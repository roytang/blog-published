<p>Thread of #mtg JumpStart results: Attempt 1: Milling Elves, 2-0.</p>
<p>Attempt 2: Heavily Armored Enchanted (terrible choices - no way to get things off the board, Thriving lands are bad when monocolored, annoyed whenever I draw Gird for Battle), 2-4</p>
<p>Attempt 3: Feathered Friends + Basri. These white decks aren&rsquo;t good for my daily quests. Even less removal. 2-5. I think that&rsquo;s enough for today.</p>
<p>Attempt 4: Plus One Dragons. 2-0. The sad thing about this format is that you tend to spend more time with the suckier decks and not enough time with the fun ones. (I know, I know, that&rsquo;s actually up to me, but I want to sample as many pairs as possible!)</p>
<p>Attempt 5: Archeology Under The Sea. Why did I go monocolor again? 2-6. Deck was fun, but way too slow (check out that &ldquo;curve&rdquo;). Aaaaand I&rsquo;m out of gold, so that&rsquo;s enough JumpStart for a while.</p>
<p>Attempt 6: Dinosaurs Reanimated. 2-1. Power level reasonably high, with removal coming mostly from the green side (surprisingly!).</p>
<p>Attempt 7: Vampires Devilish. Quick 2-1. Kinda boring, but eh. Way too many fours.</p>
<p>Attempt 8: Liliana Tree Hugging. 3-3. Played a bit extra to complete my quest.</p>
<p>Attempt 9: Milling Wizards. 2-0. My first repeat! As usual, Milling is super strong.</p>
<p>Video of attempts 8 and 9 here:</p>

<p>Attempt 10: Chandra Angels. 2-2. Losses were due to clunky hands (drawings fives and sixes while being stuck at 3-4 lands)</p>
<p>Attempt 11: Witchcraft Goblins. 2-1. The wins were due to the opponent timing out or randomly quitting early, so that sucks. Out of gold again so I&rsquo;ll just keep this one around for daily quests for a while.</p>
<p>Attempts 12-14! Rogues Cats 2-1, Seismic Predatory 2-3, Phyrexian Plus One 2-3</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Attempts 15-17! Rogues Above the Clouds 2-3, Smashing Legion 2-4 (forgot to get a deck list screenshot for this one), Dinosaur Dogs 2-0. YT of the games: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG6-lNKfyis">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG6-lNKfyis</a></p>
<p>Attempts 18-19! Seismic Doctor (DAMNIT 5th Lavamancer!) 2-2, Basri Walls 2-1. Still missing Garruk and Teferi =/</p>
<p>JumpStart Attempt 20, the final one for this set (a nice round number): Reanimated Teferi. Got one of the two missing PW packets, although this combination wasn&rsquo;t too great, only went 2-4. Still missing the Garruk one, hopefully we get it if/when JS returns in the future</p>
<p>Overall, JumpStart was a reasonably fun casual experience, and I fully expect them to bring it back every so often as I think it&rsquo;s very good for the casual new player experience, especially for anyone wanting to build casual historic brews</p>
