<div class="e-content">

<p>This last week was weird. I feel like I didn&rsquo;t really get much done in terms of productivity, yet I don&rsquo;t feel I was unproductive. A very relaxed and chill week.</p>
<p>Once again a tiny bit of work done this past week, some fixes, including to side projects. I also spent some time preparing for some events next weekend. Although I wasn&rsquo;t productive this week, I did outline a bit of a roadmap of new features for one of my side projects, hopefully I can get into that in the coming weeks!</p>
<p>We are still in a pandemic! But I did have my first dine-in meal at a restaurant last Monday. It was because I went to get blood drawn for routine medical reasons, and I had needed to skip breakfast for the test (spoiler: my blood sugar levels were very, very normal). So after getting the blood drawn I was super hungry and decided to have breakfast at the nearby Pancake House. I was the only customer since it was super early (and you know, pandemic), although a second guy came in after I had given my order. I almost subconsciously picked up the glass of water to sip from it as soon as it was served, luckily I remembered I was wearing a face mask and a face shield. I decided to hold off on removing the gear until the actual pancakes were served, to minimize the exposure time. The next day I also decided to have a snack at a Starbucks after running some errands, mainly because I had a free coffee from Globe Rewards. It was afternoon so there were a few other customers there. The cashier said it was ok to dine in, but for a maximum of one hour only.</p>
<p>There was a longish post I was writing, but it felt too raw to publish and might break it up into smaller posts.</p>
<p>We actually managed to win an online quiz night this week! It&rsquo;s been a while, good job trivia team.</p>
<p>It feels great to no longer be following the covid19 stats regularly, even though they are still fairly terrible. UP experts are projecting that we get the reproduction rate to below 1 in like a month though, so that&rsquo;s some good news, though we may still be a ways away from getting this under control.</p>
<p>Here are the things I&rsquo;ve been watching and playing the past week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Still playing a lot of SC2 Coop, trying to unlock the new prestiges. Levelling the commanders again can be a pain, but at least they managed to provide new goals/objectives for the players, breathing back a bunch of life into this game mode.</li>
<li>Still drafting Amonkhet Remastered, although the last few drafts haven&rsquo;t gone well. Need to save up gems, so I&rsquo;ll do one last one draft once I get enough gold.</li>
<li>Huh, I guess I kind of paused Uncharted 4 for most of the week, not sure why. I should get back to it.</li>
<li>I started re-playing Super Mario 3D Land (on the 3DS) lately, mostly to stave off my desire to get a Nintendo Switch (prices are still inflated here due to supply issues!). I had forgotten a lot about this game, so even when I finished the first 8 worlds and rescued Princess Peach, I was pleasantly surprised to find there were another 8 &ldquo;special&rdquo; worlds to play!</li>
<li>watched the video game history documentary <strong>High Score</strong> on Netflix. Pretty good, although there&rsquo;s some Dragon Quest erasure going on in the RPG episode!</li>
<li>watched <strong>Bill and Ted Face the Music</strong>, this was a most excellent sequel. I found the start a bit clunky (I always find it awkward watching characters be awkward), but the rest of it was a fun and sweet adventure that echoed elements of both of the first two movies. A lot of the time travel stuff didn&rsquo;t make any sense if you sat down and thought about it, but I was smiling through a lot of it. Little Billie and Theda are great!</li>
<li>also watched <strong>Superman: Man of Tomorrow</strong>, the first entry in the new DC animated universe (following the reboot at the end of Justice League Dark: Apokolips). Yet another Superman origin story here. Not too happy with this one. Not fond of the animated style, and the writing and plot seemed weird at many points. I felt like there could have been a better way to resolve the whole situation with the big bad that felt more &ldquo;Superman&rdquo;-like, and the movie doesn&rsquo;t seem to earn the monicker &ldquo;Man of Tomorrow&rdquo; for the hero.</li>
<li>for one reason or another, I also ended up watching a few standup specials on Amazon Prime. A couple from Craig Ferguson, and one from Jimmy Yang.</li>
<li>Cobra Kai is now on Netflix! Yet another thing to add to the ever-increasing backlog.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some tech stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have about three months left on my Webfaction hosting, which I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/03/rip-webfaction/">been planning to migrate away from</a>. I&rsquo;m currently leaning towards getting a cheap $5/mo VPS from Linode, although I&rsquo;m still willing to accept any recommendations. Switching to a VPS means more effort (since it won&rsquo;t be a managed service anymore), but that should provide some learning opportunities. It&rsquo;s just as well anyway, my apps have been pushing the memory limits on the current hosting, and even the cheapest Linode VPS provides more RAM.  I&rsquo;ll probably start looking into the migration in September.</li>
<li>I wrote before about <a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/gmail-migration/">migrating away from GMail</a>, and I&rsquo;ve been using Migadu.com&rsquo;s free tier for about half a year now. This past week, they wrote that they are sunsetting the free tier. Totally understandable, given the economy. They are also introducing a new Micro tier at $20 a year, with slightly better limits than the old free tier, so I may migrate to that near the end of September (when the free tier runs out). In theory, I could just try to run a mail server on whatever VPS I set up (see above bullet), but that&rsquo;s a big hassle. This cost + the $5/mo for the VPS is still less than what I was paying for at Webfaction, so I don&rsquo;t mind paying for this for a while.</li>
<li>I was notified by a local bank that their old web platform is being sunsetted and I needed to migrate to the new system, so I did that. But whenever I tried the migration steps, the process never completed, it just kept telling me it was processing. I finally had to message someone I knew on the dev team lol. Hopefully it can getr resolved next week.</li>
</ul>
