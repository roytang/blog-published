  "text": "That&#39;s probably a good idea, but not really something that&#39;s an option with\nthe company I&#39;m in. You know the deal - I&#39;d need all sorts of authorizations\nto be able to subcontract someone, it&#39;s not worth it, especially for a simple\ntask that would take me an hour or two to figure out.\n \n \nBesides, the post isn&#39;t really about how to get things done, but rather the\nvalue of technical problem-solving skill to a software developer, and my own\nusual approaches to it.\n \n \nI wrote this because I was doing performance assessments on several junior\ndevelopers and noticed that some really had no idea how to go about solving\nsuch issues.",
