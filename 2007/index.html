I&rsquo;m not sure why I keep trying to get the Ubuntu + XP dual boot thing working. I don&rsquo;t really need it, I can do most of the things I want to do in XP. And I can&rsquo;t really play games in Ubuntu (I don&rsquo;t really want to bother with all the crap Wine puts you through). Still, every so often I&rsquo;m hit with some sort of geek envy where I just want to have an Ubuntu installation handy so I can try out some cool stuff like Compiz or whatnot.

Every year I do an end-of-year cleanup of my stuff. (I try to at least) Somehow there always seem to be so many CDs/DVDs/books/comics to sort up and shelf or sleeve or whatnot. I&rsquo;m growing tired of it all.
The other day I was planning to backup everything on my computer to DVD when I realized I was just adding more to the pile. I&rsquo;m not sure if there&rsquo;s any important reason to backup all the episodes I&rsquo;ve been watching to DVD when I&rsquo;ve already watched them all.

I believe that this year, I have managed to improve my Magic-playing a bit (despite the abundance of embarassing mistakes).I also believe I&rsquo;m slightly better at Limited than I am at Constructed. TO back up these beliefs, I could point to my DCI ratings. But as a programmer who loves stats, I compiled additional stats for my own pleasure: My Playing Stats.
A bit of background: I&rsquo;ve been playing Magic on and off since Revised, but only gotten into the tournament scene seriously in 2006.

A couple of weeks ago, just before the last PTQ of the season, I was thinking of quitting Magic. Not because I&rsquo;m tired of it or anything, but because I&rsquo;ve run out of people to play with. Unlike last year where we had enough players in the office to occasionally have an 8-man draft, this year most of the Magic players have either switched to WoW or moved to a different company/country.

Dec-2, Sunday. Lorwyn Sealed. The usual location of course, NG Galleria.
I find your lack of socks&hellip; disturbing
I played a couple MTGO drafts the day before but did not do very well, I hoped my luck would be better this time. But my day did not start very well as I found that I had forgotten to bring sleeves to the event. I had to buy some rough-backed Ultra Pros.

Yeah, I post these late, I&rsquo;m a busy man. But I want to have a record so here we go. Same deck as the last time , except I removed the 2 grim harvests from the board and put in +2 sudden death (to improve the pickles matchup)
Round 1: My opponent had a BUw Mannequin deck, splashing for O-Ring and Blink. He obviously put the deck together at the last minute though.

The first step is admitting you have a problem. I&rsquo;ve thrown away games because I played spells without thinking and attacked without thinking. I go on autopilot far too often. It has got to stop.
What&rsquo;s the preventive measure? I&rsquo;ll count to 3 before making every decision.

&ldquo;Robert suggested we create Facebook accounts, I think in an effort to establish that we were &ldquo;down&rdquo; with whatever &ldquo;new jives&rdquo; the kids were flexing on the mean streets. I refused. Gabriel buckled, and the bullshit that ensued verified my initial assessment: that maintaining Facebook would quickly constitute another job. Of which I already have several.&quot;

I don&rsquo;t particularly care one way or another whether Gloria falls out of power or not. I suspect a lot of people don&rsquo;t. And a lot of people probably don&rsquo;t give a hoot about Trillianes either. I am however of the opinion that he is an idiot.
What exactly did he hope to accomplish yesterday anyway? The only difference between now and Oakwood a few years ago is that since then he&rsquo;s gotten the pity vote to actually be able to call himself a senator.

My single greatest problem with Magic Online is the fact that it&rsquo;s on a computer. Which means that unlike a real draft where I can focus 100% on the draft, in Magic Online I could possibly be doing several other things such as coding, blogging, random surfing, IM, etc. that may cause terrible misclicks such as a first-pick Faultgrinder (true story)
I should stop writing this post now and maybe try to salvage the draft.

Tournament was last Sunday, November 18. Format was Lorwyn Sealed.
I open a pretty good sealed pool this time. Notable cards include Mistbind Clique, Profane Command, Mulldrifter, Cloudgoat Ranger, Oblivion Ring, Shriekmaw and Silvergill Douser. Haven&rsquo;t written up the sealed pool yet, will probably do so later. I play major blue, minor black and white.
Round 1: 2-0 win vs BG Goblin/Elf
Round 2: 2-0 win vs UB Faeries
Round 3 vs merfolk, things start getting interesting.

Tournament was on Saturday, November 10. Format was Standard. I didn&rsquo;t have any good deck ideas this time around (some would argue I never do!), so I played a netdeck. I played the Mannequin deck that originally appeared in US States, as reported by BDM here. I had to change the board around a bit, I went with:
 4 Nameless Inversion (to help kill black/artifact critters) 3 Vesuvan Shapeshifter (get random tricks off pickles, and kill legends) 3 extirpate 3 bottle gnomes 2 damnation  I had very minimal testing, but I was fairly sure aggro decks were a cakewalk, and control decks are winnable headaches.

2 days ago: My brother Alvin and Brian report suspicious activities on the computer in their room. Random Chinese popups appearing, mysterious processes in the taskbar.

Yesterday: Alvin decides to reformat the machine and begins backing up. Brian plays WoW on the machine in my room instead.

The format is Lorwyn Sealed. Note here that I they had a shortage of boosters and had to split tournament packs into 3 boosters to be able to accomodate all the players.
Decklist/Card pool later, I&rsquo;m too lazy to type it up. Unfortunately, I failed to learn from the previous mistakes as I got blinded by the shiny again, thinking I could actually cast Horde of Notions, so I went with an almost-five color build, major red-blue-and-green.

I still have no idea what to play for Lorwyn Standard, so I was eagerly awaiting this year&rsquo;s States/Champs results. There are already partial results up at MTG.com, and I had some time so I did some of my programming hocus-pocus and extracted some fun data. States / Champs 2007 Card Counts
The data is of course extracted from top eight decklists, so what we have here are literally the best decks this past weekend.

One of the qualities that I think make a really good software developer is the ability to solve difficult technical problems. Unless you&rsquo;re the sort of software developer who just sells the same piece of software over and over again, at some point in time you&rsquo;ll to need to find out how to implement some feature you&rsquo;ve never tried before. Or you&rsquo;ll hit a problem that&rsquo;s not documented in any official docs and you need that critical functionality.

I was in Galleria earlier today and suddenly the power went out for a few seconds. It came back up almost immediately, but of course everyone was a bit spooked given the recent bombings at Glorietta 2.
Even I felt a bit shaken up I might add, even considering cutting short the tournament (I wasn&rsquo;t doing well) I hate that. Being overcome by fear, even for a very short instant. Hopefully, the authorities would be able to find whoever was responsible for the recent bombings to make the rest of us feel safer.

The game was not as long as I had hoped, although I finished without completing stuff. (Only had 11 hearts when facing the final boss). I told a friend that the current Zeldas are too easy compared to the Zeldas of old. There are a lot more hints this time around on how to get past stuff, etc. He told me that the 3d Zeldas are even easier. One of the sacrifices they had to make to become popular I suppose.

I wasn&rsquo;t too keen on playing, but that Dark Confidant kept whispering at me to give him one more chance. Rakdos again, except I removed Martyr of Ashes from the board and put in Avalanche Riders to help the terrible Angelfire matchup.

I kept Hit/Run in the main because I thought he had Solifuges, he did not.

Can holding a stylus cause carpal tunnel syndrome? Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass for a few days now; the controls are purely-stylus driven so my wrist aches a bit after a few hours of play. Of course the game has been consuming a good number of my waking hours (I didn&rsquo;t even play any Magic this weekend), but that&rsquo;s not what this post is about. This post is about the original Legend of Zelda.

Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t make it to the AM flights yesterdat, so I hung around Galleria for a few hours watching people play. A lot of people seemed to be playing blue or green stuff. There are people saying Needle Drop is good, what? Just because it cantrips?
My flight manages to start around 4 PM, and I open the sealed pool I&rsquo;m registering. The first two rares I see are Jace Beleren and Chandra Nalar!

Lorwyn prerelease in two days, and of course MTG Salvation is spoiler-complete. Some thoughts on cards:
Thoughtseize
&ndash;
B
Sorcery (Rare)
Target player reveals his or her hand. Choose a nonland card from it. That player discards that card. You lose 2 life.
My take:
Undercosted cards that demand a 2 life payment are usually pretty good. (See: Shocklands, Char, Psionic Blast, Vampiric Tutor). Thoughtseize is widely anticipated to be the chase rare of the set, with starcitygames.

My reading lately has comprised of Orson Scott Card&rsquo;s excellent Ender&rsquo;s Game series. I got a copy of six of the books from an officemate a couple of months back, and I&rsquo;ve just finished the seventh book today. I don&rsquo;t usually go through books that quickly, so it&rsquo;s a sign that I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed this series. (If I don&rsquo;t enjoy a series, I typically lose interest before even finishing the book &ndash; I have a copy of Sword of Shannara around here to prove that.

I played at an FNM for the first time last Friday, in a cramped room at the back of the Neutral Grounds in Galleria. It was definitely&hellip; different than the usual weekend tournaments. I mean people playing Rhox different. Asking whether equip costs needed to be paid every turn different. Not that I&rsquo;m picking on noobs or anything; it was all fun and refreshing. Everything was a lot more casual than the highly competitive PTQs or GPTs.

Obviously, I&rsquo;ve started playing a lot of Magic since last year. I&rsquo;ve been a long-time player, having started around the time of Revised more than twelve years ago, but I&rsquo;ve never seriously started playing in tournaments in such until I had a job, which meant more money to spend on Magic (also meant less free time though =/)
As anyone who has immersed himself in this game knows, Magic is an addictive experience.

It&rsquo;s my first time playing at BCI Greenhills. During deck registration, I open a Damnation and a Graven Cairns. If I got up then, I&rsquo;d have gotten my money&rsquo;s worth. But I didn&rsquo;t come here to buy a Damnation, I came here to play.
My sealed deck:
  Lands   8 Mountains   7 Forest   1 Swamp   1 Terramorphic Expanse   1 Kher Keep    Creatures   1 Gemhide Sliver   1 Thornweald Archer   1 Thallid Germinator   1 Citanul Woodreaders   1 Giant Dustwasp   1 Durkwood Baloth   1 Basalt Gargoyle   1 Coal Stoker   1 Two-headed Sliver   1 Bonesplitter Sliver   1 Sedge Sliver   1 Gathan Raiders   1 Scourge of Kher Ridges    Spells   1 Tromp the Domains   1 Dead/Gone   1 Rift Bolt   1 Orcish Cannonade   1 Shivan Meteor   1 Death Rattle   1 Strangling Soot   1 Prismatic Lens       I&rsquo;m pretty sure I misbuilt this, you can see the complete pool here.

When you get off at the SM North station, there are always a million people lining up at the entry turnstiles (where you insert your ticket before exiting the station). The outermost lines are always the slowest ones, because effectively three to four lines of people are trying to use that line. To save time, instead use one of the innermost lines.

This weekend was the first of three &ldquo;Pre-Lorwyn Triple Treats&rdquo; at Neutral Ground, featuring Saturdays with three tournaments: one each of Standard, Block Constructed and Legacy. I tried preparing a deck for block but I couldn&rsquo;t come up with anything consistent enough. Lazily, I just picked up the Standard Rakdos deck the day before the tourney, tweaked the sideboard for the inevitable TarmoRack decks (-4 Bottle Gnomes +4 Dodecapod). I lacked a 15th sideboard card, so I toss in a random Seize the Soul.

Yeah, I actually did play at the Standard Open at Trinoma Mall a couple of weekends ago, but my performance was so piss-poor I didn&rsquo;t bother writing a report. Long and short of it, I played Rakdos, but didn&rsquo;t have time to look for Rain of Gores for the board. They would have really helped against the two Angelfire losses I got in rounds 3 and 5, including the one where the opponent drew all four Lightning Helixes :/ The decks record against Angelfire decks is something 1-3 I believe.

When at home or at the office, if I ever get a craving for something to snack on I can usually find some easily. At home I just go down to the kitchen and check the ref or the cupboards. At the office, there&rsquo;s always the pantry or those people you know that usually store some snacks. If I need something, I can get it fairly easily. This is something of an abundance situation.

I couldn&rsquo;t sleep, so obviously, I had to start a new personal project.
PyMTG
I was inspired after forum-browsing lead me to look at existing MTG open-source software. I&rsquo;ve been thinking of starting a true-blue personal software project for a while now, and the idea of PyMTG appeals to me for several reasons:
(a) It&rsquo;s related to one of my current hobbies
(b) Allows me to become familiar with a new language (Python)

Check. Yeap, I turned 29 a couple of days ago.
There&rsquo;s a typhoon signal no. 8 over HK right now as I type this. For people in the Philippines, that&rsquo;s hard to imagine since our local indicators only go up to storm signal no. 4. But it&rsquo;s really a bit calm where I am right now, some wind but not much rain. I&rsquo;m not inclined to go out though, I&rsquo;m running out of clothes as it is.

The official title is quite long. Actually, the English Title for Gyakuten Saiban 3 is even worse!
Ace Attorney is an awesome series, I finally got around to playing the second game since the third one is scheduled for an English NDS release in September. I started playing the day I arrived in HK &ndash; so I beat the game in six days.
Justice for All is a more difficult game than the original, putting the title character in more difficult situations, and making it a lot more tedious to ‘cheat&rsquo; with the save file.

It&rsquo;s a bit strange, but somehow Hong Kong is becoming a bit familiar to me by now. This is only my third time here of course, and I&rsquo;ve spent less than five weeks here in total since 2004. Still I find that certain things like ordering at restaurants and riding the MTR have started to become a bit more &ldquo;normal&rdquo; for me.
Originally when I was told that I would be staying in HK for two weeks, I was a bit depressed, as I didn&rsquo;t really enjoy the prolonged stay last time.

Most of the time, my work involves mostly run-of-the-mill information management systems. Lately however, I&rsquo;ve been asked to look into some new tech, and that got me interested in what&rsquo;s called Rich Internet Applications (RIAs for short). The primary platform for RIAs is Flash, which apparently is already owned by Adobe and Macromedia is no more. Yeah, I never really paid attention to Flash, like most people I assumed it was only for making amusing movies and annoying ads.

A friend of mine, let&rsquo;s call her &ldquo;C&rdquo;, was waiting for a taxi near her home. There were several other people there waiting for taxis but she had been there first. She finally managed to hail a cab and had already gotten in the back seat when an MMDA traffic guy [1] stopped her and told her that he had hailed that taxi for two women nearby that he pointed to.

Just to make it, y&rsquo;know, official: I suck at Standard.
I played in two Nationals qualifiers over the past two weekends. The first one with the Mishra deck (Flores&rsquo; Legends of Team CMU) to a disappointing 4-3 finish in a sea of Angelfire, Solar Flare and Gruul. Disappointed with the decks performance, I took a look at the result of Australian Nationals that same weekend, and decided to play the Rakdos &ldquo;Satanic Sligh&rdquo; build that had won that event in today&rsquo;s qualifier, which was incidentally the last one I could play given my schedule.

Today is of course the release of Magic&rsquo;s Xth edition, Magic Game Day.
As usual, I played at Neutral Grounds in Galleria. Helluva lot of people there, more than I was expecting for a Core Set Release tournament.
The format is, as usual, Sealed Deck with four rounds of Swiss pairings. Players were grouped in Flights of 32 people each (previous prerelease tournaments had 48-people flights), each win gets you an Xth booster pack and the top 2 of each flight (the ones who went 4-0) get something extra.

Some days just don&rsquo;t go very well. You wake up with a mild headache. Your bed demands that you stay just a few minutes longer. Your computer refuses to work correctly. You have no energy. Every task assigned to you seems to be something you&rsquo;d rather not do. You find out some people hate you. You get drenched in rain on the way home. You arrive home and feel completely useless, thinking you&rsquo;ve done nothing today.

As a big Transformers fan back in the day, I have to say: the movie is okay. Action-packed and a fun popcorn flick. The story&rsquo;s nothing to win an oscar over, but everything looks SO COOL!
Some questionable things though:
(Spoilers)  Why does the all-spark only create violent, gun-toting robots? Where the hell did the Autobots come from? I don&rsquo;t recall seeing the Decepticon symbol anywhere, was it there? How come Soundwave can survive getting his head chopped off, but Jazz can&rsquo;t take being split in half?

Before actually going to the elections last Monday, I played some Limited-format Magic last Sunday at Galleria.
The format was Time Spiral Block Sealed, and I was feeling good. I opened a card pool with no outstanding rares. The only real bomb was the red uncommon Pyrohemia. Spotting the Deep-Sea Kraken and wanting to play it, I decided to go red-blue. I tested the build for a few minutes before realizing it completely stunk and had very few creatures.

Ban the distribution of sample ballots and election paraphernalia on election day within the vicinity of voting precincts. Seriously, check out the amount of trash generated on election day near the precinct:  
And I noted that the current level of trash is already an improvement from last year!
In Quezon City at least, the local government seems to have been able to keep people from plastering campaign posters all over the place (relatively), so banning campaign materials on election day should not be too much of a stretch.

I still don&rsquo;t know how I am voting on Monday.
Or even if I am voting at all.
I&rsquo;m thinking of voting for those 3 guys from Kapatiran, simply to reward the sheer chutzpah of their candidacies.
The GO and TU coalitions seem largely irrelevant to me, you can be fairly sure those coalitions won&rsquo;t mean squat after the elections, so all these surveys keeping score of administration vs opposition seem a bit useless.

I bought a new phone yesterday.
At the recommendation of my brother, I got one from the Nokia N-series, the Nokia N73. As a relatively recent smartphone release, it cost quite a chunk of cash. I was having second thoughts for a while, because I&rsquo;m almost never comfortable parting with a significant amount of cash. If I&rsquo;m going to spend more than a week&rsquo;s salary on something, it better provide me with a decent amount of entertainment

Pretty good movie, as expected. The story is what you&rsquo;d expect from a comic-book movie, but the mid-air fight scenes are really great.
The whole Sandman thing is basically fluff, the movie could have been done without him. He was like a cheap pop to make the whole &ldquo;dark side&rdquo; thing easier to start off, but then they had trouble resolving his story. It&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s a major Spidey villain anyway.

<div class="content p-summary">
So, I was there in the taxi with my youngest brother Brian. And I brought up the topic of the noontime TV show Wowowee, which we had just seen about half an hour of before we got in the taxi.
I told him that I thought of it as a really terrible show. Sure, poor people win relatively-large cash prizes and stuff from it, but it feels so exploitative. Hundreds, maybe thousands of poor folk from god-knows-how-far-away queue up outside the studios every day hoping to get into the studio audience to participate in the cash giveaways.

No matter how much of an optimist I am, I have to admit all people will have down cycles. The last few days seem to be one of mine.
Health-wise: My stomach has been in a rebellious mood for the past three or four days, I actually went to work with a fever last Friday. Also, it seems my blood pressure was a bit high since yesterday. I&rsquo;m thinking about going in for a checkup within the next week or so, depending on how my condition changes.

A bit lazy today, just a quick summary.
As usual for a prerelease, lots of people at NG yesterday. I got there before Galleria opened and whiled away time on the DS. The NG staff was a lot more efficient today, they were able to start the first 3 flights as early as 10:30. I got on flight C, and proceeded to open one of the most mediocre card pools I&rsquo;ve ever seen.

I scrubbed out of the last 3 TSP-TSP-PLC drafts, how annoying. :/
I tend to make bad plays at the worst possible time, and also don&rsquo;t mulligan very well.
If I&rsquo;m not good at it, I suppose I should stop. Maybe I&rsquo;ll get better once Future Sight comes out.

<div class="content p-summary">
At work, especially during assessment time, they often ask me if I have any concerns or needs or suggestions that I want to raise to management. And I never have any answers.
So I thought about it today, and I realized why I seldom have complaints: I&rsquo;m a simple person. It doesn&rsquo;t take much to make me happy, and I figure I&rsquo;m already ahead of the curve anyway. I have a fairly good paycheck, I like my job (more or less), I like the people I work with, and they recognize and respect me for my contributions.

Due to pressing work concerns, I was unable to go to confession for Holy Week this year. So much for being a devout Catholic.
As is tradition, most of the long weekend was spent watching a whole lot of stuff:
24
 I&rsquo;ve been keeping pace with the episodes so far. The thing about 24: people die. A lot of them. And amazingly, Jack Bauer gets off every single time. They should have a season where Jack Bauer dies around episode ten or something (or at least gets hospitalized and taken out of the game) That would shock people.

I obviously don&rsquo;t have much time for gaming if it takes me more than a month to finish a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; choose-your-own-adventure style game like Phoenix Wright. Very entertaining game, it puts you in the shoes of a novice defense attorney, Phoenix Wright and your adventures in trying to uncover the truth behind several murder cases. The gameplay is composed of two parts: investigative sequences where you go around various locations gathering information and evidence, and the actual trial part where you have to spot contradictions in witness testimonies and prove your clients to be innocent.

if you&rsquo;ve ever lived in the Philippines during the summer months, you&rsquo;re well aware of the sweltering heat. Not being in the mood to feel like french toast during this Sunday noontime, my brothers and I decided to troop to the nearby mall and catch a movie &ndash; in this case the return of those childhood stalwarts the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to the big screen.

So yeah, it was a Two-Headed Giant Limited PTQ at NG Galleria yesterday. I played with my friend Paul, and we had a rather good sealed pool, coming up with a pair of decks that had the basic strategy of &ldquo;Do not block!&rdquo;
Unfortunately, we were only able to go 5-2, ending up as the team in 10th place. Well, it&rsquo;s not like we would&rsquo;ve been able to go to San Diego, but still the 750USD would have been nice.

Everyone who&rsquo;s seen the movie has the same thing to say: it&rsquo;s really good. So I went to see it with a brother of mine. And it was good.

My computer died last night, refusing to boot. Ubuntu would complain of being unable to read the root filesystem. Windows XP would say that there&rsquo;s a corrupted DLL. I immediately arranged to borrow both an Ubuntu LiveCD and a Windows XP install disk the next day to help check the problem.
When I got home today, the computer had been miraculously fixed. My brother said he&rsquo;d been using it no problem.

I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people have experienced it, the feeling of being adrift, directionless. Just living your life day in and day out not knowing where you&rsquo;re going or why. Maybe not everybody though, as I&rsquo;ve met quite a few people who seem quite content with the monotony of their lives, doing the same thing day in and day out, never bothering to overcome the inertia of their daily lives.

If you&rsquo;re not familiar with the series, One Piece is an anime about pirates, the same way Naruto is about ninjas. Like Naruto, they don&rsquo;t live in a world very different from our own. The One Piece universe is a lot more insane than Naruto&rsquo;s though.

I&rsquo;ve been asked if I would be willing to be temporarily posted in another country, halfway across the world, for around half a year.
On the surface, it seems like a good idea &ndash; I don&rsquo;t have any definite plans for the next few months, so there&rsquo;s nothing in the way. It would be new stuff, new places, people, experiences, etc., a most welcome change of pace.
But the first emotion that grips me is fear.

Post Part I:
This being my first week back to work after a month-long hiatus, I inevitably get the usual sort of questions people ask when you get back from a vacation:
&ldquo;Hey, where did you go?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do you have any pasalubong?&rdquo; (souvenirs)
&ldquo;So, what did you do for one month?&rdquo;
I&rsquo;m amused by how very few people seem to get the fact that I didn&rsquo;t do &ldquo;anything&rdquo; in particular over the break.

Played yesterday at Galleria. With a whole bunch of people: three from the Zu crowd and I think five or six from the office. Insane number of people, as expected. I got there about ten minutes after the mall opened (I came from work), and I was already preregistered, but I only got to sign up for the sixth flight (Flight F). They had to buy extra tables from a nearby Office Warehouse.

I&rsquo;m going to try out a new feed aggregator for a while &ndash; NewsHutch. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Bloglines is nice and all, but one gets tired of the UI after a while. NewsHutch looks&hellip; nice.
And don&rsquo;t get me started on Google Reader&hellip; that one is slow as molasses. (I added it to my Google Customized Homepage though, maybe that makes it better)

Since I&rsquo;m going back to work starting on Saturday, I thought I&rsquo;d try to look for ways to improve my productivity at work.
I&rsquo;ve downloaded a few utilities that I can try at work to see if it can improve my workflow.
The first one is SlickRun. Basically it&rsquo;s a Start -&gt; Run replacement &ndash; press a predefined hotkey and a small command line tool appears where I can type shortcut-like commands.

The original is here. Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t like the header image so I removed it.
I&rsquo;m tired of moving themes around, so I&rsquo;ll settle on this for a while. Simple and clean. I&rsquo;ll just fuss around with the plugins later.
And yeah, I&rsquo;m also changing the categories around. There should be a plugin to search posts and assign multiple posts to new categories at the same time.
My vacation time is almost up&hellip; I still have too many things to watch&hellip;

<div class="content p-summary">
I played the same deck again this past weekend, but I forgot to name it &ldquo;Nameless Deck Wins&rdquo; this time, so I posted a much worse record. =(
I went 2-3-drop, with the losses all going to aggro decks (2 Boros, 1 KarstenBot). The Boros matchup is winnable, but really tight, with no room for error.
Anyway, with Planar Chaos coming out, my colors (Red/Green/Black) look like they&rsquo;re getting a good boost, so hopefully I can further improve this deck.

I&rsquo;m testing the Extreme Video Plugin for WordPress, and I thought, what better way to do so than to further propagate the extreme music videos of Ok Go.

I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write more about my time in Hong Kong.
One of the many new things I experienced there was the food. People who&rsquo;ve eaten out with me on a regular basis know that I&rsquo;m quite the picky eater. In general, I dislike eating veggies and seafood (yeah, I&rsquo;m an unhealthy carnivore). In Hong Kong, you cannot avoid vegetables and seafood; every meal comes with some form of green stuff or shrimp or whatnot.

Wow. It took me three months to finish FF12!
Fun game, weak story.
No strong lead character to carry the game.
Gameplay is very MMORPG-like. The grinding was ok, but they could&rsquo;ve done some quests like WoW to make it better.
I&rsquo;ll fight the optional bosses someday.
Will I play the next FF game? Don&rsquo;t know. Time is the most difficult factor, as it demands a lot. Took me about 65 hours to finish this one, playing 3-4 hours a day after I came back from Hong Kong.

Yeah, I still have quite a bit of vacation to go. Might as well spruce up this website a bit. Move things around here and there, you know the drill.
A work in progress of course, as always. I hope I don&rsquo;t screw things up too badly. Better backup WordPress&hellip;

I upgraded my Kubuntu Linux installation to Edgy Eft during the Christmas break. Some notes:
  Why can&rsquo;t there be a one-click install? You know, some pop-up alert bubble in the corner saying &ldquo;A new version of Kubuntu is available.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t see why the user needs to edit the sources.list file, do the apt-get stuff, etc., when all of this can basically be automated away.
  Except for one thing, I can do everything I need to do using Kubuntu instead of using Windows.

This year, I resolve to find more direction.
That being said, I&rsquo;m kind of behind already. I usually manage a total cleanup of all the stuff in my room before the New Year. This year? Not even close.
At least I have an additional 3 weeks of vacation to finish everything.
Review of last year&rsquo;s resolution:
&ldquo;I will try more new things this year&rdquo; : I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s a resounding success.
