  "text": "You caught me. I&#39;m not actually the free-wheeling happy-go-lucky schmuck I\npretend to be. I tend to overthink a lot of things, which means sometimes I&#39;m\noverly critical.\n \n \nThat being said, I only watched said shows because I was stuck in a room with\npeople who were watching it. I&#39;d never actually watch it on purpose, sexy\ngirls or no.\n \n \nSomething else that annoyed me: Some of the multiple-choice questions on\nWowowee used to filter out contestants are actually kinda hard trivia\nquestions, the sort where you have to be a bit familiar with the particular\ndomain of the question to answer. It may seem like elitist thinking, but they\nweren&#39;t the type of questions you would expect the people who join these\ncontests to be able to answer. It gives the show some pretense of being\n&quot;intellectual&quot; or maybe even &quot;educational&quot;, when the contestants are obviously\njust randomly choosing which answer to pick.",
