  "text": "You&#39;re probably too much of a packrat. And you don&#39;t need to compare yourself\nto people you know. What&#39;s important is if you need those videos, and from\nwhat you said I&#39;m guessing you don&#39;t. Don&#39;t backup those videos unless they&#39;re\nvery rare or your favorite of all time.\n \n \nThere are a couple people I know who back everything up, and sometimes I\nborrow from them. A lot of other people borrow from them too. I think we only\nneed a few them. If you&#39;re not the go-to-guy for these things, don&#39;t backup.\n \n \nYou might even find it refreshing if you throw all those CD&#39;s away. Sometimes\nit&#39;s good not to have these attachments.",
