(The mem test that came with Ubuntu\nreally helped)\n \n \nI removed one of the 256MB pieces and Ubuntu works fine now (although I now\nhave only 256MB of memory left). Windows XP cannot boot at all, I guess one of\nthe files really did become corrupted. So I&#39;m now a 100% linux user (at least\nfor the PC in my room)",
