  "text": "As a developer who regularly talks with users, I believe it is our\nresponsibility to help users express what they want. This is not just about\nwriting specs and having them sign it.\n \n \nIt is also an issue of expections. Developers sometimes (or oftentimes?)\nassume that users know the capabilities and limitations of a program and that\nthese things should not be discussed with the users.\n \n \nWe also need to be creative in helping users understand what we are trying to\nbuild. Instead of writing a spec, use screen prototypes. Instead of using\nPowerPoint to describe what the application can do, conduct a demo. Let the\nusers play with the program and observe them.",
