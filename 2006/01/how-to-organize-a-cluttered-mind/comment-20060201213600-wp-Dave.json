  "text": "Ei Roy,\n \n \nWhile it&#39;s kewl that you can handle the stress of fielding all those &quot;help me&quot;\ncalls, that&#39;s not a healthy company practice...\n \n \nWell, it&#39;s certainly got good and bad going for it. It&#39;s good because everyone\nrealizes how utterly indispensable you are, so you&#39;ll never be fired. Other\nstuff too.\n \n \nI think tho&#39; that there&#39;s more bad than good in it... There&#39;s the stress,\nwhich is one thing. And there&#39;s also the probability that this role you have\nassumed will make the bosses pass you over for promotions because you&#39;ll be\nconsidered too valuable where you are for doing stuff that&#39;s not formally\nyours to do (unless it&#39;s really part of your job description to be techno fire\nfighter).\n \n \nAnyway, nothing, just wasting time after being flabbergasted by C. Bolastig&#39;s\nforward to the list.\n \n \nSomething you might want to do eventually is to formalize the firefighting\nthing by having people do it through a standard procedure instead of actively\npinging your person with stuff. Like, maybe if someone has a problem they\ncan&#39;t work through on their own, they should have to fill out a template\ne-mail form about it to send to you so you can quickly go over it or\nsomething. I&#39;m sure *somebody* in some Japanese company has a well structured\nprocess for doing this kind of technical advising instead of you having to go\nthrough many that you have to gut it out =P\n \n \nI mean, you can manage the load now, but if your company ever expands...",
