  "text": "Better late than never?\n \n \nYou bumped into IE&#39;s &quot;Same Origin Policy&quot; security protocol.\n \n \nIf you use .hta (Microsoft&#39;s HTML Application extension) you can bypass it.\n \n \nYou&#39;ll need to crawl the microsoft dev center a bit to find out how to\nproperly initialize an .hta in a chromeless IE browser window.. but it&#39;s worth\nthe effort for future reference.\n \n \nOtherwise you can use firefox tamper data plugin or a greasemonkey hack to\nbypass firefox&#39;s SOP, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for.\n \n \nAs a side note you can use prototype event handlers to stop the framebuster\n&quot;beforeunload&quot; but gmail still won&#39;t load in a frame for some reason or\nanother (both the original and the new interface update exhibit this\nbehaviour, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s intentional or just lucky).\n \n \nAnyways.. they use javascript browser detection and it&#39;s not really obfuscated\nin the newest version, just stop the page load on the &quot;Loading...&quot; screen and\nview source.\n \n \nPersonally I&#39;d use PHP to snoop the browser type in the header\n$_SERVER[&quot;HTTP_USER_AGENT&quot;] and then use an if statement to server the correct\nHTML.\n \n \nAlternatively you could check if the user agent will accept xml applications\nsince mozilla and opera will but IE still doesn&#39;t load them as true\napplications:\n \n \nif ( stristr($_SERVER[&quot;HTTP_ACCEPT&quot;],&quot;application/xhtml+xml&quot;)\n \n \nBETTER still.. (K.I.S.S.) theme an input button using CSS and IE ONLY switches\nand skip all the guess work and iffy browser detection routines.\n \n \nSeeing as it&#39;s been well over a year since you posted this I hope you got it\nsorted ..)",
