  "text": "Ei Roy,\n \n \nThis actually made me think of one of those Discovery programs I saw a while\nback, about how the Battle Of Agincourt during the Hundred Years war may\nactually have been the French being defeated by themselves and the terrain\nrather than any special prowess of the English (although it probably helped to\nhave arrows raining down on them, even if the arrows couldn&#39;t penetrate their\narmor).\n \n \nhttp://www.crowddynamics.com/Battlefield%20Detectives/Agincourt.htm\n \n \nOnce a crowd gets to a certain size, nothing is as dangerous as their\ninteraction with barriers around them. Once people start crowding in front and\nthe ones in the back don&#39;t realize the ones in front are impeded, the pushing\nof the ones in the back easily propagates and gets amplified by layers of\nother people pushing until the front ranks are crushed.",
