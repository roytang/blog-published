Walkaway is a novel by blogger Cory Doctorow. It tells the story of a near-future world and a trend of people going &ldquo;walkaway&rdquo;. This term means walking away from what they call &ldquo;default society&rdquo;, characterized by late stage capitalism, massive inequality, ever-present surveillance, and a world controlled by what they call the zottarich, or simply zottas. Not too far from our own present reality of course. Later, the novel also delves into the near-future (?

Over the past couple of years, I&rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I&rsquo;d do reviews of them.
The first one is Sentinels of the Multiverse. We&rsquo;ve played the IRL boardgame of it before during one of our sporadic in-person meetups. If you&rsquo;re not familiar, it&rsquo;s a comics-themed coop game where up to 4 people play as a group of heroes to beat a villain (basically comic book shenanigans).

The world:  Trump has been acquitted in his second impeachment trial, proving yet again to the world that the US is a flawed democracy dominated by corruption at the highest levels Duterte says he cannot be brave in the mouth against China. Back before the 2016 elections, somebody I used to know claimed that we needed a &ldquo;rottweiler&rdquo; like Duterte as president because he would be tough against China. I remember this sometimes and laugh and then am also sad.

Lauren R. O&rsquo;Connor talks about a childhood lesson about pleasure:
 When I was eight years old, I saw the movie Back to the Future for the first time, and I fell in love. All I wanted to think and talk about was Back to the Future. I dreamt about Back to the Future at night. I rode my bike down the steepest hill in my neighborhood and pretended I was flying, approaching 88 mph, about to zap myself back in time.

Will Schreiber argues that decentralization is a narrative mirage:
 Human history is a story of increasing centralization. From roaming the plains of Africa, to settling down and building homes, to buying food in central markets, to instituting courts of law. Progression is compression. How can I make it so everybody isn’t making their own shirts? Deciding their own justice? Tabulating their own spreadsheets?
 I&rsquo;ve argued a few times on here in favor of decentralization (see 1, 2, 3), and the whole concept of movements like Indieweb is a preference for a decentralized internet where everyone has his or her own personal site, instead of reliance on centralized large silos like Facebook or Twitter or whatever.

A post from Austin Kleon reminded me of the proposed conceptual international fixed calendar:
  (Click to view full-size)    
11 Feb 2021 1:53amClose   Basically: each year would be 13 months of 28 days each, plus a bonus day at the end of each year, for a total of 365 days. This way, the first day of each month would always be a Sunday, the 2nd would always be a Monday, the 3rd a Tuesday, and so on.

A while back I wrote about how I wasn&rsquo;t a big fan of the recent trend of newsletters. Since then, I&rsquo;ve realized Substack actually publishes RSS feeds for their newsletters, so I&rsquo;ve been following a a bit more of them. I thought I&rsquo;d recommend a few that I&rsquo;ve found to be quite interesting/useful:
 Money Stuff by Matt Levine. The only non-substack entry on today&rsquo;s list, this Bloomberg column covers financial matters like stock market and investment stuff.

 The above was written mostly as a response to finding so many of my friends&rsquo; old and inactive blogs in my RSS reader.
I like the term I coined there, &ldquo;sincere blogging&rdquo;.

<div class="content p-summary">
&ldquo;The Year Without Pants&rdquo; is a book by writer Scott Berkun about his time as a team lead at Wordpress.com back in 2010-2012. This book came out in 2013, and the conceit of the book back then was that Wordpress.com, run by Automattic, was a fully remote company, something that was still a rarity at that time.
It&rsquo;s weird reading this book in the context of the current pandemic, where remote work is now the norm among tech companies.

1 For a while now, I&rsquo;d been meaning to go through the links section of this site and clean up/organize all the bookmarks I&rsquo;ve logged there over the years (first via delicious and later via pocket). One of the first things I had to do was to go through and identify any broken links. So I wrote a quick Python script to ping the URLs and it turns out there were a lot of them, unsurprising given the archives go back to 2004.

It&rsquo;s February! We are nearing the one year anniversary of being in the longest covid19 lockdown in the world!
The world:  Myanmar&rsquo;s military staged a coup, and have apparently cut off the country from the internet, maybe? Last night during an international voice chat, the two of us who were in the Philippines were suddenly dropped/disconnected and one of my first thoughts were &ldquo;Wait, is there a coup happening in our country RIGHT NOW?

It&rsquo;s February tomorrow! Somehow, the world still turns.
The world:  Somehow the most viral world news this week doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been about any kind of politics, but rather about capitalism. The Gamestop/stock market brouhaha was a sage of retail investors on reddit going head-to-head with hedge funds over the stock price of a dying gaming company (among others) that dominated most of my feeds for the week. It&rsquo;s actually a lot more compliced than that.

Wow, January is almost done. Wouldn&rsquo;t you know it.
The world:  Biden inaugurated as US president, world celebrates US getting rid of Trump. Biden isn&rsquo;t exactly unproblematic, but he is at least sane and boring. There will be time enough to criticize him later, for now let them be enjoy victory. My expectations of him are at least moderately higher than the ones I had for Trump the internet gets inundated with an inordinate amount of Bernie Sanders memes locally: the govt continues to bombard us with controversies, this time stirring up a red-tagging hornests nest by abrogating the DND-UP accord, paving the way for militarization of campuses and stifling of free expression  Links of interest:  Someone made a Mandalorian trailer in the style of old-school spaghetti westerns.

Discussions on tech censorship came to the forefront in recent weeks due to the aftermath of the Jan 6 capitol insurrection in the US. I&rsquo;ve been writing down a bunch of thoughts about the complicated issue, let&rsquo;s see if I can hammer them into a blog post. (I also wanted to defer posting about it until after the Biden inauguration, in case more things of interest happen.) Here&rsquo;s where I am now:

<div class="content p-summary">
I finished the book The End of Everything (Astronomically Speaking) by Katie Mack. I got a Kindle copy on sale on Amazon at the top of the year, figured it was a good way to kick off a year of hopefully reading more books. This is a short review.
I figure it&rsquo;s probably not a spoiler to tell you the book is all about how the universe ends. Or at least, the many possible ways it could end.

This is 2021 week 3. Or week 2. Two and a half? How do calendars work?
The world:  relatively calm compared to the chaos of the previous week. However in the US, a storm may be brewing over Biden&rsquo;s inauguration next week locally: still a lot of confusion/inconsistencies around the vaccination plan. Or at least some senators think so. Meanwhile, we are close to breaching 500k cases.  Links of interest:  I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about personal note taking recently, in a bid to find ways to improve my own systems.

The world:  the week started off with something as innocuous as a guy going viral for making his daughter work six hours to figure out how to use a can opener and open a can of beans. I can&rsquo;t explain Bean Dad, but it was so weird and surreal the way it took over the internet for a while.

I used to collect quotes a lot. Maybe I still do. Here are a couple of collections I&rsquo;ve posted online.
Tang In Cheek - a list of quotes (allegedly by me)
Email signatures - a list of quotes I used as a pool to randomly select an email signature from. I rarely send email these days, and when I do it&rsquo;s usually web-based, so I can&rsquo;t use these anymore.
There&rsquo;s probably a better way to organize these.

One habit I now have that I wish I had started much, much earlier in life would be conducting regular, periodic reviews.
These reviews are a sort of written introspection of the time period in question, the target audience being future me.
I&rsquo;m reminded of the important of this because I had been going through old files the last few months and I really enjoy reading through some older entries and basically traipsing through younger me&rsquo;s mind.

A while back I saw this tweet talking about drawing memes from before the internet, and I was reminded that was a thing we had around here too when we were kids!
We had our own version of that &ldquo;giraffe in the window&rdquo; drawing, except the one I remember was made so that you could switch the answer to &ldquo;cat hugging a pole outside the window&rdquo; to troll whoever you were asking to guess:

I&rsquo;ve been using the Flipboard iOS app as my daily morning news reader pretty much since I first got an iPad. It offered a nice, magazine like UI where you can flip through pages full of images and short article blurbs until you can find something you want to read.
The past couple of years and iOS versions though, the app has been performing terribly. Crashes a lot, reader view often fails to load, or flickers and reloads continuously and so on.

It&rsquo;s a brand new year, a brand new week, a brand new day. There&rsquo;s no real reason to believe 2021 will be a better year, but we can choose to try to be better, and maybe that in itself is better.
Last week&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s Eve transition played out pretty much as expected. We just stayed at home, actually had an early media noche dinner (around 9ish) and observed the fireworks for a little bit.

It&rsquo;s always weird for me when people do their &ldquo;year in review&rdquo; or &ldquo;X of the year&rdquo; any time before Jan 1st of the next year. You&rsquo;re making Dec 31 feel left out. It&rsquo;s one thing the Oscars get right. Anyway, here&rsquo;s my personal year-in-review, such as it is.
Essay-writing section It&rsquo;s probably impossible to talk about 2020 without talking about the Covid19 pandemic that has ravaged the world. My country is sadly still under a state of quarantine/lockdown, I believe the world&rsquo;s longest.

Happy New Year! Something I&rsquo;ve gotten used to as the New Year rolls in: make a checklist of things to do for the new year. I generally copy stuff over, but the list changes a bit every year.
In no particular order:
 Ponder why people give so much significance to the transition between an arbitrarily-chosen pair of 24 hour periods Take stock and reflect on the past year Count your blessings for the past year and be grateful Greet your loved ones and friends and anyone else you hold dear.

I started doing these weeknotes at the top of 2020, so this one signals one complete year of doing my weekly reviews/notes in public. I thought it appropriate for a review!
Did it turn out to be a good practice? I think for me yes! Not necessarily for anyone following the blog (all 3 of you), since a lot of the weeknotes stuff might seem boring or irrelevant to you. But for me, forcing me to publicly write some thoughts about the past week has been good for my own self-awareness and keeping me writing regularly.

This was the year when a lot of Christmas traditions were broken, due to the pandemic. There are cultural/country-specific Christmas traditions of course, but usually each person or family also has their own personal traditions that they do every Christmas. Here are some of mine:
 Christmas Eve dinner, or as it&rsquo;s popularly known here in the Philippines, noche buena.  Growing up, our immediate family/household unit usually celebrates Christmas Eve with a late noche buena, an extra meal that happened after dinner and starting at around midnight.

It&rsquo;s the penultimate week of the year, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not the only who&rsquo;s had enough of this accursed year and looking forward to moving on to the next one. I know that&rsquo;s silly since the world won&rsquo;t magically become better when the calendar flips over to January the first, but I think it helps our mental health to have this sort of &ldquo;fresh start&rdquo; mentality, even if it&rsquo;s on an arbitrarily chosen date.

I&rsquo;ve talked a bit about mentoring in software development before, and how early on I used to get feedback about me being &ldquo;intimidating&rdquo;. I never got any concrete feedback regarding that, so I don&rsquo;t know what problems I had specifically. Though I was recently reminded of one particular incident that was a bit cringey for me personally.
This was a bit more than 10 years ago I think. I was usually assigned to mentor new hires, which means fresh graduates who usually needed guidance with a Java (which was our primary programming language at that time) and with our in-house web framework, which could be a bit challenging to work with.

Time passes yet again. I think I have to get used to not having much personal stuff to report in the weeknotes on certain weeks (aside from the watching/gaming parts), especially given the pandemic where I&rsquo;m at home 90% of the time.
Speaking of the pandemic, the UK started vaccinations last week, and the US FDA approved the Pfizer vaccine as well, so hopefully this is where things start to turn around.

This week felt like another set of those moments-in-between, where not much seemed to happen, but it somehow still went by quickly anyway.
I think the household and the family has slowly gotten used to the idea that any big Christmas celebration isn&rsquo;t happening. My niece&rsquo;s birthday was last weekend, so we sent her gifts via Grab delivery instead of being able to get together. Most likely something similar&rsquo;s going to happen for gift exchanges on Christmas.

<div class="content p-summary">
While digging through some old stuff recently I found a copy of the late 80s/early 90s US sitcom Perfect Strangers and decided to binge through all 8 seasons of it (really more like 6 and a half, since seasons 1 and 8 were an abridged 6 episodes each).
I grew up watching this series, on live tv even, before we had cable or Netflix or anything like that. During the binge-watch I remember a good number of the episodes from the first season all the way up to the end of season 7, which implies almost all of it was broadcast on local TV, kind of a rarity I think?

A while back someone I know went from working as a developer to working at a senior/management type position at a bank, and that new job came with the corresponding dress code, which meant he was now going to work in long sleeves or barongs. That kind of thing is not for me - back when I still considered a regular office job, one of the fastest ways to get me to run away from an &ldquo;opportunity&rdquo; would be an overly stringent and/or formal dress code.

Last week, Twitter added Fleets, their own version of stories (short-lived posts). As could be expected, it&rsquo;s not something I can relate to. I did post one (saying &ldquo;This is dumb.&quot;) just to see what the interface was like, but that&rsquo;s it.
I thought about writing a blog post about how I dislike this sort of ephemeral social media, but it turns out that something I&rsquo;d already written about before. Things don&rsquo;t change I guess, and they just come around.

After playing through Super Mario 3D All Stars in October, I borrowed a copy of Super Mario Odyssey for the Nintendo Switch from my brother and played through it for most of November. Odyssey was the main reason I actually got a Switch; I played through a few worlds at a friends house during a single session and loved it, so I had been meaning to get the console just for Odyssey alone.

<div class="content p-summary">
Rhythm of War is book four in Sanderson&rsquo;s epic fantasy Stormlight Archive series. Goodreads tells me I read the prior book Oathbringer back in Nov 2017, but didn&rsquo;t bother writing a review, so I had to make sure I&rsquo;d write one now.
The book&rsquo;s launch day kind of caught me a bit unexpectedly so I didn&rsquo;t bother doing a re-read of the previous three books. Which given an epic fantasy series of this scope might have been a mistake, but watch me do it again for book five.

It&rsquo;s National Heroes Day over here, so I&rsquo;ve been thinking about heroics.
In software development, Heroic Programming can have a negative connotation:
 HeroicProgramming is often the only course of action left when poor planning, insufficient funds, and impractical schedules leave a project stranded and unlikely to complete successfully.
 I guess it&rsquo;s not just in software development either. Many times heroics are an indicator of failed systems.
Bonifacio and other Philippine heroes were needed because Spanish colonialism had failed the Filipino people, necessitating a revolution.

December is almost upon us!
I had an opportunity last week to take on some additional work, but on further reflection, I thought I&rsquo;d pass on it. I am in general, averse to working during the Christmas season (that is to say, more so than during the entire year in general). Even back when I was working full-time, I&rsquo;d prefer taking most of my leaves during December. It&rsquo;s really a result of the terrible traffic in Metro Manila, which gets significantly worse during Christmas season, a trauma that lingers even when I&rsquo;m home all the time.

This week felt weird. It kind of went by quickly for me, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel like anything important really happened. Its kind of like those moments in-between other events, where you&rsquo;re just coasting along and waiting for the more significant things to happen. My country is still recovering from the storms of the past few weeks, Trump is still flailing around trying to overturn democracy, and our own president is still insecure when someone gets more attention than him.

Weather this past week was very bad for those of us in Metro Manila (and many other places in Luzon). Howling winds and strong rains dominated for 2-3 days of the week due to typhoon Ulysses. This typhoon wasn&rsquo;t as strong as Rolly a couple of weeks ago, but it seems that it brought a lot more rains, causing flooding and loss of power in a whole lot of places. Metro Manila was hit quite badly, even drawing comparisons to Ondoy back in 2009.

The World: Somehow the week seemed to go by both quickly and agonizingly slowly, mostly because of the US presidential elections held this week. Slowly because after the initial burst of results on Tuesday night (US time), the remaining states&rsquo; results trickled in very slowly. Quickly because much time was spent doomscrolling and refreshing election-related updates. I think the world collectively breathed a sigh of relief this weekend as the US networks finally called the race for former VP and now president-elect Joe Biden.

I recently did a server migration since I moved to new hosting, The move was from managed/shared hosting to a VPS, these are some notes I took during the process, which I figure might be helpful if I ever tried to do this again. (And maybe someone else finds it helpful too). Links and references to helpeful resources are included.
Setting up a webserver and WSGI container I already knew I wanted to use Nginx (managed hosting on the old server always used Apache), that meant needing to choose a WSGI container for the Django apps.

Now: Stormy weekend here in Manila. Supposedly the &ldquo;strongest storm of 2020&rdquo; so far, typhoon Rolly made landfall earlier today and is currently battering many of the provinces south of Metro Manila. Storm signals are as high as number 5. As of this writing, weather is currently cold and nippy but not particularly rainy where I am. We expect stronger winds and rain to hit us as evening approaches as well.

Leaving Hugo It&rsquo;s been a bit under two years since I migrated the site from Wordpress to Hugo. As discussed in this post one year ago, I was very happy with the general workflow of managing posts through markdown files in git, but had big problems with the Hugo build time, largely a consequence of my social media archiving. At that time, I didn&rsquo;t want to invest effort into migrating to a different backend, but the problem has only gotten incrementally worse since then, so I decided to take the jump and started working on it last month.

Server migration update: I had encountered some trouble with the Travis-CI -based Hugo build generating this here website last week. Luckily, most of the migration work to the new backend was already done, so I went ahead and switched over the servers. So this site is no longer plain-old deployed HTML, but rather powered by a Django backend. The site should be mostly the same, though I did take the opportunity to move some stuff around.

So I got a Nintendo Switch last month. One of the first games I had gotten for the system was the recently released Super Mario 3d All-Stars. I had really been wanting to play Super Mario Odyssey instead, but my brother had a copy of that game that I could borrow later, so I decided to get 3dAS first, as I had never really played the 3 games on the collection.

So my current webhost finally decided to give me a deadline, the long and short of it is that my new server needs to be ready by December the 9th, giving me a bit under a month to get things in order. I&rsquo;m already in the middle of setting up the new server, so I think I&rsquo;ll be ready by early November anyway. Most of the code to run the new blog is also mostly ready (who knows how many bugs there are though!

The world continues to be terrible. The PH government wants people to get back to work and everything to spur the economy (with health precautions and everything). A lot of people have no choice, but I&rsquo;m fortunate enough to not have to go out there yet, and I&rsquo;m sure people like me will still hold back.

October is imminent! There are two distractions I&rsquo;m looking forward to in the coming month.
  The first one is Inktober, which I&rsquo;ve been doing since 2016. Basically it&rsquo;s just to do 30 ink drawings in October, one per day. There are some official prompts, which I&rsquo;ll probably follow. I haven&rsquo;t really done any serious sketching in a while, maybe this will help me get back into the groove.
