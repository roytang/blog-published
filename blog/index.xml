            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s April! Or as it&amp;rsquo;s otherwise known, March 2020 month 13. As is usual, we are suffering the sweltering summer heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it&amp;rsquo;s Easter Sunday, if that means anything to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surprising almost no one, the PH government extended the ECQ lockdown in the NCR+ bubble. Anyone with half a brain could have told you that the one week ECQ was no way going to be enough, given what we know about the virus&amp;rsquo; life cycle. Meanwhile, we continued to hit record numbers of new cases, our 7-day rolling average now the highest in SEA since the pandemic began. It&amp;rsquo;s like we&amp;rsquo;re in the same situation we were in last year, except the numbers are much, much higher. And yet our leadership is like &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/inquirerdotnet/status/1377810270500790274&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not so bad, even France has lockdowns!&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Sigh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Austin Kleon reminds us that we all need &lt;a href=&#34;https://austinkleon.com/2018/01/19/something-to-look-forward-to/&#34;&gt;something to look forward to&lt;/a&gt;. (Arbitrary stupid goals!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was fascinated by this &lt;a href=&#34;https://theconversation.com/the-man-with-no-plot-how-i-watched-lee-child-write-a-jack-reacher-novel-51220&#34;&gt;article about how Lee Child writes Jack Reacher novels on the fly&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because that seems like the sort of &amp;ldquo;less work&amp;rdquo; approach I&amp;rsquo;d prefer when writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a curiosity: &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law&#34;&gt;Benford&amp;rsquo;s Law&lt;/a&gt;, or the law of anomalous numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://newrepublic.com/article/161106/defense-nothing&#34;&gt;In defense of doing nothing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent a long time working with Java projects, so &lt;a href=&#34;https://advancedweb.hu/a-categorized-list-of-all-java-and-jvm-features-since-jdk-8-to-16/&#34;&gt;this long list of new features from Java 8 to 16&lt;/a&gt; was interesting to me. After reading this, I asked my old workmates what version of Java they were now using, and they were still on Java 8, the same version as when I left there 6 years ago! Time flows differently in the enterprise universe I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My friends were amazed I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-1Ue0FFrHY&#34;&gt;Long, Long Man japanese commercials&lt;/a&gt; before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Peu6lw0nido&#34;&gt;this case study by Elsa Charretier of a Hawkeye comic book panel by David Aja&lt;/a&gt;. Probably helpful in my own sketching! Subscribed to her channel as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sony announced that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-store-shut-down-ps3-vita-psp&#34;&gt;they will be shutting down the PS3, Vita and PSP stores&lt;/a&gt;. End of an era really. A lot of people are complaining about content that will be forever lost, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure that there are people working to archive this stuff and make it available through other means. &lt;em&gt;Wink wink&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a person with comorbidities (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2005/05/hypertension/&#34;&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;), I&amp;rsquo;m in vaccine priority group A3, right after senior citizens (A2s). And since the stock of AstraZeneca is limited, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/QCGov/status/1377997094431129606&#34;&gt;QC is now allowing A3s to go ahead of A2s&lt;/a&gt;, so I was able to book a vaccine appointment on the 27th. Its a ways off, but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that means they&amp;rsquo;ve learned to streamline their on-site processes by then, so hopefully things go smoothly. It&amp;rsquo;s weird to have booked a schedule even before the more at-risk parents though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a bid to minimize having to go outside, we decided to try ordering groceries online via &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.metromart.com/&#34;&gt;Metromart&lt;/a&gt;. The first-time experience wasn&amp;rsquo;t great; we had to buy from a different grocery (since our usual one wasn&amp;rsquo;t available), not all the regular items we needed were there, and some items were way more expensive. And worst of all, I ordered Tostitos cheese dip and they bought spinach dip instead!! The weird thing is, there were some other items that were out of stock that they called me about (even though I explicitly set that if there were missing items, just don&amp;rsquo;t buy them??), yet for the dip, they just went ahead and bought a different flavor. I ended up having a long convo with their customer support about how disappointed I was, and somehow despite saying there&amp;rsquo;s nothing they could do, they later ended up offering me P100 store credit as compensation. I guess it will be useful if ever we decide to try this again. Anyway, we ended up doing a supplementary grocery run yesterday to cover the items the online delivery didn&amp;rsquo;t get (and the cheese dip!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only one movie watched this week, continuing the James Bond run: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1a1ab3ad610478ba3b672b0a89c26333/&#34;&gt;On Her Majesty&amp;rsquo;s Secret Service (1969)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supergirl&lt;/strong&gt; has started up again, carrying over baggage from the cut-short previous season, same as Flash. The writing was marginally better though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt; was pretty good, though I still found Wandavision more exciting overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tried grinding to Master Rank in Eternal on the last day of the month, but I ran out of time with half a level to go. Sigh. Arena I didn&amp;rsquo;t even bother and ended the month in platinum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a couple of Civ6 games, mostly achievement hunting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a bit more &lt;strong&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/strong&gt;, now down to 1 achievement remaining, but it requires going through all the secret levels, I think?? That might take a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s multiplayer games with friends: Blood Rage, Sentinels of the Multiverse, Root, and Orcs Must Die 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Finished reading Discworld&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Men at Arms!&lt;/strong&gt;, maybe I can write book review(s) this week. Need to find a new book to read, probably a nonfiction one this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was the second Holy Week in a row where we were just stuck at home all day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Falcon and Winter Soldier, Invincible, One Piece, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the last weekend of March. It feels like the month went by quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local covid response: The government introduced the concept of an &amp;ldquo;NCR Plus&amp;rdquo; bubble last Monday, restricting travel in and out of the NCR and adjacent provinces, in response to the rising cases. Still, the daily counts kept rising, hitting record highs of almost 10k cases daily. Even before the dust has settled on the bubble response, they decided to announce last night a reversion to the stricter ECQ. Shades of last year, during the run up to the first lockdown announcement: rumors circulated via chat groups about the impending lockdown before the government finally made their announcement. As can be expected, memes quickly circulated about how we came back to ECQ more than a year after the first lockdown. The lockdown is imposed only for one week, during the Holy Week period, presumably to take advantage of the two holidays in the week to minimize economic impact. The fact that they imposed two different levels of responses one after another &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1375737016407625729/&#34;&gt;reeks of poor planning and analysis&lt;/a&gt;, as if they were just making all this up as they go along, which might not be far from the truth. What happens if the case counts continue to rise until next Sunday?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a bit of economically-devastating-yet-unintentionally-hilarious world news: a very large container ship, the MV EVER GIVEN, ran aground in the Suez Canal, blocking passage, and has been stuck there since Tuesday-ish, clogging up global shipping trade through the canal. Apparently losses are at the order of $400M per hour or something? IDK, I&amp;rsquo;m not an economist. All I&amp;rsquo;m sure of is the internet almost immediately produced a &lt;a href=&#34;https://nypost.com/2021/03/25/the-best-suez-canal-memes-the-stuck-ship-ever-given-inspired/&#34;&gt;bunch of memes&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=&#34;https://jezebel.com/yes-people-are-writing-horny-fanfic-about-the-suez-can-1846562940&#34;&gt;horny fanfic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read this interesting post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.ayjay.org/blogging-and-the-blogosphere/&#34;&gt;blogging and the blogosphere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something that interested me mostly for trivia purposes: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nme.com/photos/30-covers-that-are-better-than-the-originals-1405281&#34;&gt;30 covers that are better than the originals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/mar/22/douglas-adams-note-to-self-reveals-author-found-writing-torture&#34;&gt;Douglas Adams&amp;rsquo; note to self reveals author found writing torture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul Graham reminds us to &lt;a href=&#34;http://paulgraham.com/simply.html&#34;&gt;write simply&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Sketching, sketching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing my run on the Bond movies with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/fb71576d1974213ea471b5cda8a20948/&#34;&gt;You Only Live Twice (1967)&lt;/a&gt;. Secret volcano lair!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also managed to convince myself to sit down and watch &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/snyder-cut/&#34;&gt;Zack Snyder&amp;rsquo;s Justice League&lt;/a&gt;. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t manage to sit down for four hours straight, so it was two sittings over two days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second episode of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier last Friday. Still a bit meh, mostly because there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been anything I haven&amp;rsquo;t expected yet. But that&amp;rsquo;s bound to change as I think all the content from the trailers have been shown by now. Some good acting by Sebastian Sean though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finished watching &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek The Animated Series&lt;/strong&gt;, Star Trek TV series completion!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First 3 episodes &lt;strong&gt;Invincible&lt;/strong&gt; have dropped on Prime Video. Most of the first episode is good, clean superhero fun, but by the end of the episode you are dissuaded of that notion. Pretty good pacing, seems mostly accurate to the source material, looking forward to the rest of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also been rewatching The Office as my background watching, mostly because I listened to a podcast of Office trivia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run: Still ongoing, somehow. It feels like I&amp;rsquo;m doing these in real time, only advancing one week of the game per week of real life. At that rate, I should be done in like six months lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After five years of playing Street Fighter V, I managed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1374367400276025345/&#34;&gt;dig myself out of the pits of the bronze ranks and hit silver&lt;/a&gt;! Surprisingly, on the next two days after this, I had trouble finding ranked matches again. I took that as a sign to take a break before attempting to climb up to gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final Civ6 NFP drop came out as expected. Not super hyped, but I have started a Portugal game already, they seem really strong especially on island maps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strixhaven official previews kicked off, and I&amp;rsquo;m really hyped for the set, mostly because I really &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1375147827110629379/&#34;&gt;like the Mystical Archive cards&lt;/a&gt;. Collecting all of them on Arena is gonna be a challenge though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supposedly Magic Arena is now available &amp;ldquo;everywhere&amp;rdquo; on mobile, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/mdf9dp/androidios_versions_not_available_in_southeast/&#34;&gt;not in Southeast Asia though&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; I mentioned last week that I started reading the Discworld book &amp;ldquo;Guards! Guards!&amp;rdquo;, but for some reason everything seemed so familiar, and soon I realized it was because I had &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/12/805050532834353152/&#34;&gt;already read it back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Doh! I was enjoying it anyway, so I finished the re-read and will probably publish a review, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have one in 2016. But I&amp;rsquo;ll finish the next City Watch book first: Men at Arms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AboutQuiz this week a bit better than last week, but I still miss the other trivia groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1374212757189369861/&#34;&gt;I hit the 800-day streak on Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New FatWS episode, etc etc. I presume new Invincible episode as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe the world will miraculously be better next week? IDK, one can always hope right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Holy Week! Normally a big deal for the RC faithful in this country, but this time everyone has to stay at home for the second year in a row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ECQ! Well, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect me much, though there are now some errands that we have to push back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;See also: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2017/11/931540341919965184/&#34;&gt;Justice League spoiler-free review (2017)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is basically a movie that&amp;rsquo;s more than 3 years old, we&amp;rsquo;re not holding back on spoilers here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plot basically follows the same beats as the theatrical cut&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;except this time we have a lot more team setup time (one of my criticisms from the previous version), giving the characters stronger backgrounds, especially Cyborg and Flash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ray Fisher was right to complain; in this version he&amp;rsquo;s one of the important characters of the ensemble while he was basically a minor guest character in the theatrical cut&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more DC characters make appearances in this version, among them Ryan Choi, DeSaad, Granny Goodness, Martian Manhunter, the Joker and of course Darkseid himself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I accept this version as a better version of the original theatrical release and is my new DCEU headcanon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it never would have worked in theaters anyway, given the four hour runtime. Maybe if they split it into two movies&amp;hellip; (and I actually did take two sittings to watch this one!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anyway, this version does a much better job of setting up any succeeding movies, including the upcoming Flash movie (although I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the changes cause any continuity issues with the 2019 Aquaman movie&amp;hellip; not that the DCEU cares too much about continuity anyway&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over the past couple of days, our nationwide daily covid cases broke 7000+, the highest recorded so far.  Have to be super careful when going out for errands. Not that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t being careful even before, mind you. Just now, government has announced we are still under GCQ (see my post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1373562580375986178/&#34;&gt;the PH quarantine levels&lt;/a&gt;), but with more restrictions, etc. Looks like they are still hesitant to provide a stronger lockdown which would require paying people to stay home so they don&amp;rsquo;t starve to death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.protocol.com/internet-archive-preserving-future&#34;&gt;The internet is splitting apart. The Internet Archive wants to save it all forever. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Also could&amp;rsquo;ve sworn there was a bunch of funny stuff I read on Twitter this week that I can&amp;rsquo;t find anymore. I need to get better at marking/sharing things I find funny or interesting.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Continuing my run on the Bond movies with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/273eae12d668c24135d4db358511c9d4/&#34;&gt;Goldfinger (1964)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/c6152994fa5ddf4b9c3302bcddfdd699/&#34;&gt;Thunderall (1965)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I keep threatening to watch the Snyder Cut, but have yet to find a four hour block of time to do it. FOUR HOURS!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, I watched the first episode of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Kind of meh, though I appreciate the emotional angles they&amp;rsquo;re going for. Might have been more hyped if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware a certain character was going to be introduced in this series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finished watching &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;, now almost through the Animated Series. Almost to Star Trek TV series completion!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run: Still ongoing, somehow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to play Valkyria Chronicles 4 on Steam since I got it from Humble Choice, but since I&amp;rsquo;m still in the middle of a Fire Emblem run I keep putting it off. It feels weird to have two anime-styled tactical RPGs running at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I actually managed to finish a run of &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127610/Iris_and_the_Giant/&#34;&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/a&gt;! I still have a few more achievements to get, then I&amp;rsquo;ll probably write a review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually managed to play a fair bit of Street Fighter V over the past week, after getting inspired by watching some Justin Wong videos. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve found the sweet spot / happy hour for actually finding matches where I am, so here&amp;rsquo;s hoping to play more moving forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Finished reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/neuromancer/&#34;&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/a&gt;. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d follow it up with some lighter reading, so I got started on a Discworld book: &amp;ldquo;Guards! Guards!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/2021-site-update/&#34;&gt;Site changes applied!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We did an AboutQuiz this week, but it was terrible (for our team at the very least). I&amp;rsquo;m hoping the more mainstream pop culture trivia quizzes like PopQuiz and Geekfight come back some time soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe (could be wrong) that the Invincible animated series is coming out on Prime Video at the end of the week. I read a fair bit of the comic, though I don&amp;rsquo;t remember much of the later parts, so I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to this. I feel like JK Simmons as the protag&amp;rsquo;s dad is going to turn out to be a great casting decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;final drop in the Civ6 New Frontier pass, with new Civ Portugal, is coming out this week. I&amp;rsquo;m not very hyped for it, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy the recent barbarian update too much, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll give it a go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Falcon and Winter Soldier etc etc. WandaVision really got going by the end of episode 3, but FatWS is only 2/3rds as many episodes, so I assume important things are gonna be happening in episode 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>2021 Site Update
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/2021-site-update/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2021 07:18:03 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/2021-site-update/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of weeks or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve made quite a few changes to the site, mostly focused on frontend/layout/UI changes. The changes are more or less done, so here&amp;rsquo;s a changelog entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main driver of the changes was this post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://seirdy.one/2020/11/23/website-best-practices.html&#34;&gt;best practices for text websites&lt;/a&gt;. Not all of it applies to the site, since I do have a bunch of image content around as well, but enough that I was spurred to apply many of the points and also include some additional changes I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do. Secondary objectives include: improving site performance, accessibility, and code output; and hopefully making the site menus more organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layout changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplified top header content. V-card and some other stuff moved to the footer. Merged &amp;ldquo;Blog&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Notes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Links&amp;rdquo; into &amp;ldquo;Posts&amp;rdquo; for shorter menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed sidebar. Most of the sidebar links for my own use/benefit anyway, and not for the potential blog reader. Most of the content has been moved into the home page, footer, and the new explore page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added submenus to most listing pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standardize display of page title/description where possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added support for &amp;ldquo;prefers-color-scheme: light&amp;rdquo;. I still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/4d1fb5fa3502d4df0ff4f70f9891a7c3/&#34;&gt;default to dark mode&lt;/a&gt; though!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switched to a monospace font. Honestly I find it hard to decide whether I like monospace or sans-serif more, but let&amp;rsquo;s go with this for now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaned up/reduced the meta info at the bottom of each post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Client-side performance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;full-size images are now set to lazy load, so the browser doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to download them all immediately for example when &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook&#34;&gt;viewing an album&lt;/a&gt;. Only the thumbnails are loaded immediately, full-size images are shown only when activating &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/hugo-lightbox/&#34;&gt;the lightbox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;featured image for blog posts now use a thumbnail when shown in list view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also wanted to improve &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.webbloatscore.com/&#34;&gt;the WebBloat score&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s currently fine for text-heavy blog posts, but I guess I can&amp;rsquo;t avoid a higher score for image-heavy content since the crawler they use ignores the fact that I lazy load the full-size images and they are initially hidden. Something to consider in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new front/home page with content samplers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;added &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/explore&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Explore&amp;rdquo; page&lt;/a&gt; where I can put links that don&amp;rsquo;t belong in any of the submenus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improved &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/now&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now&amp;rdquo; page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cleaned up some out of date stuff in the About pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use profile photo as favicon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backend/code changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML Validation: Most pages should now validate without warnings/errors on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://validator.w3.org/nu&#34;&gt;W3C HTML validator&lt;/a&gt;. There was actually a lot of broken HTML I had to fix (due to me mistyping things and so on.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made sure most images had alt-text, even if just default values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Score of 75/100 on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/roytang.net&#34;&gt;Mozilla Observatory&lt;/a&gt;. It was at 20/100 before. The only thing I hadn&amp;rsquo;t implemented yet was the Content Security Policy (CSP) header, as it would have caused some issues on certain pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also tried to generally reduce the page weight, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually that high before, so I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s any measurable change there. Minifying HTML/CSS was a possibility, but that just makes it harder for me to debug things, and really feels like something too serious for a hobby site like this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripts and cookies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the site already uses minimal JS in a few places: there&amp;rsquo;s a captcha for comments, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/locations&#34;&gt;locations page&lt;/a&gt; requires JS, and some of the stat pages load data remotely via JS, but that should be it. 99% of the pages of the site should be JS free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also don&amp;rsquo;t use any cookies myself. But I do have Cloudflare enabled on the site, and they do add a &lt;code&gt;__cfduid&lt;/code&gt; cookie, supposedly to detect bots. This &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.cloudflare.com/deprecating-cfduid-cookie/&#34;&gt;cookie is being deprecated by May 2021&lt;/a&gt; though, so by then the site should be cookie-free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should be it! I had some other features in mind to implement (never ending scope creep when you have a personal project really), but I&amp;rsquo;ve already spent too much time on this and need to work on my other shenanigans as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing: attaching some images so that I can compare to the future look of the website:&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Book Review: Neuromancer by William Gibson
</title>

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/book-review-neuromancer-by-william-gibson/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It took me more than three weeks to get through Gibson&amp;rsquo;s influential work Neuromancer, a book that pioneered the cyberpunk genre and even introduced terms like cyberspace, ICE and &amp;ldquo;the matrix&amp;rdquo; into popular lexicon. It&amp;rsquo;s not because the book is bad or anything, it&amp;rsquo;s just that Gibson tends to describe everything very vividly, and almost all of it from the POV of our lead character Case, who is sometimes in the real world, sometimes in cyberspace, and sometimes simply just drunk or high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself taking time with each scene to visualize where Case was and what was going on. In later parts of the book, it became even more complicated because Case gained the ability to see the world from the POV of his ally, the cybergirl Molly. So for many chapters the POV would consistently shift between Case in the real world, Case in cyberspace, Case looking through Molly&amp;rsquo;s eyes, and so on. Some of it even takes place in space / low-gravity scenarios, so the perspectives being described can be challenging to imagine. Throw in a lot of high-tech / near-future slang and Rastafarian accents and it can make for a challenging read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made it to the end, somehow, though every step of the way I doubted whether I understood what was really going on. In fact, I had to read a plot summary afterwards to confirm that yes, I did in fact understand the story and I was not being dumb. Hard to tell without spoiling anything, but it&amp;rsquo;s really the sort of thing you&amp;rsquo;d expect from a cyberpunk story anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did enjoy the book, though I suspect I would have liked it more as a movie, as that would have been easier to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Alignment Shift: No Longer Lawful
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/alignment-shift-no-longer-lawful/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 17 Mar 2021 04:57:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/alignment-shift-no-longer-lawful/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;When I was much younger, I used to strongly identify as &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2008/02/im-lawful-good/&#34;&gt;Lawful Good&lt;/a&gt;. Whenever I&amp;rsquo;d play any of the old-school DND RPGs like Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate or Neverwinter Nights, I&amp;rsquo;d find my main character almost always being a Lawful Good Paladin goody-goody type. This was back when I was younger and more idealistic and a stronger believer in &amp;ldquo;rule of law&amp;rdquo;-type principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the years have gone by, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that my alignment has shifted considerably. Part of it is a strong disillusionment with the &amp;ldquo;law&amp;rdquo; part of lawful. As I&amp;rsquo;ve become more immersed with events in my country and the world, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that adherence to law and order isn&amp;rsquo;t always in the best interest of people or society. The imperfect men implementing the laws can always be corrupted or can find ways to abuse or circumvent the law, while staying within the purview of legality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even in the ideal case where a society is able to consistently &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/11/laws-not-men/&#34;&gt;apply the laws over the whims of men&lt;/a&gt;, the laws in place can still be disadvantageous to the progress or greater good of society. Laws in place have a tendency to be used to preserve the status quo, which in many cases means reinforcing inequality or imbalanced power structures, favoring the entrenched and the elite over the greater majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still largely advocate for following the law and obeying the authorities, but only where it makes sense. In order for society to progress, we must be willing to shake off old norms and challenge the law and authorities where applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original online alignment quiz is no longer available on the current Wizards/DND site, but there are some that have &lt;a href=&#34;http://easydamus.com/alignmenttest.html&#34;&gt;replicated it elsehwere&lt;/a&gt;. I recently took it again to confirm what I&amp;rsquo;ve know for a few years now (image result attached). My current alignment is &lt;strong&gt;Neutral Good&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://easydamus.com/lawfulgood.html&#34;&gt;Description of Lawful Good&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.easydamus.com/neutralgood.html&#34;&gt;Description of Neutral Good&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DND Alignment system is of course an imperfect and vastly oversimplified method of ascertaining one&amp;rsquo;s personality (after all, very few people would openly accept being called &amp;ldquo;Evil&amp;rdquo; on this scale), but I find it can sometimes be helpful as an abstraction of a person&amp;rsquo;s general outlook on life, as long as you know the model&amp;rsquo;s limitations. Individual moments or actions of course, are not obliged to follow one&amp;rsquo;s given alignment, and as it can see here, alignment can easily shift over time. The alignment system is probably roughly as useful as Myers-Briggs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Happy Pi Day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the one year anniversary of the world&amp;rsquo;s longest lockdown. In some kind of sick anniversary celebration, local covid cases are on the rise. Yesterday, 5000 new cases were reported, the highest daily rate in 6 months or so. And now a Philippine variant has been detected. Now is not the time to be complacent, we all need to be more careful. The government seems unwilling to impose another widespread ECQ and are focusing on targetted, granular lockdowns. Not sure how effective this would be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://seirdy.one/2020/11/23/website-best-practices.html&#34;&gt;An opinionated list of best practices for textual websites&lt;/a&gt;. Reading this reminded me there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of updates to this website I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bikobatanari.neocities.org/posts/2020/personal-museum.html&#34;&gt;My Website is a Personal Museum: the creative freedom we lost in the age of social media&lt;/a&gt;. This article, and the referenced &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/&#34;&gt;How the Blog Broke The Web&lt;/a&gt; are nostalgic for the days of curated homepages instead of blogs/social media platforms characterized by chronological feeds. Taking these into account as I consider how to reorganize the content on this website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/19/can-not-quit-facebook/&#34;&gt;Facebook invested heavily in the one feature it knew people couldn’t leave behind: Their groups&lt;/a&gt;. It kind of feels like an opportunity for a new contender to sneak in and develop a better social media platform that&amp;rsquo;s group-centered. Yahoo Groups provided this service in the 00s, but Yahoo being Yahoo, they screwed it up and YG had to close up last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/KimsConvenience/status/1369013822145576964&#34;&gt;Kim&amp;rsquo;s Convenience has been cancelled&lt;/a&gt;. I liked &lt;a href=&#34;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/kims-convenience-the-end-of-the-dream&#34;&gt;Noahpinion&amp;rsquo;s writeup about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;, not missing a beat apparently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in the final season of &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also started reading up on the show&amp;rsquo;s reception, which apparently wasn&amp;rsquo;t great, especially compared to the other Trek shows it succeeded. Not surprising, but the show isn&amp;rsquo;t that bad, really. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of doing a blog post reviewing all the Trek shows, but I should probably watch The Animated Series first for completion purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a long time now I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to watch the old pre-Brosnan Bond movies, which I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen. Maybe mostly for trivia purposes. I got started on this last week with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/2b14f8356f57460da0a4790b27b44b8a/&#34;&gt;Dr No (1962)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/096b7c67797c165b01283d0c7cd6c016/&#34;&gt;From Russia With Love (1963)&lt;/a&gt;. Side note: I&amp;rsquo;m a bit amazed about how they&amp;rsquo;re able to do a sequel based on the success of the previous film in just a year. Modern day Hollywood films cost so much and are so complicated the typical spacing for sequels is at least three years. Next is Goldfinger!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run: Such slow progress, but progress nonetheless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still trying to finish &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127610/Iris_and_the_Giant/&#34;&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Still very slowly reading cyberpunk classic &lt;em&gt;Neurmancer&lt;/em&gt; by William Gibson. I&amp;rsquo;m about 75% through, so maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll finish this in a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started applying some layout changes and other stuff to the site, things will probably be moving around for a bit. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll write a blog post about it when I&amp;rsquo;m done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coming out this week: Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Zack Snyder&amp;rsquo;s Justice League! More looking forward to FatWS than ZSJL obviously. I am awaiting ZSJL with more of a morbid curiosity than anything else, i.e. my expectations are low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have more medical errands to conduct this week, seems like a bad habit that I keep having to get into too often. Comes with the age, I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do reviews of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s review is for &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1015930/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage: Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;. This is a Norse mythology themed game based on a IRL boardgame. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those &amp;ldquo;place your guys on the map&amp;rdquo; boardgame where each player vies for control of provinces. The game is divided into three ages, and at the end of each age one of the provinces is destroyed as part of ragnarok. The players place units in each of the provinces, which have limited slots for units. During your turn you can choose to pillage a province, and other players can fight you for it if they have units there as well or can send units from adjacent provinces. A successfully pillage earns you a stat boost, and successfully defeating other players earns you glory, which is used to score for victory at the end of the game. The age ends when all the provinces have been pillaged or all the players no longer have any possible actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of each age the players draft 6 cards that will be available for them to use during the age. These include battle cards (which give you bonuses or abilities when fighting to pillage territories), upgrade cards (which give you either new abilities or new units or monsters to summon, each with special powers), or quests (which give you glory and stat bonuses at the end of the age if you fulfill their conditions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle and upgrade cards are mostly themed around the Norse Gods - Odin, Thor, Loki, Frigga, and Tyr. Each god has a different set of effects, and some can change your strategy so that you can win without having to actually win battles. For example, Tyr&amp;rsquo;s battle cards are all about giving you bonuses to combat, but Loki&amp;rsquo;s cards are all about earning you benefits when you lose combats. In many of our games, one of the player ends up being the &amp;ldquo;Loki player&amp;rdquo; who just joins every battle he can trying to gain those Loki bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battles are encouraged though; many of the upgrades and quests reward you with more glory for fighting and dying in battle, and having your units destroyed in ragnarok gives glory bonuses as well. At the start of each age, all previously destroyed units are again available for placement, so constantly getting into fights and getting sent to Valhalla can be a strategy as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve also gotten and played two of the expansions DLCs: &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1354120/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition__Mystics_of_Midgard/&#34;&gt;Mystics of Midgard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366580/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition__Gods_of_Asgard/&#34;&gt;Gods of Asgard&lt;/a&gt; (recently released). Mystics add a new unit type that can be drafted, including an annoying unit that can&amp;rsquo;t be killed as long as it has a province to retreat to after battle. The mystics usually end of being high draft picks. Gods of Asgard adds two randomly chosen Norse God figures to the board (among the 5 mentioned above), each one applies special properties to the province where they&amp;rsquo;re in, and they move do a different province after every pillage attempt. For example, Tyr makes it so that battles in the province only count battle cards and not the strength of the involved units; while Frigga makes it so that units in the province cannot die in battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was a bit buggy when we first got it in mid 2020, since it was just released, but it has steadily improved since then. We played it again recently after some time away and noted many improvements to the UI and quality of life changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is fun; we&amp;rsquo;ve played a reasonable amount of it (I&amp;rsquo;m at around 47 hours as of this writing.) It&amp;rsquo;s the kind of game where it&amp;rsquo;s easy and fun to mess around with what your opponents are doing, especially if you drafted some of the trickier cards. The only bad side would be that the games tend to go long, especially if someone drafted a good Loki deck or the Mystics are around or other such tricks. In our last session, we played 2 games for around 3 hours total.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;March has begun. Did it ever really end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vaccination finally starts in the country, with initial donated batches of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccine arriving in the country. Just in time for the one year anniversary of the world&amp;rsquo;s longest lockdown. SinoVac isn&amp;rsquo;t the best choice, but many of my doctor friends say they&amp;rsquo;ll settle for it if that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s available for them. I think QC is planning to use AstraZeneca for their citizens, but worrying is that AZ&amp;rsquo;s efficacy has been shown to be not so good against certain variants such as the South African one, which has already been detected in the country. Cases have been on the rise in the past couple of weeks as well, possibly due to the variants. We may very well be in a race against time now (maybe we always have been). The next month may be the most crucial phase of the pandemic for us, as vaccination drives hopefully kick into gear to try to overcome the accelerating spread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohhelloana.blog/catching-up-on-my-bookmarks/&#34;&gt;OhHelloAna.blog shared a whole bunch of bookmarks&lt;/a&gt;. Quite a few look interesting. Looking forward to going through this list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/&#34;&gt;Great article about cutting loading times in GTA&lt;/a&gt; went around last week. A case study in the problems with blindly relying on dependencies perhaps, and the complexities of C code performance, and even software performance in general.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rachel True had &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RachelTrue/status/1365461618977476610&#34;&gt;problems with iCloud&lt;/a&gt; after accidentally inputting her last name in lowercase. Feels like the sort of thing that can be maybe part of standard QA test suites? Hope she gets it resolved soon!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this fan video: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UngE0qn3VRY&#34;&gt;What if Wes Anderson directed X-Men?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/NonsenseIsland/status/1366449816042102787&#34;&gt;this thread on classical music in classic cartoons&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m no musical expert by any means, so it was even educational for me!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve switched back to doing digital sketches via Procreate, with kind of a different style this time? I kind of like it, more or less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today I was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/lzagfz/eli5_whats_the_difference_between_joules_watts/gq0i81h/?context=3&#34;&gt;mentioned via the u/hungryroy syntax on reddit&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. Not a big deal, I was just surprised lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally the pandemic and the quarantine hasn&amp;rsquo;t hit me as bad as other folks. My day to day routine hasn&amp;rsquo;t actually changed that much, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t really go out too often even pre-pandemic. That being said, I do miss being able to go out to places just to wander around, take my daily walk in a public place like &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1366349139559129088/&#34;&gt;the QC circle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/01/saturday-morning-up/&#34;&gt;the university campus&lt;/a&gt;, or even just loitering at the mall. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I miss being able to hang out with other people (although I do to some degree as well). More like I miss the ability to be outside, alone, in public, just sitting quietly and letting the universe wash over me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; is done! Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/wandavision/&#34;&gt;a spoiler-free review&lt;/a&gt;, something I used to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/spoiler-free-review/&#34;&gt;do more regularly&lt;/a&gt;. I have more spoiler-related thoughts, but they may be too much for this space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m almost done with season 2 of &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;, which means I&amp;rsquo;m about halfway through the series overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Flash&lt;/strong&gt; started its new season last week, but it feels like their episodes are like 90% nonsense now. (Used to be closer to 60% nonsense.). Second ep of &lt;strong&gt;Superman and Lois&lt;/strong&gt; was okay, although we are definitely getting more moody teenager problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run: still WIP. Moving forward slowly, ever so slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got last month&amp;rsquo;s Humble Choice, and decided to go ahead and install and try out some of the games in the bundle.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started by playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127610/Iris_and_the_Giant/&#34;&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice little tactical battle indie game with CCG mechanics &amp;ndash; think Slay the Spire, but with turn-based tactical RPG battles that can also feel very puzzle-like. I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying well-designed indie games recently, and this one seems to fall into that bucket. It has a unique, minimalist aesthetic and the story is about a young girl&amp;rsquo;s mental health? Maybe? I&amp;rsquo;ll know more if I actually managed to finish a run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also tried to play a game of &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/392110/Endless_Space_2/&#34;&gt;Endless Space 2&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not unfamiliar with 4X games of course, but this one was a bit confusing for me. In the one game where I managed to get anywhere, it felt like I was always behind in tech, and there&amp;rsquo;s so many indicators and UI elements on the different views that I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand. I can see there&amp;rsquo;s going to be a learning curve for this one, so it may take a few games for me to get the hang of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of Humble choice, the next one has Control as a showcase game, but I already got that off PS+, so I think I&amp;rsquo;m pausing on this one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday regular gaming group decided to play &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1015930/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/a&gt; again yesterday, and we found out there was new DLC so we all decided to buy that and try it out. Might do a review for this game this week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also did quite a few Starcraft 2 1v1s with friends this past week. I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself very proficient with SC2, mostly because I&amp;rsquo;m very micro-averse, but I still enjoy playing it. Maybe not ladder though. We recorded some of our games, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bINjaPjt1M&#34;&gt;the first one is up on the Team Camote youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;, if you&amp;rsquo;d like to watch me be terrible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of reasons, I browsed some Ludum Dare games the other day. My favorite is this short and simple one: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/a-monster-hunter-story&#34;&gt;A Monster Hunter Story&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Still very slowly reading cyberpunk classic &lt;em&gt;Neurmancer&lt;/em&gt; by William Gibson. I&amp;rsquo;m about halfway through, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I understand everything that&amp;rsquo;s going on. Might need to look for a recap later on. Still, I soldier on!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh, nothing. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s going to be one of those weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Today is the last day of February. Tomorrow, we march on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biden ordered his &lt;a href=&#34;https://thehill.com/policy/defense/540631-Biden-orders-US-strikes-on-iranian-backed-militia-facilities-in-syria&#34;&gt;first military strike last week&lt;/a&gt;. America is back, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This past week, embrassingly our local police and anti-drug agency got into a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/pnp-pdea-shootout-bungled-buy-bust-operation-ever-gotesco-quezon-city&#34;&gt;shootout&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;against each other&lt;/em&gt; near the Ever Gotesco mall in Quezon City. Both sides claim they were doing a buy-bust, which is impossible. As usual, there is little transparency about what actually happened, and many promises of &amp;ldquo;impartial&amp;rdquo; probes and investigations. People speculate that at least one of the parties involved really was dealing drugs, and they got into a shootout because they were afraid of being EJK&amp;rsquo;ed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have any of these today, sadly. This is why I don&amp;rsquo;t have a newsletter, I&amp;rsquo;m unable to promise regular content lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week was busy with family and medical errands, so not much else was accomplished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; penultimate ep, people still liked it, but it was a bit meh for me. Still looking forward to next week&amp;rsquo;s finale, as there are still so many things to wrap up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started watching &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;, the last of the non-animated Trek shows I have yet to watch. (I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the TOS animated series). It&amp;rsquo;s Scott Bakula! Their uniforms here remind me of something like modern astronaut wear, so I assume they wanted something closer to &amp;ldquo;modern day&amp;rdquo; Earth to bridge to the Star Trek future. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting because at this point the relationship between the humans and Vulcans isn&amp;rsquo;t well established, there is no federation, no prime directive, etc, so we get to see the beginnings of those things later on I guess?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also watched a couple of movies this week. First was &lt;strong&gt;Space Sweepers&lt;/strong&gt;, a Korean space sci-fi adventure on Netflix. Entertaining enough, though the plot is easily predictable and the villain seemed like a moron. Great visuals and special effects, miles apart from anything local cinema has to offer. One-inch barrier of subtitles, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second movie was &lt;strong&gt;Once Upon A Time In Hollywood&lt;/strong&gt;. This was a very laid-back, relaxed movie, unfolding mostly as a series of slice-of-life vignettes of what life was like Hollywood in 1969, with no real plot urgency to speak of. The climax sort of just happens through no real actions by the main characters. Fairly long, took me four sittings to get through. Was surprised to find out later that it was based on a true story of a massacre that took place at that time, with Margot Robbie playing a real-life actress who was the victim in the actual massacre. The story unfolds a bit differently, probably due to the presence of fictional protagonists Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth (portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt). Bruce Lee also makes an appearance!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last week was also the premiere of &lt;strong&gt;Superman and Lois&lt;/strong&gt; on CW. I still like these positive portrayals of Superman better than something like Snyder&amp;rsquo;s Man of Steel, although I&amp;rsquo;m a bit meh on the premiere overall. Everything about the teens gives me Smallville vibes. They had a really big missed opportunity to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/1364758520885772288/&#34;&gt;match a scene from the opening sequence with a classic comic cover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a bit of Civ6 now that the Barbarian Clans mode has dropped. Restarted a few times with Kublai Khan before I got a decent start. Not super impressed with the Barbarian Clans mode so far, seems like the main effect is that we get more city-states going into the endgame. Will probably still try it out for a few games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run still in progress, finally got to the Edelgard decision point, and went as I planned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have been trying to figure out why I&amp;rsquo;m having &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/lquag0/sf5_is_it_expected_to_be_so_hard_to_find_a_match/&#34;&gt;so much trouble finding matches in Street Fighter V&lt;/a&gt;. Still no luck though. I want to indulge myself by getting the season 5 pass, but it&amp;rsquo;s not worth it if I can&amp;rsquo;t actually find matches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always annoying whenever this happens, but next month&amp;rsquo;s PS+ games include FF7 Remake, which I&amp;rsquo;ve already played and finished. Good for everyone else though! New content was also announced for the PS5 version of the game, which is also annoying since it&amp;rsquo;s probably goinna be a while before I bother with a PS5 (maybe waiting for a smaller version!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit: One of my loyal readers pointed out I failed to mention that we played a few games of 4-player Free For All in Starcraft 2 last Saturday. I won one and some undeserving people won the other two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Finished reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/ghost-of-my-father/&#34;&gt;Scott Berkun&amp;rsquo;s Ghost of my Father&lt;/a&gt;. Then started reading pioneering cyberpunk classic &lt;em&gt;Neurmancer&lt;/em&gt; by William Gibson. Kind of a challenging read, I&amp;rsquo;m inching through it slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz&lt;/strong&gt;: We managed to win the AboutQuiz league, just barely. Yay us!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managed to sneak in a few minor upgrades to this here site, mostly CSS and rendering improvements on the frontend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WandaVision finale!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Flash season premiere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New One Piece later tonight!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supposedly vaccination in this country will finally kick off!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A while back, on a whim I purchased this indie game &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/922710/Knightin/&#34;&gt;Knightin&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; on Steam. I forget how I came across it and why I decided to buy, but no regrets. It&amp;rsquo;s a tightly-focused dungeon crawler in the style of original Legend of Zelda/Link to the Past dungeons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each dungeon is a set of rooms you clear one at a time, until you get  to the dungeon boss and beat him. Clearing rooms involves defeating  enemies, solving puzzles, avoiding obstacles and opening chests. It&amp;rsquo;s a  short game, there are only four dungeons to clear each slightly more difficult than the last. There is no plot at all. The game itself openly admits this by painting the thinnest of flavors. You play Sir Lootalot and you want to beat the evil dark lord at the end of the fourth dungeon. For treasure! No princess to save or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I say &amp;ldquo;tightly-focused&amp;rdquo;, I mean that the game is barebones and does only what it says, but it does it very well. I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of how well-designed it is. It&amp;rsquo;s entirely predictable, you know what you&amp;rsquo;re getting into, but each part is executed really well. Each dungeon consists of multiple floors. Each floor has exactly twelve rooms, arranged in the same 3x4 rectangle shape every time. There&amp;rsquo;s a minimap that never changes shape, but maps room paths as you go. The minimap has a nice notation that indicates things like stairs up, stairs down, a merchant, a warp point, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combat is simple and straightforward as well. You don&amp;rsquo;t get a plethora of weapons like Link does in the Zelda series. You start out with a sword (obviously) and later you get access to a wand that lets you shoot fireballs, and those are your only weapons ever. Later you also learn to dash (which hits enemies with the sword), fire dash (which leaves a trail of flames as you dash), and learn a spin attack (a la Link to the Past). You only ever have to remember four buttons: swing sword, shoot wand, dash, and raise shield (and I very rarely use the shield).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obstacles in your way include enemies of course, and the difficulty ramp is great here as well. You start out with enemies that just walk around randomly and they damage you if they bump you. As you progress you meet more complicated foes. Enemies with ranged attacks. Enemies that chase you. Enemies that can move faster. Enemies that can pop out from under your feet. Enemies that can reproduce. And so on. They are always introduced one new enemy at a time so you get to know their shtick before you meet them in more difficult rooms. Rooms can also have obstacles, such as blades that suddenly jut out of the ground, rotating saw blades, pillars that shoot projectiles, and so on, all adding to room difficulty. Some rooms will have a merchant who sells stuff (you get gold from enemy drops), or chests you can open. Everything is pre-placed, no procedural generation here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some puzzle rooms, which come in two types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;switch rooms, where you need to figure out which switches to turn on to access a chest or unlock a path. These are handled well enough. Although there&amp;rsquo;s no dialog anywhere, hints for the correct switch positions are scattered visually throughout the same floor of the dungeon where they are found. When you encounter a switch room, it&amp;rsquo;s usually just a matter of going back to previous rooms to see what the hints mean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;block rooms, where you need to push blocks around (only push! no pull!) to get them into the correct positions. I enjoyed the block puzzles more. They are relatively well-designed, and some took me a bit more time than I expected (maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just dumb? Lol)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements&lt;/strong&gt;. Completion in this game is largely straightforward as well. Most of the achievements are geared towards acquiring all the upgrades, opening all chests, and beating all the dungeons. The only two I didn&amp;rsquo;t get (and probably won&amp;rsquo;t bother to) are for doing a speedrun under 90 minutes and for doing a no death run. I tried a couple of post-game runs, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure I can do both of those after some number of tries, but I think I&amp;rsquo;m way too lazy for that. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it installed and maybe someday I&amp;rsquo;ll get around to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall&lt;/strong&gt;: A very tight, focused, well-designed and quick indie game experience (my total play time so far is less than 3 hours). It&amp;rsquo;s relatively cheap on Steam too. It&amp;rsquo;s not super groundbreaking or anything, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth it for a couple of hours of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://scottberkun.com/the-ghost-of-my-father/&#34;&gt;Ghost of My Father by Scott Berkun&lt;/a&gt; this past week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book isn&amp;rsquo;t my usual fare. It&amp;rsquo;s a memoir about the author&amp;rsquo;s father and their relationship and family life. I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with the author&amp;rsquo;s work, but mostly in the realms of tech, design and public speaking, but this book was largely personal, and mostly talking about strangers I had no real interest in. I think the only reason I have a copy at all is because I was on the author&amp;rsquo;s mailing list and got a review copy of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started reading it because I was looking for a new book to pick up, and with the first few pages I was like &amp;ldquo;Oh, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like something for me, I probably won&amp;rsquo;t finish it.&amp;rdquo; but before I knew it, I had finished 40% of the book in one sitting. I consumed mostly as if it was a work of fiction, about strangers and their relationships. Humans like stories after all, and this is a story about people who are only human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author&amp;rsquo;s relationship with his father was strained at best, and it affected the rest of their family as well. I can&amp;rsquo;t personally relate to that, as I have a pretty good relationship with my family. The author&amp;rsquo;s difficult family life provides a window into a kind of human interaction I&amp;rsquo;m not too familiar with. But I do empathize with how it can be difficult to deal with certain people, and how sometimes the people you need closure from the most will simply have no interest in providing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not a long book, it was a quick read for me (less than a week). I probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have sought out such a book on my own, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad I read it.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Digital Boardgames Review: Scythe
</title>

            <pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 07:09:07 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/digital-boardgames-review-scythe/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do reviews of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second review is about &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/718560/Scythe_Digital_Edition/&#34;&gt;Scythe: Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;. Scythe is a competitive game where you play one of seven factions in an alternate history post-war Eastern Europe. Players vie to control territories, hire workers, build mechs, accumulate resources, accomplish secret objectives, and other such goals. Accomplishing secret objectives, winning combats or maximizing one of the several metrics (workers, money, popularity, military power, recruits, structures, mechs, etc) earns you stars, and the game ends when at least one player has six stars. Having six stars doesn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee victory, as points are then tallied up depending on various factors including stars, territories, money, popularity, and so on. Having separate victory and end conditions creates a bit of tension and a balancing act between progressing stars and earning points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players play as one of seven available factions, each with preset locations on the board. The board is preset and consists of hex tiles, each with different movement limitations and resources that can be produced. The board also has &amp;ldquo;encounters&amp;rdquo; on certain tiles, basically roleplaying opportunities where you get the choice of an action to take, typically trading one type of resource for another, usually a good deal, if you can pay the costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board is fixed, but each player is randomly assigned a mat that determines the actions available during their turn. The mat is split into top actions (produce, move, bolster, trade) each paired with one of the available bottom actions (upgrade, deploy mech, recruit, build structure). During your turn, you may play one top action followed by the corresponding bottom action, and you cannot do the same action pair on successive turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weird action structure makes the game challenging. Typically, the top actions generate resources, while the bottom actions consume them to advance your goals. If you get a mat with pairings that are poor for your particular situation, it may take a while for you to get into a regular rhythm of production to actually get anything done. Other players can also interfere with you by sending their character and/or mechs to attack or harass your territory or workers. I usually find that I need to plan ahead 2-3 turns to accomplish a simple goal like building a mech. Beyond the 3-turn window, who knows what the board looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combat is kind of straightforward - you can attack a hex with one or two combat units, and up to two combat units will defend it. Each side can spend up to 7 military power, plus play one combat card per unit on their side, each card adds 2-5 to your total. The attacker wins all ties, favoring aggressors. Due to the way military power and combat cards are accumulated, it&amp;rsquo;s risky to initiate combat unless you have at least 14 military power (this ensures you have a fighting chance against a counterattack). Furthermore, each faction can only gain up to 2 stars from winning combats, so you want to make them count. In our games, we find that typically the winning faction will use two combats to try to earn 2 stars in one turn and end the game, and often those will be the only combats that happen in the entire game. Not sure if we are playing this optimally!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games tend to go at least an hour long, roughly 20 or so turns in our experience. Because of the game&amp;rsquo;s pacing and action structure, you can have games where it feels like I haven&amp;rsquo;t accomplished much by then. Usually this creates a bit of snowball effect as well - the player who gets his act together earlier will tend to pull ahead and be difficult to catch up to. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComebackMechanic&#34;&gt;comeback mechanism&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;rsquo;re missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The display is literally just the actual board, and the camera can be a bit finicky sometimes. In my last game I accidentally rotated the view and took a minute to figure out how to get it back. The UI is also fairly sparse and a lot of information or options can be hidden in the weirdest places. Like, figuring out where your faction is allowed to cross rivers can be challenging for new players. I&amp;rsquo;ve attached some screenshots to this post, but they&amp;rsquo;re nothing special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably just relevant to my playgroup, but because of the slow pace, we tend to play a second metagame on top of the endgame scoring, where we consider the player who has spent the least amount of time on his turns (as seen via the turn clock) as &amp;ldquo;winning by time&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the digital board games we&amp;rsquo;ve played, this is the one where we have the least amount of playtime. Unsurprising given how slow the pace is and how difficult it is. For this reason, I think it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to recommend to any boardgame newbies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Last week of February is about to start. Time flies, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Texas (and other parts of the southern US I guess) have been hit by heavy winter storms, with accompanying power grid failures and such. We have some relatives there so it&amp;rsquo;s a concern. Meanwhile, their governor falsely blames renewables for the power problems and their senator went to Cancun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.platformer.news/p/facebook-calls-australias-bluff&#34;&gt;Facebook cut off Australian news links&lt;/a&gt;. I think both sides of these are dumb, but that is the big tech controversy of the week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NASA has landed &lt;a href=&#34;https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/&#34;&gt;the Perseverance rover on Mars!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsurprisingly, we still do not have vaccines in this country.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a bunch of family and medical stuff to do this coming week, so I don&amp;rsquo;t expect to be very productive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had a &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/02/1362173871806287872/&#34;&gt;Globe fiber internet outage&lt;/a&gt; last week, starting Tuesday afternoon until Thursday morning. So I spent all of Ash Wednesday without internet, which is appropriate as a bit of &lt;em&gt;penitencia&lt;/em&gt; I guess. Spent the downtime complaining at their customer support account, and also reading and playing offline things. I thought about writing a post about their customer service, but it was an actual outage that affected a bunch of people in the area, and the customer service can&amp;rsquo;t really do much about that, so it seems a bit mean to pile on now that the service has been restored (and I seem to have gotten a rebate for the lost days). Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll still write the post, we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caught up with B99 up to season 7. Looks like the final season might not come out until 2022 though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went ahead and finished The Expanse season 5 yesterday. Overall the season wasn&amp;rsquo;t as exciting as some of the earlier ones, but still pretty good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; ended on another cliffhanger this week as usual, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big surprise for me, given everyone on reddit had been predicting it. Two eps to go, hoping for a strong finish!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I played a lot of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/Kaldheim&#34;&gt;Kaldheim limited this week&lt;/a&gt;, drafts at first as usual, then I did some sealeds to prep for the Arena Open, which I also did as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/02/1363386731240726533/&#34;&gt;season finale&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmU0vkKslGXgza5YFq3PfZZGHwyRIYYU-&#34;&gt;Kaldheim limited youtube playlist&lt;/a&gt;. I enjoyed this format, though I wasn&amp;rsquo;t super good at it (mostly my fault, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t really read up on pick orders and such early on). It&amp;rsquo;s fun and challenging. Looking forward to Strixhaven!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks to our internet outage, I finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/922710/Knightin/&#34;&gt;Knightin&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;! There&amp;rsquo;s a couple of achievements I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten which I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;ll bother - they&amp;rsquo;re for doing a speedrun and a no-death run, both of which I can probably do with a bit of practice, but not sure it&amp;rsquo;s worth it. I did like the game though, I might write a short review this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run still in progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks to our internet outage, I finished reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/walkaway/&#34;&gt;Cory Doctorow&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Walkaway&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Also started reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://scottberkun.com/the-ghost-of-my-father/&#34;&gt;Scott Berkun&amp;rsquo;s Ghost of my Father&lt;/a&gt;, which turned out to be a quick read, will probably finish it tonight or tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;penultimate WandaVision ep!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Street Fighter 6 first drop for season 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Civ6 New Frontier Pass free update for February (improved Barbarians mode!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Superman and Lois premiering this week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holiday on Thursday! (EDSA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AboutQuiz league season finale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;various family celebrations and medical errands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Book Review: Walkaway by Cory Doctorow
</title>

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/book-review-walkaway-by-cory-doctorow/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Walkaway-Novel-Cory-Doctorow-ebook/dp/B01FQQ47OC/&#34;&gt;Walkaway&lt;/a&gt; is a novel by blogger Cory Doctorow. It tells the story of a near-future world and a trend of people going &amp;ldquo;walkaway&amp;rdquo;. This term means walking away from what they call &amp;ldquo;default society&amp;rdquo;, characterized by late stage capitalism, massive inequality, ever-present surveillance, and a world controlled by what they call the zottarich, or simply zottas. Not too far from our own present reality of course. Later, the novel also delves into the near-future (?) concept of humans being to upload their consciousness into machines, effectively allowing them to cheat death by running as a &amp;ldquo;brain in a jar&amp;rdquo; on a cluster of computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going walkaway means giving everything up and deciding to live communally and off the land, as it were. This near-future world makes this possible due to the abundance of materials and equipment that have been left behind or abandoned due to failed cities, institutions or companies. Resources that are presumably being wasted or going unused because of insane things like copyright controls, patents, and so on. Walkaways are shown building entire communities by sending out drones to seek out and gather nearby raw materials and constructing machines like fabricators that can spin out food and clothing, all powered by open source code that is freely shared and improved upon by walkaways worldwide via a highly distributed and decentralized walkaway network. &amp;ldquo;Default&amp;rdquo; society and media portray walkaways as anarchists and terrorists, living on the fringe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot centers upon a small group of twenty-somethings (including one zotta heiress) who initially flirt with the idea of going walkaway, and then decide to jump right in. Under that thin veneer, the novel feels mostly like an opportunity to explore how such an idea could work, and how it could bridge the gap between our current society and an idealized future, post-scarcity and even post-human. That gap is not bridged easily of course. Discoveries in walkaway culture and science such as human mind uploads threaten to overturn the &amp;lsquo;default&amp;rsquo; society and thus draws the ire of the zottas, who send in mercenaries and even armies to disrupt, arrest, and take down walkaways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author is a blogger I&amp;rsquo;ve known about for a while, and his interest in various kinds of technology and possible future applications to help supplant late-stage capitalism are made obvious through the novel. I initially thought it was being a bit too preachy and idealistic about walkaway culture being the right path for humanity. The story argues that there is plenty to go around, and that people shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be coerced to work and should have an abundance mentality, freely helping and giving away to others, something that works in the novel because of the existence of fabricators and the apparent abundance of raw materials, but which I am unsure would be true in the real world. This is why we still have a lot of people arguing against things like UBI and so on. The novel anchors itself from a point where the scarcity issue is mostly addressed, what&amp;rsquo;s left is to overcome the regressive &amp;ldquo;default&amp;rdquo; capitalist systems holding us back from a brighter future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kind of find myself aligned with the author in terms of ideology; I am very much hoping we as a society find a way past the perils of capitalism, but I&amp;rsquo;m not yet so optimisci that it could work. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure whether the story should be classified as a dystopia - it certainly describes a very dystopian status quo, but that status quo is not too far from our current one. And ultimately, despite all the trials and tribulations our walkaway protagonists are subject to, the novel still exudes optimism about humanity&amp;rsquo;s future. So, a hopeful dystopia, a dystopia that can be defeated? A dystopia that is merely a stepping stone towards what the walkaways call &amp;ldquo;the first days of a better nation&amp;quot;

            <title>Digital Boardgames Review: Sentinels of the Multiverse
</title>

            <pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2021 07:34:18 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do reviews of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/337150/Sentinels_of_the_Multiverse/&#34;&gt;Sentinels of the Multiverse&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ve played the IRL boardgame of it before during one of our sporadic in-person meetups. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, it&amp;rsquo;s a comics-themed coop game where up to 4 people play as a group of heroes to beat a villain (basically comic book shenanigans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a large variety of heroes available to play, each with unique abilities and play styles. Some of them are straightforward and some are super complicated and fiddly to play. The villains you have to beat vary from super simple to really difficult, with advanced variants for even more challenge. The game also provides a &amp;ldquo;weekly one-shot&amp;rdquo; challenge which provides a fixed scenario/villain and set of heroes to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve played a lot of games of Sentinels, and probably only won something like 60-70% of them. Each game takes around an hour or so, maybe more if it was super difficult. Usually we lose when we choose some combination of random heroes just to try them out then get beaten terribly by the villain. Then we go on a revenge run using one of the simpler heroes like Legacy or Tachyon (or we just put in a healer like Dr Medico).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digital version has the advantage that it automates a lot of the ability triggers and checks that the boardgame requires, which would usually be a lot of work. On the other hand, it has a UX disadvantage for those scenarios where an ability triggers multiple times and you want to make the same decision every time. In the real board game, you can just handwave it off by saying &amp;ldquo;Ok, we choose X is every time&amp;rdquo;, but in the digital version you have to click through every confirmation dialog every time.&lt;/p&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#9b343c2c14c495c5a8dd6b1afec25ba2-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/digital-boardgames-review-sentinels-of-the-multiverse/sentinels_hu55ebca5d49dfa13d3a35dca65e2ada62_322159_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;9b343c2c14c495c5a8dd6b1afec25ba2-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/digital-boardgames-review-sentinels-of-the-multiverse/sentinels.jpg&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;15 Feb 2021 7:34am&#34;&gt;15 Feb 2021 7:34am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game&amp;rsquo;s aesthetic is very much classic comic books, even multiplayer games are joined by entering a code in the format of a comic book issue like &amp;ldquo;Justice Comics #153&amp;rdquo;. The art isn&amp;rsquo;t the most elaborate and could be better; in fact, they are planning a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/27/22250963/sentinels-of-the-multiverse-definitive-kickstarter-street-date-price&#34;&gt;Definitive Edition of the boardgame&lt;/a&gt; that has even better art that is closer to the old-school comic book aesthetic. It looks like a signficant upgrade, so I expect if they ever release a digital version of the new version it would be a completely new game on Steam. Our group has enjoyed our Sentinels games though, so I fully expect we will be getting the new Steam version when it does come out.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trump has been acquitted in his second impeachment trial, proving yet again to the world that the US is a flawed democracy dominated by corruption at the highest levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duterte says &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/duterte-cannot-afford-be-brave-in-mouth-against-china&#34;&gt;he cannot be brave in the mouth against China&lt;/a&gt;. Back before the 2016 elections, somebody I used to know claimed that we needed a &amp;ldquo;rottweiler&amp;rdquo; like Duterte as president because he would be tough against China. I remember this sometimes and laugh and then am also sad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A couple of Zelda-themed videos I enjoyed for some reason:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wsi1IbjPAkM&#34;&gt;Life as a Bokoblin - A Zelda Nature Documentary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDPRwLlpdTU&#34;&gt;The Legend of Beavis&lt;/a&gt;. This one is super dumb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this &lt;a href=&#34;https://cosmicdirtbag.com/2020/12/07/crop-circles-part-01/&#34;&gt;short webcomic series about crop circles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smolcss.dev/&#34;&gt;Smolcss.dev&lt;/a&gt;: Minimal snippets for modern CSS layouts and components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For everyone who likes NPM, there was this &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610&#34;&gt;fun story this week&lt;/a&gt; about attacking private source code repos by creating public versions of their private dependencies, so that NPM would pull those new public versions instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/books/a35118667/how-to-write-a-novel/&#34;&gt;How to Write a Novel, According to 10 Really Good Novelists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275441/jack-dorsey-decentralized-app-store-algorithms&#34;&gt;Twitter&amp;rsquo;s Jack Dorsey imagines a decentralized app store for social media algorithms&lt;/a&gt;. The article is sparse on details and I don&amp;rsquo;t know how accurate it is, but I do like the idea, if only because I hope somebody implements just the chronological timeline algorithm everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still working on that secret thing I&amp;rsquo;m learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote a bunch of actual non-weeknotes &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/blog/&#34;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt; last week, so go check them out! Or don&amp;rsquo;t, I&amp;rsquo;m not your mother.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily sketches still ongoing in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt;, somehow still managing to keep up. I make no pretense that the sketches are actually good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching a lot of old Brooklyn Nine-Nine eps, still haven&amp;rsquo;t caught up to the latest season already on Netflix. Was announced last week that the next season, only 10 eps, will be the last one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also started trying to catch up on The Expanse. This series is so hard to binge because each episode feels so heavy and dense I feel like I need time to absorb and reflect. Would have been perfect to be watching the eps weekly as they drop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; on the other hand continues to be really effective/frustrating with their cliffhangers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/f9e8b66a362f9a61612057f4db10b9cf/&#34;&gt;This note&lt;/a&gt; summarizes how I feel about these three shows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/Kaldheim&#34;&gt;Kaldheim drafts are continuing&lt;/a&gt;, although I find I&amp;rsquo;m much worse at this than Zendikar Rising. Despite being so terrible, I am considering throwing gems away on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/announcing-february-2021-arena-open-2021-02-10&#34;&gt;Sealed Arena Open next weekend&lt;/a&gt;, seems like it could be fund (although there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance of instant regret!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s this small indie game I bought a while back called &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/922710/Knightin/&#34;&gt;Knightin&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, I tried it a bit, kinda neat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Been getting back into Fire Emblem Three Heroes, on my second run at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Couple of gaming things this week that I&amp;rsquo;m interested in:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Street Fighter V made their initial previews for the first drop in season 5. The season pass includes something that lets me random select on ranked! I&amp;rsquo;d love to that, and I&amp;rsquo;d love to play more SF5 despite being so trash at it, except the real problem is I find it so hard to find online matches (possibly because I&amp;rsquo;m so bronze tier). Still, tempted to get this pass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser&amp;rsquo;s Fury for Switch released this week. Was initially not interested since I already finished 3D World on WiiU, but I saw a preview that made Bowser&amp;rsquo;s Fury look like a significant addition, so now I am once again waffling about whether to throw money Nintendo&amp;rsquo;s way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Still reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Walkaway-Novel-Cory-Doctorow-ebook/dp/B01FQQ47OC/&#34;&gt;Cory Doctorow&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Walkaway&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt; We were terrible in this week&amp;rsquo;s About Quiz, mostly due to the abundance of PH-local questions which we always find difficult. We finished second last, but I think we still manage to retain first place in the league, by a razor-thin margin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started to use an electric massager and doing arm rotations and other weird exercises to help loosen up my left shoulder and maybe regain flexibility and alleviate muscle pains. Here&amp;rsquo;s to hoping it works!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My eyes are a bit tired. Quite possibly from playing too much Fire Emblem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward-to-this-coming-week&#34;&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yet another WandaVision ep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new One Piece later today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think we should also be getting details on the next Civ6 New Frontier Pass drop next week? It should just be a free update for this month though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oh Ash Wednesday is this week, I wonder if they&amp;rsquo;ll provide an alternative for people who still don&amp;rsquo;t want to go to the actual church&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Lauren R. O&amp;rsquo;Connor &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/the-bts-effect/on-pleasure-510c9795bff4&#34;&gt;talks about a childhood lesson about pleasure&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was eight years old, I saw the movie Back to the Future for the first time, and I fell in love. All I wanted to think and talk about was Back to the Future. I dreamt about Back to the Future at night. I rode my bike down the steepest hill in my neighborhood and pretended I was flying, approaching 88 mph, about to zap myself back in time. I was ecstatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then my mother told me to stop talking about Back to the Future. “Other people are going to think it’s weird,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned three things from this interaction: one, it is bad to be really interested in things; two, if I was really interested in something, I should therefore hide it; and three, my mother cared more about me being normal than about me being happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to blame the parent for this sort of interaction, as most likely they grew up in the sort of society that routinely punished noncomformity (or weirdness). Luckily, in today&amp;rsquo;s modern society, there&amp;rsquo;s less pressure to be ashamed of the things that give us joy, since the online communities make it easier to connect with people who share similar interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The linked post above goes on to talking about how as an adult, she learned to find joy through her fandom of the South Korean group BTS. I have no interest in such things myself, but I follow a few people on Twitter who are unashamedly fans and they will sometimes Tweet something like &amp;ldquo;sorry to my followers for all the spam&amp;rdquo;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my view, such apologies shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be necessary. Social media is a public platform where you&amp;rsquo;re free to follow and unfollow as you wish. If you choose to follow someone, obviously you think some percentage of what they say will be of interest to you, but you should also accept that they aren&amp;rsquo;t the exact same person you are and they may have other interests and they will talk about what they want to talk about. If the volume is unsatisfactory to you, feel free to unfollow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this same reason, I dislike it when people complain to other people on Twitter in the vein of &amp;ldquo;I followed you for $TOPIC, please stop talking $OTHERTOPIC&amp;rdquo;. (Usually $OTHERTOPIC is something like politics.) Basically &amp;ldquo;stay in your lane.&amp;rdquo; People are complete people and not just whatever aspect you happen to enjoy. Let them enjoy what they enjoy and talk about what they want to talk about, and just unfollow if it&amp;rsquo;s too much for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be ashamed to talk about things you enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Obviously, as long as you&amp;rsquo;re not hurting other people. &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/02/be-excellent-to-each-other/&#34;&gt;Be excellent to each other.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Decentralization
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/decentralization/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2021 05:50:47 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/decentralization/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Will Schreiber argues that &lt;a href=&#34;https://secondbreakfast.co/decentralization-is-a-narrative-mirage&#34;&gt;decentralization is a narrative mirage&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human history is a story of increasing centralization. From roaming the plains of Africa, to settling down and building homes, to buying food in central markets, to instituting courts of law. Progression is compression. &lt;em&gt;How can I make it so everybody isn’t making their own shirts? Deciding their own justice? Tabulating their own spreadsheets?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve argued a few times on here in favor of decentralization (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/03/rethinking-facebook/&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/08/blogging-and-the-decentralized-internet/&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/tech-censorship/&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;), and the whole concept of movements like &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/&#34;&gt;Indieweb&lt;/a&gt; is a preference for a decentralized internet where everyone has his or her own personal site, instead of reliance on centralized large silos like Facebook or Twitter or whatever. In fact, I still believe in that ideal for the internet as it was conceived. (See also: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/badnetworker/status/1133363823728091136&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;four websites, each filled with screenshots of the other three&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I can see Will&amp;rsquo;s point. Human history definitely means we trend towards centralization in the long term. (Although our cultural and nationalistic differences are still too wide to tend towards centralized government for the planet&amp;hellip;) Still, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean there isn&amp;rsquo;t room for decentralized networks to also still exist, perhaps on the fringe. After all, not everyone wants to live in the big cities, there are still people who like growing their own food, people who prefer independent films over the ones made by big blockbuster conglomerates, people who want to support the small mom-and-pop stores over the big retail chains, etc. Even as culture and society consolidate and centralize, counter-cultures can still exist and even thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just because things towards centralized platforms doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we have to accept the current platforms as the end state, we can still ask for something better. If the analogy was to compare online platform centralization to the tendency towards people living in large metropolitan areas, then something like Facebook could be considered analogous to the worst of industrialized cities: over-populated, polluted, scammers and other shady characters abound trying to see if they can make a quick buck off of you, strangers shouting at each other, law enforcement going after you for arbitrary reasons, and so on. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be like this. The same way we are trying to have better, well-designed cities with better, cleaner systems to better support populations at scale, we also need to work hard to have better centralized silos and platforms, ones that work for us instead of against us. If we have to in a city, it might as well be a good city.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://austinkleon.com/2021/02/05/the-trouble-with-months/&#34;&gt;post from Austin Kleon&lt;/a&gt; reminded me of the proposed conceptual international fixed calendar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#7cc898702713b94181212f6df6399250-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/irregular-calendars/international_fixed_calendar_hu709de347feffee9520e31c9354aeb8b2_68948_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;7cc898702713b94181212f6df6399250-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/irregular-calendars/international_fixed_calendar.jpeg&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;11 Feb 2021 1:53am&#34;&gt;11 Feb 2021 1:53am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically: each year would be 13 months of 28 days each, plus a bonus day at the end of each year, for a total of 365 days. This way, the first day of each month would always be a Sunday, the 2nd would always be a Monday, the 3rd a Tuesday, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered this idea before and I do understand the appeal of the regularity, especially from an engineering perspective. But after living through the last year of the pandemic and the lockdown where every day, week, and month passed feeling more or less the same, I now feel like having every month be the same might not be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine, under this scenario: Christmas and other holidays would always fall on the same day every year; If you were born on a Wednesday, your birthday would be on a Wednesday every year. You&amp;rsquo;d never get a weekend birthday party! Also, imagine all the date processing code us programmers would have to rewrite!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem likely that we&amp;rsquo;d ever change our calendar system, it seems far too ingrained in us culturally. Even if humanity eventually expands to the stars and forgot all about Earth&amp;rsquo;s 365 days, we&amp;rsquo;d probably still be wondering whether February of the current year has 29 days or only 28. The only way our calendars would ever change would probably if we met an alien civilization with a completely different culture and thus need a common standard for datekeeping.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A while back I wrote about how &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/08/podcasts-audiobooks-newsletters/#newsletters&#34;&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big fan of the recent trend of newsletters&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized Substack actually publishes RSS feeds for their newsletters, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been following a a bit more of them. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d recommend a few that I&amp;rsquo;ve found to be quite interesting/useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine&#34;&gt;Money Stuff&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/matt_levine&#34;&gt;Matt Levine&lt;/a&gt;. The only non-substack entry on today&amp;rsquo;s list, this Bloomberg column covers financial matters like stock market and investment stuff. (It was certainly useful when following the whole Reddit/Gamestop stock market saga!) Levine likes to go in-depth and long-form, so his columns are usually quite long and cover multiple topics. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that this kind of thing isn&amp;rsquo;t really my specialty, and most of the time I have trouble even getting to the end of any single entry without my eyes glazing over, but I do feel like I learn a lot every time and I hope to someday finish a column claiming I fully understand it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://noahpinion.substack.com/&#34;&gt;Noahpinion&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/noahpinion&#34;&gt;Noah Smith&lt;/a&gt;. Noah Smith writes mostly about economics and US politics. The articles are fairly in-depth (not as much as Money Stuff), and I&amp;rsquo;ve found them generally informative and educational on topics I&amp;rsquo;m not especially familiar with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.todayintabs.com/&#34;&gt;Today in Tabs&lt;/a&gt; by Rusty Foster. I used to consider myself &amp;ldquo;extremely online&amp;rdquo; and aware of most everything on the internet. That might have been true back in 2010, back before all these youngsters came online and added all their vlogs and tiktoks and whatnot. This newsletter (and the next one) helps me keep up with all of the modern internet&amp;rsquo;s day-to-day nonsense. Each issue of Today in Tabs is dense and jam-packed with a whole bunch of recent cool internet things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.garbageday.email&#34;&gt;Garbage Day&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/broderick&#34;&gt;Ryan Broderick&lt;/a&gt;. I first encountered this newsletter when someone shared his &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.garbageday.email/p/everything-you-need-to-know-about&#34;&gt;article giving an explainer about the Tumblr subculture&lt;/a&gt;. It covers a variety of internet-focused topics, but each issue focuses on less&amp;hellip; things than Today In Tabs, albeit covering each item with just a bit more depth. Together, both newsletters give me a good idea of what&amp;rsquo;s happening on the internet on a regular basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://vicki.substack.com/&#34;&gt;Normcore Tech&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/vboykis&#34;&gt;Vicki Boykis&lt;/a&gt;. The author&amp;rsquo;s background is in data science, and from their own description, the newsletter offers &amp;ldquo;takes on tech news that are rooted in humanism, nuance, context, rationality, and a little fun&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t write a better explanation than that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

            <description>
            
            

    On 
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/23ef43058c482c829265e01e331d53c2/&#34;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&#34;2021-02-03 15:11:53&#34;&gt;3 Feb 2021 3:11pm&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    I wrote:
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Please write more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just on social media, FB, Twitter, whatever. Write on your own sites and blogs. On your tumblrs, wordpresses, whatever. Long-form, rambling, incessant. The world could use more sincere blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

        






    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above was written mostly as a response to finding &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/link-rot/#2&#34;&gt;so many of my friends&amp;rsquo; old and inactive blogs in my RSS reader&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the term I coined there, &amp;ldquo;sincere blogging&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;d define it as any blogging that isn&amp;rsquo;t for any kind of commercial purpose like for selling something or to generate ad revenue. Sincere blogging can be intended as informative or aspirational or purely for self-expression, as long as it&amp;rsquo;s not mainly commercial in purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it served as reminder to me, as I haven&amp;rsquo;t been writing here as often as I could have. I feel like in the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve filtered my writing a bit by only writing blog posts when I feel like I have something longish or elaborate or profound to say, and that led to making it harder to write posts when I was low on energy or whatever. Most probably a consequence of the proliferation of microblogging, as if a post needed to justify it&amp;rsquo;s length so that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get relegated to the ranks of &amp;ldquo;notes&amp;rdquo;. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been restricting myself to at most one post a day, which is a bit arbitrary and entire meaningless. So, let&amp;rsquo;s change all that, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping. I should be free to post more than once if I want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am with my nonsense again, if you&amp;rsquo;ll have me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Not like I ever left, mind you&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Year Without Pants&amp;rdquo; is a book by writer Scott Berkun about his time as a team lead at Wordpress.com back in 2010-2012. This book came out in 2013, and the conceit of the book back then was that Wordpress.com, run by Automattic, was a fully remote company, something that was still a rarity at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s weird reading this book in the context of the current pandemic, where remote work is now the norm among tech companies. So one of the things I like about the book is it&amp;rsquo;s kind of a time capsule back to an era when remote work was a novelty and not an everyday part of our modern dystopia. That and the stories about the culture at Automattic and Wordpress, arguably one of the main drivers of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/blogging/&#34;&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt; phenomenon at its peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wordpress.com was a force back in the day, and maybe it still is, as Wordpress still powers a good number of sites online I think. I&amp;rsquo;d be eager to read an updated take on what life is like at Automattic/Wordpress.com these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t really recommended the book to anyone who isn&amp;rsquo;t interested in the internet history and the whole tech side of it, but if that&amp;rsquo;s you, it&amp;rsquo;s an entertaining enough read.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h4 id=&#34;1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while now, I&amp;rsquo;d been meaning to go through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/links/&#34;&gt;links section&lt;/a&gt; of this site and clean up/organize all the bookmarks I&amp;rsquo;ve logged there over the years (first via &lt;a href=&#34;https://del.icio.us/&#34;&gt;delicious&lt;/a&gt; and later via &lt;a href=&#34;https://getpocket.com/&#34;&gt;pocket&lt;/a&gt;). One of the first things I had to do was to go through and identify any broken links. So I wrote a quick Python script to ping the URLs and it turns out there were a lot of them, unsurprising given the archives go back to 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not happy with it, but I know link rot is a natural part of the internet, especially as time goes by. Websites fall out of maintenance, run out of funding, get restructured and so on, and the links to those pages break and rot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of link rot is proportional to age: almost half of all the links back in 2004 are now inaccessible, and the percentage drops quickly as we get back to modern day:&lt;/p&gt;

class=&#34;keyText&#34;&gt;Broken links&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been meaning to update the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/blogroll/&#34;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt; on the site, since I haven&amp;rsquo;t added things there in a while. So I went through the good old RSS reader to find items to add to the blogroll, and I noted with sadness a number of blogs from old friends/people I knew who were still on my follows and were no longer active. But at least they were still there and I can still revisit all their old posts and thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse than the inactive ones are those that are no longer accessible at all, either because their domains were no longer renewed, or their accounts on platforms like wordpress.com have been deactivated. Just another form of link rot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s one of the disadvantages of the whole &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/personal-domain&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;owning your personal domain&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; principle promoted by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/&#34;&gt;Indieweb&lt;/a&gt;. Domains require maintenance, which means money, and which also means such personal sites can easily fall out of maintenance and thus contribute to link rot. Granted, running your website on one of the silos has no guarantees either (see: Geocities), but at least those silos have more resources than any individual and are likely to give you a chance to archive your data before they shut down, if ever. (Well, IDK if Parler let their users do that&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Link rot is one of the reasons that when I no longer use Twitter embeds on this site, since if the source tweet is deleted or the account gets banned or goes private, the embed breaks (and back when I was using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; it would even break the build completely)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Link rot is inevitable, as I said. It&amp;rsquo;s part of the nature of the internet. Despite services such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/&#34;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s probably impossible to keep the entire web of the internet online at the same time. Links will break and rot as time goes by. Maybe trying to avoid link rot completely is an impossible ideal, akin to wishing people never die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I guess that it&amp;rsquo;s also a bit selfish of me to want everything to be preserved no matter what. People have a right to want their content off the internet or be private if that&amp;rsquo;s what they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for my own content, I am well aware of my own mortality, and hope all this nonsense I write, such as it is can somehow survive beyond me. Aside from my current hosting, a mirror of all the site content is currently published to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/&#34;&gt;mirror.roytang.net&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, that&amp;rsquo;s still under my domain, so if I ever slip and lose the domain, or if I kick the bucket, it won&amp;rsquo;t be accessible either. But at least all my content exists in source form on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/roytang/blog/&#34;&gt;github repo for this blog&lt;/a&gt;. And a good chunk of that has already been preserved in &lt;a href=&#34;https://archiveprogram.github.com/&#34;&gt;Github&amp;rsquo;s Arctic Code Vault&lt;/a&gt;, so at the very least if all of humanity perishes, some record of me personally may still survive.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s February! We are nearing the one year anniversary of being in the longest covid19 lockdown in the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Myanmar&amp;rsquo;s military staged a coup, and have apparently cut off the country from the internet, maybe? Last night during an international voice chat, the two of us who were in the Philippines were suddenly dropped/disconnected and one of my first thoughts were &amp;ldquo;Wait, is there a coup happening in our country RIGHT NOW?&amp;rdquo; Luckily no, it was just the typical bad internet we have here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In local news: &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1392144/fwd-media-orgs-groups-call-out-parlade-for-remarks-vs-inquirer-net-reporter-shows-perils-of-anti-terror-act&#34;&gt;Red-tagging&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1392466/manigas-kayong-lahat-roque-touts-duterte-for-infrastructure-success-beating-covid-19&#34;&gt;immature public officials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1392786/go-says-duterte-also-against-imposing-child-car-seat-law-at-the-moment&#34;&gt;people objecting to laws due to poorly-thought of implementation rules&lt;/a&gt;, etc. So, same-same. Oh, also the anti-terror law challenged in the Supreme Court, and Napoles finally convicted of the pork barrel scam after a five-year trial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like noting down these current events in the weeknotes because they help future me frame my personal happenings around what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the world, but in a way &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/1358305512517849089/&#34;&gt;it can get exhausting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing for today, I&amp;rsquo;ll post some stuff later this week, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have been busy for the past week, mostly learning a thing that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about right now. So I haven&amp;rsquo;t been wandering the internets that much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily sketches still ongoing in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gurren Lagann&lt;/strong&gt; was added to Netflix! I watched the first few episodes, the series is as insane as I remember. It has English dubs, so I can watch it in the background (since I&amp;rsquo;ve already seen it before), but I have a bunch of other stuff to watch, so we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; episode 5 was fantastic. It also may or may not be a BIG DEAL (tm). We&amp;rsquo;ll see. I was a bit annoyed that this was a weekly show, but the reality is that their cliffhangers wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been as effective (or generated as much discussion/hype) if all the episodes came in one drop, so I guess it&amp;rsquo;s okay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On a whim, I decided to watch the &lt;strong&gt;Royal Rumble&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s so weird since their events have virtual audiences (with the wall of faces). Also like 1/3 to 1/2 of the actual Rumble participants have been around since forever, and in fact the current winner Edge won the Rumble for the first time 11 years ago to the day (which, together with him starting at #1, was a pretty strong hint he&amp;rsquo;d be winning). Not sure if I&amp;rsquo;d watch Wrestlemania in two months, since I don&amp;rsquo;t really follow anymore and I&amp;rsquo;m not really invested in the storylines or anything, but they really do a pretty good job of recapping storylines, feuds, etc in the events themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Humble Choice is out and includes &lt;strong&gt;Valkyria Chronicles 4&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Endless Space 2&lt;/strong&gt;, which seem like good picks for me, so I&amp;rsquo;m probably getting it. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2009/01/valkyria-chronicles/&#34;&gt;played the first Valkyria Chronicles more than a decade ago&lt;/a&gt; and I was surprised to know there&amp;rsquo;d already been 3 sequels, so looking forward to this one. Endless Space looks like my kind of jam as well. What? Backlog? What&amp;rsquo;s that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have already drafted a bit of &lt;strong&gt;Kaldheim&lt;/strong&gt; on Magic Arena. It&amp;rsquo;s proving to be a rather fun format, and I did already get my first 7-x run on the third try. Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/Kaldheim&#34;&gt;Kaldheim tag&lt;/a&gt; for details/VODs/etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Finished Scott Berkun&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Year-Without-Pants-WordPress-com-Future/dp/1118660633&#34;&gt;The Year Without Pants&lt;/a&gt;, review sometime this week. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what to read next, so I just sat down and scrolled through the files in my Kindle til I decided on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Walkaway-Novel-Cory-Doctorow-ebook/dp/B01FQQ47OC/&#34;&gt;Cory Doctorow&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Walkaway&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt; Hey, we somehow managed to win this week&amp;rsquo;s AboutQuiz, so we are back on top of the league standings, I think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muscle pains in my left upper arm/shoulder seem to be more prevalent. Not more painful or anything, but like, easier to trigger at random angles so now I find myself wincing a lot. And the arm has a lot less flexibility when doing something like reaching behind me or such. At this point I should probably get a massage or something to try to fix it, but that would mean interacting with a stranger!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward-to-this-coming-week&#34;&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as always (at least until March), more WandaVision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new One Piece later today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s February tomorrow! Somehow, the world still turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somehow the most viral world news this week doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have been about any kind of politics, but rather about capitalism. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1354670019045584899/&#34;&gt;Gamestop/stock market brouhaha&lt;/a&gt; was a sage of retail investors on reddit going head-to-head with hedge funds over the stock price of a dying gaming company (among others) that dominated most of my feeds for the week. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a lot more compliced than that. If you want a more in-depth look, I recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine&#34;&gt;Matt Levine&amp;rsquo;s Money Stuff column over on Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, he covered the whole thing for most of the week. You can start &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-25/the-game-never-stops&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tony Hawk, age 52, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tonyhawk/status/1354305117982400514&#34;&gt;can still hit a 720&lt;/a&gt;, probably his last one ever. I think it&amp;rsquo;d kind of a bittersweet blessing to be doing something you love and knowing that it&amp;rsquo;s going to be the last time you get to do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/crossover-project/are-we-really-engineers/&#34;&gt;excellent series of posts by Hillel Wayne&lt;/a&gt; comparing software engineering to other engineering disciplines by interviewing people who have crossed over from other fields into ours. It addresses interesting questions like whether what we do can really be called &amp;ldquo;engineering&amp;rdquo; and what can software engineering and other engineering fields learn from each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kottke.org/21/01/usa-downgraded-from-democracy-to-anocracy-part-democracy-and-part-dictatorship&#34;&gt;USA has been downgraded from a democracy to an anocracy&lt;/a&gt;. This was the first time I heard of this term, anocracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.engadget.com/facebook-political-content-news-feed-mark-zuckerberg-232846266.html&#34;&gt;Facebook says they want to deprioritize political content&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ll see if that holds, given that generating political heat is good for their engagement metrics. But if such a thing were to happen (and applied to the PH), it would seriously reduce the reach of government propaganda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of Facebook, they appear to have recently &lt;a href=&#34;https://lincoln.metacannon.net/2021/01/facebook-disabled-my-account-after-i-criticized-them.html&#34;&gt;banned someone for criticizing them.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have yet to read through all of it, but there&amp;rsquo;s this metafilter thread full of all sorts of recommendations: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ask.metafilter.com/351766/What-do-you-always-recommend-to-people&#34;&gt;What do you always recommend to people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Chris Kiehl talks about &lt;a href=&#34;https://chriskiehl.com/article/thoughts-after-6-years&#34;&gt;software dev topics he&amp;rsquo;s changed his mind on after the last 6 years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rands talks about &lt;a href=&#34;https://randsinrepose.com/archives/doomscrolling-at-scale/&#34;&gt;doomscrolling at scale&lt;/a&gt; using Tweetdeck, an app &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always recommended&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The current US senate&amp;rsquo;s President pro tempore has &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/23/us/senator-patrick-leahy-batman-trnd/index.html&#34;&gt;appeared in multiple Batman movies&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily sketches in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt;, somehow I still haven&amp;rsquo;t fallen behind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started watching the current NCIS season (TIL Fez from That 70s Show is a cast regular there now!) and also a bunch of Mike Birbiglia standup specials on Netflix. I do have other more interesting series on my backlog to watch, but somehow I found myself falling back to procedurals and standup comedy. The main reason is that these things don&amp;rsquo;t require a lot of attention, so I can leave them running in the background while I do other things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will admit I was a bit meh on &lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; episodes 1-3 (and even for the rest of the MCU offerings this year), but episode 4 was just fantastic and has renewed my MCU hype. If they manage to hit this level of quality for their other series, we have a lot to look forward to. It makes me a bit sad that the Netflix series/Agents of SHIELD never received the kind of MCU integration these series are getting, but what can you do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of gaming for me this week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played three whole games of &lt;strong&gt;Civilization VI&lt;/strong&gt; over the past week, two of them before the latest New Frontier Pass drop even. I won one game with the new Civ Vietnam. (I &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFiA4HBCi8&#34;&gt;streamed a bit of this game&lt;/a&gt; if you want to watch me be dumb.) I&amp;rsquo;m glad I got one already, because I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;d play them again, as the terrain restrictions are very challenging. The Corporations mode is nice, but I feel like I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet maximized it too much. It does feel like I&amp;rsquo;ll be enabling this by default from now on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of reasons, I purchased a copy of &lt;strong&gt;Princess Maker 2 Refine&lt;/strong&gt; on Steam. I played a bunch of the original game back in the day, and it was weird reading through the old guides on GameFAQs and some of them would have advice on configuring old-timey things like &lt;code&gt;config.sys&lt;/code&gt; and such. Anyway, I played almost 5 hours of this in one session, which was really bad for my eyestrain. This was one of the first calendar-based life sims I played, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the reason I really enjoyed the Persona series? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why I found this game in particular so engaging, as it&amp;rsquo;s kind of like watching spreadsheet numbers go up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kaldheim&lt;/strong&gt; is out on Magic Arena! I only had time to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1355164547842248704/&#34;&gt;do a Sealed&lt;/a&gt; so far, but I expect to be drafting (and streaming on Twitch) a few times a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Still reading Scott Berkun&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Year-Without-Pants-WordPress-com-Future/dp/1118660633&#34;&gt;The Year Without Pants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finances:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t talk about my finances a lot in this space, but I will note that a couple of weeks ago I started investing in the US markets via an app called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.etoro.com/&#34;&gt;eToro&lt;/a&gt;. I got lucky with an initial trade that had a bit too much leverage for my taste, because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t reading too carefully. Luckily the NASDAQ spiked that day so I made it out with a bit of profit. I used a bit of that profit to buy-in a minimal amount of Gamestop, trying to cash in on the trend, unfortunately I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get in on a low price. Well, I can afford to risk (and lose) this profit, so that&amp;rsquo;s fine. I just hope the Gamestop thing doesn&amp;rsquo;t crash the markets entirely, that would be just my luck for such a thing to happen just when I started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt; We were still ahead in the AboutQuiz league going into this week&amp;rsquo;s Price is Right-themed game, but we only finished 5th this time, so IDK if that will still hold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a lot of family errands during the week as well, mostly financial stuff and helping my folks with medical appointments and such. I think this was the week where I had the most trips out of the house since the pandemic lockdowns began.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;site-updates&#34;&gt;Site updates:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you follow this site via an RSS/feed reader (both of you), you may want to know that I&amp;rsquo;ve added a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/daily/feed/&#34;&gt;daily feed&lt;/a&gt; to the site, it will cough up a single post per day with a summary of all the things I&amp;rsquo;ve posted for that day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward-to-this-coming-week&#34;&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new WandaVision episode!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a new thing I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to learn/get into, hoping to get started on it this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Wow, January is almost done. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biden inaugurated as US president, world celebrates US getting rid of Trump. Biden isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly unproblematic, but he is at least sane and boring. There will be time enough to criticize him later, for now let them be enjoy victory. My expectations of him are at least moderately higher than &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2017/01/822558467265335297/&#34;&gt;the ones I had for Trump&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the internet gets inundated with an inordinate amount of Bernie Sanders memes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;locally: the govt continues to bombard us with controversies, this time stirring up a red-tagging hornests nest by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/phkule/status/1351128229462028288&#34;&gt;abrogating the DND-UP accord&lt;/a&gt;, paving the way for militarization of campuses and stifling of free expression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone made &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJH_RbnrGUs&#34;&gt;a Mandalorian trailer in the style of old-school spaghetti westerns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like this &lt;a href=&#34;https://myk.ninja/loremen&#34;&gt;random lore generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote a bunch of words about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/tech-censorship/&#34;&gt;my thoughts on tech censorship and social media&lt;/a&gt;; there are some relevant links in there, if that kind of thing interests you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.idrlabs.com/difficult-person/test.php&#34;&gt;difficult person test&lt;/a&gt; did the rounds in some of my online groups this week (and sparked some silly discussions about gaming self-assessments)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wow, did I not internet that much or was the internet just boring this week? Boring can be good though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily sketches in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt;, ongoing, streak yet unbroken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1352137686614564867/&#34;&gt;World War Z&lt;/a&gt;, though I kinda wish I had seen it back at the start of the pandemic, seemed like it would have been appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WandaVision ep 3: So weird! I don&amp;rsquo;t mind the sitcom stuff, though I&amp;rsquo;m mostly here for the Marvel plots. The pacing is fine, with just enough easter eggs and plot teasing to not be annoying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kicked off a second run of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1349796416042856448/&#34;&gt;Fire Emblem Three Houses&lt;/a&gt;! Now in hard/classic, and going down the red/Black Eagle path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG: &lt;strong&gt;Kaldheim&lt;/strong&gt; previews are done, and set is out on Arena next week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular Saturday gaming group tried to do some Jackbox games via Discord, but we ran into audio issues, so we ended up just playing Sentinels and Root again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books: I finished reading Katie Mack&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;End of Everything&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;, here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/end-of-everything/&#34;&gt;a short review&lt;/a&gt;. For the next book, I started on Scott Berkun&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Year-Without-Pants-WordPress-com-Future/dp/1118660633&#34;&gt;The Year Without Pants&lt;/a&gt; of which I&amp;rsquo;ve had a copy forever. It&amp;rsquo;s about remote work back in the early 2010s, which is a fun contrast to our current remote work-heavy world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz: We actually won the online Wheel of Fortune-themed AboutQuiz the week before this (forgot to mention in last week&amp;rsquo;s notes), so we were defending champs in this week&amp;rsquo;s Weakest Link-themed quiz, but we were too conservative with our banks and only finished 3rd place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health: Still have muscle pains in my left upper bicep and shoulder, though they seem to be in different places compared to before? Am using this hand massager to massage the area occassionally while I&amp;rsquo;m at the computer, and still continuing the warm compress. Hoping this fixes it up soon, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to ask a stranger to come in and massage me or whatever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the first time since March, I put on pants! I had only been going out in shorts when going to the grocery or the nearby pharmacy, but this week I had to do an errand at a hospital a bit farther away, so I figured it would be a good time to figure out where my pants were. Hospital protocols were strict, as expected. We had to wait in like 3 different waiting areas before we could get to our appointment. This hospital was one of the hotspots back in the early days of the pandemic, so their vigilance is reassuring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PC died unexpectedly today. As in, lost power while I was using it and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t turn back on, power light just blinking. This has happened once before, towards the end of 2020. Back then I had tried unplugging the power supply and opening it up, then reconnecting to see what happened, and it just miraculously fixed itself. This time, I just unplugged the PS, then left it alone for a while. When I came back later and reconnected everything and booted up, it was fine. So I guess there&amp;rsquo;s some issue with the power supply? I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to upgrade just yet, although this rig is already more than 5 years old, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping I can get a couple more years out of it at least. (That and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to go to a shop to have one assembled during the pandemic, and I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna do the assembly myself.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I filled up an online application form for Quezon City&amp;rsquo;s new QC id, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how this goes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward-to-this-coming-week&#34;&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new WandaVision episode!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaldheim releases on Magic Arena!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new drop in Civ6&amp;rsquo;s New Frontier pack!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Thoughts on Tech Censorship and Social Media
</title>

            <pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/tech-censorship/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Discussions on tech censorship came to the forefront in recent weeks due to the aftermath of the Jan 6 capitol insurrection in the US. I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing down a bunch of thoughts about the complicated issue, let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can hammer them into a blog post. (I also wanted to defer posting about it until after the Biden inauguration, in case more things of interest happen.) Here&amp;rsquo;s where I am now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;trump&#34;&gt;Trump&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so first Trump (or anyone) getting kicked off Twitter (or any service) for TOS violations (inciting violence etc). it&amp;rsquo;s kind of a free speech issue, except the censorship is being done by a private entity, so it specifically doesn&amp;rsquo;t violate the US first amendment. I think that without question, I agree that social media platforms have a right to pick and choose what they allow on their platforms (except those that they aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to discriminate against, by law, like race, religion, etc). And Trump absolutely violated ToS by inciting the Jan 6 riots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are thinking this is a free speech issue because being deplatformed feels similar to being escorted off and banned from a public square. Of course, if you were on a public square goading people to raid govt buildings and kill elected officials, a lot of people would you want you dragged away from there anyway. That being said, I think the bigger issue is why have we these tech companies/platforms that are being treated as de facto public squares in the first place. It feels like we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have allowed them to grow to this size/amount of influence in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re on the fence as to whether this was a correct decision, there is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/misinformation-dropped-dramatically-the-week-after-twitter-banned-trump/ar-BB1cOqVP&#34;&gt;research that says misinformation dropped drastically after Twitter kicked off Trump&lt;/a&gt;, so that as you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll circle back to social media platforms/public square stuff in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;parler&#34;&gt;Parler&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Parler. In theory, Parler could have become a competing public square, in fact that&amp;rsquo;s one of the things it&amp;rsquo;s doing. But Parler itself has been deplatformed, not just by Google/Apple, but by the webhost, AWS. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any opinions either way about the app stores kicking them out (although I will say Apple is more egregious, since there&amp;rsquo;s no alternative to Apple&amp;rsquo;s app store on iOS), but AWS kicking them out seems more problematic. It is a bit analogous to a landlord kicking out a tenant from their building because they are doing illegal things, like maybe running a meth lab? So by that analogy it can be justified. Technically, the discussions on Parler aren&amp;rsquo;t directly violent, but they are planning violence. So, can a landlord evict a tenant because his space was being used to plot violence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the landlord analogy, they could always just find another landlord, but few compare in scale and capability to Amazon. So this may be another case of monopolies being problematic. They could also just host the content themselves, build their own datacenter etc. It&amp;rsquo;s akin to saying you can just buy/build your own house if no one is willing to let you rent one. It&amp;rsquo;s true, but not very pragmatic in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My gut is that AWS kicking Parler off was justified, because Parler wasn&amp;rsquo;t making a good-faith effort to manage harmful content on their platform, but it still leaves a worse taste in the mouth than the Trump/Twitter. scenario&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s super dumb to be planning these things in public anyway! Why don&amp;rsquo;t they get private forums, those are still things right? Or even a private FB group. Can FB ban them for discussions in a private group? Maybe. Or why don&amp;rsquo;t they all join those QAnon forums or whatever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-should-social-media-platforms-change&#34;&gt;How should social media platforms change?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circling back to my earlier assertion, I don&amp;rsquo;t think social media platforms should be liable for what their users post. To me, this seems sensible on its face, otherwise no one would bother hosting content posted by other people (which I don&amp;rsquo;t mind, I have a website.) I also think platforms are well within their rights to filter what is or is not allowed to be posted on their platforms. (See above.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(There&amp;rsquo;s a whole side discussion about section 230 of the US CDA where conservatives are thinking repealing platform protections provided by that law would step them from censoring people, but that seems completely wrong. I&amp;rsquo;m not an American though, so I don&amp;rsquo;t particularly care.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think however, that platforms should be held responsible for promoting, recommending or otherwise broadcasting harmful content via their algorithmic &amp;ldquo;timelines&amp;rdquo;, as that is more of an editorial decision than anything else. Think of it in terms of, if I was a content curator who recommended stuff to my followers, and I started recommending or promoting things illegal things like child porn or criminal stuff, I should absolutely be held accountable. The less that platforms promote harmful material, the less likely they are to gather steam and influece. Don&amp;rsquo;t give harmful people megaphones! &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hankgreen/status/1351736509095792640&#34;&gt;Related twitter thread I read recently talking about this very same thing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the platforms aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to use recommendation engines, what then? I would suggest that strictly chronological timelines should be fine, with no judgment made by the platform as to whether individual posts should be seen outside of that order or by people who aren&amp;rsquo;t subscribed to those sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ads, I think platforms should be liable for what ads they allow to run. And information should be publicly available for whoever paid for the ad. If someone advertises something illegal in real life, law enforcement needs to be able to track them down. And probably we should avoid targeted advertising as well. I think showing ads depending on what topics the user follows might be ok, assuming the topics aren&amp;rsquo;t super specific. For example, if the user follows a lot of politics, showing political ads might be ok, as long as the user is exposed to all flavors of political ads (i.e. ads from all sides). Definitely something that can still be refined. (And it goes without saying, if the platforms can&amp;rsquo;t do targeted advertising, they would be less inclined to siphon off all your personal data? Or is that too naive?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think stuff like Twitter&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;trending topics&amp;rdquo; section is fine, as long as it&amp;rsquo;s not super localized, i.e. you get a sense of what everyone is talking about, not just people in your bubble or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: I will agree not all algorithmic recommendations are bad. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching a lot of British TV show clips on Youtube recently, and YT keeps recommending more, so I watch more, and it&amp;rsquo;s fine, it&amp;rsquo;s entertaining. That said, I would willingly give up those recommendations in exchange for the above. After all, people can always curate and provide recommendations manually (and they can be held liable or banned if needed!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;regulation-and-monopolies&#34;&gt;Regulation and Monopolies&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately social media platforms aren&amp;rsquo;t likely to do the above changes on their own, as avoiding algorithmic recommendations cuts into their &amp;ldquo;engagement&amp;rdquo; or whatever BS metric they choose to use. So it would have to be enforced by some kind of government regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of talk about regulating big tech in the US government, but most of it centers on splitting up larger companies like Facebook and Google. I think that while this is not necessarily a wrong approach, it won&amp;rsquo;t be super useful. The monopoly power these large companies have doesn&amp;rsquo;t come directly from the services they offer but rather from the size of their userbase. (Which admittedly, is influenced by the services they offer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would suggest instead is to cut into that userbase monopoly by requiring the platforms to implement open standards for external services to subscribe/follow publicly-available content published on their platform. It can be something simple like RSS or something a bit more complicated like how Mastodon implements ActivityPub. Private comms/DMs can be via open protocols too like XMPP. (Or email! Remember email?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is, if I want to follow someone on Facebook, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to be required to have a Facebook account. This is part of the reason why so many people find it hard to leave Facebook - a lot of the people they follow and want to keep in touch with are there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t believe it would be necessary to require platforms to do the opposite thing - allow their users to follow users on other platforms - because users would just naturally prefer any platform that does implement such a feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requiring open protocols would remove the whole &amp;ldquo;public square&amp;rdquo; problem because now instead of having 1 or 2 de facto public squares, we can have as many as we want. Official government feeds could be hosted on their own servers instead of being forced to publish via Facebook or Twitter, and the public could still follow them from the platform of their choice. Same goes for influencers, brands, companies, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might think this would make it easier to distribute harmful content and harder to censor it, but as we can see on the open web, the opposite is true: harmful content is difficult to stumble upon normally (you have to be specifically looking for it) and can easily be punished, which is why we don&amp;rsquo;t see a lot of openly operating child porn websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;in-conclusion&#34;&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a whole lot of words, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have a conclusion. Like I said, complicated issue. (And I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are some easy flaws in my assertions above, I haven&amp;rsquo;t spent more than an hour thinking these through.) But these are discussions we should be having, and at least some of what I&amp;rsquo;ve outlined are above are options that are worth considering, given how harmful and divisive we have found the current social media paradigm to be. I still believe in the promise of the internet in bringing people and the world together - but we need to be doing it in a smart and responsible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;rrl&#34;&gt;RRL&lt;/h4&gt;

            <title>Book Review: The End of Everything by Katie Mack

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I finished the book The End of Everything (Astronomically Speaking) by Katie Mack. I got a Kindle copy on sale on Amazon at the top of the year, figured it was a good way to kick off a year of hopefully reading more books. This is a short review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figure it&amp;rsquo;s probably not a spoiler to tell you the book is all about how the universe ends. Or at least, the many possible ways it could end. The book gives a surface-level walkthrough of what we know about the nature, history and future of our universe through the lenses of physics and cosmology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me more than a couple of weeks to get through the book, as each chapter does discuss some challenging topics and I wanted to make sure I mostly got my head around it before continuing. I suspect those with less background in the sciences might have a bit of trouble with the text, but the author tries her best to not be too complicated (which can be challenging given the subject matter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that the text or prose is boring mind you. The author spices things up with a few humorous jabs here and there, although it might depend on your sense of humor. The author&amp;rsquo;s wit reminds me a bit of British-style humor, like in The Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy, so YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are able to power through the book, you are rewarded with a fascinating view of the current state of our knowledge of physics and cosmology, of how far we&amp;rsquo;ve come and much we still don&amp;rsquo;t know and how much there is yet to be discovered. Perhaps those who have not much background in science will come away with a deeper understanding of how scientific theories are formed, improved, discarded, iterated upon, and so on. I came away with a better understanding of things like the cosmic background radiation, dark matter, dark energy, and so on. Fascinating stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend the book to anyone with even a passing interest in physics. And even if you didn&amp;rsquo;t have such an interest, you could try it anyway, and maybe that will change.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This is 2021 week 3. Or week 2. Two and a half? How do calendars work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;relatively calm compared to the chaos of the previous week. However in the US, a storm may be brewing over Biden&amp;rsquo;s inauguration next week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;locally: still a lot of confusion/inconsistencies around the vaccination plan. Or at least &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/01/17/2071005/senate-seeks-further-hearings-vaccines&#34;&gt;some senators think so&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, we are close to breaching 500k cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot about personal note taking recently, in a bid to find ways to improve my own systems. I skimmed this book from like 2004ish: &lt;a href=&#34;https://users.speakeasy.net/~lion/nb/html/&#34;&gt;How to Make a Complete Map of Every Thought You Think&lt;/a&gt;, which is like a super paper-heavy system. Probably totally impractical (for me at least), but some ideas there worth considering. The modern day equivalent would be something like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/&#34;&gt;Zettelkasten method&lt;/a&gt;, something I&amp;rsquo;ve also been considering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I read this Substack &lt;a href=&#34;https://paulskallas.substack.com/p/is-culture-stuck&#34;&gt;post about culture being stuck in the mid-2000s&lt;/a&gt;, presumably because the Internet became mainstream and people started forming a hivemind around what was popular, and creators responded accordingly by creating more of the same stuff. I think there&amp;rsquo;s still some space for fringe tastes out there, but it is true that pop culture has seemed monolothic recently. What hits me most from the article is the phasing out of rock n roll in favor of hip hop, because a more diverse crowd favors it. I&amp;rsquo;m not really a hip hop person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cory Doctorow &lt;a href=&#34;https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/&#34;&gt;blogs about his daily linkblogging process&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate 20 years of blogging. This reminded me that during my recent blog-hopping I also ran across &lt;a href=&#34;https://althouse.blogspot.com/2021/01/another-bloggiversary-this-blog-is-17.html&#34;&gt;Ann Althouse&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt;, which has been posting daily for 17 years without breaking the streak! I kind of wish I could be that prolific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald%27s_Restaurants&#34;&gt;McDonald&amp;rsquo;s coffee lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, often held up as an example of frivolous ambulance-chasing lawsuits, was much more complicated than that. The woman was hospitalized for more than a week and had to have skin grafts, and McDonald&amp;rsquo;s refused to settle for more than $800, which wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have even covered medical expenses, leading to the huge jury award.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tom Critchlow asks &lt;a href=&#34;https://tomcritchlow.com/2021/01/14/new-browsers/&#34;&gt;why we can&amp;rsquo;t write code in our browsers&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel B. Markham argues that &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielbmarkham.com/the-platform-is-the-enemy/&#34;&gt;platforms might be turning us into idiots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this (kinda old) story about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.damninteresting.com/who-wants-to-be-a-thousandaire&#34;&gt;a guy who hacked a TV game show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not a big fan of Tiktok, but I admit I have been enjoying some of the sea shanty performances coming out of it. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/etelsverdlov/status/1348654717036093440&#34;&gt;Example one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/EKingstonBooks/status/1349906687537373189&#34;&gt;example two&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PH stuff: A trailer came out for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ4ChZPlikM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&#34;&gt;Voltes V Legacy&lt;/a&gt;, which will be airing on GMA. I don&amp;rsquo;t have high expectations, but the animation seemed decent enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily sketches in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt;. I used to crosspost them all to &lt;a href=&#34;https://instagram.com/roytang0400&#34;&gt;instagram&lt;/a&gt; pretty consistently, but now I only do it when I feel like it. Been thinking of getting off instagram anyway, but that&amp;rsquo;s something for another time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finished &lt;strong&gt;Spectacular Spider-Man&lt;/strong&gt; on Netflix. I liked it, even if it was a kids&amp;rsquo; show. Too bad it was cut off abruptly due to licensing issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also started (re-?) watching Attack on Titan, from season 1, as the final season has been getting some hype. Anime is hard to background-watch though (due to subs), so this might take a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched my first two movies of the year: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1350042544567029763/&#34;&gt;The Godfather&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1350361902149324800/&#34;&gt;The Godfather Part II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First two eps of WandaVision are in! It&amp;rsquo;s so weird. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing how things unfold. Series runs until March, I feel like I should do one of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/spoiler-free-review/&#34;&gt;spoiler-free reviews&lt;/a&gt; when it&amp;rsquo;s done (haven&amp;rsquo;t done any of those in a while) but it feels weird to do it for a show that drops weekly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1349796416042856448/&#34;&gt;Fire Emblem Three Houses&lt;/a&gt;! Will probably kick off the 2nd run sometime this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG: &lt;strong&gt;Kaldheim&lt;/strong&gt; preview season in progress. I am fairly excited for the new set to come in, because I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to draft, the limited environment looks exciting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I feel like I should be starting one of the many Steam RPGs on my backlog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books: Been reading Katie Mack&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;End of Everything&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;m around 2/3rds in, so hopefully I can finish it and at least get 1 book in this month lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health: My muscle pains in the left upper arm are still there, although they&amp;rsquo;ve tapered off a bit, I think because I&amp;rsquo;ve been applying warm compresses twice a day for most of the week. Hopefully it will be gone by next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward-to-this-coming-week&#34;&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biden inauguration (chaos?!?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometime this week, I will probably put on pants for the first time since March.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;We are barely more than a week into 2021 and it has already been quite a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the week started off with something as innocuous as a guy going viral for making his daughter work six hours to figure out how to use a can opener and open a can of beans. I can&amp;rsquo;t explain &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9506541/bean-dad-explainer-reactions/&#34;&gt;Bean Dad&lt;/a&gt;, but it was so weird and surreal the way it took over the internet for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;impossible to discuss the last week without mentioning the violent attack by Trump supporters on the US capitol upon incitement by the president himself
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching the events unfolding on the news &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1347017186317983745/&#34;&gt;gave me the same feeling as watching the 9/11 twin towers assault almost two decades ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the subsequent condemnation and consequences not just from US politicians but worldwide, including Trump himself subsequently getting booted off/banned from almost every social media service (of course sparking many opinions about the first amendment and the disproportionate control by tech giants over the public sphere).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s talk of second impeachment and 25th amendment calls (I know about the 25th amendment mostly due to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1347018337990021122/&#34;&gt;Air Force One&lt;/a&gt;), although Pence has thumbed that down. If Trump faces no consequences for this one, they might be looking at something much worse down the line, possibly as soon as the Biden inauguration on the 20th.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s consequences for the actual rioters though: many are being identified on social media and some have already been fired from their jobs. Nascent social media app Parler, used to coordinate the attacks, has been booted off Apple and Google mobile stores AND off their Amazon webhosting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, gootecks showed himself to be once again a MAGA idiot supporting the violence, so his emote got banned from Twitch, which was a weird piece of news.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yesterday (Saturday) was the feast of the Black Nazarene, a big deal in Manila. It was reported that &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1381685/doh-to-quiapo-crowd-watch-for-symptoms&#34;&gt;up to 400,000 devotees&lt;/a&gt; crowded the streets of Manila in what is probably a COVID19 super-spreader event. I mean sure, we held back and stayed at home for Holy Week/Easter/Christmas but somehow we can&amp;rsquo;t avoid celebrating the Black Nazarene. This when our local case counts have been rising since the holidays. Sigh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started these weeknotes, I sometimes put in a section with recent links I&amp;rsquo;ve found interesting during the week. It kind of died off, mostly because I haven&amp;rsquo;t been good about going through my backlog of feeds and sources to get much content for the section. I&amp;rsquo;m bringing it back here as a regular section (for now), so that (a) I force myself to go through all that stuff at least once a week; and (b) people who aren&amp;rsquo;t super interested in what&amp;rsquo;s going on with me have more stuff to read in these weeknotes. I also considered just having a separate weekly &amp;ldquo;linkblog&amp;rdquo; post with the links of interest section, but figured maybe I&amp;rsquo;d check first if I can keep up with the volume needed for that sort of thing? Also, a lot of these are available on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/links/&#34;&gt;links&lt;/a&gt; list, which I also share to Twitter/Masto as they come, so if you follow me there, you might have seen me tweet some of these, and this is just sort of a weekly recap. Anyway, for this week, here we go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for gamers, the wonderful &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.engadget.com/spotify-persona-5-4-3-fes-2-pq-dancing-arena-soundtracks-104349652.html&#34;&gt;Persona 4 and 5 soundtracks are now officially available on Spotify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for people who like old-school blogs and personal websites: Robin Rendle writes &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.robinrendle.com/essays/newsletters&#34;&gt;a nicely-formatted post about newsletters and writing on the web&lt;/a&gt;, Desmond Rivet wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://desmondrivet.com/2020/04/28/writing-reasons&#34;&gt;about using his blog to manage his thinking&lt;/a&gt; back in Apr 2020, and I realized I never shared this &lt;a href=&#34;https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse&#34;&gt;2019 post from Matthias Ott about personal websites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For self-improvement, ideopunk &lt;a href=&#34;https://ideopunk.com/2020/12/22/100-tips-for-a-better-life/&#34;&gt;talks about 100 tips for a better life&lt;/a&gt;. Probably not all of these are for you, but maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll get some stuff of interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For optimists, it can be nice to know there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://reasonstobecheerful.world/the-year-in-cheer/&#34;&gt;quite a few bits of good news in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, in spite of everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snAhsXyO3Ck&#34;&gt;video about lockdown productivity&lt;/a&gt; came out early on in the pandemic, but a lot of the advice still seems sound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.damninteresting.com/who-wants-to-be-a-thousandaire/&#34;&gt;old story about a guy who gamed one of the earliest game shows&lt;/a&gt; by studying the RNG patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some recent Twitter threads of interest:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently, it&amp;rsquo;s a thing for teens &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/unikunka/status/1346602536904523777&#34;&gt;to disbelieve in Hellen Keller&lt;/a&gt;, wth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are told that abusers and white supremacists &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lilithsaintcrow/status/1347293759155838976&#34;&gt;absolutely do not believe their own bullshit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to determine if &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/NomeDaBarbarian/status/1338876619205746688&#34;&gt;something is a sandwich&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone compiled some ridiculous &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/paulisci/status/1340764722811957248&#34;&gt;2020 headlines of the year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hey, the new daily habits I kicked off starting the New Year are holding strong so far. Well, except for daily blog posting, I missed yesterday. But I never claimed that as a resolution, so maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t count that.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily sketches in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;rsquo;re not super good, but maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll like that kind of thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I binged season 3 of &lt;strong&gt;Cobra Kai&lt;/strong&gt; in under 24 hours. Still greatly enjoying it, despite the high school drama. I really like the evolving dynamic between Johnny and Daniel, and the callbacks to all 3 Karate Kid movies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For my background watching I started &lt;strong&gt;Spectacular Spider-Man&lt;/strong&gt; on Netflix. Not bad for a kids&amp;rsquo; show, covers most of the mythos fairly well, though I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed at how Peter treats Gwen like a sidekick given in the comics she&amp;rsquo;s the love of his life. I&amp;rsquo;m only halfway through, maybe that changes later? I always felt Spider-man was better as a serialized TV series than the constant movie reboots. He has a lot of nice street-level villains and supporting cast that can only feature in a longer storyline than blockbuster movies can afford. Oh well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Star Trek Discovery&lt;/strong&gt; Season 3 finale was this week. Nothing too exceptional, I mean, we knew they were going to pull out a win somehow, there were very few surprises. Star Wars wins 2020 I guess lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Emblem Three Houses&lt;/strong&gt; still ongoing. I actually took a few days break this week because I felt like I was playing it a bit too much lol. I think I&amp;rsquo;m fairly close to the end though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG: &lt;strong&gt;Kaldheim&lt;/strong&gt; preview season kicked off this week, but nothing too exciting for me so far, though there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of interesting cards of course. Lore-wise, I do like how they translated a lot of the Norse myth stuff into card form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books: Been reading Katie Mack&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;End of Everything&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty interesting so far, but I&amp;rsquo;m less than halfway in, not a good rate. To help reinforce my book reading, I&amp;rsquo;ve switched up my evening meals reading from the day&amp;rsquo;s news to whatever book I have on tap at the moment. It works I guess, but I eat quickly, so I don&amp;rsquo;t get to read much per session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the past week or so I&amp;rsquo;ve had some kind of strange muscle (?) pain in my upper left bicep, but only when I hold up the arm or stretch it at certain angles. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of annoying, like I slept on it wrong. I thought it would just go away on its own, but now I&amp;rsquo;m thinking maybe it&amp;rsquo;s one of those old age things where things just hurt randomly and you have to live with it?!? Friends recommended trying a warm compress and/or self-massage on the arm, gonna try those out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward-to-this-coming-week&#34;&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WandaVision kicks off on Disney+! I think we&amp;rsquo;re getting two episodes this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more Kaldheim previews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I used to collect quotes a lot. Maybe I still do. Here are a couple of collections I&amp;rsquo;ve posted online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/quotes/tic/&#34;&gt;Tang In Cheek&lt;/a&gt; - a list of quotes (allegedly by me)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/quotes/sig/&#34;&gt;Email signatures&lt;/a&gt; - a list of quotes I used as a pool to randomly select an email signature from. I rarely send email these days, and when I do it&amp;rsquo;s usually web-based, so I can&amp;rsquo;t use these anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s probably a better way to organize these. I mean, I kind of want some kind of upvoting system like they have at bash.org (to see which quotes the three readers of this blog like), but that&amp;rsquo;s a side project for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also a list page at &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/quotes/&#34;&gt;/quotes/&lt;/a&gt; which maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll add to the menus somewhere? For fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: There is also a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/quotes/&#34;&gt;quotes tag&lt;/a&gt;, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been maintaining it too well.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Regular Reviews and Tracking
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/regular-reviews-and-tracking/</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2021 12:47:47 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/regular-reviews-and-tracking/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;One habit I now have that I wish I had started much, much earlier in life would be conducting regular, periodic reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These reviews are a sort of written introspection of the time period in question, the target audience being future me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of the important of this because I had been going through old files the last few months and I really enjoy reading through some older entries and basically traipsing through younger me&amp;rsquo;s mind. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of a time machine in a way. And it helps me by providing a sort of foundation for my thinking, so I understand how my thinking has (or has not) evolved through the years, what mistakes I&amp;rsquo;m still prone to, or which ones I&amp;rsquo;ve overcome, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to start this habit on and off again since basically the early 2000s. This blog is part of that effort, as you can see by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/archives/&#34;&gt;archives&lt;/a&gt;. (Although, not everything can be logged publicly in a blog.) I really only managed to get into a regular discipline of reviews starting around 2017 though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current regular reviews/tracking systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;daily tracker. This is a custom system I built for myself basically just to log things on a day-to-day basis, with categorization, search and summary metrics and graphs. Most useful for expense and tracking what I eat. This tracker is the reason I have a pretty good idea of where my money is going. (I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are OTS systems that can do this, building your own isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;weekly reviews. For things I&amp;rsquo;ve done throughout the week, any big expenses, etc. Helps me remember when I did things. I used to do this privately, via text files, but last year mostly moved it to regular weekly blog posts called &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/weeknotes&#34;&gt;weeknotes&lt;/a&gt;. Having the weekly reviews on the blog gave me a regular public cadence. Most of the things I log in weekly reviews are ok to be public anyway; any private stuff stays in the daily tracker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;monthly finance checks. This is the review habit I&amp;rsquo;ve had the longest, but it&amp;rsquo;s also evolved a lot along the way. Basically I just go through all my bank accounts and credit cards and billing statements, make sure all transactions for the month check out/are legit, check if there are loans/investments I need to follow up on, make sure all bills are paid, and get a snapshot of what my current financial status is. I can cross check the deltas with the numbers from the daily tracker, to make sure there&amp;rsquo;s not any money I&amp;rsquo;m losing unnecessarily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yearly reviews. These are on the blog as &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/yearnotes&#34;&gt;yearnotes&lt;/a&gt;. There are entire years of my early career that seem like a blur - I have very little idea what I was up to in those years. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose that kind of time again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to all of that, I&amp;rsquo;ve recently also resumed doing &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/03/750words/&#34;&gt;750words&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because the old export files from that service were among the old files I was going through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this might seem overmuch for most people, but I find it works for me. It helps me with my thinking, helps me manage my anxiety, and having the past to scroll through is certainly better than doomscrolling all the time. (There is probably some danger of becoming too obsessed with the past, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth it as long as you&amp;rsquo;re aware of the risk.) The past informs the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A while back I saw &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/thorstenball/status/1317488308285558784&#34;&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt; talking about drawing memes from before the internet, and I was reminded that was a thing we had around here too when we were kids!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had our own version of that &amp;ldquo;giraffe in the window&amp;rdquo; drawing, except the one I remember was made so that you could switch the answer to &amp;ldquo;cat hugging a pole outside the window&amp;rdquo; to troll whoever you were asking to guess:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;3e378b94e9485846954887298c03fb57-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/pinoy-drawing-memes/giraffe.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;

    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;6 Jan 2021 6:25am&#34;&gt;6 Jan 2021 6:25am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common ones I remember were the ones involving a &amp;ldquo;man wearing a straw hat/salakot&amp;rdquo;, a typical depiction of rural people back in the day. The drawing would just be two concentric circles (see #1 below), representing the view of the man from above.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest in the picture above are kind of specific to local flavor. Can you guess what they are? Answers in the spoiler tag below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;details class=&#34;spoiler&#34;&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;(Spoilers)&lt;/summary&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#2: magtataho. Basically a man carrying two pails across a stick he carries on his shoulders; this is the typical way taho is sold on the streets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#3: sorbetero. An ice cream man on foot with a cart in front of him containing ice cream; a typical way ice cream used to be sold back in the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#4: a guy peeing against a wall in public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#5: another guy peeing against a wall in public, except he&amp;rsquo;s laughing at a joke #4 is saying while they pee together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are others I can&amp;rsquo;t remember, and probably others that younger generations made up. Maybe some pinoy friends will chime in?&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Word clouds! They used to be a thing right? I was reminded of them yesterday and I wish I had thought of this in time for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/2020-year-in-review/&#34;&gt;2020 year in review&lt;/a&gt;, but here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;rsquo;d generate some word clouds for the blog anyway!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the word cloud for all my blog posts for the year:&lt;/p&gt;








  




&lt;a href=&#34;#1e4410ff92a9c9ded87f6be7974f145f-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/2020-word-clouds/2020_word_cloud_hu8b57e42517547ed8fda9ff31b6689758_699553_300x0_resize_box_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;2020 blog post word cloud&#34; title=&#34;2020 blog post word cloud&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;2020 blog post word cloud (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;1e4410ff92a9c9ded87f6be7974f145f-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/2020-word-clouds/2020_word_cloud.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2020 blog post word cloud&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;5 Jan 2021 9:00am&#34;&gt;5 Jan 2021 9:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s a word cloud for all my tweets for the year:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;864d680be21b9518c5cf38c1919e6e40-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;

    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/2020-word-clouds/2020_tweets.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2020 tweets word cloud&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;5 Jan 2021 9:00am&#34;&gt;5 Jan 2021 9:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if these word clouds are supposed to mean anything, except possibly that I use the words ONE TIME all too often? Oops, I did it again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud&#34;&gt;this library&lt;/a&gt; for the actual generation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I remember to do this again for succeeding year in review posts!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Goodbye Flipboard
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/goodbye-flipboard/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/goodbye-flipboard/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the Flipboard iOS app as my daily morning news reader pretty much since &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2010/10/ipad-first-impressions-and-snap-judgments/&#34;&gt;I first got an iPad&lt;/a&gt;. It offered a nice, magazine like UI where you can flip through pages full of images and short article blurbs until you can find something you want to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past couple of years and iOS versions though, the app has been performing terribly. Crashes a lot, reader view often fails to load, or flickers and reloads continuously and so on. Just not a very good experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;s not entirely their fault; recent iOS versions (starting from 13 I think?) have become more agressive with their memory management and garbage collection, so app processes seemed to regularly get killed for some reason. It sometimes happens in other apps too, but by far Flipboard is the worst offender. Maybe their code is poorly optimized, IDK. Oh, and they&amp;rsquo;ve started to have a lot more ads! In any case, I&amp;rsquo;ve had enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most relevant Flipboard reading consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;latest world news/headlines (main)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tech news (secondary)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;comics/gaming news (when I just feel like scrolling through Flipboard)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a replacement, I assumed I could simply take their most common sources in each of the above categories and import them into my RSS reader of choice (right now that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.inoreader.com&#34;&gt;Inoreader&lt;/a&gt;). But after doing that, I realized this won&amp;rsquo;t work, because I treat my mealtime news reading differently from feeds I follow via RSS. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have unread counts for the news stuff, just see what&amp;rsquo;s the most recent stuff and move on. I decided instead to revive my &lt;a href=&#34;https://feedly.com/&#34;&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt; account, and import the news feeds there, and use the Feedly iOS app for my morning news reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have been doing this for a few days already; not all of the feeds render well (particularly some websites that did not have RSS feeds, I had to do workarounds), but it seems acceptable for now. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll revisit Flipboard again in a future iOS version and hope they get their stability together.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a brand new year, a brand new week, a brand new day. There&amp;rsquo;s no real reason to believe 2021 will be a better year, but we can choose to try to be better, and maybe that in itself is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week&amp;rsquo;s New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve transition played out pretty much as expected. We just stayed at home, actually had an early media noche dinner (around 9ish) and observed the fireworks for a little bit. Yes, there were still fireworks, despite the supposed ban at the LGU level. I would estimate a drop in fireworks volume of maybe 20% at best. Ma says maybe most of those are &amp;ldquo;sanctioned&amp;rdquo; fireworks in common areas, but I remain unconvinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/2020-year-in-review/&#34;&gt;year in review blog post&lt;/a&gt; covered most of the stats for the past year. I enjoyed putting this together, I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker both for reflecting over the past and for gathering stats, so it&amp;rsquo;s a pleasant combination for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really believe in New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions anymore, but I did decide to try to restart a few daily habits and see which ones stick. Don&amp;rsquo;t feel like talking about them all here, but a couple are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the daily walking, but this time I only do a small loop right in front of the house and still inside our subdivision. It&amp;rsquo;s super boring, so I can&amp;rsquo;t tolerate doing it for too long, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get used to it. I&amp;rsquo;ve started listening to a trivia podcast while walking, maybe that will help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/03/sketching-daily/&#34;&gt;sketchdaily&lt;/a&gt;! This might be the most ambitious one. You can check all my sketches via &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt; on this site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;: Fire Emblem run ongoing! And the usual Eternal, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/1344593852154347520/&#34;&gt;Magic Arena&lt;/a&gt;, regular Saturday gaming, etc. I paused on the new Humble Monthly, seems meh. There&amp;rsquo;s still time to get stuff from the Steam sale, but there&amp;rsquo;s nothing particularly interesting. FOR NOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching&lt;/strong&gt;: I finally watched Wonder Woman 1984. Kind of meh. First one was definitely better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: I purchased Katie Mack&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;ldquo;The End of Everything&amp;rdquo; on Kindle because it was on sale, hopefully to restart the book reading habit for the New Year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star Trek Discovery season finale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG Kaldheim preview season kicking off!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shenanigans in the US congress/senate when they try to certify the EC results. Also Georgia elections determine whether Biden will have Senate support!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s always weird for me when people do their &amp;ldquo;year in review&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;X of the year&amp;rdquo; any time before Jan 1st of the next year. You&amp;rsquo;re making Dec 31 feel left out. It&amp;rsquo;s one thing the Oscars get right. Anyway, here&amp;rsquo;s my personal year-in-review, such as it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;essay-writing-section&#34;&gt;Essay-writing section&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably impossible to talk about 2020 without talking about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/covid19&#34;&gt;Covid19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; that has ravaged the world. My country is sadly still under a state of quarantine/lockdown, I believe the world&amp;rsquo;s longest. I am doing relatively well during the pandemic, nobody I know personally has been infected, and I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly averse to just staying at home all the time. Compared to other people, it has for me at worst been a minor inconvenience. For that I am grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss being able to go out to quiz nights or visit friends or eat at restaurants or even the occasional paper Magic tournament. We haven&amp;rsquo;t been visited by my the pamangkins in a while, most contact relegated to Zoom calls. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been unable to do my regular walks. Other than that my life remains relatively the same compared to last year, since any work I&amp;rsquo;ve done has been from home for the past couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like I have accomplished much in 2020, but maybe given all that we had to go through this year, just getting to the end is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2020-statistics&#34;&gt;2020 Statistics:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;work-travel-learning-and-self-improvement&#34;&gt;Work, Travel, Learning and Self Improvement:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hours worked: ~100 hours (estimated) - down from ~200 hours last year
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still have the occasional support consultancy work, but for the most part work has wound down, and I opted not to take on additional work to replace it. Maybe someday I&amp;rsquo;ll write about how I can afford to work so few hours. (Hint: It involves being very frugal)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programming languages/frameworks learned: 1, same as last year
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned the Flutter mobile framework to rewrite a mobile app charity project I did for some friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some other stuff/projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I rebuilt this site in the latest version of Django&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migrated this site to a new webhost, learned some server deployment stuff along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migrated my main email usage &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/gmail-migration/&#34;&gt;away from Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duolingo streak: 718 days (from 355 last year). It seems that I never broke the streak from 2019, so my longest streak continues. The numbers don&amp;rsquo;t add up - 355 + 366 should be 721 - but this may be because this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a true streak. I think I used the &amp;ldquo;streak freeze&amp;rdquo; powerups a few times throughout the year, so I probably actually broke the streak thrice lol. I don&amp;rsquo;t care, I&amp;rsquo;m counting it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other countries visited: 0!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;social-media&#34;&gt;Social media:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook activity:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;32 posts (down from 315 last year, and 1081 in 2018). I deactivated my Facebook account in the middle of the year, so I can say Operation: Reduce Facebook Usage has succeeded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;322 comments (up from 138 last year). I did however have more comments, because of quiz nights being held on FB live during the pandemic!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tweets: 1037 (slightly down from 1124 last year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/syndicated/instagram&#34;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; photos: 46. Vs 108 last year. Most of these were for the usual &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober2020/&#34;&gt;Inktober&lt;/a&gt; thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reddit activity:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 submissions (20 last year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;31 comments (172 last year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answers written on Quora: 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0 words written for &lt;a href=&#34;https://nanowrimo.org/&#34;&gt;Nanowrimo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0 sketches submitted to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/sketchdaily&#34;&gt;r/sketchdaily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;115 &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/blog/&#34;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;, 98537 words worth; down from 224 posts and 119529 words last year. Some posts that I liked or got some reactions:

&lt;li&gt;410 comments! Way up from 75 last year. But this was probably due to some integration stuff counting likes/shares from Mastodon/Instagram/Twitter (?) as comments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full stats for content on this blog and social media activity available &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/about/stats/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;media-consumption&#34;&gt;Media consumption:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things watched on Netflix: 802 (as at 12/29) (416 last year). Pandemic meant more binge-watching. I also rewatched some old (and long) series like The Big Bang Theory, which really adds to the count.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(New) movies watched: 47. &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/lists/2020/movies/&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books read: 2, half as much as last year T_T
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/01/atomic-habits/&#34;&gt;Atomic Habits by James Clear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action item&lt;/strong&gt;: read more books (again)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music tracks played (Spotify/LastFM): 773. (1048 last year). See &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/stats/listening/&#34;&gt;listening stats here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;gaming&#34;&gt;Gaming:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I tried getting into &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/twitch&#34;&gt;game streaming via Twitch&lt;/a&gt;! Haven&amp;rsquo;t been super successful so far, but it&amp;rsquo;s been fun, especially when my friends are around to watch and keep me company. Subscribe at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&#34;&gt;twitch.tv/twitchyroy&lt;/a&gt; or at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwpuHIsvCAdmcZ4hIS3tQHA&#34;&gt;the youtube channel&lt;/a&gt; where I upload all the stream vids afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Nintendo Switch playtime this year: 159 hours (thanks Nintendo for providing a year-in-review!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also played a ton of Starcraft II Coop, up to the time they announced ending support for it, then me and my SC2 buddies got tired of it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magic The Gathering
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best MTGA Rank: Mythic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG paper tournament games played: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG paper tournament games win rate: N/A (See &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/about/stats/mtg&#34;&gt;my MTG stats&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG GPs attended: 0.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p /&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;others&#34;&gt;Others:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fitbit activity: 657,713 steps, 513.03 km walked. Down from 1,766,878 steps, 1,378.15 km last year. Down to a bit more than 1/3 of last year! Largely because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go out too much during the pandemic.  Looks like my counts for Jan and Feb were on track for hitting 1.8m steps for the year, but then dropped off drastically starting March. Sadface. Hopefully I can get back into it once things settle down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donuts eaten: 2, up from 1.5 last year. In my defense, they were Dunkin donuts, which seem to have gotten smaller during the pandemic!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baptisms attended: 1 (up from 0), managed to sneak one in right before the pandemic lockdowns started&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weddings attended: 0 (down from 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wakes attended: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New pamangkins: 2 (!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz nights attended: Unable to count, since the pandemic forced the shift to more frequent online quizzes!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grab:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trips: 3, down from 46 last year, for pandemic reasons obviously. All 3 rides were in January!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food delivery: 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Express delivery: 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Times I won the lotto: 0 (I declare in advance that I will remove this stat for 2021, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I won the lotto!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bears defeated in single combat: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;moving-forward-using-all-my-breath&#34;&gt;Moving forward using all my breath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans are still hazy for 2021. On a personal level, I have been feeling a bit lost in terms of direction, since there&amp;rsquo;s always so much stuff I want to do or try out. I have been considering taking the year off completely like I did in 2016, but that may need further evaluation. As always, we take it in stride, and move forward one day at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>New Year&#39;s Checklist 2021
</title>

            <pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/new-years-checklist/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Happy New Year! Something I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten used to as the New Year rolls in: make a checklist of things to do for the new year. I generally copy stuff over, but the list changes a bit every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ponder why people give so much significance to the transition between an arbitrarily-chosen pair of 24 hour periods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take stock and reflect on the past year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Count your blessings for the past year and be grateful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greet your loved ones and friends and anyone else you hold dear. Maybe even those you disagree with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about what you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn this year or how you want to improve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change your passwords&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy a new toothbrush&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a target of how many books you&amp;rsquo;ll read in 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose the first book to read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throw away a few things you no longer need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check out what movies are coming out this year and which ones you want to watch (see below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audit your financials &amp;ndash; where is your money going, how much do you owe, how much are you earning, where should you invest, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick up your keyboard and shake out all the grime that&amp;rsquo;s gathered there over the past year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a list of projects you want to do in 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose something from the past year that you&amp;rsquo;re going to stop watching or doing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat your favorite food. Or ice cream. Ice cream is great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get rid of 2020 calendars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a list for the new year!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean up the photos on your phone, tablet and computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete all files downloaded 2018 or earlier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow up on the people who owe you money or things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review your recurring luxury costs (Netflix, etc) and evaluate whether you still really need them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backup any important files on your computer/laptop/phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export your Google, FB, Instagram and Twitter data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually, maybe just &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/quitting-facebook/&#34;&gt;quit Facebook altogether&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wash your hands, keep your distance, avoid going out or meeting people unless absolutely necessary. We are still in a pandemic!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speak truth to power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be kind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some stuff I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to in 2021 (who knows if they will actually release as scheduled! This section is updated as news come out.):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Games:&lt;/p&gt;

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/weeknotes-2020-12-27/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I started doing these weeknotes at &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/01/weeknotes-01-12/&#34;&gt;the top of 2020&lt;/a&gt;, so this one signals one complete year of doing my weekly reviews/notes in public. I thought it appropriate for a review!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did it turn out to be a good practice? I think for me yes! Not necessarily for anyone following the blog (all 3 of you), since a lot of the weeknotes stuff might seem boring or irrelevant to you. But for me, forcing me to publicly write some thoughts about the past week has been good for my own self-awareness and keeping me writing regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned this in the first weeknotes linked above, but I used to do private weekly reviews before this. I haven&amp;rsquo;t found much need to supplement the public weeknotes with private ones over the year, but that&amp;rsquo;s basically because (a) my other tracking systems have evolved this year to better capture more data, so less review was actually needed; and (b) this silly pandemic keeping me at home most of the year means there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much to report most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I&amp;rsquo;ll be carrying the weeknotes practice into 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the past week, it was of course Christmas week, which went about as expected. Noche buena night was just me and the folks at home, although the brothers and their families did pass by for a short while on the morning of that day for some gift exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world was relatively quiet. Well, there&amp;rsquo;s finally a post-Brexit trade deal, and Trump seems to be screwing over everybody as expected, and there&amp;rsquo;s a new Covid19 variant, and our government is still being dumb. So, same old same old?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good chunk of my week went towards playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/1340074409961222146/&#34;&gt;Fire Emblem Three Houses&lt;/a&gt;. As is typical of JRPGs, the startup is a bit slow, but once you get into the whole Persona-like loop of tasks and battles, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty addictive. Pretty sure this will take a while to finish though!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steam Christmas Sale is still ongoing. Thinking of actually getting Hades, because of all the GOTY accolades it&amp;rsquo;s getting. On the other hand, Fire Emblem&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular weekly gaming with friends: Root, Sentinels of the Multiverse. I also played a couple more Civ6 games for achievement hunting purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new Jeopardy eps on Netflix ran out quickly. Haven&amp;rsquo;t really started on anything seriously yet, though I did watch first episodes of The Expanse S5 and Kimetsu no Yaiba, but I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling like binging either series yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of cramming a few more movies into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/lists/2020/movies/&#34;&gt;2020 movies list&lt;/a&gt; this week, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if I get around to it or just play more Fire Emblem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To whoever is reading this: despite everything about this year, I hope you somehow managed to have a good holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This coming week: end of year stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;This was the year when a lot of Christmas traditions were broken, due to the pandemic. There are &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/12/xmas-ph/&#34;&gt;cultural/country-specific Christmas traditions&lt;/a&gt; of course, but usually each person or family also has their own personal traditions that they do every Christmas. Here are some of mine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christmas Eve dinner, or as it&amp;rsquo;s popularly known here in the Philippines, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/nochebuena&#34;&gt;noche buena&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growing up, our immediate family/household unit usually celebrates Christmas Eve with a late noche buena, an extra meal that happened after dinner and starting at around midnight. Then we&amp;rsquo;d open presents, usually with one of the uncles taking the role of &amp;ldquo;Santa Claus&amp;rdquo; and giving out gifts. And as kids, it was one night of the year where we were allowed to stay up late and play with the presents for a while. As we grew older, this usually meant playing video games for a few hours in the early morning!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typical noche buena food: some kind of bread, some kind of ham, some quezo de bola, some kind of pasta. Sometimes there&amp;rsquo;s other stuff too like barbecue or soup, but those seem to be the mainstays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We kept this tradition when we moved out of my grandparents&amp;rsquo; house. This tradition only started changing recently, when my brothers all got married and moved out in the past 10 years. They still come to visit with the kids on Christmas eve, but we couldn&amp;rsquo;t have the noche buena very late anymore, because they would need to drive back home, and some of the kids had early bedtimes. So the noche buena kind of got merged into the Christmas dinner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usually we&amp;rsquo;d all be dressed in red and take a family photo in front of the Christmas tree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year, as you can imagine, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t have that dinner together. Instead, my brothers came out on the morning of the 24th and we exchanged presents outdoors. It was the first time for the folks to see their grandkids in person a long while! We still had noche buena early (during dinner time), despite there only being three of us at home to celebrate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My mother&amp;rsquo;s side extended family usually has a reunion on Christmas day itself, the one time of the year we all get together.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re talking a few dozen people (best estimate, the number grew a lot over the years, as some of my cousins were very, um, productive). When we used to live at my grandparents&amp;rsquo; house, it was easy, because everyone else came to us. When that house was sold, one of my other uncles/aunts/cousins usually hosted (our house was way too small), but that usually involved driving out to some far corner of the Metro. Far for us, at least. (Driving across the Metro on Christmas day was tough, and there were some years where some of us had to get a taxi, that always took forever).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the get-together itself, there&amp;rsquo;s usually dinner, then some kind of party games or some cousins might be asked to perform, then presents exchange. We used to do the Santa Claus thing where one person stands in front of the tree and goes through the presents one by one and calls them out and the recipient comes forward and so on. But this didn&amp;rsquo;t really scale as the extended family grew and grew. Later on, the present exchange became more &amp;ldquo;underground&amp;rdquo;, with each household going around giving gifts to the others throughout the night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tradition started by my grandfather was the &amp;ldquo;pasabog&amp;rdquo; where there would be a surprise throwing of money (usually coins or small bills) over the party area and everyone scrambled to grab some. My uncles carried on this tradition when my grandfather passed away, and in recent years my dad and I have been doing the pasabog ourselves (since at this point all of my uncles have passed away as well).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do a big family photo in this gathering too, but it&amp;rsquo;s usually much more challenging since there&amp;rsquo;s way more people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obviously this year, the get together could not happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was also thinking the other day about how the people we greet on Christmas Eve/Day has evolved with technology.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I was young, we could only greet those people in our immediate household and sometimes the neighbors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When cellphones became popular, people greeted each other through those. Usually people had limited SMS, so they&amp;rsquo;d only pick and choose who they could greet. And during those days in particular, network congestion was so bad, it would sometimes be hours before your messages got through. I got a cellphone late and was never much into SMS, so this period didn&amp;rsquo;t last long for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the ubiquity of instant messaging these days, people just send greetings online, mostly to group chats and some to specific people (who are probably more &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; for you&amp;rdquo;). At least this is one tradition the pandemic can&amp;rsquo;t take away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, our government manages to get its act together and get this pandemic under control as soon as possible, so we can resume our Christmas traditions next year!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the penultimate week of the year, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;m not the only who&amp;rsquo;s had enough of this accursed year and looking forward to moving on to the next one. I know that&amp;rsquo;s silly since the world won&amp;rsquo;t magically become better when the calendar flips over to January the first, but I think it helps our mental health to have this sort of &amp;ldquo;fresh start&amp;rdquo; mentality, even if it&amp;rsquo;s on an arbitrarily chosen date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holiday season continues to be weird, thanks to the pandemic. My brothers and I have been trying to hash out how to have the usual holiday gift exchange among the four households. In theory nobody will be coming inside the house, just parking outside and dropping off and picking up gifts, but they need to coordinate since they also need to exchange gifts with each other. They&amp;rsquo;re trying to see if they can synchronize their visits so that the exchanges can happen, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if that works out. Meanwhile, the usual family and extended family reunions will probably happen on Zoom, like many of my friends&amp;rsquo; recent company Christmas parties. Hopefully they go smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the pandemic and the holiday, cases continue to rise locally. This trend will probably carry on into January as a result of holiday gatherings. In pandemic related government screwups recently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requiring face shields everywhere in public, even for joggers or bikers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a pilot for face to face classes in January because the education secretary says they are more likely to get infected at home anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apparently we could have had vaccines as early as the first quarter of 2021, but the health secretary dropped the ball during negotiations with pfizer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I guess they were working with some sort of backlog due to the holiday sales, but my local gaming store took an entire week to ship me my copy of Fire Emblem Fates. It finally arrived last Friday so yay! I haven&amp;rsquo;t started playing yet, beyond opening the package and checking that the cartridge works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead this week, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a bit of achievement hunting in Civilization VI, since a new patch with balance updates dropped last week. I also tried resuming my Wasteland 2 game. It took me a while to get my bearings, but the game just seems so fiddly, I have a hard time getting into it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG: Kaldheim previews started this week! We don&amp;rsquo;t get any more until January though. The metal-themed previews reminded me of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/1339627168947601408/&#34;&gt;something from 10 years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finished The Big Bang Theory rewatch, I totally did not almost tear up at Sheldon&amp;rsquo;s speech in the finale. TBBT gets a lot of flak for being terrible, but I think it holds up reasonably well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;caught up with Mandalorian and Discovery. Discovery was so-so, but wow, the Mandalorian. What a fantastic season finale. I watched it around half a day after the episode dropped and I was very happy I wasn&amp;rsquo;t spoiled by the internet. The team behind the show are doing a great job with the Star Wars franchise. After the problematic sequel trilogy (which I still enjoyed), maybe the real future of the franchise is on episodic TV. Looking forward to all the new Star Wars content next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New background binge watching: There&amp;rsquo;s new episodes of Jeopardy on Netflix! Not a lot, but more trivia is always fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, most of my time was again spent on digging through and sorting old files. Additionally, one of my old external hard drives had also started getting errors, so I ordered and got a new 1tb one, and spent some time trying to move old backup files across from the old drive to the new one. It was annoying because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t play any games that use a controller while this was happening, for fear of disturbing the long file transfers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m kind of looking forward to doing my year in review blog post for this strange and accursed year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How Not to Mentor Software Developers
</title>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve talked a bit about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/10/mentoring-in-software-development/&#34;&gt;mentoring in software development&lt;/a&gt; before, and how early on I used to get feedback about me being &amp;ldquo;intimidating&amp;rdquo;. I never got any concrete feedback regarding that, so I don&amp;rsquo;t know what problems I had specifically. Though I was recently reminded of one particular incident that was a bit cringey for me personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a bit more than 10 years ago I think. I was usually assigned to mentor new hires, which means fresh graduates who usually needed guidance with a Java (which was our primary programming language at that time) and with our in-house web framework, which could be a bit challenging to work with. That means a lot of my days are spent answering questions or guiding newbies through more complicated tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident I remember was with one particular newbie. After they completed a particular task, they asked me to check their work and everything was fine. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the actual wording of what I said but recall making an offhand in-jest remark congratulating them on getting an entire thing done with zero questions and no actual issues. I remember thinking almost immediately afterwards that it was a terrible thing to say since it implies that asking questions might be frowned upon. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of like the difference between just saying &amp;ldquo;Good job&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Good job, you didn&amp;rsquo;t screw this one up!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might have been overthinking it a bit back then as I don&amp;rsquo;t remember any actual negative reaction to that particular remark. That&amp;rsquo;s not really a good metric though, especially when you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with newbies on their first job. There&amp;rsquo;s power dynamics to consider, so they may not think it appropriate to complain even if something makes them feel bad or uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a mentor, it&amp;rsquo;s important to actually encourage the mentees to ask questions when things are unclear or to raise conceerns when there are problems. It&amp;rsquo;s an essential communication skill that all developers (maybe arguably all people) should have. And it&amp;rsquo;s not enough to say &amp;ldquo;Hey, you can ask me questions any time&amp;rdquo;, but you also have to reflect that openness in your actions, your feedback, and your comments.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Time passes yet again. I think I have to get used to not having much personal stuff to report in the weeknotes on certain weeks (aside from the watching/gaming parts), especially given the pandemic where I&amp;rsquo;m at home 90% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the pandemic, the UK started vaccinations last week, and the US FDA approved the Pfizer vaccine as well, so hopefully this is where things start to turn around. Sadly, it may be a while before vaccinations get widespread, especially here in the Philippines. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping things clear up by mid next year for us here, but I&amp;rsquo;m not optimistic about it. It would be really sad if the pandemic restrictions reach next year&amp;rsquo;s holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that people here seem to realize there&amp;rsquo;s still a pandemic going on, if pictures coming out of Divisoria are any indication. I get that not everyone has access to online shopping, but are there no other options for holiday gift shopping than walking through such dense crowds? This may be one instance where our generous gift-giving culture is bad for us, since people are still out trying to buy gifts when the pandemic is a perfectly good excuse for scaling back on the shopping. Capitalism ho!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The saddest part of this pandemic for me has that my brothers and their families can&amp;rsquo;t come over to visit, which means my parents don&amp;rsquo;t get to see their grandkids (and I don&amp;rsquo;t get to see the pamangkins). Sometimes we push back a bit on that envelope, but it&amp;rsquo;ll be a while before we all really get to see each other and enjoy company in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I managed to finish Batman Arkham Knight! The main story at least. Achievement completion seems unlikely, given the multiplayer achievements, and even some of the single-player ones seem a bit too challenging. I was able to enjoy the game despite the graphical issues I encountered early on. Lowering the settings helped a lot I think, though things still weren&amp;rsquo;t 100% good. I really take to these style of games where there&amp;rsquo;s an open world and you have a lot of things to collect and such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ordered Fire Emblem Fates for the Switch yesterday! I was also considering Paper Mario Origami King, but that had some mixed reviews, so holding off for now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently doing a binge re-watch of The Big Bang Theory as my background watching, I&amp;rsquo;m up to season 7 at the moment. I think the show holds up better than some of its contemporaries such as How I Met Your Mother. I know the geek portrayals can be a bit exaggerated or patronizing, so a lot of geeks don&amp;rsquo;t like it, but for me it&amp;rsquo;s fine. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of doing a bad comic book movie marathon sometime this month, covering the ones I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother watching, stuff like Ben Affleck Daredevil, Michael B Jordan Fantastic Four, and the recently released New Mutants. We&amp;rsquo;ll see if I get around to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just under two weeks until Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This week felt like another set of those moments-in-between, where not much seemed to happen, but it somehow still went by quickly anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the household and the family has slowly gotten used to the idea that any big Christmas celebration isn&amp;rsquo;t happening. My niece&amp;rsquo;s birthday was last weekend, so we sent her gifts via Grab delivery instead of being able to get together. Most likely something similar&amp;rsquo;s going to happen for gift exchanges on Christmas. We&amp;rsquo;re still trying to figure out what we can do in the meantime. The extended family has proposed a zoom call on the day of, instead of our traditional annual get-together, I&amp;rsquo;ll let them manage the logistics of that, they have a lot of digital natives to figure it out I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past couple of weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve made improvements to one of my side projects which is an app I use for personal data tracking. Improvements to that app&amp;rsquo;s feature set meant I could also take the time to do some digital housekeeping. That mostly means digging into a whole bunch old files to process their contents and possibly extract them the tracking app. Also regular maintenance things like backing up what needs backing up, deleting what can be deleted. It feels appropriate as a near-year-end activity to be going through junk from the past. (Although I should get started on going through actual physical junk as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;: In the never-ending quest to defeat the  gaming backlog, I started working on Arkham Origins. I believe I&amp;rsquo;ve had  my Steam copy for years now, well before I finished Arkham Knight, and  never got around to it. It&amp;rsquo;s not a particularly new game, so I figured  my five-year old PC could handle it fine. However I&amp;rsquo;m experiencing graphical  slowdowns, especially when dealing with bug groups of enemies. I&amp;rsquo;ve  already tried turning the graphics down to minimum settings, but still  experiencing some issues. My suspicion is that it may have something to  do with me currently using an AMD graphics card (the game does say it&amp;rsquo;s  optimized for NVidia when starting up). So maybe I should have gotten  around to it before my old GeForce card started having trouble. It&amp;rsquo;s  still mostly tolerable, and I did manage to get through some of the  quick-time event sections despite framerate drops. I&amp;rsquo;ll stick with it a  bit to see if I can crawl my way to the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt; Finished the binge watch of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/perfect-strangers/&#34;&gt;Perfect Strangers&lt;/a&gt;, and have caught up with Mandalorian and Discovery. I also blazed through S4 of My Hero Academia. I&amp;rsquo;d read the manga already, so just skipped ahead through the boring parts. I kind of want them to catch up with the current manga arc, as I want to see some of the more recent fights animated, but I guess that&amp;rsquo;s going to take a while. I also started rewatching The Big Bang Theory as my background show of choice, it&amp;rsquo;s aged reasonably well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned recently that I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write more, and I did manage to churn out one blog post per day last week! Maybe I went overboard? And that says nothing about their quality of course. Still, writing more + going through the past should help me focus my thoughts to help me figure out what I want for the upcoming year (aside from the to-be-expected wish for the end of the pandemic of course.) I&amp;rsquo;m not committed to daily posting, but let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can keep up the writing pace.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;While digging through some old stuff recently I found a copy of the late 80s/early 90s US sitcom &lt;em&gt;Perfect Strangers&lt;/em&gt; and decided to binge through all 8 seasons of it (really more like 6 and a half, since seasons 1 and 8 were an abridged 6 episodes each).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up watching this series, on live tv even, before we had cable or Netflix or anything like that. During the binge-watch I remember a good number of the episodes from the first season all the way up to the end of season 7, which implies almost all of it was broadcast on local TV, kind of a rarity I think? Of course, given the primitive nature of broadcast tv (i.e. needing to be there at the time the show is on), a lot of the episodes were new to me too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, the premise of the show is simple: Balki Bartokomous, an immigrant from the small Mediterannean island-nation of Mypos, comes to America to pursue his dreams and somehow convinces his distant-cousin-that-he-has-never-seen-before Larry Appleton, who himself has just moved to the windy city of Chicago, to take him in and let him live with him. The series largely relies on the contrast between the two leads for its humor: Balki is portrayed as a naive, unassuming foreigner, honest and open and prone to hugging strangers, while &amp;ldquo;Cousin Larry&amp;rdquo; sees himself as this street-wise, savvy guardian who must introduce Balki to the realities of modern American life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, Larry is actually terribly neurotic, deceptive and manipulative, even to his closest friends. He often gives Balki advice that gets both of them into trouble; he typically overreacts to the situations they find themselves in; he is prone to being taken over by his greed when the opportunity presents itself. And when he does get the two of them into some trouble, his first instinct to try to lie and cheat his way out of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember enjoying the series a lot when I was young, and have a fond recollection especially of the theme song, which I consider one of the best TV show theme songs of all time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8vbnLYROCj8&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, the show isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly deep, as can easily be seen during a binge-watch. Most episodes will have a plot along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balki says/does something naive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Larry says &amp;ldquo;Balki, Balki, Balki&amp;rdquo; and gives some advice or some other action that gets them into trouble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hijinks ensue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optionally: Larry overreacts to the hijinks and lies or something getting them into even deeper trouble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d say Larry is at fault maybe 80% of the time, though he does have some good/redeeming moments too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show&amp;rsquo;s overall story arc follow the two cousins as they grow both in terms of careers and relationships; they start out working as clerks in a used furniture store, and later move on to jobs at the presitigious Chicago Chronicle. Along the way, they form relationships with a pair of flight attendants (with decidedely 80s hair) who live in their apartment building, whom they eventually marry and have kids with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last part is a bit problematic for me, as I feel like Larry&amp;rsquo;s fiancee and eventual wife Jennifer deserves much better; Larry constantly lies to her and have put their group in mortal danger more than once. Although, once they are married, Jennifer does exhibit many of the same neurotic behaviors Larry has, including trying to lie her way out of bad situations, so maybe they deserved each other. I would guess this character arc is largely a product of its time, a time when society (and thus TV shows) focused on values such as building a career and a stable relationship and eventually a family (as opposed to the Friends era, where the characters would often be jumping across relationships constantly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I did learn during this binge-watch run (and the accompanying Wikipedia check) is that &lt;em&gt;Perfect Strangers&lt;/em&gt; spawned a spin-off show, &lt;em&gt;Family Matters&lt;/em&gt;, that went on to be one of the longest-running shows on US tv. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that show ever aired on local tv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, it was a reasonable binge-watch, good enough for watching in the background while doing other stuff. My nostalgia is not damaged, I never assumed it was a deep show. The best part remains the theme song, which I still somehow feel compelled to sing out loud with each episode.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;A while back someone I know went from working as a developer to working at a senior/management type position at a bank, and that new job came with the corresponding dress code, which meant he was now going to work in long sleeves or barongs. That kind of thing is not for me - back when I still considered a regular office job, one of the fastest ways to get me to run away from an &amp;ldquo;opportunity&amp;rdquo; would be an overly stringent and/or formal dress code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of this because a few days ago, I read an article titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/latimes/status/1251152944717639680&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Enough with the WFH sweatpants. Dress like the adult you&amp;rsquo;re getting paid to be.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, which is like a hilariously bad take. (The account&amp;rsquo;s social media editor &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/latimes/status/1251175728940343298&#34;&gt;immediately followed up disavowing the tweet and admitting to working from home in his pjs&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s understandable if your job involved salesmanship or meeting with clients and such, but not for ordinary office work. I can fix bugs as easily in a t-shirt and jeans as I can in a suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of elitist too. Fancy clothes impractical for commuting or for tropical heat. Reinforces existing power structures. Obsolete signals/ideas of status/power/affluence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not saying you can&amp;rsquo;t dress up if you want, but maybe don&amp;rsquo;t judge others for not doing so, or otherwise require them to dress up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand the line needs to be drawn somewhere, but why does the line have to be something impractical and not simply comfortable?&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Last week, Twitter added Fleets, their own version of stories (short-lived posts). As could be expected, it&amp;rsquo;s not something I can relate to. I did post one (saying &amp;ldquo;This is dumb.&amp;quot;) just to see what the interface was like, but that&amp;rsquo;s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about writing a blog post about how I dislike this sort of ephemeral social media, but it turns out that &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/08/ephemeral/&#34;&gt;something I&amp;rsquo;d already written about before&lt;/a&gt;. Things don&amp;rsquo;t change I guess, and they just come around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still can&amp;rsquo;t relate to this kind of thing, since I really prefer having a record of things I&amp;rsquo;ve posted for future reference. It&amp;rsquo;s generally my favorite feature of social media platforms; even when I was winding down my usage of Facebook, I was still using it regularly for the &amp;ldquo;On This Day&amp;rdquo; feature. And I even put an &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/onthisday/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;On this day&amp;rdquo; feature&lt;/a&gt; on this very site as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People do seem fond of this kind of thing though, a lot of my Twitter follows are already posting fleets. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind looking through other people&amp;rsquo;s fleets or stories, there&amp;rsquo;s some fun stuff there sometimes. So this might be the sort of feature we can expect social media platforms to keep putting out in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Game Review: Super Mario Odyssey

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;After playing through &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/mario-3d-all-stars/&#34;&gt;Super Mario 3D All Stars in October&lt;/a&gt;, I borrowed a copy of Super Mario Odyssey for the Nintendo Switch from my brother and played through it for most of November. Odyssey was the main reason I actually got a Switch; I played through a few worlds at a friends house during a single session and loved it, so I had been meaning to get the console just for Odyssey alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game deviates a bit from the formula established by Mario 64, Sunshine and Galaxy; Instead of a single hub that leads to small mission worlds, there are a number of different kingdoms, each of which have different residents. The plot is standard Mario fare; Bowser kidnaps Peach because he wants to marry her against her will (and apparently there&amp;rsquo;s nothing she can do about it?! You can say no girl!) You visit each kingdom in turn as you chase Bowser across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each kingdom is a self-contained &amp;ldquo;open world&amp;rdquo; where there are many challenges you can complete to advance the story. Completing challenges earns you Power Moons (the analogue to 64/Galaxy&amp;rsquo;s stars and Sunshine&amp;rsquo;s shines) which ostensibly power your ship, the Odyssey. Examples of the Kingdoms are the Metro Kingdom featuring New Donk City, whose mayor is the girl you rescued from Donkey Kong so long ago; the Woodland Kingdom is populated by flower-growing robots; the residents of the Seaside Kingdom are slugs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually finished the main story after around a week of play. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly straightforward, not especially challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is however, a lot of post-game and completion stuff to do, that took me another couple of weeks and change. Odyssey&amp;rsquo;s completion revolves around collecting a rather large number of Power Moons. A good chunk of them are only available after beating the main story, though I did try to get as many as I could even before beating Bowser. And some worlds like Peach&amp;rsquo;s Mushroom Kingdom and the more challenging Dark Side/Darker Side of the Moon are available only in the post-game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite parts of the game are these segments where Mario becomes a 2D Mario and you have to play 2d Mario stages in 8-bit style, they appear in the open world as murals, often hidden, and they&amp;rsquo;re really nice throwbacks. They even made 8-bit versions of each Mario costume!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completion is a real challenge. There are much more difficult platforming challenges involved, and some moons like the Koopa racing ones will require you to master advanced moves and jumps to beat them. There&amp;rsquo;s also a whole lot of minigames to complete, moons hidden using art-based clues, and a whole lot of collectibles (including hats and costumes for Mario) that you can purchase from stores using coins and regional currency that you collect. I played most of the game in handheld mode, but there are some moons that are easier to get using motion controls, which requires you detach the joycons, so that&amp;rsquo;s something I sometimes had to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to get all but 7 of the unique 880 collectible moons. The 7 I missed were 5 for minigames (100 jumps in jump rope, 100 volleys in beach volleyball, and 3 bound bowl races) and 2 stage moons (for Breakdown Road in Dark Side). While none of these seem impossible to do, they all seem like they require much more patience than I am willing to give, so I&amp;rsquo;m satisfied with this completion rate for now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only complaint is that at some point I found going for completion to be super tedious, especially with those last few moons. 880 moons is a ridiculous number, compare that to a paltry 240 stars in Galaxy. This might be a case of there just being too much stuff? I realize this is a weird thing to complain about. Overall it&amp;rsquo;s still a fun and engaging game, though I&amp;rsquo;m waffling over whether this one or Galaxy is the better game. (I probably still like Super Mario 3D World over either though!)&lt;/p&gt;
