            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I recently did &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/site-migration-to-django/&#34;&gt;a server migration&lt;/a&gt; since I moved to new hosting, The move was from managed/shared hosting to a VPS, these are some notes I took during the process, which I figure might be helpful if I ever tried to  do this again. (And maybe someone else finds it helpful too). Links and references to helpeful resources are included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-up-a-webserver-and-wsgi-container&#34;&gt;Setting up a webserver and WSGI container&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already knew I wanted to use Nginx (managed hosting on the old server always used Apache), that meant needing to choose a WSGI container for the Django apps. The choices were either gunicorn or uwsgi. Readings suggest minimal performance difference between the two. I did try setting up both, and found uwsgi&amp;rsquo;s setup much more straightforward and with more helpful step-by-step documentation: &lt;a href=&#34;https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html&#34;&gt;https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nginx itself was pretty straightforward to set up. This &amp;ldquo;common pitfalls&amp;rdquo; article was helpful in resolving issues: &lt;a href=&#34;https://origin-www.wp.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/config_pitfalls/&#34;&gt;https://origin-www.wp.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/config_pitfalls/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I will note that&amp;rsquo;s not in the article above is that for static files to be served by Nginx, it was easier to just have everything be under /var/www, for permission purposes. I initially had static files in a different folder in my user root, but really there&amp;rsquo;s no reason for that since you&amp;rsquo;re going to serve them statically anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-up-php-on-nginx&#34;&gt;Setting up PHP on Nginx&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed PHP since I had a few minor scripts/pages and a Wordpress install that needed PHP. For the setup on Nginx, I found this guide from askubuntu super helpful: &lt;a href=&#34;https://askubuntu.com/questions/134666/what-is-the-easiest-way-to-enable-php-on-nginx&#34;&gt;https://askubuntu.com/questions/134666/what-is-the-easiest-way-to-enable-php-on-nginx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide from DigitalOcean was also helpful: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-nginx-mysql-php-lemp-stack-in-ubuntu-16-04&#34;&gt;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-nginx-mysql-php-lemp-stack-in-ubuntu-16-04&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was encountering some issues with fastcgi not mapping requests to the correct PHP script if the Nginx location block was aliased. This was with me using the default &lt;code&gt;snippets/fastcgi-php.conf&lt;/code&gt; that was provided with the fastcgi install. I resolved the issue by adding an additional fastcgi_param to the php location block like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    location /sample-path {
        alias /var/www/sample-path;
        # autoindex on;

        location ~ \.php$ {
                include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
                fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME    $request_filename;
                fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
        }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution for this came from the Nginx common pitfalls article listed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;choosing-a-database&#34;&gt;Choosing a database&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially wanted to use PostgreSQL (since that&amp;rsquo;s what I was using locally) and set that up first. Then I realized I had a Wordpress install I wanted to carry over, and apparently Wordpress needs MySQL, so oops. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have two databases running, so that was out. Plan out your database usage boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-up-mysql-for-django&#34;&gt;Setting up MySQL for Django&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created the initial MySQL database with character set &lt;code&gt;utf8&lt;/code&gt;, which apparently had the dumb implementation of only supporting 3 bytes for multibyte characters. This led to errors when I tried importing records into Django that had emojis and the like in text. Apparently the &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; character set to use is &lt;code&gt;utf8mb4&lt;/code&gt; (mb4 -&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;multibyte 4&amp;rdquo; I guess?). It&amp;rsquo;s kinda dumb that they had to invent a &amp;ldquo;more utf8 character set&amp;rdquo; because of their initial dumb implementation. It&amp;rsquo;s also dumb that I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize this when apparently the MySQL databases on the old server were already using &lt;code&gt;utf8mb4&lt;/code&gt;! On the Django side, you need to specify the charset in the database settings. Helpful for resolving this issue was donturner&amp;rsquo;s answer on this SO question: &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2108824/&#34;&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2108824/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some initial testing, I also encountered a &amp;ldquo;MySQL has gone away&amp;rdquo; every so often. Turns out Django was holding on to connections for too long, so a timeout had to be set in the database settings as well. SO reference: &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26958592/&#34;&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26958592/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: I just encountered this a few hours after I wrote this post, when I tried to make the site display all times in Manila local time. Apparently, even if I set my Django app to be timezone, aware, additional setup needs to be done on the MySQL side so it knows what the actual timezones are (feels like they should really do this as part of the install!). Basically you need to run &lt;code&gt;mysql_tzinfo_to_sql&lt;/code&gt; to load the OS timezone info into the database. This is in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://django.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ref/databases.html&#34;&gt;Django documentation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-tzinfo-to-sql.html&#34;&gt;MySQL documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;misc-stuff&#34;&gt;Misc stuff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used cron to set up most of the batch jobs I usually run (like the Twitter bots, etc). Initially I had problems where it seemed like cron wasn&amp;rsquo;t running the jobs, even though syslog showed me the cron daemon was actually running. I don&amp;rsquo;t have notes on how I resolved this, but mentioning it here so that if this happens again in the future, I know to actuall take notes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up log files for my cron jobs: I did it this way: &lt;code&gt;0 * * * * /path-to-batch/hourly.sh &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /var/log/cron/my-log-file.log 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1&lt;/code&gt;. The &amp;ldquo;2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1&amp;rdquo; at the end is necessary so that stderr is redirected to the same file (otherwise you&amp;rsquo;d only get stdout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log rotation: these is the kind of thing you don&amp;rsquo;t realize you need to do when you&amp;rsquo;re managing your own server. Anyway, I found this guide helpful: &lt;a href=&#34;https://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/setup-log-rotation-logrotate-ubuntu/&#34;&gt;https://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/setup-log-rotation-logrotate-ubuntu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to set up AWStats on the new server (and migrate data from the old server). This guide was helpful: &lt;a href=&#34;https://larsee.com/blog/2020/06/awstats-on-ubuntu-20-04-with-nginx/&#34;&gt;https://larsee.com/blog/2020/06/awstats-on-ubuntu-20-04-with-nginx/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When migrating the old AWStats data files, the filename format from the oldserver was slightly different (new install needed to end with &lt;code&gt;*.roytang.net.txt&lt;/code&gt;), so I learned a bit of bash scripting to do the batch rename:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;for i in /path-to-tmp/awstats/*.txt ; do cp &amp;quot;$i&amp;quot; &amp;quot;/path-to-tmp/awstats/out/$(basename &amp;quot;$i&amp;quot; .txt).roytang.net.txt&amp;quot; ; done&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt SSL on Nginx: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nginx.com/blog/using-free-ssltls-certificates-from-lets-encrypt-with-nginx/&#34;&gt;https://www.nginx.com/blog/using-free-ssltls-certificates-from-lets-encrypt-with-nginx/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect from the migration from shared hosting to a VPS is how much memory I&amp;rsquo;d need. My old hosting plan was only on 512MB ram, and the lowest DigitalOcean droplet had 1GB RAM, so I figured that was fine! But MySQL occasionally had out of memory errors on startup even at 1GB ram, so I bumped up to the next level (2GB RAM). I guess the database RAM usage didn&amp;rsquo;t count against my limits on the shared hosting! The next tier isn&amp;rsquo;t much more expensive and is still manageable for my casual/hobby hosting purposes, but I will probably try to look into more detail into the memory situation at some point to see what I can optimize.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now:&lt;/strong&gt; Stormy weekend here in Manila. Supposedly the &amp;ldquo;strongest storm of 2020&amp;rdquo; so far, typhoon Rolly made landfall earlier today and is currently battering many of the provinces south of Metro Manila. Storm signals are as high as number 5. As of this writing, weather is currently cold and nippy but not particularly rainy where I am. We expect stronger winds and rain to hit us as evening approaches as well. On top of everything, a second typhoon has entered the PH area of responsibility and is expected to affect us over the next couple of days as well. If those two typhoons get together, it may be very bad. Hoping for the best. (I thought about doing these weeknotes end of day&amp;hellip; but we might lose power, so here we go.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Server migration update:&lt;/strong&gt; Migrating the final domain now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; I finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1322214646221205504/&#34;&gt;Link&amp;rsquo;s Awakening!&lt;/a&gt; Full heart and seashell completion even! It was fun and a great throwback to classic games like Link to the Past. I never played the original on Gameboy, though maybe that&amp;rsquo;s for the best, as I liked how this one looked and my memory is not tainted by nostalgia over GB graphics. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a particularly long game, especially compared to other Zeldas, but there is a custom dungeon feature (new to this remake) which probably adds some replay value, though I don&amp;rsquo;t have much interest in it at the moment. On to Super Mario Odyssey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; I did terribly at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/11/review-eternal/&#34;&gt;Eternal Card Game&lt;/a&gt; worlds LCQ, but I must admit their current celebration promo was super effective in getting me back into the game, as I&amp;rsquo;m now doing daily grinds in both Eternal and Magic Arena again. I managed to hit Mythic in Magic Arena before month end, but didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough time for Eternal, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can keep it up next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying games of &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/965580/Root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; with the Saturday gaming group. It&amp;rsquo;s a multifaction boardgame where each faction plays differently and has different ways of scoring victory points, and the factions will naturally clash with each other. The main challenge is finding a fine balance between advancing your agenda and interfering with the others. Disrupting the other factions might lose you some momentum compared to the others, but if no one keeps the others in check, someone might run away with victory! Pretty fun. And given that the game supports asynchronous games (up to 3 days per turn), the term &amp;ldquo;Saturday gaming group&amp;rdquo; is a bit obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Done:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober2020&#34;&gt;the Inktober thing&lt;/a&gt;! I managed to get through the whole thing without missing a day! Doing daily drawings with a pen are hard for me, given my poor manual dexterity at this age (and it was never that good in the first place). My hands got tired so easily, and a lot of my lines were shaky. Still, I enjoyed doing a lot of the sketches, and while I don&amp;rsquo;t want to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/03/sketching-daily/&#34;&gt;commit to daily drawings&lt;/a&gt; again (at least for now), maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll warm up the old Apple Pencil every so often and do some digital stuff? Maybe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt; I finished Season 4 of The Expanse. I didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy it as much as the first 3 seasons, though the second half was better than the first. Things were ramping up too slowly, and a lot of things didn&amp;rsquo;t seem relevant to the what was going on with the Roci crew (and turned out to be mostly geared towards next season&amp;rsquo;s big crisis apparently?). As I said to a friend, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m here for the scifi protomolecule stuff not OPA terrorist or earth politics BS.&amp;rdquo; Still, looking forward to the next season. Also: Finished five seasons of NCIS (that&amp;rsquo;s all they had on Prime Video). In the queue: The Boys S2, Star Trek Discovery S3, Mandalorian S2. Where&amp;rsquo;s my Orville?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skipped:&lt;/strong&gt; Hacktoberfest. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considering:&lt;/strong&gt; Nanowrimo. Haven&amp;rsquo;t done any prep, so if ever it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a late start. I do have some ideas rolling around in my head, but I also have some other stuff to do, so for now let&amp;rsquo;s say this is &amp;ldquo;low probability&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxiety:&lt;/strong&gt; Low, most of it due to awaiting a call back about something that hasn&amp;rsquo;t pushed through yet, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really need? Why am I anxious about it then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Random:&lt;/strong&gt; This storm reminded me of my worst typhoon experience in Metro Manila, Ondoy back in 2009, so I wrote a short &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2009/09/ondoy/&#34;&gt;back-dated retrospective on it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad luck:&lt;/strong&gt; The hinge on one side of my glasses&amp;rsquo; frame broke while I was at the cashier at the grocery yesterday! D: I have a slightly older pair I can use in the meantime, but it&amp;rsquo;ll probably be a few days before I can even go to get a real replacement, given the storm and the long weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward to:&lt;/strong&gt; the US presidential elections, with a mix of morbid dread and anticipation, like an onlooker at a car crash.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;leaving-hugo&#34;&gt;Leaving Hugo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit under two years since &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/11/site-migration-to-hugo/&#34;&gt;I migrated the site from Wordpress to Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. As discussed in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/11/one-year-with-hugo/&#34;&gt;this post one year ago&lt;/a&gt;, I was very happy with the general workflow of managing posts through markdown files in git, but had big problems with the Hugo build time, largely a consequence of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/10/archive-of-my-own/&#34;&gt;my social media archiving&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to invest effort into migrating to a different backend, but the problem has only gotten incrementally worse since then, so I decided to take the jump and started working on it last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;migration-goals&#34;&gt;Migration goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main goal is to get rid of the unnecessary build time. I also don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to store all the pre-generated HTML files. It&amp;rsquo;s fine for a small site, but with the large number of posts here, there&amp;rsquo;s a large amount of unnecessary duplication, considering listing pages and such. That means reverting to a system where each page is generated on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to retain the current workflow of managing content via markdown files, so that rules out something like Wordpress. Still, I figured I needed some kind of database for indexing, so that things like listing and archive pages work properly. Given that we would be migrating away from a static site, I fully expect a performance hit, at least initially, but ideally it&amp;rsquo;s not too bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d also like to retain the current content written for Hugo as much as possible. This means the new system will need to be able to parse the custom Hugo shortcodes I&amp;rsquo;d set up for the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also be migrating to a new server which I would be managing myself, which means I would need to set up the deployment myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-django&#34;&gt;Why Django&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I naturally fell back on Django, it&amp;rsquo;s my ORM+backend framework of choice, and the one I&amp;rsquo;m most familiar with. Also, I already had a handful of small Django apps that I needed to migrate to the new server as well, so no matter what I needed to have a Django app on the server anyway. I also had a bunch of Python scripts that were doing already doing support functions for the site like search and ingestion of social media content, so that&amp;rsquo;s something to fold into the new backend as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-bother&#34;&gt;Why Bother?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will fully admit I spent far too much effort unnecessarily doing this, but the realization is that it&amp;rsquo;s actually work I enjoy. This site is primarily a project for myself, and I enjoy the time working on it and learning stuff and improving things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, the effort wasn&amp;rsquo;t too much. There was a lot of code to reuse and migrate, so most of the effort was testing and making sure things worked. Most of the new code was for parsing the markdown files to render the hugo shortcodes as HTML; I basically wrote Django templates for each Hugo shortcode to be supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;changes&#34;&gt;Changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The migration was largely done in-place: site design remains mostly the same, post URLs should be more or less retained. I did take the opportunity to make one nontrivial change: Photos are now under &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/a&gt; category. I really only had a separate photos category before because in Hugo I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a way to query posts that have attached images. Even with everything under Notes, since I have a database now, I can do silly things like show &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/photos/random&#34;&gt;random photos&lt;/a&gt;. Also, now the notes section is closer to a microblog/tumblr-like feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source for the site content will still be &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/roytang/blog&#34;&gt;available publicly via Github&lt;/a&gt;, as it was before. Unfortunately, I am not ready to make public the source for this site, because (a) a lot of it is old code that I reused so it looks terrible; and (b) some level of security by obscurity I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that the site needs to be secure; there isn&amp;rsquo;t actually any critical/important data being stored anywhere. But the fact that a database now exists means I need to follow some kind of security practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The server is now hosted on DigitalOcean. Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://m.do.co/c/6c2e6b11b260&#34;&gt;my affiliate link&lt;/a&gt;. Since I&amp;rsquo;m on a self-managed VPS now, that means Github webhooks now work, so whenever I push new posts, they take less than a minute to now appear on the site. This is a vast improvement over the old system where it would take anywhere between 30-60 minutes depending on how Travis was feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Travis, I set up a new mirror, Travis now publishes to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net&#34;&gt;https://mirror.roytang.net&lt;/a&gt; once a day, hosted on Netlify. The mirror is still generated using Hugo! I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long I can keep up having the content generate correctly for both builds, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this actually went out much smoother than I thought it would. Took less effort than expected, deployment was a breeze. The listing pages have slightly worse performance, but individual pages are hitting 100 on Pagespeed, so that&amp;rsquo;s mostly fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was just the overview of the site changes. There&amp;rsquo;s still a bunch of technical notes to be written up, so that&amp;rsquo;s stuff for a future blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time I used a Django backend for my website was &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2008/12/roytang-net-site-update/&#34;&gt;waaaay back in 2008&lt;/a&gt;, and that didn&amp;rsquo;t last more than a year before I switched to Wordpress. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how long this one holds out!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Server migration update: I had encountered some trouble with the Travis-CI -based Hugo build generating this here website last week. Luckily, most of the migration work to the new backend was already done, so I went ahead and switched over the servers. So this site is no longer plain-old deployed HTML, but rather powered by a Django backend. The site should be mostly the same, though I did take the opportunity to move some stuff around. There&amp;rsquo;s probably some bugs floating around, and maybe some secrets even. Probably need a longer blog post writing about the migration itself, though it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too complicated. I also have a bunch of notes about the server setup that I&amp;rsquo;ll also carve into a blog post when I have time. Things should be mostly done for this site, but I have one other domain I have to migrate, and I have scheduled that for the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that hopefully all my apps/domains will be on the new server after the first week of November. My account at the old webhost is paid until Nov 15th, and I&amp;rsquo;ve already indicated I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to migrate to whatever new system they have, so it&amp;rsquo;s just in time I think. Hoping things go smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming: I did &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1318238520251621377/&#34;&gt;the 120 stars &amp;ldquo;completion&amp;rdquo; for Super Mario Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;, although that&amp;rsquo;s really more like half of actual completion. I put down the Switch for a few days after that to cool down on it for a bit, as I have been playing it a lot since I got it. Still deciding whether to play Odyssey next or try Link&amp;rsquo;s Awakening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming: I haven&amp;rsquo;t played &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/11/review-eternal/&#34;&gt;Eternal Card Game&lt;/a&gt; in months, which meant falling behind on the collection as new sets came out and such. But they&amp;rsquo;re running an event right now where all accounts have access to all cards, and there are qualifiers for their worlds event. I figured why not and gave it a shot, running a deck I got from their recent tournaments, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1319794495395745793/&#34;&gt;managed to qualify for the LCQ on my first try&lt;/a&gt;. Eternal has always been a fun game, but the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve preferred playing on MTG Arena. The timing of this Eternal event was pretty nice, as it came up just after Arena got a patch that severely downgraded the UX, with bugs being reported everywhere and general laggy performance. The Eternal client was, as always, snappy and had no issues. Arena dev team needs to get their act together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still ongoing: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober2020&#34;&gt;the Inktober thing&lt;/a&gt;. Still haven&amp;rsquo;t missed a day! This week is the final stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not ongoing: Hacktoberfest. I mentioned before that I was planning to do it, but&amp;hellip; I haven&amp;rsquo;t. Less than a week to go, so doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem likely I can get into it, especially since other things have come up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my current webhost finally decided to give me a deadline, the long and short of it is that my new server needs to be ready by December the 9th, giving me a bit under a month to get things in order. I&amp;rsquo;m already in the middle of setting up the new server, so I think I&amp;rsquo;ll be ready by early November anyway. Most of the code to run the new blog is also mostly ready (who knows how many bugs there are though!) I am (re-)learning a lot about server setups though, so hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll have quite a few blog posts to write the migration is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching lately: Mostly old NCIS seasons still, and I&amp;rsquo;m just past the halfway point on The Expanse season 4. Slow going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to November, and am awaiting the outcome of the US presidential elections with morbid interest.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Game Review: Super Mario 3d All-stars
</title>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;So I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/09/nintendo-switch/&#34;&gt;got a Nintendo Switch last month&lt;/a&gt;. One of the first games I had gotten for the system was the recently released Super Mario 3d All-Stars. I had really been wanting to play Super Mario Odyssey instead, but my brother had a copy of that game that I could borrow later, so I decided to get 3dAS first, as I had never really played the 3 games on the collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly played the 2d Mario games prior to this, with the exception of 3d Land (3DS) and 3d World (WiiU), although both of those games were closer in style to the the 2d mario games than to the games in this collection. The three games here share the same style of having a hub-like world from which you visit other worlds to accomplish missions to get stars/shines. The other worlds have multiple &amp;ldquo;episodes&amp;rdquo; so you have to replay each of them a bunch of times (doing different things each time) to get all the stars/shines available in those worlds. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of a clever world to save on level design resources - each world is essentially multiple stages sharing the same maps and objects and so on. It can also mean the player might get tired of repeating the same worlds over and over, but the hub system means they can visit other worlds for a while if that happens. As you gather stars/shines, you unlock more areas of the hub world and thus more worlds/stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t optimistic about SM64 going in. I played a little bit of it on the DS when it was released there, didn&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy it. Released in 1996, I know it&amp;rsquo;s regarded as a classic and revolutionized 3d platforming in its day, but for me it hasn&amp;rsquo;t really aged very well. My problems with the title are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor camera handling. You don&amp;rsquo;t have smooth right-stick control of the camera (since the N64 did not have a right analog stick), and the camera angles are often limited in how you can rotate them around. There&amp;rsquo;s a button to toggle the camera from Lakitu perspective to Mario perspective, which is annoying for me since I don&amp;rsquo;t find the over-the-shoulder Mario perspective useful, and I accidentally keep hitting the toggle button. There is a setting to disable the Mario perspective altogether (such that the toggle button now fixes the camera to a given position instead), but the setting resets every time you load your game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even when the camera is in Lakitu mode, it will often turn or rotate far too quickly for my taste, and for me this means if I play the game for around an hour or so I start getting dizzy, and this is the main dealbreaker for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find it quite difficult to control Mario in this game as well. His normal movement is to run, not to walk, so a simple flick of the left analog stick moves him farther than I&amp;rsquo;d like, and the same goes for his jumps. I think it&amp;rsquo;s because this was their first 3d game, so they hadn&amp;rsquo;t really calibrated yet what would be a good walk/run speed and jump distance. Adding to that, some actions like turning Mario in a new direction combined with jumping can cause him to jump in a different direction/distance, it&amp;rsquo;s something to get used to. You don&amp;rsquo;t have much jump control once you are in mid-air either. So for difficult platforming segments, I often found it challenging to position Mario for precise jumps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of the worlds/stages are also quite frustrating. You will be dying quite often. This is unsurprising for a Mario game, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that many of the sequences are a bit long so it can be annoying to re-do them. Combined with the finnicky controls and the often weird camera angles, it can cause unnecessary frustration. Even worse, when you die, you are not just kicked back to the start of the stage, but most of the time you are kicked out of the stage altogether and back to the hub world. A minor inconvenience, but it still means additional friction in the try-fail-retry cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of try-fail-retry, a lot of the missions really require you to spend multiple lives dying and trying again. This isn&amp;rsquo;t unexpected, but a lot of them can be extremely challenging. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking in particular of that one mission where you have to race a penguin down a twisty icy slope, where veering off the slope means death. Trying to get to the end of the icy slope is bad enough - it&amp;rsquo;s going to take you a lot of trial and error to do so - but then you have to make sure you get there ahead of the penguin too. I feel like a lot of the more challenging missions carry over some of the &amp;ldquo;Nintendo hard&amp;rdquo; mentality from the NES/SNES generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t managed to even finish SM64 yet, so I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are a lot more challenging stages ahead. As of this writing, my progress stands at a pitiful 17 stars obtained (out of a possible 120). The dizziness due to the camera is the main problem for me. I may try to come back to it later, but for now there are better games to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario Sunshine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released in 2002 for the GameCube, Sunshine is the mainline Mario I&amp;rsquo;ve never even tried before. I later found out that Sunshine is considered one of the most difficult 3d Mario games to date. I will tend to disagree; I think the average SM64 stage is more difficult than Super Mario Sunshine, given that I was actually able to beat Sunshine. I will concede that 120-shine completion is probably very difficult for Sunshine though, but more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunshine provides some improvements over SM64:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most significant upgrade is graphically. It&amp;rsquo;s a huge jump over SM64&amp;rsquo;s blocky polygons, and Mario&amp;rsquo;s appearance here is already pretty close to his latest modern appearances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still find walk/run controls a bit slippery, but there is significant improvement in jump control since this game gives you FLUDD (the water jetstream firing thing), which has hover functionality making it easier to make difficult jumps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsurprisingly, the most challenging parts of the game are the &amp;ldquo;secret&amp;rdquo; platforming stages where Mario is denied the use of FLUDD. These secrets usually have to be accessed at a certain point in the composite worlds. Although these secret stages are difficult, the blow is kind of softened by two things: if you die, you are returned to the start of the secret stage (instead of kicked out to the containing/hub world); and most of the stages will have one or more 1-ups available, with one easily available near the start of the stage. You&amp;rsquo;re still going to need to grind a lot to finish these secret stages, but at least you&amp;rsquo;re not likely to run out of lives doing so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also most of the game&amp;rsquo;s worlds and settings are a lot more fun in terms of ambience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, I did manage &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1314224120490389504/&#34;&gt;to beat Super Mario Sunshine a couple of weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;. I finished with around 77 shines (out of a possible 120). I may eventually come back to it for completion, although that looks challenging. The main challenge would probably be completing the blue coins in each world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario Galaxy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally released in 2007, Galaxy is easily the best game in this collection. I tried playing this back when I first got a WiiU (by borrowing the game and a couple of WiiMotes from a friend). At the time I wasn&amp;rsquo;t thrilled with the WiiMote control scheme, especially with having to use the WiiMote as an imprecise pointer, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t get far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m obviously much happier with the Switch version. In handheld mode, you use touch controls on the screen to do the pointer stuff (like to collect star bits), which is much easier and more precise than using the WiiMote (or pointing the joycon in TV mode), so that&amp;rsquo;s my preferred mode of playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some stages that require motion controls, where I find I need to switch to TV control. Examples are the ones where you have to control a Mario riding a rolling ball, or Mario riding a manta ray surfing along a water track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game itself is very beautiful and significantly easier (or at least, less frustrating) than the first two games. You don&amp;rsquo;t have FLUDD this time, but Mario gets a spin jump that gives him additional jump control. And longer stages now have checkpoints in between so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to start over from the beginning if you die. Many of the stages are fun to play and do a lot of innovative things like playing around with gravity and such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still some challenging stages. Two of them specifically come to mind: The first one is Galaxy&amp;rsquo;s Greatest Wave, which is one of the aforementioned ray-surfing stages. The race course is very twisty and challening, and if you take each turn too fast or don&amp;rsquo;t turn just the right amount, you&amp;rsquo;re going to be falling off. There are a number of 1-ups along the course, and I managed to get to 99 lives in trying to finish the course. My personal estimate is that I probably re-did the course at least a hundred times. The second one that comes to mind is Luigi&amp;rsquo;s Purple Coins, a stage only available after beating the game the first time. It&amp;rsquo;s a stage where you have to be constantly jumping across disappearing platforms while collecting purple coins all within a time limit. It took me a lot less tries than the ray-surfing one, but each try was exhausting since you&amp;rsquo;re jumping all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I wish they would have done for this port was add more button support for the menus, instead of having to use tap/motion control for many of them (such as when retrying a level).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1317023064555548672/&#34;&gt;finished Galaxy for the first time&lt;/a&gt; last week, and completed the bonus Purple coin missions a few days later. That makes it the first game of this trilogy where &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1318238520251621377/&#34;&gt;I hit the goal of 120 stars&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the first two games though, Galaxy has an additional &amp;ldquo;second quest&amp;rdquo;, an additional 120 stars to be earned while playing as Luigi. Again, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably come back to this at another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Switch is a great console for these games, since I can easily pick it up at any time and play a couple of stages in handheld mode. I was worried whether this purchase would be worth it, since to be honest I&amp;rsquo;m getting a bit old and am not as good as the platforming stuff as I used to be. Platforming in 3d only adds an additional level of difficulty for me personally. But overall, it was a good purchase. I somehow managed to beat two of the games, and it was nice to see how the 3d Mario games evolve through the years. It&amp;rsquo;s too bad they didn&amp;rsquo;t include Galaxy 2, which by all accounts is as good as Galaxy was. My fingers and wrists are tired from all the jumping though, so maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll put down the Switch for a few days before I get started with Odyssey.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;rsquo;m already in the middle of setting up the new server, so I think I&amp;rsquo;ll be ready by early November anyway. Most of the code to run the new blog is also mostly ready (who knows how many bugs there are though!) I am (re-)learning a lot about server setups though, so hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll have quite a few blog posts to write the migration is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming: Hey, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1317023064555548672/&#34;&gt;finished Super Mario Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;! There&amp;rsquo;s 15 post-game stars only available after beating the game, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to work through them before moving on to Odyssey, alhough some of them are quite stressful. (Apparently there&amp;rsquo;s an entire 120 stars again afterwards in some kind of second quest, but I figure I can come back to that some other time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still ongoing: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober2020&#34;&gt;the Inktober thing&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s surprising that I haven&amp;rsquo;t missed a day yet. (Hopefully I haven&amp;rsquo;t jinxed it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching lately: I&amp;rsquo;ve taken to having old seasons of NCIS running in the background (via Prime Video) recently, they&amp;rsquo;re the sort of show you can just leave running while you&amp;rsquo;re doing other things, and if you miss something it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. I also started on Expanse season 4, but that requires more focused watching so the going is slow. I have some backlog to work through, since The Boys season 2 and Star Trek Discovery season 3 are both out now.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The world continues to be terrible. The PH government wants people to get back to work and everything to spur the economy (with health precautions and everything). A lot of people have no choice, but I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate enough to not have to go out there yet, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure people like me will still hold back. This all would have been a lot easier if the government had gotten control of this pandemic early on but it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still not writing blog posts apparently. I have a lot of thoughts swirling in my head, I&amp;rsquo;m sure they&amp;rsquo;ll pop out sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming: Hey, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1314224120490389504/&#34;&gt;finished Super Mario Sunshine&lt;/a&gt;! I started Super Mario Galaxy right afterwards. It&amp;rsquo;s actually interesting playing through these 3d Mario games for the first time, since I can see how things evolve. Will hopefully have some good thoughts for the eventual review, probably after I also play Odyssey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still ongoing: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober2020&#34;&gt;the Inktober thing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still ongoing: The site rewrite project. It&amp;rsquo;s going reasonably well, and might be ready soonish (famous last words), so I started looking into the new server as well. I&amp;rsquo;ve also mentioned before that I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/03/rip-webfaction/&#34;&gt;migrate to a new webhost because GoDaddy etc.&lt;/a&gt;, and I had been leaning towards getting a VPS on Linode so I tried to do that this week, but for some reason they kept rejecting my application, so I just went with DigitalOcean instead. They give free two months $100 credit, so I&amp;rsquo;m not paying for anything until December or such, so that&amp;rsquo;s nice. I spent a couple of hours wrangling with Nginx + uWSGI + my app on Ubuntu, with permission problems and everything. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll figure it out eventually!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some recent fun things on the internet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Toadsanime/status/1312880060899233797&#34;&gt;Twitter thread about free indie games&lt;/a&gt;. Not like I have time to play all of these, but I find it fun to browse these lists and fantasize about my lifelong dream of being an indie game developer that I still hope to eventually get back to someday (why not today)? Anyway, check them out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vulture.com/article/most-influential-best-scenes-animation-history.html&#34;&gt;100 Sequences that shaped animations&lt;/a&gt;. Some fun history of animation stuff to go through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBpxhfBlVLU&#34;&gt;Why do mirrors flip horizontally but not vertically?&lt;/a&gt;(Youtube video). I always have trouble explaining this, so this one was nice to watch.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the news this week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donald Trump, who for some reason is still the US president, has tested positive for Covid19, adding even more chaos and uncertainty to the US election season. The rest of the world has no choice but to pay attention, given how much US politics affects the rest of us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Philippines is now #20 worldwide in total Covid cases, yay! Yay?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some drama about the PH congress leadership? IDK, whatever man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annoyingly, I&amp;rsquo;ve not been doing any blog posts other than these weeknotes during the past few weeks. It is what it is though. I guess I haven&amp;rsquo;t really had time for longer writing things lately?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; busy, but the I have felt busy during the past week. Part of it is probably becaause I&amp;rsquo;ve started &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober2020&#34;&gt;doing the Inktober thing&lt;/a&gt;, so that&amp;rsquo;s an additional daily task. Another part of it is probably the fact that I purchased a Nintendo Switch last week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, gaming then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the aforementioned Nintendo Switch. I got Super Mario 3D All Stars and Link&amp;rsquo;s Awakening together with the purchase. I originally wanted to get Mario Odyssey, Fire Emblem and Paper Mario as well, but I figured two games (really four) was plenty for a first set, and my brother was going to lend me Odyssey anyway. I started playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/09/1310497720117784577/&#34;&gt;Mario 64&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not too far in, but I found the camera really problematic, and I can&amp;rsquo;t play it for too long without getting dizzy. I also started playing Super Mario Sunshine, which was a noticeable improvement camera-wise, and I can play it for extended periods without dizziness problems, so I&amp;rsquo;m quite a bit farther along there. I hope to get back to Mario 64 eventually, but it&amp;rsquo;s no big loss if I don&amp;rsquo;t. I understand it&amp;rsquo;s a classic game a lot of people look back fondly on, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s aged well, and not just because of camera problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also tried the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1311655542008377346/&#34;&gt;free Super Mario 35 battle royale game&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s reasonably fun, although when you&amp;rsquo;re at the last 2-3 players, it takes a while to get to a winner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally managed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1311602939891535872/&#34;&gt;hit the 7 wins in Zendikar Rising draft&lt;/a&gt;! Standard is still terrible though. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll just play 1 draft a week and that&amp;rsquo;s it? The MTG community was also in an uproar the past few weeks, both due to the poor state of standard and due to some controversy over an upcoming Secret Lair crossover with The Walking Dead. WOTC has implied they are looking at expanding Magic mechanics to other IPs, so the TWD thing is mostly a trial balloon, I think. Many people are upset and are predicting the death of Magic, but the game has been pronounced dead before. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens. I&amp;rsquo;m not personally affected (since I don&amp;rsquo;t Commander), my primary concern is the health of Standard formats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday gaming group picked up a new multiplayer game, it&amp;rsquo;s Root, from Leder Games (and published for digital by Dire Wolf, creators of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/&#34;&gt;Eternal&lt;/a&gt;). It&amp;rsquo;s reasonably complicated, and thematically and mechanically quite different from the last digital boardgame we were doing (Blood Rage).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned last week that I was planning to participate in &lt;a href=&#34;https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/&#34;&gt;Hacktoberfest&lt;/a&gt;. I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet, and there was some controversy over the past few weeks, with OSS maintainers complaining about spam PRs due to the event. Apparently, it was the fault of a Youtube who had a few hundred thousand followers. He had made a video showing how easy it was to make PRs and win the event swag, and a lot of people were following his low effort examples. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;ll still participate, though I have been looking around a few repos here and there, we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, I haven&amp;rsquo;t watched anything of note the past week. A couple of standup specials on Netflix, that&amp;rsquo;s it. I guess the Switch took most of my entertainment time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IFTTT, a service I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/01/ifttt/&#34;&gt;been using for a while now&lt;/a&gt;, has &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1312652625511280640/&#34;&gt;obnoxiously been insisting I upgrade to their Pro tier&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;rsquo;re going to start severely restricting free accounts, so I&amp;rsquo;m looking to minimize my usage of the service moving forward. All of the social media syndication stuff can be handled by the new blog backend I&amp;rsquo;m writing, so that&amp;rsquo;s fine. The only things that should remain are stuff I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked into automating myself yet, mainly backing up of SMS, so I&amp;rsquo;ll probably look into that soonish. I&amp;rsquo;m not against paying for services, but in this case it&amp;rsquo;s simply not worth it for me, since I can trivially write my own replacement software for most of my usage of the service. So long IFTTT, it&amp;rsquo;s been swell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no closing words of wisdom today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;October is imminent! There are two distractions I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to in the coming month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober/&#34;&gt;Inktober&lt;/a&gt;, which I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing since 2016. Basically it&amp;rsquo;s just to do 30 ink drawings in October, one per day. There are some &lt;a href=&#34;https://inktober.com/rules&#34;&gt;official prompts&lt;/a&gt;, which I&amp;rsquo;ll probably follow. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really done any serious &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt; in a while, maybe this will help me get back into the groove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second one is &lt;a href=&#34;https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/&#34;&gt;Hacktoberfest&lt;/a&gt;! Basically it&amp;rsquo;s an event where you have to submitted some number of GitHub PRs in October, and there&amp;rsquo;s some swag for people who finished. I last &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/02/hacktoberfest/&#34;&gt;participated in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, skipped last year because I was a bit busy. I have a bit more free time this year, so hopefully I can get into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these are welcome distractions, as the world continues to suck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past week, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the Django-based rewrite for my personal site (this one!). It&amp;rsquo;s one of those projects where I find myself being productive not because of deadlines or anything like that, but because I genuinely enjoy working on it. When I find myself thinking of of new things that need to be done, or a new feature, or a way to solve an interesting problem, I am cursed (blessed?) with restlessness until I get it done. There are a number of challenges with the way I chose to approach this problem, most probably the subject of a future blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned this before, but I went ahead and paid for a year of the Micro plan on Migadu.com. The email in/out limits aren&amp;rsquo;t that high, but the price is decent, and I don&amp;rsquo;t really use my personal email that much anyway (I&amp;rsquo;m no spammer!). I&amp;rsquo;ll re-evaluate next year whether I want to migrate. (Sets a calendar event.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve watched this past week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went ahead and watched the second season of Umbrella Academy. It&amp;rsquo;s more or less structured like the first season: each member has their own problems; five discovers an upcoming apocalypse, so he tries to bring everyone together; also, there&amp;rsquo;s people who want to kill them. The ending of this is more satisfying than S1 though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enola Holmes on Netflix. It was ok, but it&amp;rsquo;s more of a young adult story, maybe a bit above the Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming this past week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;managed to get in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgznr/&#34;&gt;couple more Zendikar Rising drafts&lt;/a&gt;. Fun format, but I continue to have a terrible record, with only one draft actually going well. I did get a refund for that last one, so let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can&amp;rsquo;t do better this coming week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;additional drop on the Civ6 New Frontier pass came out, giving us Gaul and Byzantium. A friend and I tried it in a multiplayer game. I played Byz and he went with Gaul; we only played for a couple of hours, but both new civs seem quite powerful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my SC2 group managed to finish the Wings of Liberty coop campaign! Pretty fun, and it was fun to relive the story too, as I had already forgotten a lot of it. We started the Heart of the Swarm version the next day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday gaming group have been playing Blood Rage over the past few months, and it even came out with a new DLC/expansion a couple of weeks ago. The game client is a bit buggy, but we tolerate it because it&amp;rsquo;s a fun/deep game anyway. We&amp;rsquo;re looking at maybe trying out a different game next week though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia was meh this week, the topics weren&amp;rsquo;t really to our liking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I purchased last month&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription&#34;&gt;Humble Choice&lt;/a&gt; (or rather, let it lapse into purchase). It&amp;rsquo;s not unreasonable, there&amp;rsquo;s some games there I can try like Forager and Evoland, and given my recent streak of Mario playing, I was wanting a platformer for the PC, so Yooka Layle isn&amp;rsquo;t a bad idea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Late-breaking Sunday news: I have kind of impulse bought a Nintendo Switch. Well, I was agonizing over it for a while, but stores were selling it just a bit overpriced. Today I found that there was a slight price drop (around $40 worth) of the Labo bundle at one of my local stores, so I impulsively went ahead and ordered it. Maybe should have waited a day or so? regardless, it&amp;rsquo;s on the way, along with Zelda: Link&amp;rsquo;s Awakening and Super Mario 3D All Stars. No interest in the Labo personally, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll try to sell it off?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried using Messenger Rooms for a family conf call today, in lieu of Zoom which limits us to 40-minute calls. Might have been bad luck or poor internet, but the experience was substantially worse. Disconnections, lag, poor video quality, etc. We&amp;rsquo;ll see if they want to switch back to Zoom next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems weird that we are so close to the end of 2020 now. Still no idea what Christmas is going to look like. I&amp;rsquo;m sure many other people are also looking forward to closing out 2020 and going to 2021, even though that holds no logical promise of things being better than they are now. But we can always dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine this is already the 3rd week of September, it feels like the month is passing by quickly, although I haven&amp;rsquo;t been particularly busy recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did do some paid work this past week; not a lot, just filling in to provide some emergency support/consultation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the reason it feels like the week passed by quickly is that I started a new side project (like many programmers, I am afflicted by the curse of wanting to start too many side projects). This one will probably get finished: I&amp;rsquo;m writing a Django based server for this website. I am generally happy with the current Hugo workflow I use for publishing things here, but the build times have struggled with the sheer number of posts I have. This started back when I decided to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/10/archive-of-my-own/&#34;&gt;start importing my social media activity to this site&lt;/a&gt;, which increased the post count from a couple of thousand to more than twenty thousand now. Even the automated builds take forever, and I can&amp;rsquo;t even run the local Hugo build on my laptop due to too many open files error on Mac. And Hugo is already one of the faster static site generators, so I have doubt that other SSGs would be able to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I briefly considered moving back to Wordpress, but that seems like a step back. I also briefly considered writing a new backend using a new programming language like Rust, giving me an opportunity to learn something new as well. But I kind of needed to get this done quickly, given that I have a pending server migration within the next couple of months; it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary, but it would be nice to have the new system up in place by the time I do that, so that all the migration happens in one go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still generally happy with the workflow of writing using my local editor and pushing markdown files to git, so I plan to retain that. The Django webapp will have a database, but that will be a secondary data structure used mainly for indexing and searches. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be some kind of weird file system/database storage, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how that goes. Anyway, probably more details on all that when I am ready to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching this past week: I finished both seasons of Cobra Kai. The series is decent. I&amp;rsquo;m here mostly for the Karate Kid nostalgia and the Lawrence/LaRusso rivalry. Season two had a lot of high school drama, which I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too interested in, so I liked the first season a lot more. Will still probably watch S3 when it comes out on Netflix. Now to figure out what to watch next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming this past week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zendikar Rising is out on Magic Arena! I&amp;rsquo;ve already played a couple of drafts, but things didn&amp;rsquo;t go as well as I hoped, so now I am poor, will probably be able to draft again in a couple of days. Hopefully I get better at this format, as I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to draft this set a lot; posts on these should be under &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgznr/&#34;&gt;the mtgznr tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t play much else this week other than the regular multiplayer games with the gaming groups SC2, Blood Rage, etc. I have yet to find a new game to knock off the backlog. I have also been considering trying out some of the smaller indie games in my collection, and maybe streaming some let&amp;rsquo;s play/reviews for them, as a bit of support for indie game devs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this week was the much awaited PS5 announcement, with pricing and release dates and everything! The $499 price tag is reasonable, but I probably won&amp;rsquo;t be getting one on launch, since there&amp;rsquo;s not a lot of games I want immediately. I will admit to getting a bit excited at the FF16 reveal, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably a ways off. I&amp;rsquo;m probably more likely to get a Switch first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trivia team put up a new chaotic video of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U52L9c2kB8M&#34;&gt;us playing some trivia&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out, like, subscribe, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big news from the other side of the pacific is that US SC Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has died. &amp;ldquo;No no no&amp;rdquo; was trending on Twitter for a little bit, and a lot of people on my timeline were swearing. I had a short discussion with some friends living on the west coast about it. Many of my US friends also have some level of anxiety/worry about what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen during/after their elections. It&amp;rsquo;s actually annoying how informed I am about US politics, although it doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect me directly. Like it or not though, the US further sliding into single-party autocracy will likely be bad for the rest of the world, so let&amp;rsquo;s all hope they get their shit together.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It has certainly been a week, yes it has. The world continues to turn (and burn even).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy. Not so much with work, though there was a bit of that due to a required emergency software change (aren&amp;rsquo;t they always emergencies?). I wasn&amp;rsquo;t doing the emergency work myself, more like consulting and advising how to approach it, so not much to tell there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did quite a bit of work on my personal data processes/backups/workflows. It involved streamlining my backups, dedepulication, going through old records and cleaning them up, and so on. Some combination of Python scripts and manual work was required. One specific thing I did was to get a whole bunch of my old photos out of Google Photos and onto disk backups, and also had to do some deduplication there. I was able to remove around 1300 duplicates from over 12000 photos, so around 10% ish duplication rate, not too bad. My original intent was to remove them from Google Photos, dedupe, then add them back, but now I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure I need to add them back. The main advantage of Google Photos has been that they make the photos more searchable, but I don&amp;rsquo;t seem to have an urgent need for that anyway, and probably there are other ways to do that? I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll look into it when the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also been browsing some old (physical) albums stored around the house. There&amp;rsquo;s another few thousand photos there, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of eventually digitizing them, as a means of backup, but that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work, so maybe in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming was good again this week. I finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/09/uncharted4/&#34;&gt;Uncharted 4&lt;/a&gt;! I guess any week where I manage to tick something off the backlog is a good week. Last weekend I mentioned I was near the end, that was so untrue lol. Turned out more than half the game was still to come. My SC2 buddies and I started to play this 3-player coop version of the Wings of Liberty campaign (avaiable as custom arcade things), that&amp;rsquo;s been fun. Then the usual stuff: Blood Rage with the Saturday group. Quiz nights/codenames with the trivia team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kind of want to get into SFV again, presumably there&amp;rsquo;s a flood of new players coming in recently since it was free on PS+ this past month, so hopefully it won&amp;rsquo;t be so hard to find matches this time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My desire for a Nintendo Switch is being tempered by two things at the moment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rumors of a new, upgraded Switch coming out next year. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the first time that I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased a console just before it&amp;rsquo;s successor came out though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;frustration at the difficulty of the special stages in Super Mario 3D Land lol. It&amp;rsquo;s a stark reminder that I&amp;rsquo;m getting old and I&amp;rsquo;m not as good at these games as I used to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this week, I binged four seasons of Superstore. It&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable enough ensemble comedy, though it&amp;rsquo;s no Brooklyn Nine Nine. A lot of the characters&amp;rsquo; problems are of their own making due to selfishness, that&amp;rsquo;s always annoying. But it&amp;rsquo;s good enough for side-watching while I&amp;rsquo;m doing other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also started watching Cobra Kai, not even halfway through the first season yet. It&amp;rsquo;s slightly painful, since it casts Johnny Lawrence as the POV character/protagonist, and he&amp;rsquo;s kind of a loser asshole, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My desktop PC seems to be showing it&amp;rsquo;s age. It&amp;rsquo;s like recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been hitting 100% CPU and/or RAM much more often. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried uninstalling some unneeded software, hopefully that helps. I got this PC back in 2015, so it&amp;rsquo;s not unreasonable that I might need an upgrade soon, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I want to spend that money yet. I&amp;rsquo;m kind of hoping it can still hold on for a few years still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same thoughts for the rest of the world, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Late Game Review: Uncharted 4: A Thief&#39;s End
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/09/uncharted4/</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2020 09:15:38 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I finished Uncharted 4: A Thief&amp;rsquo;s End yesterday, and I felt like making a post about it, since I had a bunch of screenshots. Late game review because the game came out in 2016. I think I got it from PS+? Certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first played the original Uncharted trilogy back in 2010-2011, but I found out just now while writing this post that I never finished Uncharted 3 (started yes, apparently), so that explains why some story elements seemed unfamiliar in the 4th game. (I think I may have also gotten the trilogy remaster via PS+, so maybe I should play the 3rd game too? Maybe.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually have to thank the Uncharted series for getting my into this kind of single player adventure game in the first place. After Uncharted, I played some kinda similar games like Infamous, Tomb Raider etc, I was never that into the genre before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main complaint with the series is the sheer suspension of disbelief it requires to imagine a person like Nathan Drake could exist: basically a human at peak physical ability, able to fearlessly leap off high cliffs and cling onto walls with unbelievable grip and upper body strength, barely ever getting tired, while at the same time good enough at gunplay to go up against armies of battle-hardened mercenaries and come out on top. Oh, and he has an intimate knowledge of archaeology and is also able to find ancient lost treasures and cities all the time apparently. And also he&amp;rsquo;s pretty good at sketching. It&amp;rsquo;s fine, after all what are video games but power fantasies right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncharted 4 gives us a deeper look at Nathan Drake&amp;rsquo;s background and how he grew up to be like this, and we find out that not only is he this human at the peak of physical ability, he also has a brother who, despite 15 years rotting away in some backwater prison, is also at peak physical ability and also has all the rest of Nathan&amp;rsquo;s abilities (except the sketching though). (Cue Star Wars prequel meme &amp;ldquo;This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from that minor complaint, the games are pretty great though. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, the games are highly linear and story-driven, consisting of set pieces and sequences that are either platforming/exploratory (figure out how to get from point A to point B) or combat/stealth vs the aforementioned armies of battle-hardened mercenaries. Oh, and there&amp;rsquo;s the occasional puzzle too. Uncharted 4 adds some new elements such as letting you drive a car (4 wheel drive) around in what seems like an open world (it really isn&amp;rsquo;t), but it&amp;rsquo;s still mostly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a big action game player, so I dislike the combat parts and I die a lot there. You can see in one of the screenshots later that my shooting accuracy rate was like 49%. For this reason, I&amp;rsquo;m not inclined to go for achievement completion on this one (or any of the Uncharted games for that matter), since there are many combat-related and difficulty-related trophies, and even one that requires me to finish the game with like a 70% accuracy rate. Good luck with that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dying a lot isn&amp;rsquo;t a problem, as the game is very forgiving. There are a generous number of checkpoints, and there&amp;rsquo;s really no penalty for dying too much. (Again, you can see in the stats screenshot that I failed checkpoints 105 times.) It&amp;rsquo;s kind of unavoidable with on-rails games like these - there are plenty of spots where if you don&amp;rsquo;t climb or run or jump in just the exact way the game wants, you&amp;rsquo;ll die and fail the checkpoint. It&amp;rsquo;s not super frustrating since you never really have to repeat too much, but it&amp;rsquo;s that kind of game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I guess Nathan Drake is famous now, because people know about his discoveries from the first 3 games, but I feel like he should be richer than he is portrayed. Not that he&amp;rsquo;s poor, but surely he got away with a few valuable trinkets here and there during his adventures right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Story-wise it feels like they planned this to be Nathan Drake&amp;rsquo;s final run, given the epilogue, but who knows? I mean in their universe, Sully is pretty old but he still also does ridiculous stunts with the rest of the gang. And they did introduce some new characters, so it&amp;rsquo;s not far-fetched there&amp;rsquo;ll be another Uncharted game later on, possibly with someone else as the lead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, game is pretty good, play it if you can, happy to have ticked it off the backlog! Have some screenshots:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s September! The last six months were a blur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s considered &amp;ldquo;Christmas season&amp;rdquo; over here already I guess. The local memes are that once the clock hits midnight between Aug 31 and Sep 1, your neighbor&amp;rsquo;s Christmas lights are magically up. Also of course the famous Jose Mari Chan gets famous starting September, since malls and stores love to play his Christmas songs during this time. IDK what to expect for Christmas season this year though, since we are still in a pandemic. I keep telling my mom not to get her hopes up that we (i.e. my brothers and their families) will all be able to get together as tradition dictates. It&amp;rsquo;s possible, but I&amp;rsquo;m not optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My week was kinda busy. Not really in terms of work, but in terms of&amp;hellip; high school stuff, I guess? My high school batch hosted our 25th year alumni homecoming this past weekend. Since we were unlucky enough to have it in the middle of the pandemic, it was an online-only affair, with presentations and raffles and whatnot. And a quiz night! A lot of my batchmates did a lot more work, my participation was mostly limited to some tech stuff, since I had access to the database of registrants for the raffle, and also representing the batch at the Pisay Quiz Night held online. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only PQN team member, I was just the one assigned to join the zoom and show the whiteboard; I was drafted against my will due to my past quiz night experience. My other batchmates were supporting me from a Discord, I basically streamed the Zoom call to them via Discord (which is really troublesome, always has tech issues) and they fed me possible answers etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting my PQN participation to take too much time, but there was like a tech rehearsal and a dry run before the event proper, to make sure everything worked well and that all the team got it, plus my team also got together a couple of times for &amp;ldquo;practice.&amp;rdquo; I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to take it seriously, as with all online quiz nights I&amp;rsquo;m mostly there for the fun since it&amp;rsquo;s super likely for at least some people on some teams to be googling their answers lol. The PQN is super competitive though, I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s to be expected given the nature of Pisay. We didn&amp;rsquo;t win, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the final scores yet, but I guess that we finished around middle of the pack among the 22 teams, but we had a good time (more or less!) and it was fun hanging out with the batchmates virtually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming this week was pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/09/1301222471568297984/&#34;&gt;and finished Disco Elysium&lt;/a&gt; during the first half of the week. Fantastic game, and I was probably unhealthily engrossed in it for like 2-3 days. I was so into the whole mystery thing, when the game warned me that I was at a critical point and that proceeding further would end other sidequests, I just created a save and pushed to the finish anyway. I went back later to load and finish the other side stuff. It&amp;rsquo;s the kind of game you&amp;rsquo;d enjoy if you like getting your Speech skill to 100 in Fallout. It&amp;rsquo;s very well-written and had some really great/shocking moments. Since it has very little actual &amp;ldquo;action&amp;rdquo; aside from delving inside the MC&amp;rsquo;s thoughts, I understand that it&amp;rsquo;s not for everybody, but it&amp;rsquo;s certainly a worthwhile experience. I thought about writing a full review post, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll save that for when/if I manage full achievement completion (looks tough!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after getting distracted by Disco Elysium, I went ahead and resumed my Uncharted 4 game. I think I&amp;rsquo;m close to the end on this one, should finish it this coming week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;already half way through the Super Mario 3D Land special worlds. Speaking of Mario, Nintendo announced a bunch of new Mario releases for the Switch this past week, which significantly increases my want for a Switch. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how long I can hold off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;still playing my regular games with the playgroups: Starcraft 2 Coop, Blood Rage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it&amp;rsquo;s September, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing my regularly quarterly data backups/exports. One of them is Google Takeout. The last one was back in April, and that last export was 27 chunks (they split it into 2GB or less chunks). The new one is 44 chunks! I suspect the huge increase is because I&amp;rsquo;ve been streaming on Twitch and exporting them to Youtube, so they&amp;rsquo;re probably part of this current export. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even export everything this time, since I don&amp;rsquo;t need to re-export data from those services I&amp;rsquo;m no longer using. One of my ongoing projects is reducing my Google footprint, so I need to figure out how to get the size of this export down.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>On Mobile App Development
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/09/mobile-app-dev/</link>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;This post is just quite a few thoughts on mobile apps and mobile app development, all mishmashed together. I don&amp;rsquo;t claim to be a mobile app specialist, at best I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;em&gt;dabbled&lt;/em&gt; in them, but enough to form some opinions I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-bit-of-history&#34;&gt;A Bit of History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first exposure to mobile app development when I got pulled to help my then-company&amp;rsquo;s then-fledgling mobile team with cleaning up the codebase for their iOS app. This was back in maybe 2011? It was one of those projects where some devs built a quick proof-of-concept demo using new technology, then management liked it and asked for new features and they kept adding new features haphazardly until there was just this huge unmaintainable mess of code. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a knock against Objective-C or iOS development specifically or the dev team; the fact is they were new to the stack and were learning as they went while still trying to meet deadlines. I also spent some time reviewing the corresponding Android team&amp;rsquo;s code as well. This was the bulk of my exposure to native mobile dev on iOS/Android. (This was before Swift, so I never got to experience that. Language looks neat though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from a web dev background, I&amp;rsquo;ve always found the fragmentation of platforms annoying. Basically your effort gets multiplied by the number of platforms you have to support, and what would work well on iOS may not work well on Android and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, this concern was alleviated a bit with the rise of common frameworks that could publish to both iOS and Android. The first one I tried of these was React Native. I tried it for a small mobile project I did around 3-ish years ago. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t tremendously happy with the experience. My mistake was probably diving head-first into React Native, when this was my first experience with React and front-end frameworks in general (something new to someone with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/02/old-web/&#34;&gt;my jQuery background&lt;/a&gt;!), so a lot of concepts were new to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, the React Native docs at that time seemed to assume some familiarity already with React, or at least similar frameworks like Angular. I had a bit of confusion with whether I should be using Expo or not, and how to eject, and it resulted in having to restart the project a couple of times. It was also my first encounter with NPM&amp;rsquo;s dependency management, and that annoyed me a lot. A lot of the third-party dependencies I used back then were still immature too, so I often had problems with things like accessing the camera roll and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it was experience, and the ability to publish cross-platform to iOS and Android was invaluable. I went on to use React Native as my go-to mobile framework I would recommend for other projects afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had to do a UI revamp for that small mobile app I wrote three years ago, and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t touched it for a while so I had some trouble with NPM trying to get it to run. In frustration, I gave up on it and decided to rewrite it in Flutter, of which I&amp;rsquo;ve heard good things. Flutter turned out to be great, and it took me just a little over two weeks, part-time to rewrite the app, probably slightly less effort than it took me to write it in the first place. I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough experience yet to have a detailed review of Flutter, but I was generally much happier with the experience compared to React. Part of that may be I&amp;rsquo;m much more familiar with the mobile landscape now and have a better idea of what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, but I really did encounter much fewer points of friction and Flutter seems to have much better documentation. I believe it will be my first choice of frameworks moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;not-everything-needs-to-be-a-native-app&#34;&gt;Not Everything Needs to Be a Native App&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that annoys me about mobile apps is that people/companies unnecessarily want things to be native mobile apps when they would work perfectly fine as web apps. I can understand applications such as Uber may need numerous native functionality (GPS, timely notifications, offline functionality), so that&amp;rsquo;s fine (although many of those things are available using modern browser APIs as well!). Things like online newspapers, forums like Reddit, and so on, are perfectly fine as normal web apps, and should stop prompting me to install their native apps when they detect I am on mobile. Granted that you may get a much better UX experience with a native app, but you also have to install it locally and grant it more access than what the browser&amp;rsquo;s sandbox provides, and that feels like a tradeoff decision that the user needs to make, and not something to nag the user about constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess part of it is that I grew up with the open web and have a significant bias towards it. In general, if I can just access an app via web, I will prefer that, unless the native app experience is vastly superior or otherwise necessary. And this focus on native apps can be bad for the web. This is apparent in apps like Instagram, which don&amp;rsquo;t allow you to use their primary function - uploading images - on a desktop browser. I also had a similar discussion with a freelance client a few years ago, when they wanted to make a mobile app, but not a corresponding web platform, when all of the app&amp;rsquo;s functionality was simple stuff that web could do easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;different-platforms&#34;&gt;Different Platforms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differences in iOS and Android are particularly annoying to me as a developer, especially since I&amp;rsquo;m used to web development. With web, everything is open and standards-based, so you generally write everything using a single stack, and any reasonably standards-compliant web browser will work with the web app in a reasonably consistent way. (Granted, there will be browser-specific issues, but nowadays those aren&amp;rsquo;t too common.) With iOS and Android, you have to test on both platforms extensively, and the build processes and distribution methods are different for each. Frameworks like React Native and Flutter lighten this load considerably, but you still really have to devote more time and resources to testing on the different platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;backward-compatibility&#34;&gt;Backward Compatibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, this one may be an unfounded concern of mine since I don&amp;rsquo;t have much experience in the matter, but I have this worry that native mobile apps tend to &lt;em&gt;rot&lt;/em&gt; more easily, and by &lt;em&gt;rot&lt;/em&gt; I mean, get worse with time, as the mobile OSes upgrade themselves very rapidly. Unlike, say, Windows, which gets a new major version every few years, iOS and Android are constantly getting new versions and more importantly, deprecating APIs and adding new ones! Hence my worry that unmaintained, a perfectly functional app may become unworkable a few years down the line and no longer work on the latest mobile OSes. It&amp;rsquo;s my totally unfounded belief that this is a significant reason why &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/itunes-purchases/&#34;&gt;more than 50% of my lifetime App Store purchases are no longer listed on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. (And also why I&amp;rsquo;ve pretty much disavowed making mobile purchases again.) Say what you will about Windows, but at least they have a pretty good record of backward compatibility when software I&amp;rsquo;ve written for Windows in the early 2000s is still very likely to run on Windows today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;closed-platforms&#34;&gt;Closed Platforms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue I have with native apps is that I have been used to working on open platforms. Windows, for all its faults, is still an open platform, and anyone can write software for it and distribute it using whatever method they desire. And the web is even more open and standards-based (for now at least). For mobile, Android is mostly open, but iOS is mostly a closed platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&amp;rsquo;s tight control over the iOS platform has been in the tech news recently. First was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation&#34;&gt;the kerfuffle with hey.com&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago, and more recently, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/&#34;&gt;their removal of Fortnite and battle with Epic&lt;/a&gt; due to Epic&amp;rsquo;s objection to Apple taking a cut of all purchases on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a mobile developer, the most annoying things about Apple&amp;rsquo;s tight control over iOS apps are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that $100 annual fee for an Apple Developer account. If you&amp;rsquo;re a 1st world developer, that cost isn&amp;rsquo;t much, but if you&amp;rsquo;re a young hobbyist developer in a poorer country who just wants to try making an app, it can be a significant hurdle. Google also charges you some token amount for Play Store access, but at least it&amp;rsquo;s just a one-time fee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the fact that you need to use a Mac to publish apps to the App Store. This is another significant hurdle for hobbyist developers; Macs are typically very expensive computers. Granted Android development requires a beefy setup too, but at least you get a choice of platform for Android development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App store review can be unpredictable; sometimes things that were perfectly fine during a previous release are now flagged in the next review. It feels like you need to get lucky with the reviewer you get. And if the reviewer is unfair to your app, you may be out of luck unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big company like Epic or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/wordpress-developers-says-apple-wants-30-percent-of-its-profits-from-app-store/&#34;&gt;Wordpress that can raise a stink about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the issues that could be levied against Apple for their monopoly over the App Store could be largely addressed if the platform allowed users to install apps via alternative methods, the same way Android does. I fully understand that Apple&amp;rsquo;s tight controls enable a safer environment for naive end users (presumably, assuming they don&amp;rsquo;t screw up), and I actually approve some of their controls like their iOS14 plans to restrict targetted advertising. But more advanced users should be given the option to use alternative methods if they so choose. They can still flag apps installed via alternative methods as &amp;ldquo;potentially unsafe&amp;rdquo; and add hurdles to prevent less capable users from being easily tricked by malicious actors, (Android does this, I believe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-conclusion&#34;&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really have a point here. Maybe I just want everything to be open? I like open platforms lol.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This last week was weird. I feel like I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get much done in terms of productivity, yet I don&amp;rsquo;t feel I was unproductive. A very relaxed and chill week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again a tiny bit of work done this past week, some fixes, including to side projects. I also spent some time preparing for some events next weekend. Although I wasn&amp;rsquo;t productive this week, I did outline a bit of a roadmap of new features for one of my side projects, hopefully I can get into that in the coming weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still in a pandemic! But I did have my first dine-in meal at a restaurant last Monday. It was because I went to get blood drawn for routine medical reasons, and I had needed to skip breakfast for the test (spoiler: my blood sugar levels were very, very normal). So after getting the blood drawn I was super hungry and decided to have breakfast at the nearby Pancake House. I was the only customer since it was super early (and you know, pandemic), although a second guy came in after I had given my order. I almost subconsciously picked up the glass of water to sip from it as soon as it was served, luckily I remembered I was wearing a face mask and a face shield. I decided to hold off on removing the gear until the actual pancakes were served, to minimize the exposure time. The next day I also decided to have a snack at a Starbucks after running some errands, mainly because I had a free coffee from Globe Rewards. It was afternoon so there were a few other customers there. The cashier said it was ok to dine in, but for a maximum of one hour only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a longish post I was writing, but it felt too raw to publish and might break it up into smaller posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We actually managed to win an online quiz night this week! It&amp;rsquo;s been a while, good job trivia team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels great to no longer be following the covid19 stats regularly, even though they are still fairly terrible. UP experts are projecting that we get the reproduction rate to below 1 in like a month though, so that&amp;rsquo;s some good news, though we may still be a ways away from getting this under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching and playing the past week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still playing a lot of SC2 Coop, trying to unlock the new prestiges. Levelling the commanders again can be a pain, but at least they managed to provide new goals/objectives for the players, breathing back a bunch of life into this game mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still drafting Amonkhet Remastered, although the last few drafts haven&amp;rsquo;t gone well. Need to save up gems, so I&amp;rsquo;ll do one last one draft once I get enough gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Huh, I guess I kind of paused Uncharted 4 for most of the week, not sure why. I should get back to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started re-playing Super Mario 3D Land (on the 3DS) lately, mostly to stave off my desire to get a Nintendo Switch (prices are still inflated here due to supply issues!). I had forgotten a lot about this game, so even when I finished the first 8 worlds and rescued Princess Peach, I was pleasantly surprised to find there were another 8 &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; worlds to play!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watched the video game history documentary &lt;strong&gt;High Score&lt;/strong&gt; on Netflix. Pretty good, although there&amp;rsquo;s some Dragon Quest erasure going on in the RPG episode!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watched &lt;strong&gt;Bill and Ted Face the Music&lt;/strong&gt;, this was a most excellent sequel. I found the start a bit clunky (I always find it awkward watching characters be awkward), but the rest of it was a fun and sweet adventure that echoed elements of both of the first two movies. A lot of the time travel stuff didn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense if you sat down and thought about it, but I was smiling through a lot of it. Little Billie and Theda are great!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also watched &lt;strong&gt;Superman: Man of Tomorrow&lt;/strong&gt;, the first entry in the new DC animated universe (following the reboot at the end of Justice League Dark: Apokolips). Yet another Superman origin story here. Not too happy with this one. Not fond of the animated style, and the writing and plot seemed weird at many points. I felt like there could have been a better way to resolve the whole situation with the big bad that felt more &amp;ldquo;Superman&amp;rdquo;-like, and the movie doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to earn the monicker &amp;ldquo;Man of Tomorrow&amp;rdquo; for the hero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for one reason or another, I also ended up watching a few standup specials on Amazon Prime. A couple from Craig Ferguson, and one from Jimmy Yang.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cobra Kai is now on Netflix! Yet another thing to add to the ever-increasing backlog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some tech stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have about three months left on my Webfaction hosting, which I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/03/rip-webfaction/&#34;&gt;been planning to migrate away from&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m currently leaning towards getting a cheap $5/mo VPS from Linode, although I&amp;rsquo;m still willing to accept any recommendations. Switching to a VPS means more effort (since it won&amp;rsquo;t be a managed service anymore), but that should provide some learning opportunities. It&amp;rsquo;s just as well anyway, my apps have been pushing the memory limits on the current hosting, and even the cheapest Linode VPS provides more RAM.  I&amp;rsquo;ll probably start looking into the migration in September.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote before about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/gmail-migration/&#34;&gt;migrating away from GMail&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Migadu.com&amp;rsquo;s free tier for about half a year now. This past week, they wrote that they are sunsetting the free tier. Totally understandable, given the economy. They are also introducing a new Micro tier at $20 a year, with slightly better limits than the old free tier, so I may migrate to that near the end of September (when the free tier runs out). In theory, I could just try to run a mail server on whatever VPS I set up (see above bullet), but that&amp;rsquo;s a big hassle. This cost + the $5/mo for the VPS is still less than what I was paying for at Webfaction, so I don&amp;rsquo;t mind paying for this for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was notified by a local bank that their old web platform is being sunsetted and I needed to migrate to the new system, so I did that. But whenever I tried the migration steps, the process never completed, it just kept telling me it was processing. I finally had to message someone I knew on the dev team lol. Hopefully it can getr resolved next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The week after I posted about phoning in the weeknotes, here I am with one where there&amp;rsquo;s nothing much to report. Not that surprising, given how busy I was over the previous few weeks, I took the opportunity to take a more relaxing week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a bit of work to be done, but very miniscule by comparison. Minor fixes here and there, including to some side projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did get to write on the blog more, as expected. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope I can keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These week&amp;rsquo;s quiz nights were terrible for our team, but on the bright side, I got to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/08/quiz-night-sketches/&#34;&gt;do a couple of sketches&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching and playing the past week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continued drafting Amonkhet Remastered, although the last few drafts went a bit poorly. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgakr/&#34;&gt;mtgakr tag&lt;/a&gt; on this site has all the records.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After finishing D:OS2 and FF7R, I looked around for a new game to start and decided on Uncharted 4, which I guess I got free from Plus or something. I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten very far yet, but unsurprisingly Nathan Drake&amp;rsquo;s antics still really challenge one&amp;rsquo;s suspension of disbelief. He has to be one of the most peak-performance athletes in the world to consistently pull of the jumping and wall climbing stunts he regularly does. Not to mention being able to win over basically hordes of heavily-armed mercenaries in gunfights. Not that it&amp;rsquo;s not fun and engaging as a game, it just feels so ridiculous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dcfandome.com&#34;&gt;DC Fandome&lt;/a&gt; was today, I watched some panels and new trailers and such. I enjoyed the Suicide Squad reveals and the Wonder Woman 1984, Shazam 2 and Justice League Snyder cut trailers, plus previews for the new Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad games, looking forward to those. (I should probably get around to Arkham Origins first.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing to play SC2 coop and Blood Rage with the regular groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that there&amp;rsquo;s anything wrong with a bit of relaxing downtime, but I am hoping to eventually ramp up to being more productive in the coming weeks, especially with the side projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Filed under &amp;ldquo;Things I Don&amp;rsquo;t Really Grok&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;podcasts-and-audiobooks&#34;&gt;Podcasts and audiobooks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These 2 are kind of in the same boat. Their main sin is that they are audio-only. When consuming content, my order of preference for formats is roughly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;text (+images I guess) (most preferred)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;video (with audio)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;audio only (least preferred)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think these preferences have to do with information density: I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I prefer text because text can convey the most amount of information in the least amount of bits. I&amp;rsquo;ll also watch informative videos, to a point. If it&amp;rsquo;s movie-length, it better be damn entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves us with audio. I don&amp;rsquo;t see the appeal. I try podcasts, sometimes, when I&amp;rsquo;m out walking or such. Audiobooks, I&amp;rsquo;ve never tried. My main concern is the amount of attention you have to give the content. Because you only have the audio as a source of information, if you lose track of it, then why are you even bothering? And if I try to listen to an audiobook or podcast while doing something else that requires my attention, there&amp;rsquo;s a very low chance I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to absorb anything from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the few times I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to listen to podcasts while I&amp;rsquo;m out walking, I only dare to if I&amp;rsquo;m walking in this safe, short, and circular route inside our subdivision. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t dare do it in the streets outside where there&amp;rsquo;s real traffic. That seems like a recipe for being distracted while crossing the road, which CAN LEAD TO DEATH! Granted, the odds of such a disaster are fairly low, but why risk it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe if I still had a regular 2-hour commute (one way) to work, then audiobooks/podcasts would be more appealing while I sit in the back of an FX in Metro Manila traffic. But even then, I think I&amp;rsquo;d rather nap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make an exception for listening to music of course. Listening to music doesn&amp;rsquo;t take much concentration, and can easily happen as a background task, so that&amp;rsquo;s fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I just haven&amp;rsquo;t found the right podcast to follow? IDK, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a few. Never could keep it up as a habit. Also, can I subscribe to podcasts using RSS feeds? I think I can, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never tried it. Like, if I find a podcast on Spotify there doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be an RSS option?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;newsletters&#34;&gt;Newsletters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &amp;ldquo;Newsletters&amp;rdquo;, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean those popups that appear on news sites or commercial blogs asking you to subscribe to get updates or such. Those are just spammy marketing BS and I have no interest in such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &amp;ldquo;Newsletters&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;m referring to a recent trend in the tech/online world of people moving their writing from websites/blogs to newsletters via platforms such as substack. These have some merit, as it basically involves the type of blog writing I like to consume, except in email newsletter form. There are some such newsletters whose posts I&amp;rsquo;ve read and I do find their content interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s the problem? The problem is I want to treat this type of content the same way I treat blog posts and newspaper editorials - as casual reading that I can pick up and read at my leisure. And (for me at least), casual reading doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong in my email inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an inbox zero policy, and to achieve that I&amp;rsquo;m very strict about what I let in my email inbox. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly limited to actual conversations with people and important notifications. The email inbox is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; where I&amp;rsquo;d like to consume casual reading that I can pick up whenever I&amp;rsquo;d like. Just the idea of leaving them there while having unread markers is annoying. In theory I could filter them to a subfolder and then the unread count would accumulate there, but I don&amp;rsquo;t like unread counts even in my email subfolders!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have nothing against the Substack business model (writers gotta earn a living I guess) and I&amp;rsquo;m sure a lot of people don&amp;rsquo;t mind consuming casual reading content via email, but Substack (and similar platforms) should provide alternate ways to consume their content, preferably RSS feeds. In the meantime I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a service called &lt;a href=&#34;https://kill-the-newsletter.com/&#34;&gt;Kill the Newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe to a few newsletters I like. It works well enough (though I checked just now and one of the feeds, on a nonsubstack platform, seems to have stopped last June. I just created a new inbox in KTN for it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(It would be even better if the content writers made their content available on their own websites, instead of centralized in a silo like Substack!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, are there any newsletters anyone can recommend that might be relevant to my interests?&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Mozilla made the tech news recently for laying off a whole lot of people. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/&#34;&gt;Official statement&lt;/a&gt;). People were alarmed and worried about the future of what is the last major independent browser and the open web, bit it looks like it isn&amp;rsquo;t that bleak. Most of the layoffs were to teams other than those working on Firefox, things like the experimental browser engine Servo, devtools, and MDN. The core Gecko team seems to be unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that these things aren&amp;rsquo;t important. MDN, if you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, is a set of documentation of web standards and browser support, &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/&#34;&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt;, that is one of the best resources for web developers working on cross-platform things. Mozilla no longer funding it&amp;rsquo;s maintenance is a big deal, it means it&amp;rsquo;s less likely to be kept up-to-date, even though community work can still continue. Peter-Paul Koch, writer of &lt;a href=&#34;https://quirksmode.org&#34;&gt;quirksmode.org&lt;/a&gt;, which was the original resource for cross-browser compatibility back in the heyday of the browser wars, wrote an article about Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s problems titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2020/08/the_cult_of_the.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Cult of the Free&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; where he argues that it&amp;rsquo;s time to step out of this mentality that all these resources must be maintained for free by &amp;ldquo;the community&amp;rdquo;, but that we as consumers must get used to the idea of paying or donating to support these resources. Expecting &amp;ldquo;the community&amp;rdquo; to step in and maintain these resources &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2020/08/i_love_mdn_or_t.html&#34;&gt;also devalues the work of technical writers.&lt;/a&gt; Trying to get more people to support these &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; resources is a good idea, but I worry it goes against the grain of years of internet culture which has conditioned people to expect online content for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of contributing, a while back I had considered looking for open source projects I could contribute to, and preferred projects that I actively use. Given that I&amp;rsquo;d been using Firefox &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2004/10/firefox-1-0-on-november-9/&#34;&gt;since before version 1.0&lt;/a&gt;, one of the projects I considered was Firefox. I went through the whole rigmarole of &lt;a href=&#34;https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/windows_build.html&#34;&gt;their instructions to set up my machine for the Windows build&lt;/a&gt;, and just the setup process, which involved setting up and checking out code took more than an hour. That was fine for initial setup, but actually building and running Firefox itself took an additional hour or so. Might have been more than that even, it was a while back so I don&amp;rsquo;t clearly remember, but I do remember thinking that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time for these hour-long build times. The whole set up also took up a nontrivial amount of my SSD disk space (imagine how much worse the build time would have been if I had used my non-SSD drive!), which I am always dangerously low on. These 2 factors led me to shelve the idea for the time being; perhaps I could revisit the idea of contributing to Firefox when I upgraded my computer or had more SSD space available. (TBF, I kind of gave up real quick after the first build, maybe the builds get faster on succeeding runs?). So that&amp;rsquo;s my personal &amp;ldquo;contributing-to-Firefox&amp;rdquo; story, for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer size of the codebase and the long build times just drive home the point of how much modern browsers are these large complex beasts that are doing so much. They are pretty much an OS of their own since they host a ton of features and web applications and JIT JS and all of that. This means it&amp;rsquo;s really difficult for independent browser efforts to hit feature parity with modern web browsers - even just working with JS and CSS standards, there are so many to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drew DeVault laments that &lt;a href=&#34;https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/13/Web-browsers-need-to-stop.html&#34;&gt;Web browsers need to stop&lt;/a&gt; with all these new functionalities and APIs that add scope and complexity, and maybe focus more on performance, efficiency, etc. I do agree - if I was contributing to Firefox, I would want to find a way to reduce the massive memory footprint it always has. I don&amp;rsquo;t even use that many tabs, and I already feel burdened by Firefox&amp;rsquo;s memory footprint. (Pretty sure Chrome is pretty bad in this regard as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why care about Mozilla/Firefox at all? Why not just use Chrome, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty good right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, no, Chrome is not necessarily &amp;ldquo;pretty good&amp;rdquo;, given how it props up a surveillance capitalsm engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, even if you didn&amp;rsquo;t dislike Google, having a browser (engine) monoculture is not a good thing. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/02/old-web/&#34;&gt;got my start in web development&lt;/a&gt; at around the height of Internet Explorer 6&amp;rsquo;s dominance, and I&amp;rsquo;d rather not find my way back there. Granted, one of the issues back then was that IE6 was a stagnant platform that upstarts Firefox and eventually Chrome left behind. No such problem exists now, since Chrome is still in active development and still pushing new web standards forward. And the fact that Chrome is an open-source platform means in theory someone could just fork it if ever Google goes off the rails or such. (And people have already built indie browsers on top of Chrome of course!) But it&amp;rsquo;s still dangerous for a single company and/or codebase to be the sole major implementer of web standards. A single company dictating the future of the web isn&amp;rsquo;t a good thing, and is the very opposite of the idea of an &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: Maybe I should try building Chromium too, just for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&amp;rsquo;s all my ranting for today. In conclusion: reduce your surveillance capitalism footprint and support the open web, use Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;These weeknotes are coming in late in the day because of reasons. (The reasons being laziness and procrastination.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been kind of phoning in the weeknotes over the past few weeks, they&amp;rsquo;ve mostly been &amp;ldquo;hey, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy, so nothing of significance happened, but here are some things I watched/played.&amp;rdquo; Supposedly one of the side effects of writing regular updates is that you tend to look out for more interesting things to do so you have something to write about, even on an unconscious level. In the past few weeks, that has been problematic because (a) as mentioned, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with some things, so my excess time is devoted to less mentally taxing things like just watching movies/shows or destress with games; and (b) we are still in the middle of a pandemic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the pandemic, I read this piece recently on the Financial Times: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ft.com/content/32d79c87-1ade-4b63-8d14-7af1a553d963&#34;&gt;We won’t remember much of what we did in the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, about how the sameyness of our days in quarantine means our brains compress that data since so little of it is meaningful, affecting our perception of time. When 99% of your activities take place in the same environment, in your room during a zoom call, everything just tends to blur together. And I guess that reflected in the weeknotes too! (For that reason, I&amp;rsquo;m switching up the weeknotes format today to be more freeform prose, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if it sticks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the pandemic part 2, one thing I have been doing since the pandemic started is writing a regular series of notes, first as &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/covid19/&#34;&gt;one long post that I kept updating every couple of days or so&lt;/a&gt; then later I transitioned to regular weekly update notes, on the same day as these weeknotes. The idea was that in the future I could just browse the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/covid19/&#34;&gt;covid19 tag&lt;/a&gt; on the site and I could recall what things were like during the days of quarantine and the quality of the government response. And this was fine during the start, since things happened and unfolded quickly. But these past few months, the updates have fallen in the quagmire of sameyness as well: I only went out once every 1 or 2 weeks, everything was always getting worse, cases were always going up, government response was always terrible, and so on. One thing the last few months has made clear for me is that the government has no clear plan on controlling this thing and so I am highly pessimistic that things will change anytime soon. For that reason, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to pause on doing the covid19 update notes for now, unless some drastic change happens.(I have no expectation of Russia&amp;rsquo;s vaccine having any effect on our status quo anytime soon!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so how was my week? I wrapped up the things causing my busy-ness towards the middle of the week, so I expect to be less busy/stressed during the coming weeks. At the very least, I should be able to write on the blog more, and maybe do some work on some of my other side projects. I actually thought about writing some posts already last week but I was like you know what, I&amp;rsquo;ll just relax and watch things and play things and leave the writing to next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching and playing the past week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marvel&amp;rsquo;s Agents of SHIELD had their series finale last Thursday. I enjoyed the first half of this season, but the second half and the finale were just ok, maybe slightly meh. Still, the series finale was pretty good, wrapping things up nicely with a big bow. This series had a lot of haters, I think mostly because of mismatched expectations, because people wanted it to be more directly tied-in to the MCU movies, but that was never going to happen (maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll get that more with the coming Disney+ series). But I like it, it had a lot of fans, and it had a pretty good run. And it had Ghost Rider!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One things I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a bunch is Amonkhet Remastered, which came out on Magic Arena last Thursday. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing drafts over on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&#34;&gt;the twitch channel&lt;/a&gt;, and archiving them to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsD8jNRlYkw&amp;amp;list=PLmU0vkKslGXg6Pdu3_kaKx5oumTwftUUe&#34;&gt;this playlist on the Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly fun, though I need to play better. Watch me on Twitch/Youtube, or like and subscribe, all that jazz, if you like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oh, I also finally finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/08/1293051269129486337/&#34;&gt;Divinity Original Sin 2&lt;/a&gt;! I really dragged out that last act for a few months, but I finally got there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/08/1294146833359364097/&#34;&gt;tried out Fall Guys on PS4&lt;/a&gt; (free on PS+!). It&amp;rsquo;s fun but kind of frustrating, I guess this is why I don&amp;rsquo;t really play these battle royale kind of things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a little bit Street Fighter x Tekken because of a reddit thread and am once again disappointed that (a) it was such a missed opportunity; and (b) up to now it&amp;rsquo;s still not available on Steam in SEA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so one of the reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing these &amp;ldquo;watching/playing lately&amp;rdquo; posts and segments is because I want to track what I have been watching/playing at any particular point in the past. And maybe I can have like a widget on the site with things like &amp;ldquo;Recently played&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Last movie watched&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;d also want to be able to search/query for things like &amp;ldquo;what year did I watch so-and-so movie?&amp;rdquo; (Helps with trivia quizzes!) I feel like I need to be recording these detail in more of a machine-readable format or a database in order to do those kinds of things. Maybe some kind of Goodreads-like system? It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;d need to figure out how to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, this is already longer than I thought it would be. More things will be posted to the blog (hopefully!) later this week!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Still kind of busy, although there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of things I hope I can finally wrap up this week, so I can move on to the long list of other things I want to be doing. The world continues to be bleak, so I&amp;rsquo;m still hiding from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/08/forty-two/&#34;&gt;Forty-two.&lt;/a&gt; I thought about just merging these into a single post for the day, but nah, this seems better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reworking the old charity side project still ongoing. I was hoping to finish all the changes last week and next week would be testing and deployment, but stuff got in the way (and estimates may have been a bit off), but the spillover is small and we should still be fine for finishing everything next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots more SC2 coop this week, mostly in the wee hours to destress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost impulse-bought a Switch yesterday; a friend&amp;rsquo;s logic and my inexorably large gaming backlog held me back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG Arena: Nothing of significance, but Amonkhet remastered comes out this week so looking forward to that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually did a bit better in 1 of the two quizzes we played this week, but I think we had way more fun playing Codenames online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background watching: Jeopardy on Netflix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binged the new Transformers Netflix series, since it was fairly short (six episodes). A very bleak take on the Autobots&amp;rsquo; struggle against the Decepticons on Cybertron, and also a very obvious tie-in to the current War for Cybertron toy line since most of the main characters have toys in that line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also watched Craig Ferguson&amp;rsquo;s Netflix special Tickle Fight, mainly because I happened to have watch a few of his late night segments on YT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also started watching the last season of Agents of SHIELD, since I&amp;rsquo;m told the season finale is coming up next week. First three episodes seem pretty good for network TV, hopefully I have time for the rest of the (short) season in the next couple of weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links: Nothing of note this week. Even though I have read some interesting stuff, I think my link-capturing workflow really needs improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still in a pandemic!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Pandemic thoughts and updates, Aug 9 edition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So, NCR got sent back into MECQ, a stronger quarantine lockdown. I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually felt the difference, since I&amp;rsquo;m at home most of the time. We went out yesterday for a grocery run, and not much seemed different out there either, still a lot of cars and people out of doors. I don&amp;rsquo;t actually remember what the last MECQ was like, but I kind of assumed things would be closer to how they were at the onset of the lockdowns in March, but this feels still mostly like the GCQ of past weeks. IDK if this 2-week MECQ stretch really serves any purpose except to show the government is trying something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching mass via Facebook again today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 126,885 cases (+4226 from the day before, +28653 from last week, huge jump week-on-week), 2,209 deaths (+41 from the day before, +170 from last week, thankfully not as big a jump as from last week), 67,117 recoveries (+287 from the day before, +1852 from last week, a predictably much smaller jump after last week&amp;rsquo;s miraculous &amp;ldquo;mass recoveries&amp;rdquo;). We hit record high daily deaths again over the first few days of the MECQ. We seem to have settled at a much higher average daily rate since then. Luckily, the death rate hasn&amp;rsquo;t gone up that much. We are now #1 in confirmed cases in SEA, overtaking Indonesia. The govt claims nothing to worry about, it&amp;rsquo;s only because we are testing more, but our relatively large positivity rate (around 8.6% as of this writing) implies transmission is outpacing testing? &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at around 19.8 cases (+1.8M from last week, slope holding steady for maybe 3 weeks now?) and almost 730k deaths. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/08/forty-two/</link>
            <pubDate>Sun, 09 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/08/forty-two/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Forty two is of course the &amp;ldquo;Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.&amp;rdquo; (if you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet read the 5-book Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy trilogy, I suggest you do so, you are in for a treat.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason I imagined I would be able to take at least a couple of days off of everything else I&amp;rsquo;m doing to chill and actually craft a well-written, deep, introspective post for the occasion, but alas, various things I&amp;rsquo;m working on and all the usual distractions means I am here in the early morning hours of the day itself typing this out. Likely to just rant a bit here instead of putting out anything coherent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s weird celebrating your birthday in the middle of a worldwide pandemic, when most of the usual celebration trappings are inaccessible. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the reasons why the &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1275013/sinas-other-police-officials-in-mananita-to-face-criminal-case-palace&#34;&gt;birthday mananita debacle&lt;/a&gt; was such a big deal to a lot of people. While these supposed &amp;ldquo;public servants&amp;rdquo; flaunt their privilege, the rest of us are deprived of things like seeing our friends and loved ones in person, celebrating milestones, or even the simple pleasures of eating out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve actually written quite a few of these &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/birthday/&#34;&gt;birthday posts&lt;/a&gt; by now, though not as regularly as I&amp;rsquo;d have liked. I read through a few of them to help me decide what to write for today (didn&amp;rsquo;t really help). My favorite has to be the one with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/08/thirty-eight/&#34;&gt;thirty eight lessons I’ve learned through the years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s for the best, maybe even if I had gotten a few days off I still wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been able to come up with anything satisfying enough. I mean, the point of taking time off for myself was to get away from the world for a bit and be all introspective and to spend time with my own thoughts, but with this pandemic, I might have been doing far too much time doing that already. Perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m not really complaining about the spike in busy-ness I&amp;rsquo;ve had over the past month or so. It&amp;rsquo;s sort of a welcome respite from all the self-reflection this pandemic time has given me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that this is the first birthday after I quit Facebook, I am expecting much, much fewer birthday greetings this year. Interesting how a lot of people are probably dependent now on Facebook to tell them when other people are having birthdays. It is no big loss; the people who are important will remember. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I&amp;rsquo;m not grateful and amazed if someone unexpected should remember. A couple of days ago someone I&amp;rsquo;d only known for less than five years actually remembered to greet me, except the greeting came two days early due to uncertainty about the exact date. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to be remembered, no matter how stoic we pretend to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost impulse-bought a Switch yesterday, luckily a friend talked me out of it. Would have made a fine self-birthday gift, but my gaming backlog is still pretty ridiculous as it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit ironic that in last year&amp;rsquo;s post &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/08/forty-one/&#34;&gt;I complained about an uneventful 365 days&lt;/a&gt; and look what we have now (&lt;em&gt;waves hands around&lt;/em&gt;). I hope I didn&amp;rsquo;t jinx 2020. Next year is a more boring number, maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll have a better year?&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Kind of a busy week for me again, so the week kind of passed me by quickly. It&amp;rsquo;s August! In one month it will be (PH) Christmas season! It feels like July went by more quickly than other quarantine months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bit of consulting work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reworking the old charity side project still ongoing. I was hoping to finish all the changes last week and next week would be testing and deployment, but stuff got in the way (and estimates may have been a bit off), but the spillover is small and we should still be fine for finishing everything next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starcraft 2 came out with a 10th anniversary patch that had some sweet new features and changes for coop. They added unlockable prestige talents for each of the 18 commanders, each talent alters their gameplay so they play out a bit differently. We had actually been getting a bit bored with SC2 coop and had been playing it less, this patch did a lot to invigorate our enthusiasm for it. We&amp;rsquo;ve been playing it quite a bit to unlock the prestige talents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG Arena: Didn&amp;rsquo;t hit mythic last month, but that&amp;rsquo;s fine. I switched my historic deck to Monored for faster games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only played 1 quiz last week for reasons. Instead, trivia group played some online Codenames (via &lt;a href=&#34;https://codenames.game/&#34;&gt;https://codenames.game/&lt;/a&gt;) on Saturday night, with voice chat over discord. It was a bunch of fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s new episodes of Jeopardy on Netflix, so that quickly replaced Family Guy as my background watching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s actually a bunch of new stuff to watch too: Umbrella Academy S2 is out, there&amp;rsquo;s a new Transformers series on Netflix etc. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get around to all of these things someday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some fixes to the trivia app backend, but I can&amp;rsquo;t really get too much into the (other) side projects until I get past my current busyness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internet seems to be having some DNS issues this past week. Occasionally can&amp;rsquo;t access various URLs, but is fine on refresh. Problem survived multiple router reboots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The right-click button on this gaming mouse I got last year is starting to get less responsive. I only got for $13 in Walmart, but even then it&amp;rsquo;s one of the more expensive mice I&amp;rsquo;ve bought, so I hope it doesn&amp;rsquo;t die too quickly. Maybe I should clean it out?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Couple of somewhat related blog posts resonated with me: &lt;a href=&#34;https://rubenerd.com/why-arent-you-more-serious/&#34;&gt;Why aren’t you more serious?&lt;/a&gt;, asserting the personal blog&amp;rsquo;s right to write about whatever the blogger wants, and not just to focus on specific serious or technical topics; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://om.co/2020/07/30/write-like-a-human/&#34;&gt;Write like a human&lt;/a&gt; is kind of self-explanatory.&lt;/li&gt;

Also had an &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/roytang/status/1288899712112717824&#34;&gt;interesting exchange about this with a friend over on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; re:how this might reflect locally.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDK, maybe I&amp;rsquo;m getting used to the pandemic. Is this what they mean by &amp;ldquo;new normal&amp;rdquo;? I&amp;rsquo;ll move the pandemic notes to the end of these weekly updates.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Pandemic thoughts and updates, Aug 2 edition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We ended July with around 90k active cases. Despite the threat of sending Metro Manila back to ECQ if we breached the 85k mark, the govt did not push through. Over the weekend, this led to a clamor from doctors and other frontliners to have a &amp;ldquo;time out&amp;rdquo; of 2 weeks for the NCR, a temporary quarantine, to give the healthcare system some breathing room. The knee-jerk response from the palace was to say it wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessary, but they quickly flipped their flops and said the IATF would discuss it. Enraging people and doctors, a certain outspoken-on-social-media doctor tried to shame doctors for not being heroic enough, and a certain senator implied that we can&amp;rsquo;t afford it so frontliners just need to work harder and be more passionate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching mass via Facebook again today. Churches have actually been holding limited physical services, but in solidarity with the call for ECQ, they said they will temporarily suspend such services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went to get some Jollibee takeout last Thursday; apparently they are already allowing limited dine-in customers, that seems unwise, eh. Was anxious the entire time I was waiting for my takeout order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 98232 cases (+4963 from the day before, +19820 from last week, huge jump week-on-week), 2039 deaths (+17 from the day before, +142 from last week, moderate jump), 65265 recoveries (+93 from the day before, +39513 (!) from last week, a miraculous jump). We hit record high daily deaths over the past few days, and the huge spike in recoveries is because the DOH decided to do a &amp;ldquo;mass recovery&amp;rdquo; of mild/asymptomatic cases that are already 14 days or older, supposedly in line with WHO guidelines. I can kind of see some logic behind this, but the communication was not handled very well. &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at around 18M cases (+1.8M from last week) and almost 690k deaths. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hm. I was a bit busy this week, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t paying too much attention, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have too much to rail against today. Well of course, things are still ongoing. There&amp;rsquo;s still the pandemic, fascist police state philosophy continues to rear it&amp;rsquo;s ugly head in the US, PH gov&amp;rsquo;t continues to be dumb, etc., but this week seemed a bit tame comparably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Watching mass via Facebook again today. The nearby Church actually holds services, but last I heard it was only 10 people per mass, and need to call ahead of time. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem likely we&amp;rsquo;ll be going anytime soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grocery run yesterday, without incident&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;last Thursday I finally &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/1286105826743091201/&#34;&gt;got a haircut&lt;/a&gt; my last one was around New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day, so this was around six and a half months of hair cut off. I didn&amp;rsquo;t go to a barbershop, this was a home service haircut, care of a lady who works at a neighboring salon, who actually came over to do some home care service for my mom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 78412 cases (+2019 from the day before, +13108 from last week, slight acceleration week-on-week), 1897 deaths (+20 from the day before, +224 from last week, lower jump than last week), 25752 recoveries (+1278 from the day before, +3685 from last week, much less than last week&amp;rsquo;s jump). The admin claims that if we breach 85k cases by end-July, Metro Manila may go back to NCQ. First, that seems likely to happen so we&amp;rsquo;ll see. Second, it seems a bit unfair and illogical to make Metro Manila&amp;rsquo;s quarantine status dependent on national case numbers, but whatever. &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at 16.2M cases (+1.8M from last week, slight acceleration) and almost 650k deaths. The US retains a comfortable lead over second placer Brazil. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Busy with rebuilding the UI for the old project. I&amp;rsquo;m having fun with it, so that&amp;rsquo;s something. I think this week went by more quickly for me because of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake completed! Review &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/ff7r-review/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I played through a couple of Civ6 games, trying out the new civs and game modes from the New Frontier pass. Fun and challenging. Apocalypse mode: it&amp;rsquo;s an insane feeling the first time you see a comet strike take out a city. I was actually streaming the gameplay to a friend on Discord when this happened and we both went &amp;ldquo;Woah!&amp;rdquo; and he said that pushed him to get the DLC as well. Secret societies: Only tried Voidsingers so far; their cultists are great for culture victory since they&amp;rsquo;re a constant source of relics for tourism, and the Old God Monument gives you GW slots for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG: Still playing a bunch of JumpStart, but also put together Bant Ramp for Historic. Currently at Diamond 4, I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can grind Mythic for constructed before end of month. Related: I watched Maro&amp;rsquo;s Comic-con stream for Zendikar Rising last night, but left kinda underwhelmed. Set boosters are neat, but I kind of wanted more info/spoilers about the set itself. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to be excited about the set boosters when my MTG involvement is primarily through Arena these days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only played 2 online quizzes this week (the third one didn&amp;rsquo;t fire due to not enough participants). There was a fun Scientists/Inventors round which I could have perfected if I had gone with my gut answer (Rutherford) and not listened to my teammates lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a new season of Family Guy on Netflix, so I&amp;rsquo;ve started to watch that in the background while I&amp;rsquo;m working on other things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I watched a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ew.com/events/comic-con/scott-pilgrim-cast-reunion-table-read/&#34;&gt;for-charity cast-reunion live-table-read for Scott Pilgrim vs the World&lt;/a&gt; last week. I enjoyed it so much, I went and rewatched the movie on Netflix as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technically, this old project I&amp;rsquo;m revamping used to be a &amp;ldquo;side project&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing of note.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Just in time for #JRPGJuly, I finally managed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/1285149646650671105/&#34;&gt;complete my platinum run for Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/a&gt;!

            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;h3 id=&#34;spoiler-free-review&#34;&gt;Spoiler-free review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is a fantastic retelling of the original FF7&amp;rsquo;s Midgar section. The plot largely tracks the original, except greatly expounded. More plot details are added to expound on character details and backstories, especially for supporting characters like Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie, and even for Shinra corporation itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game isn&amp;rsquo;t open world like FFXV kind of was; that would have been difficult given the plot they were trying to adapt, but it&amp;rsquo;s not entirely linear either. The story is divided into 18 chapters, and some of them are entirely linear, while some provide an open area littered with sidequests that you can optionally do before advancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t much else to say story-wise without being spoiler-y, especially if you&amp;rsquo;ve played the original. If you&amp;rsquo;re new, then I can say you are in for a treat; the storyline is certainly better and less confusing than, say, FFXIII.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the original, the game is peppered with mini-games that you can indulge in and are sure to annoy completionists like me (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combat system is something like FFXV&amp;rsquo;s real-time combat (with you controlling a single character and the others controlled by AI) mixed with some elements from FFXIII, namely the use of the Active Time Bar in order to spells or items or other special moves, and the additional stagger element around which most of the more difficult fights revolve. Unlike FFXV where you&amp;rsquo;re always controlling Noctis, you can switch controlled characters freely, or you can also issue ATB commands to the AI without shifting control. It all works very fluidly, a fun and satisfying evolution to the real-time version of the FF battle system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My one complaint would be the game limiting you to three playable characters at once, even though there are points where four are available. It&amp;rsquo;s not like their graphics engine can&amp;rsquo;t handle four player character models at once (see: FFXV), maybe it was an issue of balancing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The materia system is back! It was one of my favorite FF equipment systems, and I enjoyed it again this time around. This time however, the game is much more stingier with its special materia. For example, you can only ever get two copies of Elemental Materia (since having too many means you can abuse it against bosses), and only one copy of Magnify (equivalent to All in the original), which means only one character can use Curaga on everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normal difficulty is&amp;hellip; a bit easy. Most of the mob encounters are &amp;ldquo;mash attack, rinse and repeat&amp;rdquo;; most of the bosses are &amp;ldquo;mash attack, target weakness, repeat until staggered, use stronger attacks, repeat until victory&amp;rdquo;. Many of the bosses you can walk into the fight with your default materia settings and you&amp;rsquo;ll be fine. Maybe you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to exploit weaknesses, but the fight will still be manageable. Some of them are a bit more creative, requiring you to make use of space to avoid certain attacks and so on. Only a few boss fights were ever really troublesome. Beating the game once unlocks hard mode, more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beating the game also unlocks chapter select, which makes it easier for completionists, since you can just replay specific chapters if you missed something. There are also additional challenges only available in hard mode post-game. I believe this is the first instance of a &amp;ldquo;mainline&amp;rdquo; (such as it is) FF game providing post-game content and chapter select.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had gotten &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/ff7r/&#34;&gt;the Deluxe Edition&lt;/a&gt;, which was only delivered to me by May 1 due to quarantine shenanigans. The steelbook is gorgeous! A worthy addition to my Final Fantasy steelbook collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My completionist run took just under 90hrs, a bit above the median according to &lt;a href=&#34;https://howlongtobeat.com/game?id=57686&#34;&gt;HowLongToBeat.com&lt;/a&gt;. I started on Jun 8th, so it&amp;rsquo;s just about a month and a half too. (Average of an hour per day!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I enjoyed the game, enough to go for the platinum trophy, despite the annoying minigames. A worthwhile retelling and addition to the FF7 universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(End of spoiler-free section)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;image-gallery&#34;&gt;Image gallery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game looks great, especially when it shifts to cutscene models. Speaking of which, the cutscene transitions are also great, they&amp;rsquo;re hardly noticeable. And your hard mode run goes much faster since there&amp;rsquo;s an option to skip the cutscenes! As always, I took a lot of screenshots along the way! &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/ff7r/&#34;&gt;Image gallery is here&lt;/a&gt;, very spoilery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;expanded-plot-and-content&#34;&gt;Expanded plot and content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who played the original will no doubt remember the major plot points. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of new scenes and story bits that weren&amp;rsquo;t in the original. Some felt a bit filler-y, like the section where you have to figure out how to get to the reactor from the underplate, or the section where you have to make your way out of the sewer. They weren&amp;rsquo;t boring or anything like that, but it did feel they were there mostly to pad the time. I mean, Shinra is about to drop the plate, but first we have to deal with these ghosts?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of dropping the plate, the damage here felt a lot more memorable than in the original. In fact, I only remembered this happened in the OG by the time I got to that part of the story in the remake. The impact here is more severe because you spent a lot more time with the residents of the sector 7 slums, and with Wedge, Biggs, and Jessie. Their supposed deaths weighed more heavily upon me than in the OG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some plot points in this game that I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if they were in the original&amp;hellip; namely Shinra deliberately sabotaging the reactors and using Avalanche as a scapegoat to incite pro-war sentiment against Wutai. Perhaps it was intended in the OG but got lost due to translation issues? Or did they add that new detail for the remake?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I remember to be the more confusing and less-explained plot points of the original was the existence of the numbered clones; they also make an appearance here, but I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed that they weren&amp;rsquo;t really explained very well. While I understand why that is - in the OG the party doesn&amp;rsquo;t find out about Sephiroth/Jenova until near the end of the Midgar section, and the reunion part is never fully explained - I wish they could have added a bit more detail. As it is, people who are new to FF7 or don&amp;rsquo;t otherwise have context will probably be confused about who or what these numbered and hooded people are supposed to be? And why is this Sephiroth guy here, isn&amp;rsquo;t he supposed to be dead? These things are never really explained in-game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I disliked is that we didn&amp;rsquo;t get a playable Red XIII. I was wondering how they would handle this since I knew beforehand that he would be available in Midgar. I guess I can understand the decision, pacing-wise it&amp;rsquo;s weird to have a playable character only available in the last 2 chapters of the game. At least they gave us Red as an AI character and someone who can helpfull wallrun to pull levers, so that&amp;rsquo;s something I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also understand the limited number of summons we get. But we have Shiva and Ifrit but no Ramuh? Instead we get two Chocobos? Shrug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least I got to see the only enemy I really wanted to see in the remake: THE HELL HOUSE! (Now promoted to boss fight!)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hard-mode&#34;&gt;Hard mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard mode is&amp;hellip; appropriately hard. Even normal encounters can be troublesome if you&amp;rsquo;re not careful. And boss fights are much more dangerous, and it&amp;rsquo;s much more imperative that you prepare before hand with the appropriate materia for eevery fight. The most crippling factor here is the fact that you can&amp;rsquo;t use items and can&amp;rsquo;t recover MP within a chapter. Which is a bit weird since quests and loot boxes still award you items. I understand the mode is balanced around not having items, it&amp;rsquo;s just weird. And I feel like the game could have used an intermediate difficulty step where the enemies are on hard mode difficulty but you can still use items. In fact, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have minded if that was what Normal mode was like, and Easy becomes what the actual Normal mode was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the hard mode fights are frustratingly difficult though, as long as you are sufficiently prepared. I did have to repeat some boss fights a few times, but hard mode didn&amp;rsquo;t really feel too tedious. I guess it helped that I enjoyed the combat system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most difficult fight in the game is a simulator fight available only in Hard Mode, called Top Secrets. This one took me a while, as I kept dying at the Bahamut+Ifrit fight when using conventional strategies. I finally managed to clear this fight using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dYWl2PFPYc&#34;&gt;the methods outlined in this video&lt;/a&gt; (Yes, I had to Youtube), except my materia wasn&amp;rsquo;t as levelled up as his was apparently and I kept running out of MP. It still wasn&amp;rsquo;t as easy as he made it look; it took me a few tries, but once I managed to clear Bahamut+Ifrit, I was able to beat the last fight as well, albeit with only Aerith remaining alive with almost no MP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played hard mode chapters 1-17 before grinding a bit so I could beat the Top Secrets fight, then proceeded to chapter 18 for the hard mode final boss. Having the limit break accessory from the Top Secrets fight doubtless made Sephiroth a bit easier, but it still took me a few tries, mostly because of his tendency to spam Heartless Angel in the last phase. I had Cloud, Tifa and Barret for that final boss fight, and basically configured only with HP UPs and healing abilities. I finally took Sephiroth down when I realized I should be using Magnify+Regen in the final phase and to be careful to not be in an attack animation when he starts Heartless Angel (otherwise you can&amp;rsquo;t avoid it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;platinum-completion&#34;&gt;Platinum completion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combat was great, but the most troublesome part of completion for me were the annoying dexterity-based minigames. There&amp;rsquo;s a reason I play RPGs and not rhythm games or twitch shooters! Anyway, there&amp;rsquo;s two minigames I skipped during my first run (mostly out of frustration): the first was the darts minigame in the Seventh Heaven bar, the second was the pull-ups challenge at the Wall Market gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The darts minigame was easy enough when I got back to it and figured out I needed to finely control the L stick with like three fingers in order to aim the dart. The Pull-ups minigame was much more frustrating, since you basically had to make no mistakes and even then you still might not beat Jules. The Top Secrets and Sephiroth battles probably took more time, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure pull-ups took a lot more attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;I realized that the key was focus, and that meant getting rid of distractions like reducing the speech volume so you can&amp;rsquo;t hear the inane cheering (&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s this close!&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; bro, we just started!) and not looking at your count or Jules&amp;rsquo; count during the pullups. You&amp;rsquo;re not really competing against Jules, you&amp;rsquo;re competing against yourself, so he&amp;rsquo;s only a distraction. I ended up focusing on the round timer instead of looking elsewhere to avoid distractions. Even then I was still having trouble. Finally, I took drastic measures to avoid getting distracted by Jules: I covered half the TV with a towel:&lt;/p&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#349c9cfc2c906bf2574607e2bd6b9a90-lightbox&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;349c9cfc2c906bf2574607e2bd6b9a90-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to beat Jules on the very first attempt after putting the towel. This was my very last trophy for completion!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;that-ending&#34;&gt;That ending&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the main story tracks the OG&amp;rsquo;s Midgar section, we get an additional boss fight that kind of mirrors the Sephiroth boss fight in the OG. I was actually worried about how they planned to do this, since restricting the story to Midgar meant the final boss would have been&amp;hellip; Rufus? Or that big robot on the highway? Either would have been lame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That ending though&amp;hellip; not going into detail, but it heavily implies that although this is a retelling of the OG FF7, events may or may not unfold as we expect. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to how they do this &amp;ldquo;Unknown Journey&amp;rdquo; moving forward. Some outcomes have already changed, as implied by several scenes in the ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;overall&#34;&gt;Overall&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, very happy with the way this remake turned out, and looking forward to the succeeding installments and how they adjust the plot from here. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping they do a good job of fleshing out the other characters like Red XIII, Cait Sith/Reeve, Cid, Yuffie, and Vincent. (Not looking forward to having to do more dexterity-based minigames at the Gold Saucer!) It&amp;rsquo;s likely that the next installment will be a next generation game; this lets Square put off an FF16 lol.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;My country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are days when I have to consciously temper my rage at the shenanigans of this government. I can&amp;rsquo;t write about them today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/covid19-07-19/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s pandemic notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a busy work week again; at the same time I also picked up an older charity project where the client asked for UI updates. Had issues with running the old code, and it was small enough, so I decided to rewrite it in a new tech stack. Might write about it at some point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am like 98% through the FF7R hard mode run. I&amp;rsquo;m totally making these percentages up, but I do have only one trophy left, and it&amp;rsquo;s this annoying minigame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started trying out some of the new leaders/civs in the Civ6 New Frontier pack. Another drop should be coming this week, so looking forward to that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG JumpStart is out this week! I tried it a couple of times on Arena. Some combinations are much better than others; the sad things is if you picked a miserable pair you have to stick with it longer before you can get your requisite two wins. Here&amp;rsquo;s an (ongoing) &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/1283901490206109698/&#34;&gt;thread of my JumpStart results&lt;/a&gt; will probably update it through the month it&amp;rsquo;s available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t win any online quiz this week, boo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After watching Atomic Blonde last week, I watched the Old Guard for back-to-back Charlize Theron action flicks. Pretty fun, although some plot points might make you go what?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of stuff coming out in July that I might watch: new season of Umbrella Academy, and there&amp;rsquo;s a Transformers anime coming out on NF, and well, there&amp;rsquo;s also a long backlog of things to watch&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing to note, too busy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/09/889394605/please-scream-inside-your-heart-japanese-amusement-park-tells-thrill-seekers&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Please scream inside your heart&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; should be the motto for 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>In Which I Review Everything I Purchased from the iTunes App Store
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/itunes-purchases/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/itunes-purchases/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I was going through some old emails and found some receipts for things I had purchased from the iTunes App Store for my iPad, and I wondered how much have I actually spent on apps/games on the App Store? I went through all the receipts and decided to write mini-reviews for each item as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Purchase Date&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Price (USD)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Still Available on App Store?&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Notes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/10/30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Alien Blue HD - Reddit Client (Unofficial), v1.1.0, Developer: Morrissey Exchange Pty Ltd (17+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Wow, my first ever App Store purchase was a Reddit app! Appropriate since I reddit a lot. This app was much better than the official client available at the time. Eventually Reddit bought the app and phased it out in favor of a new, official Reddit client.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/11/24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Covers of Spider-Man, v1.0, Developer: Philipp Lenssen (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This was some lame app that just showed you a lot of Spider-Man covers. It was an accidental purchase and the only one I ever had refunded from the app store. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I said to the support: &amp;ldquo;Someone gave me a promo code for this application (Promo code: KAP3KXHM7HH3) and I was trying to figure out how to use it from the app store and accidentally bought the app. &amp;quot; (Noob!)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/11/27&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The Settlers HD, v1.0.4, Developer: Gameloft (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Wow, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember this one at all. One of those &amp;ldquo;eh, why not it&amp;rsquo;s cheap&amp;rdquo; purchases I guess?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/11/27&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Zombie Neighborhood for iPad, v1.0, Developer: Mo-Star Information Technology Co., Ltd. (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;As above&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/11/30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition, for iPad, v1.1, Developer: Lucasfilm International Services Inc. (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the LucasArts adventure games, so I was willing to pay for the chance to play these classics on the go. As is typical of me, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever got around to it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/11/30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Monkey Island 2 Special Edition: LeChuck&amp;rsquo;s Revenge for iPad, v1.1, Developer: Lucasfilm International Services Inc. (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;As above.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/12/18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Instapaper, v2.3.2, Developer: Marco Arment (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still using this app occasionally. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty nice, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really fit into my flow, since I tend to just read things immediately instead of setting them aside for later. That being said, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I have a bunch of still unread stuff saved here.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/12/18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SCRABBLE for iPad, v1.1.55, Developer: ElectronicArtsBV (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The Scrabble app situation is always a mess since the rights to Scrabble are complicated internationally. I grew up with Scrabble, but these days I just play Words with Friends.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/12/18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Enigmo 2, v2.2, Developer: Pangea Software, Inc. (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I think this was some kind of physics sandbox puzzle game, sorta like Incredible Machine? I can still download it, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get back into it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/12/18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Heroes 2 HD!, v1.2, Developer: Pavel X (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lol this was some port of the original PC Heroes 2, I suspect wholly unlicensed so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t surprising that it got kicked off the store.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/12/23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Words With Friends HD, v3.14, Developer: newtoy, inc. (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The original version of the app is no longer available; I believe I paid to get rid of ads. I have version 2 now, which I still play regularly, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have a record of paying for it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/12/25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Battle for Wesnoth HD, v1.5, Developer: Kyle Poole (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I was looking for some tactical battle game to play on the go, and this seemed promising, but I never got into it. It&amp;rsquo;s still available on the App Store, but might be a different SKU, as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t recognize my previous purchase.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/12/27&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;iCab Mobile (Web Browser), v4.2.1, Developer: Alexander Clauss (17+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I believe I got this at the time because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use Safari, and it had a download feature that other browsers didn&amp;rsquo;t have? It&amp;rsquo;s still available, but there&amp;rsquo;s Firefox on iOS now so that&amp;rsquo;s what I use.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/02/02&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Penultimate, v2.2, Developer: Cocoa Box Design LLC (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The first of several note-taking apps I had purchased in hopes I could be a productive note taker. It was not to be. This was pretty neat though. It&amp;rsquo;s linked to EverNoteso if you use that this might be good.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/02/07&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SketchBook Pro, v1.3.1, Developer: Autodesk (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;There is a free Autodesk Sketchbook app still available on the store, can&amp;rsquo;t find the pro version anymore. I tried this for a bit, but had trouble with the learning curve. I eventually settled on using the Procreate app for my sketching instead; it&amp;rsquo;s really good and IDK if it&amp;rsquo;s free, but there&amp;rsquo;s no record of me ever paying for it. It&amp;rsquo;s too good to be free! Here are &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/procreate&#34;&gt;some of my sketches using Procreate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/02/11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;STREET FIGHTER IV, v1.00.06, Developer: CAPCOM Co., Ltd (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for Street Fighter things so I tried this out. Don&amp;rsquo;t remember much about it though.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/02/11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;World of Goo HD, v1.2, Developer: 2D BOY (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Kinda boring for me, but my niece liked playing around with it while she was growing up, so that&amp;rsquo;s something.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/02/21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tilt to Live HD, Full Version 2.0, Developer: One Man Left&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Probably my all-time favorite iOS game, well worth the purchase. It&amp;rsquo;s simple and easy to play, but hard to master, and you can play it in short bursts easily at any time. You can hand the game to someone with minimal explanation and they&amp;rsquo;ll grok the game quickly.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/02/26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Battleheart, v1.0.5, Developer: Kelli Bordner&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Maybe my second-favorite iOS game, I played this a bunch. Basically it&amp;rsquo;s party battles where you click and use abilities etc.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/05/08&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Notes Plus - Handwriting, Note Taking, Shape Drawing, and Sound Recording, v2.3, Developer: Viet Tran (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Another note-taking app! I think I liked this one best, as I had a bunch of notes in it, but it looks they made some sort of breaking format change in 2019 and now my older notebooks can&amp;rsquo;t be viewed as notebooks in the app? Maybe I can figure it out later. I remember it had some neat features like handwriting recognition so it can automatically convert your handwriting to text? Not sure how well that worked with my chicken-scratch handwriting though.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/05/19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Infinity Blade, v1.3, Developer: Chair Entertainment Group (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This was a big deal when it came out, as it was one of the first iOS games with true 3d rendering. I think I only played it a little bit.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/06/30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;STREET FIGHTER IV Volt, v1.00.00, Developer: CAPCOM Co., Ltd (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t remember much, purchased because Street Fighter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/07/30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;X-Men, v1.0.2, Developer: Konami Digital Entertainment (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I believe this was a port of the old-school X-Men arcade game. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I played this version much.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/08/26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Aralon: Sword and Shadow HD, v3.12, Developer: Crescent Moon Games LLC (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;For a while I was hoping to find a good RPG to play on the go, but never really found the time to get into any of the ones I tried.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/08/28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rimelands: Hammer of Thor, v1.31, Developer: Crescent Moon Games LLC (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;As above&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/10/13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Avadon: The Black Fortress HD, vv1.0.2, Developer: Spiderweb Software (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;As above. I was a fan of the SpiderWeb games back in the day, but haven&amp;rsquo;t really managed to play any of their newer games to a finish. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ve outgrown them?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/10/13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dungeon Hunter 2 HD, v1.0.0, Developer: Gameloft S.A. (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t remember playing this at all.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/10/29&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sid Meier&amp;rsquo;s Pirates! for iPad, v1.0.4, Developer: 2K Games (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I played the PC version of this a bunch, the iPad version not so much I think.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/12/21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Civilization Revolution for iPad, v2.2.8 (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Big fan of the Civ series, and getting this version was cheaper than the alternative which was on NDS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/12/29&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Puzzle Quest 2, v1.2.0 (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This was a match-3 type puzzle game with a thin veneer of fantasy role-playing flavor on top of it. I played this a bunch.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2012/01/07&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;MONOPOLY for iPad, v1.0.6 (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I think I only got this because a friend wanted to try playing remotely. However, Monopoly is a terrible board game.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2012/01/21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Comic Zeal Comic Reader, v5.0.36 (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Second most expensive purchase here, but one I&amp;rsquo;m still using up to now! I used to use some free open-source comic reader app whose name I can&amp;rsquo;t remember now, but I liked Comic Zeal because it had support for uploading files via web browser&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2012/02/04&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Notability, v4.1 (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yet another note-taking app. Maybe someday when I actually get into a decent habit of note taking I&amp;rsquo;ll actually review them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2012/08/05&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Another World - 20th Anniversary, v1.2 (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I played the original on PC back in the day. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I finished this version.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2012/12/26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;STREET FIGHTER X TEKKEN MOBILE　, v1.01.00 (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yet another &amp;ldquo;purchased because Street Fighter&amp;rdquo;. The Vita version has served me better.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2013/01/02&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Scribblenauts Remix, v2.6 (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Can be fun, but gets boring after a bit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2013/01/11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate: Enhanced Edition, v1.0.2007 (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The most expensive purchase on this list! I haven&amp;rsquo;t finished this version though.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2013/01/14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer, Return of the Fallen expansion&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ascension was one of the original deckbuilding games, so I wanted to try it. I played the iOS version a fair amount, since I had some other friends playing it too. Enough to justify purchasing a couple of expansions.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2013/01/14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer, Storm of Souls expansion&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;As above&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2013/01/18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer, Promo Pack 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;As above&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2013/05/28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rebirth of Fortune 2, v1.02 (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yet another &amp;ldquo;hoping I could play RPGs on the go&amp;rdquo; purchase. Don&amp;rsquo;t remember it at all.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I first got an iPad in 2010, and still use one (not the same one) up to this day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all prices are in USD because these purchases were made on the US app store; I believe there was yet no PH app store at that time. All checking of whether they are still available however, is done on the PH app store, since that&amp;rsquo;s where my Apple ID is currently linked. So maybe that causes some inaccuracy somewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total amount spent over 3 years: $89.59. Which is not too bad, considering that&amp;rsquo;s roughly one and a half brand new PS4 games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;majority of the purchases (31 out of 41) are games. A lot of these games were &amp;ldquo;impulse purchases&amp;rdquo; too, unsurprising since most mobile apps are priced so low. The tradeoff for this low price is the high risk of the games going unmaintained and getting delisted. My roots as a PC/console gamer work against me, as I am apparently less inclined to play through RPGs and such on a tablet. These days I really only play free multiplayer games like Words with Friends on the iPad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;22 out of my 41 purchases are no longer available on the App Store as of today. This is one of the reasons I stopped paying for App Store things altogether: the pace of development for mobile OSes is very quick and backwards compatibility is not a priority, so apps and games can easily be out of date or no longer compatible with newer versions of the OS. For apps/games with low prices/profit margins, it&amp;rsquo;s simply not worth it to keep updating these apps/games every time, so they simply delist them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have any purchases on the Google Play store, mostly because I don&amp;rsquo;t like gaming on the phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;My country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday afternoon the House of Representatives voted to deny the franchise application of the nation&amp;rsquo;s biggest broadcaster ABS-CBN. This despite all agencies of the executive testifying that the company had no violations. Justifications cited were mostly personal reasons. The Palace claims they remained neutral on this issue, but no one really believes that. Probably not even then. What now, Philippines?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/covid19-07-12/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s pandemic notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a busy week work-wise. Learning a lot about Vue and Laravel though, so that&amp;rsquo;s fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am like 95% through the FF7R hard mode run. Only a 5% difference from last week, progress is slow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I bought a few games off the Steam Sale: Civ 6&amp;rsquo;s New Frontiers Pass (not actually on sale), Disco Elysium, and Garou Mark of the Wolves. You can watch me struggling in Garou &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yQ6B9IlwHU&amp;amp;t=70s&#34;&gt;on Youtube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We only played one online quiz this week, didn&amp;rsquo;t do too well D:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I watched Atomic Blonde yesterday. I thought it was like a John Wick style action flick. That&amp;rsquo;s true, but it&amp;rsquo;s also a Cold-War era spy thriller with lots of double-crosses and whatnot. Fairly engaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing to note.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.dev/one-line-layouts/&#34;&gt;Ten modern layouts in one line of CSS&lt;/a&gt;. I could have used this two weeks ago!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.swiss-miss.com/2020/07/alike-an-animated-short-film.html&#34;&gt;Alike, an Animated Short Film&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of an allegory for modern life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Using Hugo to Automatically Update Your Github Profile
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/hugo-update-github-profile/</link>
            <pubDate>Sat, 11 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/hugo-update-github-profile/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;So recently Github secretly rolled out a new feature where you can create a file named &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; in a repo named &lt;code&gt;github.com/&amp;lt;your github username&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;your github username&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and that markdown file would be rendered on your Github profile page. It means, you can now put basically anything you want on your Github profile!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just read this &lt;a href=&#34;https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/10/self-updating-profile-readme/&#34;&gt;post from Simon Willson&lt;/a&gt; about using this new feature + Github actions and a Python script to automatically generate and update his Github profile. That seemed neat so I thought about how I would do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blog is already setup to publish using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://travis-ci.org/&#34;&gt;Travis-CI&lt;/a&gt; whenever I push a commit, so I figured I could just ride on that framework. You can already see this in action on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/roytang&#34;&gt;my Github profile page&lt;/a&gt;! Basically, I publish the &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; using my regular Hugo build, then my Travis script will deploy it to the appropriate repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re new to Hugo, the trickiest part of this might be using a custom output format to generate the README.md. This is basically just a bunch of settings in your Hugo config file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define a new Markdown media type under &lt;code&gt;mediaTypes&lt;/code&gt; in your config file. For a TOML config file, that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-toml&#34; data-lang=&#34;toml&#34;&gt;    [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;mediaTypes&lt;/span&gt;]
        [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;mediaTypes&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;text/markdown&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;]
            &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;suffixes&lt;/span&gt; = [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;md&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define a &amp;ldquo;readme&amp;rdquo; output format (or whatever you want to name it) under &lt;code&gt;outputFormats&lt;/code&gt; in your config file. For a TOML config file, that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-toml&#34; data-lang=&#34;toml&#34;&gt;[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;outputFormats&lt;/span&gt;]
  [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;outputFormats&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;readme&lt;/span&gt;]
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;baseName&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;README&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;mediaType&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;text/markdown&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;baseName&lt;/code&gt; here controls the output file name, while the extension is controlled by the suffixes in step 1. The &lt;code&gt;mediaType&lt;/code&gt; you use here should match the one in step&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next is to specify which pages should have this custom output format. I used my home page for this, so under &lt;code&gt;outputs&lt;/code&gt; in the config file I added the name of the output format (&amp;ldquo;readme&amp;rdquo;) in my case under &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-toml&#34; data-lang=&#34;toml&#34;&gt;[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;outputs&lt;/span&gt;]
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;home&lt;/span&gt; = [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;HTML&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;RSS&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;jsonfeed&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;hfeed&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;readme&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last step, in your theme or your layouts folder, create a file named &lt;code&gt;index.README.md&lt;/code&gt;. This will be the template used to generate the README file. Remember that this is a template to generate markdown. You can use all the normal Hugo template functions, but your output should be markdown. Here&amp;rsquo;s part of what I put in my template, which generates a list of my most recent blog posts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go-html-template&#34; data-lang=&#34;go-html-template&#34;&gt;Latest blog posts:
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;$pages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;.RegularPages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Type&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;post&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;$pages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
- [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;.Title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;](&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;.Permalink&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;

[View all posts](&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;.Permalink&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;blog)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not yet too familiar with Hugo templates, you can maybe just use the above example directly first to see what it outputs. (You might need to replace &lt;code&gt;post&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;posts&lt;/code&gt; or whatever your main post type is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have these setup, just run your usual hugo build and check the output folder to see if the README.md file was generated correctly. It should be in the root of the output folder, same place as the &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; for your home page. One problem I encountered with Hugo is that it insists on lowercasing all the output files, so the output file in my case is always &lt;code&gt;readme.md&lt;/code&gt; and not &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt;. I just solved this by renaming it during the Travis build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t discuss the travis deployment process anymore here; if you&amp;rsquo;ve done CI with Travis and Github integration before, it&amp;rsquo;s relatively straightforward to add a step to copy the readme file from the Hugo build output to the appropriate repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After setting this up, my Github profile page now automatically updates with my latest blog posts/notes/shared links! (I didn&amp;rsquo;t include photos to keep things simple). The update happens every time my site itself gets a new build, so that&amp;rsquo;s pretty neat. I&amp;rsquo;ve attached an image of the new Github profile page for reference!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;My country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday afternoon the president sighed the controversial &amp;ldquo;Anti-terror law&amp;rdquo; that vastly expands police powers, allows people to be arrested without warrants on mere suspicion of terrorism etc. Interesting timing, right after China applies a new anti-terror low to Hong Kong (and rightly gets castigated for it by countries all over the world) and also right after the PNP (who &lt;em&gt;promise&lt;/em&gt; not to abuse their newfound powers) are under criticism for killing some soldiers in a &lt;em&gt;misencounter&lt;/em&gt; and tampering with the crime scene to cover it up. Many are afraid of the chilling impact on freedom of speech, but I like to think that I will be as complain-y as I used to be. I am privileged to be able to do that, so might as well keep going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Congressmen &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/abscbn-bias-press-freedom/&#34;&gt;tightening the screws on ABS-CBN&lt;/a&gt; during the franchise hearings reminds me that: given how complicated the various laws and statutes are, anyone with an agenda who wants to harass you can always find some obscure laws or regulations that you allegedly violated. That is not to say we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t follow such regulations, but given when one randomly keeps digging up new issues, it becomes obvious that there is a vendetta at work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I often ruminate about what I can do to help the state of my country today. Or maybe even the state of the world? I used to think being a good citizen and making good voting choices was enough, but it&amp;rsquo;s not. The systems are rigged to perpetuate inequality, exploitation, and bad people in power. I read somewhere recently that one should imagine the path towards the future he wishes to claim and take the steps to make it happen, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think my imagination is up to the task at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/covid19-07-05/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s pandemic notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fair bit of consulting work for this coming week, might be busy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have already &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/quitting-facebook/&#34;&gt;deactivated Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. If I would be honest, I still find myself sometimes instinctively thinking about checking the Facebook feed. Hopefully, it&amp;rsquo;s an instinct that gets weaned away with time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am like 90% through the FF7R hard mode run, but I&amp;rsquo;m currently stuck at a certain point trying to beat the so-called &amp;ldquo;hardest fight in the game&amp;rdquo;. Hopefully I can finish it this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinity OS2 inched along slightly as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday gaming group picked up a new board game on Steam, it&amp;rsquo;s Blood Rage, about vikings trying to earn glory for Ragnarok. A bit more violent than Scythe, lots more fighting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG: I did six twitch streams/yt episodes of M21 drafting, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXZO7Ukg5Xk&amp;amp;list=PLmU0vkKslGXiz0shcCJgV1YTP5emzWgr4&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s a playlist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Able to play a couple more online quiz nights this week, but still didn&amp;rsquo;t do well lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some new movies on Netflix lately. Decided to watch Mission Impossible Fallout. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I ever watched Rogue Nation though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to plan out the next set of updates for the trivia thing, but I might be too busy in the coming weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I changed the fonts on this blog. Again. Someday I&amp;rsquo;ll probably try Comic Sans just for the heck of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again: I should probably write more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This list of &lt;a href=&#34;https://whimsical.club/&#34;&gt;websites that spark joy&lt;/a&gt; is great, have some new sites to browse!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A walk back through the history of web trends and standards: &lt;a href=&#34;https://pavellaptev.github.io/web-dark-ages/&#34;&gt;dark ages of the web&lt;/a&gt;. As someone &lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.technology/@schwartz/104450459330476402&#34;&gt;commented on Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; though: &amp;ldquo;dark ages for development, golden age for content.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;In several places on this site (like if you click &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/photos/&#34;&gt;Photos&lt;/a&gt; in the menu up top), I have a grid-like view of a list of photos/images:&lt;/p&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#faccc892f8e2cf4a4264858849ce5ae2-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/image-lightboxes-using-html/css/photos_hua697e57b9c5f61f8be116df80d63f53b_922940_300x0_resize_box_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;faccc892f8e2cf4a4264858849ce5ae2-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/image-lightboxes-using-html/css/photos.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;1 Jul 2020 12:00am&#34;&gt;1 Jul 2020 12:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to just have each thumbnail open the post permalink on click, with the anchor set to the image itself. The image would be shown in full size inline of the post. This was a bit clunky and not so modern, so I decided to implement it so that the image lists instead will show a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightbox_%28JavaScript%29&#34;&gt;Lightbox&lt;/a&gt;-style overlay with the full image and some details and an option to click through to the post. That looks a little something like this:&lt;/p&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#69db43a1058dcdddf90179b43e7ecf6d-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/image-lightboxes-using-html/css/lightbox_hu396d03ff45b11c54616c22d72e1875ca_532641_300x0_resize_box_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;69db43a1058dcdddf90179b43e7ecf6d-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/image-lightboxes-using-html/css/lightbox.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;1 Jul 2020 12:00am&#34;&gt;1 Jul 2020 12:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in the olden days doing this sort of thing required JavaScript (as described in the wikipedia link above to Lightbox). But for the modern web, this can be achieved using HTML and CSS only. The method is described in &lt;a href=&#34;https://jlelse.blog/dev/css-lightbox-hugo/&#34;&gt;this blog post by jlelse&lt;/a&gt;, specifically for use in Hugo themes. The CSS technique is relatively straightforward: you generate two images, a thumbnail, and a hidden full-size one in an overlay. The thumbnail is wrapped in an anchor pointing to the id of the hidden overlay, and the overlay gets displayed via the &lt;code&gt;:target&lt;/code&gt; CSS pseudo-selector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how that looks in this site&amp;rsquo;s current Hugo templates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;( &lt;code&gt;.context&lt;/code&gt; is the original image resource, and &lt;code&gt;$thumb&lt;/code&gt; is the generated thumbnail)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go-html-template&#34; data-lang=&#34;go-html-template&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;.context.RelPermalink&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;md5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;-lightbox&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;figure&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;$thumb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;.RelPermalink&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;alt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;$figcaption&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;$figcaption&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;tn&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;figure&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;

    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;outline&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;block&lt;/span&gt;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;My only changes on top of the jlelse&amp;rsquo;s blog post linked above was to add a second overlay for a caption and date to be shown, and a link to the original post, and a close button. Clicking the post itself also dismisses the overlay (by replacing the URL fragment), but I thought it was more usable to also add an obvious Close button. I also initially wanted to put &amp;ldquo;Previous&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Next&amp;rdquo; buttons so that you can easily cycle through the images in a post, but this was a bit more effort. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a way to &amp;ldquo;look ahead&amp;rdquo; in the loop to get the &amp;ldquo;next&amp;rdquo; image, if any, so I think I would have needed to loop through the images twice? And since I use this image list in a number of places on the site, that was a bit troublesome, so maybe it&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ll attempt later on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I think the new lightboxes are neat!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/covid19-06-28/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s pandemic notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easily the most annoying thing this week: our broadband modem conked out Wednesday night. Customer support isn&amp;rsquo;t super responsive for local telcos: I called their support line the next day (support line is not even available 24/7!), got put on hold for 45 minutes TWICE before they agreed to send a repair crew over the next day (Friday). Friday morning I got a text that the technician visit was actually scheduled for SATURDAY morning. They arrive Saturday AFTERNOON, due to traffic apparently. And unluckily, they are out of spare modems for the replacement. They promise to come back first thing in the morning SUNDAY. They come back Sunday LUNCHTIME. And I finally have internet back. An annoying experience, and I&amp;rsquo;m also worried that my mobile plan might be charged for the two one-hour calls I had to do to their support line (hopefully I can clear that up), and I&amp;rsquo;m told I can also call them up to ask for a rebate for their days we had no service, but eh, I&amp;rsquo;d have to sit through another long on-hold period!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One would think that being offline for half a week would lead to some kind of gigantic productivity boost, but no such luck. I still had my mobile internet for my doomscrolling after all. I did manage to read/write/watch a few more things than usual I guess?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finished Final Fantasy VII Remake (before the internet outage)! So I spent a lot of the outage (including my time on hold with tech support) playing through hard mode, already about half-way through. Still not sure I&amp;rsquo;m going to do achievement completion, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see. Hard mode is actually an enjoyable challenge, nothing too insane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinity OS2 inched along slightly as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;won my &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/1274581114628108289/&#34;&gt;first Trivia Royale&lt;/a&gt;, I can quit now lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the internet outage coincided with the start of this week&amp;rsquo;s Steam Summer Sale. There&amp;rsquo;s some games/DLC I&amp;rsquo;m considering buying, but realistically in terms of backlog I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t lol. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if willpower holds out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the new MTG core set also came out on Magic Arena during the outage. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get back into regular streaming for M21 limited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still tried to join the Zoom and voice chats for the online quizzes with only my tethered mobile internet, but that was kind of a miserable experience. Still, I was able to contribute a bit, though we didn&amp;rsquo;t actually do too well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finished watching season 2 of Harley Quinn. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve written about the show before. The whole Harley/Poison Ivy dynamic isn&amp;rsquo;t really for me, but I like the show&amp;rsquo;s take on Gotham and the wider DC universe and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of fun characters like King Shark and Clayface. Also, Riddler was recognizably voiced by Dean Pelton from Community, and that was fun lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also did a rewatch of Spider-Man Far From Home on Netflix, before the internet problems and all. Still a pretty good movie, and watching it made me eager to get back to the MCU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also watched the Sonic the Hedgehog movie while things were offline. The best thing about this is Sonic being recognizably voiced by Ben Schwartz, who apparently &lt;a href=&#34;https://thesuperheroesnetwork.tumblr.com/post/622121477003739136/supernova-swirls-gothammite-he-really&#34;&gt;voices everyone blue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As soon as my internet came back, I started watching Ghost Fighter/Yu Yu Hakusho, which came out on Netflix (as you guessed it, during the outage)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also tried reading a book. It was a Discworld book. &amp;ldquo;Tried&amp;rdquo; being the operative word. I&amp;rsquo;ll write about it if I manage to get to the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uh, proceeding apace I guess?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again: I should probably write more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/22/nyt-is-threatening-my-safety-by-revealing-my-real-name-so-i-am-deleting-the-blog/&#34;&gt;NYT threatened to doxx Scott Alexander of Slate Star Codex&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t really follow SSC too strictly, but that seemed like a bad thing. I also read up some more on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Scott_Alexander&#34;&gt;Scott Alexander / SSC&lt;/a&gt; because of this, and it looks like he had a lot of problematic views, so I don&amp;rsquo;t really think I want to support him lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great essay from Ankit Shah about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ankit.fyi/being-alone&#34;&gt;Being Alone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gomakethings.com/always-bet-on-html/&#34;&gt;Always Bet on HTML&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I had been meaning to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/quitting-facebook/&#34;&gt;quit Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for more than a year maybe, but I kept putting it off. The main reason being that I like having backups of my own digital data (still very much a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2007/12/pack-rat-mentality/&#34;&gt;pack rat&lt;/a&gt;), and Facebook&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/03/export-your-social-media-data/&#34;&gt;social media export&lt;/a&gt; is less than ideal, for me at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than ideal why? It doesn&amp;rsquo;t include a lot of content I would like backed up, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;comments on my posts (there have been some good conversations with friends over the years I would prefer to preserve)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;things I&amp;rsquo;ve reposted from other people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;content of certain groups I&amp;rsquo;m members of (again, mostly for some interesting discussions over the years)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pictures posted by other people that I&amp;rsquo;ve been tagged in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while I looked around for scraper programs/scripts to this for me, but none really did what I wanted. Early this month I finally wrote my own scraper scripts to pull that data out of Facebook, as a supplement to the actual FB export. It seems unlikely that these will be helpful to anyone else, especially since web scraping is an inherently brittle activity; any slight change in the FB HTML generation will break the scripts. In spite of that, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share them publicly anyway, via Github gists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/roytang/a5b4a8e4d511e97b9d25cb190f9dfb5d&#34;&gt;Script to export FB timeline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/roytang/1cb3a682a2c223e569e3009aceb0e319&#34;&gt;Script to export FB group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are basically the same file, with minor changes between configuration and some scraping details. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting to need these scripts again in the future so I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother with any kind of reusability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other notes about these scripts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;made with Python! Using my favorite HTML parsing library, BeautifulSoup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the scripts run against the mobile web version m.facebook.com. The main web version is troublesome because it executes JS to do its infinite scroll and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to waste time reverse engineering that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are some variables near the start that you should probably set. Most of it is output folders and group details, but the main one is the FB login cookie - basically you need to login to FB, then use dev tools or whatever to copy your cookie string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the main output file is a gigantic JSON. There is no specified schema, basically I made things up as I went along. I&amp;rsquo;ll figure out how to process this at a later date lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a secondary output, there is also a cache folder that should contain the raw HTML parsed for each page. These aren&amp;rsquo;t necessary to retain, as all the information they have should also be in the JSON. Images from posts are also downloaded into a &lt;code&gt;dls&lt;/code&gt; folder. (The JSON will include the download path for the images from each post.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;running the timeline export on my machine took the better part of 2-3 hours, for roughly 13 years worth of FB content. The output JSON was around 22 MB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;running this might be considered spammy behavior by Facebook (understandably, but it&amp;rsquo;s their fault they won&amp;rsquo;t me do this via API), but the only consequence I&amp;rsquo;ve seen was that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to view other people&amp;rsquo;s profiles for some minutes after running the script&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for what I&amp;rsquo;m going to do with this data, that&amp;rsquo;s still to be determined. The nonpublic content can be imported into the archive on this blog (if it isn&amp;rsquo;t there yet), but that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of manual work. As for the scripts, hopefully I won&amp;rsquo;t have to use them again in the future, but maybe they can be useful to someone else!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/covid19-06-21/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s pandemic notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some days still hot, but weather beginning to turn for the better. Sleep kind of better and a bit more regular too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did my quarterly medical checkup this past week (slightly delayed). No issues, but I need to do an FBS test for next time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep schedule kind of settling back into my usual biphasic sleep. Although the second phase seems to move around a lot&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not much work-wise the past week, and a bit more family-related expenses. Medical and government stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;still playing a lot of Final Fantasy VII Remake. I think I&amp;rsquo;m already in the final chapter. I am quite happy with the adaptiation, bit I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;m going to bother with achievement completion for this one; it requires hard mode completion, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the issue. The problem is the abundance of these dexterity-based minigames! I thought everything was fine when I did the squats thing, but then later there&amp;rsquo;s a harder pull-ups thing! And I haven&amp;rsquo;t even cracked the bottom of that darts leaderboard&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinity OS2 inching along slightly. But probably will be finished after FF7R at this rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s a new trivia app by the makers of the QuizUp, which we used to play a lot back in the day. The name is Trivia Royale, it&amp;rsquo;s currently iOS only and it&amp;rsquo;s basically battle royale quizup: you join a game with 1000 players, and you play 10 head-to-head matches until you get a winner. Took me most of the wook to actually win my first one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;did poorly in the AboutQuiz and PopQuiz games this week. Actually, we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing poorly for a while now lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing to log. Maybe a good thing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://triviastorm.net/&#34;&gt;triviastorm&lt;/a&gt; stuff this week. Most of it are some backend fixes to make later planned new features easier to build. Planning to clear/reset leaderboards at the end of the month. Some roadmap things:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allowing users to submit their own questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make the discord bot usable for public usage, i.e. let other people add it to their discord&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I should probably write more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot of posts off &lt;a href=&#34;https://lobste.rs&#34;&gt;lobste.rs&lt;/a&gt; lately, so I finally pulled the trigger and asked around for an invite to the site. A &lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@ignaloidas&#34;&gt;helpful person&lt;/a&gt; provided me one via Mastodon. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting site, basically an invite-only reddit-like site, mostly focused on tech stuff, so in theory the discussion quality should be fairly high. The chain of invites is public too, each user&amp;rsquo;s profile shows you who invited him, so in that way it&amp;rsquo;s kind of similar to a certificate chain of trust? We&amp;rsquo;ll see if this scales up well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this &lt;a href=&#34;https://mxb.dev/blog/the-return-of-the-90s-web/&#34;&gt;recent article about the 90s web&lt;/a&gt;. I will easily admit that I am an easy sucker for any post that appeals to my nostalgia for how the web was better &amp;ldquo;back in the doy&amp;rdquo;, rose-tinted glasses or no.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed the song Fast Car, so it was interesting to read about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/tracy-chapman-fast-car-revival-luke-combs-khalid-1014843/&#34;&gt;its origins and its surprising popularity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The founders of BaseCamp recently released &lt;a href=&#34;https://hey.com&#34;&gt;Hey&lt;/a&gt;, a new email service that has &lt;a href=&#34;https://hey.com/features/&#34;&gt;some interesting ideas about new features&lt;/a&gt; to support the typical email workflow. I don&amp;rsquo;t nearly use email enough on a personal basis to pay for it (though I do have an invite!), but I&amp;rsquo;m glad someone is innovating in this space, although they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be using open standards. They promptly &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation&#34;&gt;got into a fight with Apple over App Store policies&lt;/a&gt; which has sparked some debate in the tech community on the value of curated app stores. So maybe they&amp;rsquo;re actually going to push for innovation in two different areas?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, no new crises have emerged during the past week. I think. More of the same crises, carrying on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Friday was the PH independence day holiday. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like celebrating. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like we are free. In any case, a protest rally against the yet-to-be-signed terror bill took place at the university that morning, inspite of threats from the authorities that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t allowed. The protestors spaced themselves out and everything. Some friends reported trouble getting into the university though. Apparently a heavy police/military presence was manning many of the entrances for some reason. &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/DailyGuardianPH/posts/3416858255000782&#34;&gt;Basta&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/move-ph/263710-police-blocks-entry-protesters-rally-independence-day-2020&#34;&gt;News report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/covid19-06-14/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s quarantine notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much better weather this week, some nights were comfortably rainy and chilly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep schedule kind of settling back into my usual biphasic sleep. Although the second phase seems to move around a lot&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disappointed in the PS5 reveal. None of the shown games are must buys from me, and I was hoping for a price and release date. Highly unlikely I&amp;rsquo;d get a PS5 on launch though. Historically I&amp;rsquo;ve waited at least a year to get consoles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinity OS2 run stalled this week because&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip; most of my gaming this week spent on Final Fantasy VII Remake. I&amp;rsquo;m only around 12ish hours in. Game is pretty great, and not just for the nostalgia bit. There is a large amount of added content, and some plot details play out differently. Looking forward to how this all ends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also purchased the &lt;a href=&#34;https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality&#34;&gt;itch.io BLM bundle&lt;/a&gt; this week. Wow that&amp;rsquo;s a ton of value. Over 1600+ games, assets, etc for minimum $5? I was originally hesitant since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have an itch.io account and really I don&amp;rsquo;t need more backlog, but it&amp;rsquo;s for a good cause, and did I mention also a ton of value? Better than Humble Bundles ever were.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somehow managed to win Geekfight this week, and it&amp;rsquo;s the last one until July. We got third place in PopQuiz and as usual did poorly in AboutQuiz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team Camote Pop Culture Trivia Challenge S01E01 is out: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQytLl61PCQ&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQytLl61PCQ&lt;/a&gt;. We had a lot of fun, and we recorded this around a month ago I think, editing took a while. We have a few more episodes in the queue, feel free to like and subscribe!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My dad has been watching a lot of Two and A Half Men, which means a lot of incidental watching from me whenever I&amp;rsquo;m in that same room. The Charlie Sheen firing came really abruptly since he was binging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Huh, I guess not much TV/movies for me last week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worked a bit more on &lt;a href=&#34;https://triviastorm.net/&#34;&gt;triviastorm&lt;/a&gt; stuff this week. Cleaning up the old questions, prepping new question sets, etc. Will probably load new question sets and reset both the twitter bot and discord leaderboards around the end of the month, and hopefully can expand upon the app after that, and prepare it for more general use and other cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My urge to completely revamp the site has passed&amp;hellip; for now. Other plans proceed apace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/&#34;&gt;Sort By Controversial&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s two years old, but it&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic read, a fictional (or maybe not so fictional?) take on how society can easily be cleaved apart by the right discussions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit interesting, this mentality of &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t trust this person because they appear to be a goody-goody do-gooder, they&amp;rsquo;re probably fake or have ulterior motives!&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m no psychologist, so idle speculation thread:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, apparently they DO message!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Sunday, everybot!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes you wonder what kind of trauma this person must have experienced in his life, to automatically mistrust people who present as good people; were they betrayed by some person who initially presented as a good person?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(IDK Gang Badoy personally, but from what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen of her public persona, she hasn&amp;rsquo;t been anything but a decent person.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume it&amp;rsquo;s this same crowd that had a backlash against the &amp;ldquo;disente&amp;rdquo; push of the last admin (as if being decent was objectionable) and related more to one who presented himself as a thug since they find him more relatable somehow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mentality perhaps speaks to a pessimistic belief that people are inherently bad anyway, so anyone who presents as &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; is a lying faker, and might as well support the ones who present as more &amp;ldquo;relatable&amp;rdquo; yet flawed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might also reflect on the person&amp;rsquo;s view of himself: he might have a poor self-image or sense of self-worth and projects that to everyone else, hence why he relates more to the problematic people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I find it easier on my own sanity to just judge people by their words and deeds, and not by whatever imaginary motives I may ascribe to them. If a person is doing good, then you can assume they are a good person until proven otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correspondingly, if someone jokes about rape and murder or makes light of human rights or favors a foreign aggressor, you can judge them by that too. No need to imagine motives beyond what you see and hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Maya Angelou:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;When someone shows you who they are, believe them&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Disclaimer: this is not to say that one should automatically trust any person who presents as good, just not to unnecessarily assume false motives; use your common sense.)&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;The world isn&amp;rsquo;t letting up. The virus is still around, but both the US and my own country have gotten distracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US is in its second week of police brutality/black lives matters protests. Meanwhile, our government took on a sidequest of trying to enact a wide-ranging and easily abusable anti-terror bill, triggering some smaller (by comparison to the US).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t written about the terror bill, mainly because I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the opportunity to dig into it too deeply. But my general impression leaves me two points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the justification for asking for increased police/anti-terrorism powers? We don&amp;rsquo;t actually get that many terror attacks pulled off, the last big one was Marawi (which I heard some Congressmen citing, tbf), which was back in 2017. And that was mostly a problem with Islamic militants. I don&amp;rsquo;t hear any of the bill proponents talking about how specifically the limits on govt powers holds them back. How would these added powers prevent another Marawi? Did they actually have intel leading up to the Marawi siege that they couldn&amp;rsquo;t act on due to limited powers? I find this difficult to believe because&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what about the authorities&amp;rsquo; history of impunity? It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that they are being restricted by the law in anti-terror activities when they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to let the law get in the way for much lesser things. I guess this is the crux of the issue for most people, one of trust. Even if you say there are safeguards in the law, they are still easily abusable. The bill extends the detention period for terror suspects to I think is it 30 days, extendable? But given the speed (or lack thereof) of local courts, even if you challenge any violation of the safeguards, the challenge may take longer to resolve than the detention period. Maybe we should consider cleaning up our justice system first? People wouldn&amp;rsquo;t object if our systems were trustworthy&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, also China banned mocking their national anthem in HK, or something to that effect. China being China. Better not to lose track of what is probably the greatest threat to democracy in the coming century&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/covid19-06-07/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s quarantine notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was hoping the weather would get much cooler than this. Where&amp;rsquo;s our &lt;em&gt;hanging amihan&lt;/em&gt;?!?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tiny bit of consulting work again this week, mostly integration work. And it&amp;rsquo;s in PHP, which means I&amp;rsquo;m once again tempted to write a &amp;ldquo;bad things about PHP&amp;rdquo; post lol. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll collect a few more gripes before I do that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep schedule slightly better and more regular, but my eyes seem to be heavy a lot more often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;m like in the final act for Divinity OS2. Need to finish it soonish because&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip; my PS4 is back! My brother finally passed by the house to pick up some stuff and returned my console. I already hooked it up and did the installation things for FF7R. Will probably start it this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Humble choice is up, but it&amp;rsquo;s meh again. Will probably pass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was looking forward to the PS5 reveal this week, but it got rescheduled due to everything happening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least previews for the next Magic set have already started. Some cool stuff. Instant planeswalker abilities! Phasing! Prowess! &lt;a href=&#34;http://mythicspoiler.com/m21/cards/peerintotheabyss.html&#34;&gt;Really creepy art&lt;/a&gt;! We also got some bans and an actual rule change to address companions, both of which are sure to shake up the formats. I finally caved and paid gems for the Ikoria mythic pass on Arena (I&amp;rsquo;ve saved up a bunch anyway. Still totally F2P!). Hopefully I can max out the levels/rewards before the mastery rotation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt; Geekfight was fun this week (theme was Marvel comics, right up my alley), although I didn&amp;rsquo;t win. We did poorly in the other two online quizzes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legends of Tomorrow season finale was weak and didn&amp;rsquo;t really make sense, but still somehow the best of the Arrowverse finales this season. Oh well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By contrast, I really liked the Rick and Morty season finale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also started watching Space Force; only 3 episodes in, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit meh. Not super funny or anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worked a bit on &lt;a href=&#34;https://triviastorm.net/&#34;&gt;triviastorm&lt;/a&gt; stuff this week. I&amp;rsquo;m preparing new questions and cleaning up the old ones, and also some work on a tighter checking algorithm. There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of features I want to add to this side project, let&amp;rsquo;s see if I manage to get around to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also spent a couple of hours fantasizing about rewriting the site again, maybe back to a dynamic backend, or some kind of hybrid, mostly to address the issues scaling with so many posts. Lol, will probably not do this yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s in the back of my mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No recent links for now. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll be more diligent about this next week.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Why Twitter?
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 02 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Alright so someone responded to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/quitting-facebook/&#34;&gt;my previous post on quitting facebook&lt;/a&gt; asking why I&amp;rsquo;m quitting facebook but keeping Twitter. This is a fair question; after all, Twitter also makes its money off targetted advertising, can also get you addicted to engagement (likes/RTs), the Twitter app can also be dumb, and there can also be a lot of toxic people on this platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are my reasons for keeping Twitter, and you may also get some tips for improving your twitter experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;twitter-allows-you-to-completely-disable-targetted-advertising&#34;&gt;Twitter allows you to completely disable targetted advertising:&lt;/h3&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#c91c00253ad1ae9b056d9bfae5126930-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/IMG_0841_hufd3da52f36486a42feb03bb7adb0c498_332696_300x0_resize_box_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;c91c00253ad1ae9b056d9bfae5126930-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/IMG_0841.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;2 Jun 2020 12:00am&#34;&gt;2 Jun 2020 12:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these settings disabled, they don&amp;rsquo;t expose any of your data to advertisers, and they don&amp;rsquo;t track you offsite. Twitter also by its design gathers less specific personal information about you. They don&amp;rsquo;t have fields to store your educational background or religious preference or other such demographics. Such things can be inferred from your activity though, but if I don&amp;rsquo;t enable targetted advertising, they really have no reason to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;twitter-provides-more-fine-tuned-controls-for-you-to-filter-who-can-interact-with-you&#34;&gt;Twitter provides more fine-tuned controls for you to filter who can interact with you.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can disable notifications from low-quality accounts:&lt;/p&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#07cf616a69da0b3bf903d9ad4dfbf378-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/IMG_0842_hua2344dafbc09a3b3f08ab49369d6511f_150532_300x0_resize_box_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;07cf616a69da0b3bf903d9ad4dfbf378-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/IMG_0842.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;2 Jun 2020 12:00am&#34;&gt;2 Jun 2020 12:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helps to filter out trolls and newly-created accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also mute particular keywords to avoid seeing topics you dislike:&lt;/p&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#c23e7fe814d897f4f20dcfbe1b1c6840-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/IMG_0843_hu3cb436bee07e5a0942209acde8a06545_145657_300x0_resize_box_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;c23e7fe814d897f4f20dcfbe1b1c6840-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/IMG_0843.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;2 Jun 2020 12:00am&#34;&gt;2 Jun 2020 12:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The ff7 one is there because I haven&amp;rsquo;t played the remake yet and don&amp;rsquo;t want spoilers lol.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;suggest_activity_tweet&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;suggest_recycled_tweet_inline&amp;rdquo; are hacks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/9gxxaq/lpt_twitter_mute_suggest_activity_tweet_and/&#34;&gt;prevent &amp;lsquo;liked by&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;followed by&amp;rsquo; tweets from appearing on your home timeline&lt;/a&gt;. (IMHO you should never be on your home timeline anyway and always on &amp;ldquo;Latest Tweets&amp;rdquo;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can also make your account completely private (only followers can interact with you), but that&amp;rsquo;s not for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tweetdeck-exists&#34;&gt;Tweetdeck exists&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default Twitter app sucks for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it occasionally shifts you back to &amp;ldquo;Home&amp;rdquo; when &amp;ldquo;Latest Tweets&amp;rdquo; i.e. chronological timeline is far superior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it shows you ads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lists, one of Twitters best features, aren&amp;rsquo;t first-class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter is a lot more tolerable if your main use of it is through the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/&#34;&gt;Tweetdeck site&lt;/a&gt;. Tweetdeck lets you arrange your interface into columns, which means you can make lists front and center. Here&amp;rsquo;s a sample of my Tweetdeck setup:&lt;/p&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#427089e48245315f5fbde69259ca403f-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/tweetdeck_hub6bbe349cf5268ed82f4dae746d7a278_932018_300x0_resize_box_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;427089e48245315f5fbde69259ca403f-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/tweetdeck.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;2 Jun 2020 12:00am&#34;&gt;2 Jun 2020 12:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part of Tweetdeck is that it never shows ads, and everything is always chronological!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;twitter-is-slightly-harder-to-use-than-facebook-and-doesnt-benefit-from-free-data-policies-in-the-philippines&#34;&gt;Twitter is slightly harder to use than Facebook and doesn&amp;rsquo;t benefit from free data policies in the Philippines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, this is gonna be a bit elitist, but these &amp;ldquo;disadvantages&amp;rdquo; mean using Twitter has a higher barrier of entry than Facebook, which in theory means a higher quality of discourse. I have no data or analytics to back up this assertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;twitter-has-an-open-api&#34;&gt;Twitter has an open API.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is a more technical reason. Having an open API allows me to cross-post from my site to Twitter every time I write a blog post, and also archive all my tweets from that platform back into my own site. FB API used to be a lot more open as well, but as they continued to flub their personal data management, their API got more and more closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open API also means services like &lt;a href=&#34;http://rssbridge.chamallow.com/&#34;&gt;RSS Bridge&lt;/a&gt; can exist, allowing Twitter feeds to be followed via open formats like RSS/Atom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;twitter-moderation-is-less-evil-than-facebook-moderation&#34;&gt;Twitter moderation is less evil than Facebook moderation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of them are actually fairly terrible and inconsistent (surely a consequence of operating at that scale without corresponding scaling up of moderation efforts), but at least Twitter is not afraid to at least fact-check Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;twitter-has-better-public-content&#34;&gt;Twitter has better public content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, this one might be totally subjective or anecdotal based on my own Twitter follows and setup, but I find that public discourse is generally better on Twitter compared to Facebook. It might be due to some of the factors above, and maybe some level of luck/privilege/good filtering on my part. I mean, you can find bad actors and low-quality discussions if you go looking for them, but why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not saying Twitter is perfect. There is certainly a lot of room for improvement, especially technically. But compared to Facebook, I think Twitter is much less of a garbage fire maybe because (a) I don&amp;rsquo;t feel constrained to follow mainly family and friends; Twitter feels more like it can be a window to part of the larger world; and (b) the existence of Tweetdeck and better filtering tools means I don&amp;rsquo;t have to suffer through ads or other such inanity every few posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: It seems a bit weird to be publishing this right now when the world seems to be on fire. I follow a lot of Americans so a lot of the racism and police brutality-inspired chaos dominates my Twitter timelines at the moment (as can be seen in the Tweetdeck screenshot above). But I think this is also a good illustration of how useful Twitter&amp;rsquo;s filters and options are. If you chose to, (or needed to temporarily, for your sanity maybe?) you can probably block out these events from your timeline completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is certainly a lot of room for improvement especially from the technical side; &lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.technology&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; comes to mind as a superior platform in this regard, but that platform doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the scale of Twitter yet, which limits the interesting interactions that can come up. I find a lot of smart and interesting interactions still happen on Twitter, so it&amp;rsquo;s not yet something I&amp;rsquo;m willing to give up.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Quitting Facebook
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/quitting-facebook/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/quitting-facebook/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This will be cross-posted to my Facebook account.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been long overdue, but I&amp;rsquo;m quitting Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not you, but it&amp;rsquo;s not me either. It&amp;rsquo;s Facebook. There&amp;rsquo;s a ton of reasons for quitting Facebook, but here are some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook is dumb. The site is barely usable and the app is a big battery hog. And posts don&amp;rsquo;t even support formatting so now you&amp;rsquo;re getting this one in Markdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook uses your personal information to earn money, and they&amp;rsquo;re &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal&#34;&gt;not even very good at keeping that information safe&lt;/a&gt;. Their tech tracks you all over the internet, even when you aren&amp;rsquo;t logged in to FB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook is evil:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CEO Zuckerberg thinks their users are &lt;a href=&#34;https://gawker.com/5636765/facebook-ceo-admits-to-calling-users-dumb-fucks&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;dumb fucks&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook is divisive. They &lt;a href=&#34;https://geeknewscentral.com/2020/05/26/facebook-executives-dismissed-efforts-to-make-the-site-less-divisive/&#34;&gt;know it and choose to do nothing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-for-the-first-time-acknowledges-election-manipulation/&#34;&gt;used for election manipulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CEO Zuckerberg &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/28/zuckerberg-facebook-police-online-speech-trump&#34;&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t think they need to police fake news and harmful speech by politicians&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook is a breeding ground for paid trolls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook teaches us bad habits like responding to trolls and gets us addicted to likes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had initially planned to just stop using Facebook and keep my account data there indefinitely, in the interest of reducing link rot on the web. But as long as it stays up, there&amp;rsquo;s always the temptation to use it, and it still supports Facebook&amp;rsquo;s surveillance capitalism machine, even a little. So it&amp;rsquo;s time to cut the cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-can-i-keep-in-touch-or-know-what-youre-up-to&#34;&gt;How can I keep in touch or know what you&amp;rsquo;re up to?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still actively post on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/&#34;&gt;own website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/page/about/elsewhere/&#34;&gt;other services&lt;/a&gt; and have an actively &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/page/about/contact/&#34;&gt;maintained contact page&lt;/a&gt;. Every email address I&amp;rsquo;ve had since 2003 is still being checked regularly. If you have my phone number (ends in 09) I&amp;rsquo;m on Viber and Signal. I&amp;rsquo;m very easy to reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-about-messenger-and-instagram&#34;&gt;What about Messenger and Instagram?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m keeping Messenger around for a bit, maybe until the whole quarantine situation blows over or until I can convince the people who still communicate with me there to move to a different service. Yes, you can keep using Messenger even if you deactivate your FB account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to do with Instagram yet. I should probably quit it too, it&amp;rsquo;s not really important, but one thing at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;should-i-also-quit-facebook&#34;&gt;Should I also quit Facebook?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you what to do. Do you even really derive any meaningful benefit from this site that you can&amp;rsquo;t get elsewhere? Enough to justify continuing to support and feed their network? That&amp;rsquo;s for you to decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, yes you should quit Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;but-if-i-quit-how-can-i-keep-in-touch-with-my-friends&#34;&gt;But if I quit how can I keep in touch with my friends?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start a group text. Or an email chain. Or a discord server. Or a Viber/Signal/Skype group. There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of alternatives, I&amp;rsquo;m sure I missed a lot. Pick one and go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend: Whatsapp (owned by FB), WeChat (Chinese spyware), Messenger (hypocrisy!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;but-what-if-i-want-to-share-my-thoughts-to-the-world&#34;&gt;But what if I want to share my thoughts to the world?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, alternatives: Twitter, Mastodon, Wordpress.com, Tumblr, Reddit, micro.blog, Blogger, etc. Even LiveJournal is still around! All of them free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend: Medium (ew!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;but-if-people-use-so-many-different-websites-and-services-it-becomes-hard-to-follow-them-all&#34;&gt;But if people use so many different websites and services it becomes hard to follow them all!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use a feed reader service like InoReader or Feedly to follow most such services. Another reason Facebook sucks is that they&amp;rsquo;re a black hole that doesn&amp;rsquo;t contribute back to the open web: you can&amp;rsquo;t easily follow someone on Facebook from outside Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;but-i-need-facebook-for-workto-promote-my-brandbusinessside-hustle&#34;&gt;But I need Facebook for work/to promote my brand/business/side hustle!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you really? There may be alternatives you haven&amp;rsquo;t considered. A lot of small business can just as easily spread through word of mouth etc. But I&amp;rsquo;m not an entrepreneur (and don&amp;rsquo;t care to be), so IDK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If yes, sad. If you like, you can just create a new account with no personal information, don&amp;rsquo;t add your friends, create a page for your business things, don&amp;rsquo;t post anything personal ever and only use it for work/business things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;but-how-will-i-know-when-peoples-birthdays-are&#34;&gt;But how will I know when people&amp;rsquo;s birthdays are?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just don&amp;rsquo;t greet anybody, I&amp;rsquo;m sure it will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;all-of-that-seems-too-complicated-maybe-ill-just-stick-with-facebook&#34;&gt;All of that seems too complicated, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll just stick with Facebook.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s fine. Do whatever you like. I&amp;rsquo;m not your mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-what-now&#34;&gt;So what now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan is to leave this account and this post up for maybe until the end of June. After that I&amp;rsquo;m deactivating the Facebook account. Then at some point afterwards, I&amp;rsquo;ll delete the account (probably when I no longer need Messenger.)&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It seems difficult to write about stuff today, when the world seems like it is on fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For historical context, for the past few days the USA, presumably a first-world nation, has been in the grip of massive protests and riots and police brutality following the murder of a black man by four police officers was captured on video and went viral. Basically, many states are responding to protests against police brutality with&amp;hellip; police brutality. Bold move Cotton. I&amp;rsquo;m not an American, but this resonates with me a lot because to see this kind of thing happening in a country that purports to champion human rights, how much worse can it be in a country like ours or a dictatorship like China where they don&amp;rsquo;t even give lip service to the concept? (Spoiler: we already know police brutality and EJKs are a thing in my country.) I give my support to those protesting, and hope they achieve the reforms their country needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would question why I (and maybe the world) focuses so much on what happens in the USA, given that violence and brutality happen in a lot of other countries too. The main difference is that the USA is presumably a superpower and provide some semblance of leadership to democratic countries. The USA needs to shape up, they&amp;rsquo;re making democracy look bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s weird watching a hegemony fall apart in real time to weight of its own excesses. It&amp;rsquo;s like they&amp;rsquo;re trying to hard to make &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_Tense_(Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine)&#34;&gt;Deep Space Nine&amp;rsquo;s 2020s prediction&lt;/a&gt; come true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: I should also highlight in this space that this past week China rammed its National Security Law through Hong Kong, bypassing the HK legislature and essentially ending HK&amp;rsquo;s autonomy through one country, two systems. I&amp;rsquo;ve been to Hong Kong multiples times and know and have worked with people there, so this one hits a lot closer to home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/covid19-05-31/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s quarantine notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weather slightly cooling off, with more thunderstorms happening in the afternoons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep schedule completely out of whack again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; Moved along my Divity OS2 game. A friend got me some Steam keys for the older Jackbox Party Packs, so I have more access to games to play. I tried streaming via Twitch, but seems difficult due to streaming delay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt; We didn&amp;rsquo;t really do too well in the quiz nights this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have uploaded some gaming videos to our trivia team&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCptXvNbp4ETVttb_k-1oOww&#34;&gt;Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;, check it out!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watched Zombieland: Double Tap. My friends and I really enjoyed the first movie when it came out ten years ago. This one was fun, but pretty much more of the same&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;caught up with Legends of Tomorrow in anticipation of their season finale this coming week. I have to say I had low expectations but once again Legends may be the best of the Arrowverse shows this season. I really enjoyed the penultimate episode where they had parodies of other shows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Site updates: Nothing to announce!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do have some social media related thing to announce, maybe tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent Links of Interest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/&#34;&gt;Rediscovering the small web.&lt;/a&gt; Great post here, and I like the term &amp;ldquo;small web&amp;rdquo; to describe what I&amp;rsquo;ve been missing on the internet lately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slim pickings this week apparently. Been distracted by other things.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/25/mafia-logic/#mafia-logic&#34;&gt;recent post on Cory Doctorow&amp;rsquo;s pluralistic blog&lt;/a&gt; had a really good take on the general worldview of &amp;ldquo;the right&amp;rdquo;, describing it as &amp;ldquo;mafia logic&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m going to quote a huge chunk of it here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This follows perfectly from the second definition. The purpose of the law is to protect the rightful rulers, so the law can&amp;rsquo;t – by definition – punish them. And it is &amp;ldquo;mafia logic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holbo was talking about Michael Gove – a UK Tory Minister – excusing his the Prime Minister&amp;rsquo;s advisor Dominick Cummings repeatedly breaking the quarantine rules that Cummings is responsible for creating and enforcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it could apply equally well to Trump&amp;rsquo;s pardons for his crooked henchmen, or the legions of Karens who think the cops should come and bust some Black kid&amp;rsquo;s head for selling lemonade without a license, while ignoring their own anti-vax playground quarantine-breaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s pure Blue Lives Matter logic: the law should protect cops from Black people, but not Black people from cops. It should punish Black people who break the law, but protect cops who break the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a meaningful difference between reactionary and progressive, left and right. It&amp;rsquo;s the difference of property rights vs human rights – whether you exact the right to hoard while others starve, or the right not to starve while others hoard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the difference between pluralism and elitism: whether you think some of us were born to be ruled over, or whether you think we should have a government selected by its people to serve those people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the difference of equal protections and duties under the law, as opposed to impunity for the powerful and the legalized oppression of the powerless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resonates with me a lot because &amp;ldquo;equal protections under the law&amp;rdquo; may be a pretty big ask in this country when individual citizens find it difficult to apply judgement equally to both those they support and those they don&amp;rsquo;t. Double standards abound, both for the government and many of the citizens. There are a lot of people in this country who support the people in power blindly because of some form of tribalism; they chose this person so they feel they have to support them no matter what, no matter how incompetent, no matter how blatant the abuses are, and so on. It&amp;rsquo;s a weird case of trying to justify a purchase after the fact, even if it turned out to be horrible, out of some sense of pride, maybe? People hate being wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of someone I used to know who was an avid supporter of a particular candidate during the 2016 elections. Whenever he would fail to convince us of the merits of his candidate (or be unable to answer our concerns about his human rights record, etc), he would simply say &amp;ldquo;you guys just don&amp;rsquo;t trust him&amp;rdquo;. Which is a really weird thing to say because why trust any politician based on anything other than his track record and what he says or does? It always felt like he had already decided to trust this candidate and that nothing else mattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like so many people in this country are so used to our politicians taking advantage of them that they have become hostage to this form of &amp;ldquo;rule&amp;rdquo;: ordinary people are subject to the harshness of the law, while for those in power, the law must be &amp;ldquo;tempered with compassion&amp;rdquo;. Being progressive and believing in pluralism in this country requires that we challenge those norms wherever we can, that we hold the powerful to account, regardless of political affiliation. It can be challenging to get people to look beyond their tribalistic nature, but it&amp;rsquo;s something we need to figure out if we are to survive and evolve as a truly democratic &amp;ldquo;rule of law&amp;rdquo; society and not devolve into some kind of right-wing populist authoritarian &amp;ldquo;rule of men&amp;rdquo; wasteland (if we aren&amp;rsquo;t already there yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the Doctorow quote (which I&amp;rsquo;ve already strayed from a bit&amp;hellip; the last few paragraphs turned out a little ranty about the state of the country, but I&amp;rsquo;ve actually already rewritten it a couple of times to be&amp;hellip; less ranty I guess?), this model of how &amp;ldquo;the right&amp;rdquo; thinks can be a useful tool when engaging in debate or discussion with others (something I am less inclined to do these days). The two sides of this model are mostly incompatible, thus when discussing with anyone you can ask yourself (or them directly) which side of that divide they lie on. (I don&amp;rsquo;t imagine anyone would say out loud they believe people in power deserve special treatment, because that sounds absurd. Or evil. But that might just be the leftist perspective in me.) Whether they agree with you or not, at the very least it gives you a model in which to frame further discussion, or even to decide whether further discussion would even be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer 1: Doctorow is of course primarily left-leaning, hence his bias towards these definitions. It would be interesting to see what the equivalent definitions would be on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer 2: Every individual is slightly different. I use &amp;ldquo;the right&amp;rdquo; in quotes here to indicate that the generalizations are describing a significant subset of people who might consider themselves &amp;ldquo;right-wing&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;conservative&amp;rdquo; or whatnot. I use this label more for this particular way of thinking rather than a political alignment. (And I dislike labelling people anyway, as much as possible.)&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Migrating away from GMail
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/gmail-migration/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve basically been using GMail as my main email account since I first got access in 2006ish. &amp;ldquo;Main email account&amp;rdquo; means I use it as the primary access point for all my other online accounts. GMail was certainly revolutionary when it came out, and had a lot of benefits: it was fast, easily searchable and had a lot of free storage. But in the modern day, there are significant disadvantages to using GMail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you don&amp;rsquo;t control your account; it&amp;rsquo;s rare, but anecdotally people have lost access to their GMail accounts for some perceived infraction, and when that happens you have no way of recovery or appeal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you&amp;rsquo;re fueling a surveillance capitalism machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it can &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/1263160405737607170/&#34;&gt;look unprofessional&lt;/a&gt; to be using free email, especially for official or business correspondence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first bullet point is the biggie for me. One such story came across the Hacker News front page a while back and I can only imagine the nightmare it would be for me to lose access to my Google account. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve started a conscious effort to slowly but surely decouple myself from my dependencies on Google Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That meant migrating my online accounts to use another email, primarily one I control. I already had this domain &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net&#34;&gt;roytang.net&lt;/a&gt;, so there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to not use emails with that domain. The only risk to using an email on your own domain is that if you forgot to renew your domain, or otherwise lose control, you are screwed. So&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t let that happen I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only question was what email service provider to use? I&amp;rsquo;m still on Webfaction hosting, and they do provide email accounts, but I&amp;rsquo;m planning to move away from them before the end of the year &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/03/rip-webfaction/&#34;&gt;due to the GoDaddy purchase&lt;/a&gt;, so probably best not to be reliant on their email service. If I wanted more control over the risks, I could of course run my own mail servers, but I&amp;rsquo;m not ready to go that far yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one I tried was &lt;a href=&#34;https://protonmail.com/&#34;&gt;ProtonMail&lt;/a&gt; because yay, end-to-end encryption! I used it for a couple of months first before paying for anything (using a custom domain email requires a paid plan). Unfortunately, I felt like the additional security wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth the trouble of not being super portable. Accessing via mobile required their app, can&amp;rsquo;t use any generic email client. I also wanted to be able to access via a desktop client like Thunderbird or Mail on the Macbook Air, but that required some sort of SMTP bridge, and it seemed like a bother. Every time I set up a new machine I&amp;rsquo;d need it? I&amp;rsquo;m not super security-conscious, so I decided to keep the protonmail account as a secondary account, in case I did come to a situation where e2e encryption was absolutely critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I next tried &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.migadu.com&#34;&gt;migadu.com&lt;/a&gt; as an email provider, based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://cmpwn.com/@sir/102452352875414214&#34;&gt;this recommendation thread&lt;/a&gt; by Drew Devault over on Mastodon. Their web settings aren&amp;rsquo;t super refined, but everything was relatively easy to setup. And their free tier includes support for custom domains and multiple mailboxes per domain, so that&amp;rsquo;s a big plus. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using them now for a few months and am generally happy with the service. (They did have a short bout of server access issues around the time the covid19 thing started getting around, but they resolved it pretty quickly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After choosing an email service provider, the next step was setting up emails and shifting over all my online accounts. Migadu&amp;rsquo;s support for unlimited mailboxes meant I could have separate email addresses for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contact email for other online accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publicly accessible contact email on the website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;private email for communication with friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up updating over 50 online accounts to point to the new domain email. Not all in one go, as that&amp;rsquo;s terribly boring, but a few at a time over the course of the last few months. That covers social media services, gaming services, financial services, dev tools, and so on. The upside of all this effort is I got to do a kind of audit of all my online accounts, which ones could be deleted/deactivated, which ones needed new passwords, which ones have poor security measures, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, I only need to do this once. An advantage to using custom domain emails is that if you&amp;rsquo;re unhappy with your underlying email provider, you can switch to a different one while retaining the same email addresses, no need to update emails in all your other online accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I had no intention of using webmail anymore, so I ended up installing Thunderbird (it&amp;rsquo;s been a while old friend) for accessing these accounts, and also set up the Mail app on the Macbook Air. For the phone, I installed K-9 mail, although I&amp;rsquo;m having an issue with that currently where it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be doing background syncing of mails. Not a super critical issue, as I mostly don&amp;rsquo;t want to be pinged real-time by email anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still keeping the GMail account of course, a lot of people still know me by that email address, but now I have a largely reduced footprint and dependency on it. And as mentioned, I&amp;rsquo;m also keeping the ProtonMail account for any security-conscious communications. So I ended up having to manage a lot more email addresses, but hopefully everything will be a bit more organized, with every account having a specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A while back I got an export of my Foursquare/Swarm data. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, these were a pair of apps that were used for &amp;ldquo;checking-in&amp;rdquo; to particular locations, with a sort of gamification system where if you checked in at a place often enough, you would earn points and eventually become &amp;ldquo;Mayor&amp;rdquo; of the venue. The idea being that owners of those venues might give some benefits to those who check-in often at those locations (AFAIK, this never really caught on in the Philippines). I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a super active user of Foursquare/Swarm, I had maybe 500ish check-ins from 2010-2017 when I stopped using it. Some people are still using it up to now and have thousands of check-ins, although as far as I can tell it&amp;rsquo;s no longer very popular in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I thought having this data would be handy so I put it up as location data on this site. It also gave me an excuse to figure out how to render OpenStreetMap. (The location pages are one of the few pages that have JavaScript on this site.) The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/locations/&#34;&gt;locations page&lt;/a&gt; shows a map of all the visited locations and a listing of the locations grouped by country, and for the Philippines, by city (where available). You can click through to individual locations to see how often I&amp;rsquo;ve checked in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, one of the venues with the most number of check-ins for me is &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/locations/4d27f36c8292236a41e814bb/&#34;&gt;BBQ Chicken&lt;/a&gt;, a now-closed Korean-themed BBQ chicken place in Ortigas near where I used to work. Another one with a lot of check-ins would be &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/locations/4bbbfea5ed7776b032413f51/&#34;&gt;Murphy&amp;rsquo;s in Makati&lt;/a&gt; where we did a lot of quiz nights from 2011-2013. Obviously, the location data isn&amp;rsquo;t complete and doesn&amp;rsquo;t capture all my visits, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t use Foursquare/Swarm that religiously anyway. I&amp;rsquo;m certain I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten at BBQ Chicken more than the 18 times I checked in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-about-privacy&#34;&gt;What about privacy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually telling the internet where you are all the time might seem a bit anathema to the more privacy-conscious modern world, but I do like having a history of where I&amp;rsquo;ve been. I even have location tracking enabled on my phone via Google Maps so that I can have a timeline of where I am on a day-by-day basis. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it more than once to answer queries like &amp;ldquo;do you know if we went to &lt;place&gt; in &lt;month&gt; of last year?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;When did you last go to &lt;store&gt; ?&amp;rdquo; Obviously it&amp;rsquo;s not for everyone and I fully understand the privacy ramifications of Google having all my location data and feeding the mightly global surveillance capitalism machine, but for me right now it&amp;rsquo;s an acceptable tradeoff. As for the foursquare data, I was using foursquare back when I was less privacy-conscious that I am now, so I my attitude is like, that particular dataset has been out in the world for years, I can&amp;rsquo;t put the toothpaste back in the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I did scrub some old check-ins from this data (and the corresponding data on Swarm and on Twitter if it was cross-posted)) that was a bit too close to home. I know this data potentially allows bad guys or assassins or whatnot to figure out where I live, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d at least make it a tiny bit more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-now&#34;&gt;What now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a neat little thing that probably only I will care about, as it lets me see some of the places I&amp;rsquo;ve been to. And I probably won&amp;rsquo;t be using 4sq/Swarm again, so the dataset probably won&amp;rsquo;t be growing. That being said, I do want to add some future features like grouping the check-ins according to trips, so I can see all the particular places where I went to on particular trips. Many of my trips are missing data though; for example, my only check-in in France was in the airport, and not at any of the touristy places we went to. I may try to supplement this data with selected extracts from my Google Maps location history (hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s easy to figure out!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also don&amp;rsquo;t know where to put the locations page in the menus lol. I&amp;rsquo;ll figure it out sooner or later!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A bit of brouhaha a couple of weeks ago after the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.manilatimes.net/2020/05/05/news/headlines/ntc-orders-abs-cbn-to-shut-down-operations/722798/&#34;&gt;National Telecommunications Commission ordered the country&amp;rsquo;s biggest broadcaster ABS-CBN to cease operations because Congress had been remiss in renewing their franchise.&lt;/a&gt;. This despite the NTC earlier promising they can operate provisionally while the franchise renewal is being processed, a change of heart apparently due to a legal opinion by the SolGen. Some thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bias&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bias&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker of the house &lt;a href=&#34;https://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2020/05/15/cayetano-slams-bias-at-abs-cbn/&#34;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you are one of the reasons why there are issues with your network. In the eyes of some, there is clear bias and meddling in the elections, which is against the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, IDK what this supposed election meddling is that he&amp;rsquo;s talking about (If they have really done such a thing that is illegal, they can be charged in court, but AFAIK there are no such cases?), but speaking on the issue of &amp;ldquo;bias&amp;rdquo;: we cannot require that a news entity be unbiased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeating for emphasis: &lt;strong&gt;we cannot require that a news entity be unbiased&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, you say? It comes back to the nature of bias, and the nature of humans. Every individual human is biased towards certain things, as a result of their experiences growing up. No matter how well-read or well-traveled or well-learned you are, your individual human experience is but a fraction of a fraction of an infinitessimal fraction of the collective human experience. Therefore, you will exhibit bias naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations are pretty much the same, since they are composed of biased humans. Any given organization can strive to be less biased by having members with diverse points of view and opinion. And in fact it would be better if our news entities were as unbiased as possible, this would be ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we (through the state) cannot require that such entities be unbiased, for the simple reason that determination of bias will itself be tainted by bias. There can be no absolute, objective standard for being unbiased, because who would make that judgement? Who would make the rules? Humans, who are also biased? Imposing such a vague restriction on news entities (&amp;ldquo;you must be unbiased&amp;rdquo;) is tantamount to imposing someone else&amp;rsquo;s will (and bias) upon the entity, and that encroaches upon the freedom of expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can impose specific restrictions on freedoms of expression and the press through law; examples are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disallowing knowingly publishing falsehoods through libel laws (although this too is problematic, since truth is also not always measurable nor absolute)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disallowing child pornography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;false fire alarms in a crowded theater&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing is that specific, measurable things can be disallowed, since presumably these can be evaluated fairly (or as fairly as possible). More dangerous are restrictions that depend upon the whims of those in power, such as commonly found in authoritarian countries like China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get into the nitty-gritty legalities of it, since I am not a lawyer. But my main point is that like it or not, we can&amp;rsquo;t require news entities to be unbiased. We want them to be as close to that as possible ideally, but we can&amp;rsquo;t require it, because that is not enforceable fairly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About ABS-CBN specifically, I don&amp;rsquo;t even see any bias; I mean, if anything, many of their news anchors and celebrities seem to be supportive of the administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(You might disagree with me, but that&amp;rsquo;s just your bias, and that&amp;rsquo;s fine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;press-freedom-access-to-information-and-other-concerns&#34;&gt;Press Freedom, Access to Information, and other concerns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people have commented that press freedom still exists in the Philippines despite the ABS-CBN shutdown, citing reasons such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;existence of other networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ABS-CBN still being able to broadcast over digital channels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people still being able to criticize the government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is true, that the Philippines does still enjoy some press freedom, undoubtedly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any reduction in the diversity of news sources is harmful to democratic society since it reduces access to information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not everyone has access to cable or internet channels through which ABS-CBN programs can still be accessed, thus depriving many people of a source of information (and in some cases the only source of information they had available)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the mere fact that the government, on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/168137-duterte-block-abs-cbn-franchise-renewal&#34;&gt;president&amp;rsquo;s whim and vindictiveness&lt;/a&gt; (no one really believes the NTC and the SolGen and even the House are acting independently), has taken the biggest network off the air leads to what is called a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect&#34;&gt;chilling effect&lt;/a&gt;, basically sending a message to everybody else. If even the biggest network in the country can be taken down, what chance do smaller outfits or independent journalists have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have cited other reasons why ABS-CBN should have not been taken down, like the fact that X number of workers would lose their jobs. For me, that&amp;rsquo;s extraneous. Of course we don&amp;rsquo;t want anyone to lose their livelihoods, but that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t even be necessary to contemplate: on the basis of the harms to democracy and press freedom alone this should not have happened. And especially not during a pandemic, when getting information out to people can be crucial!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand the requirement for Congress to approve broadcast franchises, since broadcast frequencies are a limited resource. But if it were me: the grant of provisional franchise upon expiry would be automatic unless explicitly revoked by Congress with clear violations specified as the cause of revokation. And the grant of franchise should probably explicity specify the conditions upon which the franchise may not be renewed. The grant or renewal of broadcast franchises should be as free of politics as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-police-bad-news-entities&#34;&gt;How to police &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; news entities?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can&amp;rsquo;t impose unbiasedness, and shutting them down violates press freedom, how do we control wayward news entities? Since humans are biased, we have no universal definition of &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo;, but there are still some controls that society can impose, not necssarily through law:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;through law, specific restrictions as described above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally, it should be the market and news consumers themselves who are able to control the biases of the news entities, by not patronizing news entities that tend to be editorialized. (Although this probably requires a more educated populace, see: Fox News). ABS-CBN itself is still super popular, in spite of everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;etc&#34;&gt;Etc&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chilling effect on free expression has a slippery slope. Already the government has started going after critics allegedly for social media posts. If we are not careful, we might be on the road to becoming like China. (Which might be what Duterte and his cult following want, but certainly won&amp;rsquo;t be good for a democratic Philippines).&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/covid19-05-24/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s quarantine notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the weather has been so hot lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken to shifting my sleep schedule to afternoons so that I can maximize the use of the air-conditioning to when it&amp;rsquo;s most needed. It also helps me be more productive, since I can get more things done if I&amp;rsquo;m awake during the cooler hours of the day. I think I&amp;rsquo;m more looking forward to the end of summer than the end of quarantine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a bit of consulting work this week, actually had to code some stuff. Mostly integration work, API calls, that sort of thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/hyperx-cloud2/&#34;&gt;fancy new headset&lt;/a&gt; I ordered off Lazada came in last Saturday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Gaming: **Not much gaming this week surprisingly. The Saturday playgroup started playing Scythe, a Steam version of an actual boardgame. Games take a long time, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty terrible at it because it seems to need a lot of advance planning. We&amp;rsquo;re also planning to play some Jackbox games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt; So we&amp;rsquo;re up to 3 regular online quiz nights now. Sadly, we didn&amp;rsquo;t too well in this week&amp;rsquo;s quizzes. I did win the Geekfight one last Wednesday, but the other two were a wash. As if that weren&amp;rsquo;t enough, we also decided to do internal trivia team quizzes, with the intent of putting them up on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCptXvNbp4ETVttb_k-1oOww&#34;&gt;relatively-new Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt; (Subscribe, etc). I hosted the first one last Wednesday, and the video will be up on YT as soon as our editor gets done with it. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably upload the slides once it&amp;rsquo;s up as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caught up with the &amp;ldquo;season finales&amp;rdquo; for Supergirl and Flash. In quotes because they literally just cut their seasons short and left a lot of cliffhangers to be resolved next season. Understandable, but so weird.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;various streaming shows have started up again their seasons that I&amp;rsquo;ve started watching: Rick and Morty, Patriot Act with Hasan Minaj&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Site updates: Nothing to announce! Been busy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent Links of Interest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;great &lt;a href=&#34;https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/&#34;&gt;post on software bloat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not big on sudoku, but I enjoyed watching &lt;a href=&#34;https://kottke.org/20/05/solving-the-the-miracle-sudoku&#34;&gt;this &amp;ldquo;miracle sudoku&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; that made the rounds last week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@steve.yegge/saying-goodbye-to-the-best-gig-i-ever-had-a33736833c1e?source=rss-c1ec701babb7------2&#34;&gt;Steve Yegge has left Grab&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with him, he used to work at Google and wrote a bunch of &lt;a href=&#34;https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;longish but really good software development related articles&lt;/a&gt; back in the day. I like this recent post because he highlights some of the differences he noticed while working with people from this side of the world. It was actually a year ago that he last &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/05/1131993395738468352/&#34;&gt;wrote about being at Grab&lt;/a&gt;. Although ick, Medium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the Worldometer site to track worldwide Covid19 stats, but it turns out it &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;might not be super accurate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capcom has re-released &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.capcom-unity.com/2020/05/21/street-fighter-april-fools-mini-games-have-returned/&#34;&gt;some old April Fools joke Street Fighter themed minigames&lt;/a&gt;! I liked the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/1263976021444816896/&#34;&gt;Street Fighter Academy one&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s a trivia game!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theringer.com/2020/5/20/21264342/online-trivia-learned-league&#34;&gt;Great writeup of LearnedLeague&lt;/a&gt;, a long-running trivia league that&amp;rsquo;s invite-only. I kind of want to try to find a way to join, but it seems really tough! &lt;a href=&#34;https://learnedleague.com/&#34;&gt;Their website&lt;/a&gt; has an archive of all the past sets and their questions. I browsed through a month&amp;rsquo;s worth of questions and they&amp;rsquo;re really hard, I could answer maybe 1-2 in 10 questions on average.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/02/thoughts-on-blogging-2020-edition/&#34;&gt;Previously&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/weeknotes-2020-05-17/&#34;&gt;most recent weeknotes&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned this &lt;a href=&#34;http://tttthis.com/blog/if-i-could-bring-one-thing-back-to-the-internet-it-would-be-blogs&#34;&gt;post about bringing blogs back to the internet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23205588&#34;&gt;ensuing discussion on Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some further thoughts on blogging based on the HN discussion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-traffic-and-engagement&#34;&gt;On Traffic and Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone mentioned that one of the reasons most people stop blogging is that it feels like there&amp;rsquo;s nobody reading their work. This reminds me of a convo I had with a friend a couple of years back when he saw one of my blog posts. He was getting into content creation himself via a Youtube channel and he asked me what kind of traffic or how many visitors I see on my blog, and I was like &amp;ldquo;You know what, I have no idea!&amp;rdquo; because I never really got into that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to have Google Analytics on the site back when I first migrated to Hugo, because the initial theme I used supported it and why not right? But I got rid of it when I did the redesign because I didn&amp;rsquo;t really use it and didn&amp;rsquo;t care for the additional JavaScript and tracking and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do have are server-side stats via AWStats, which I do look at maybe once every couple or years or so. For the purposes of this post I decided to pull the server-side stats into a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/stats/awstats/&#34;&gt;page on this site&lt;/a&gt;. So if you check that page, I had 29292 unique visitors for the entirety of 2019. That&amp;rsquo;s around 80 visitors per day. The peak was in 2017, when I had around 135 visitors per day. These are pretty weak numbers I guess? I don&amp;rsquo;t really know, but obviously I haven&amp;rsquo;t gone viral or gotten on the frontpage of HN/reddit or anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s fine! Traffic isn&amp;rsquo;t why I write, and any visitors above 0 are kind of a bonus, since I write mostly for myself! I feel like optimizing for traffic or SEO or whatever would be a bit like selling your soul. I think the whole point of the original post was a nostalgia for the old-style blogs that were writing for the sake of writing, and not to cater to the whims of the search engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do like engagement though, mostly in the form of comments, which is something I have &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/stats/site/&#34;&gt;been tracking before&lt;/a&gt;. (Other than the comments, you can see that most of the stats that I track are &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; stats, i.e. how much I post and so on.) Again, it&amp;rsquo;s not a whole lot, but it&amp;rsquo;s enough to feel a bit rewarding every time a new comment comes in. I recently disabled the comment form for the site (been getting too much spam), but this site can still get new comments via webmention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is nice to know that there are actually people out there reading my words. I do know some friends of mine follow the blog somehow (or maybe they just pick up the posts when I syndicate to Twitter), but it&amp;rsquo;s actually more fun when a stranger leaves a good comment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-self-censorship&#34;&gt;On Self-Censorship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone on HN mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this is why I don’t have a blog. I have a lot of strong opinions that might be interesting to some people, but I don’t want to miss opportunities because some HR person googled my name and found a post they disagreed with. Or, in the future, not a real person but an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this is a result of the current climate, where people can get &amp;ldquo;cancelled&amp;rdquo; for things they&amp;rsquo;ve said in the past etc. And I guess that&amp;rsquo;s a valid concern, if you want to live your life that way. But really, how strong are your opinions if you can&amp;rsquo;t stand for them in public?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I write something, on this blog or elsewhere on the internet, it&amp;rsquo;s because I believe it to be true, at that time. (Or I may also be shitposting, but it should be obvious when I&amp;rsquo;m shitposting.) I&amp;rsquo;ve written some political stuff on the blog and elsewhere on the internet before, and I often criticize my country&amp;rsquo;s government when the opportunity arises. This might become problematic recently, as Duterte&amp;rsquo;s administration has started harassing critics by filing charges against them and so on. But even if it comes to that, I like to think that I would be willing to stand by what I write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to think it&amp;rsquo;s because I tend to be right all the time (LOL), but also if I&amp;rsquo;ve said or done or posted something before that would later turn out to be inaccurate or offensive or whatnot, I have no concerns about walking that back and saying &amp;ldquo;Hey, I made a mistake!&amp;rdquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s another advantage running your own blog has over something like Twitter. On Twitter you can only delete your past mistakes. Here I can preserve them, but add a note saying something like &amp;ldquo;My opinion on this has changed&amp;rdquo; or such. I have not yet had a reason to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I think it helps that I largely hold non-controversial opinions and generally try to avoid being an asshole to people, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably the topic of another post entirely.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also the idea that you may want to write things that you don&amp;rsquo;t want associated with you IRL. I can understand that. For those kinds of things, you can make one-off posts using throwaway accounts I guess? For me, from the very beginning of my internet presence, I haven&amp;rsquo;t considered anonymizing or protecting my content. My geocities URL had my full name in it for example (and so does this domain!). But I have made some throwaway posts that aren&amp;rsquo;t tied to me, for example when talking about sensitive information or such. But I think for a large majority of the content a regular person would post, this isn&amp;rsquo;t really necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-originality&#34;&gt;On Originality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often notice when I start writing on a particular topic, I learn more about my thoughts and opinions of it and realize my thoughts are wrong or not really novel. Halfway in I give up since I feel like, &amp;ldquo;oh, this actually isn&amp;rsquo;t really adding anything new to the conversation&amp;rdquo;. Then I leave with a new humbleness about my beliefs but also a sense of &amp;ldquo;when am I actually going to know enough to warrant writing about it?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in a blogging lull around 2010-2015 (as seen on &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/stats/site/&#34;&gt;the stats page&lt;/a&gt;!) and thinking of getting back into it and writing more software-related content, but I mentioned to a friend that I was worried that the internet was already oversaturated with such writers/bloggers and I would not have anything original to contribute. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember his exact words, but it was one of the best pieces of writing advice I had ever gotten, something along the lines of: &amp;ldquo;No one else is going to be writing with your perspective and your point of view, so no matter what, you are bringing something to the table.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-discoverability&#34;&gt;On Discoverability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people on the HN thread said that Google no longer surfaces older blog content. I anecdotally know this to be not true, because a Google search for the terms &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=killer%20killer&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;killer-killer&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=pasmado&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;pasmado&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; still shows posts from my blog from 2008 on the first page. I suspect this is because my blog has been continuously updated since 2002, hence my posts never fall &amp;ldquo;out of rotation&amp;rdquo;? Is that a thing? Who knows! SEO, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original post was correct however in that it is difficult to find old-school blog content if you are searching specifically for that kind of thing. I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/04/fe45adb8c24e654605b9906dea2df749/&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; that I want some kind of indieweb federated search focused on searching content from &amp;ldquo;indie&amp;rdquo; blogs (for lack of a better term. We need a better term?). Maybe someday I&amp;rsquo;d write down how I imagine that would work. And implement it maybe? IDK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, there are still a lot of blogs around, if you know where to look. One of my favorite avenues is Kicks Condors&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kickscondor.com/hrefhunt/&#34;&gt;monthly HrefHunt updates&lt;/a&gt;. And I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before, but whenever anyone posts anything remotely nostalgic about old-school blogging on Hacker News, the comments are always full of links to blogs. There&amp;rsquo;s specialized subreddits like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/SpartanWeb/&#34;&gt;r/SpartanWeb&lt;/a&gt; (not many users!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run a blog, you can help by having a page where you list other blogs you like! Some kind of roll call, but for blogs. Like&amp;hellip; a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/blogroll/&#34;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt;? And if they make a post you like, share it on your blog, and maybe on other social media channels too! Us indie and old-school bloggers need to have each other backs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;more-to-come&#34;&gt;More To Come&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am 99.9999% sure this is not the last time I&amp;rsquo;m going to blog about blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;My Stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/covid19-05-17/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s quarantine notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work&lt;/strong&gt;: A bit of Laravel work, and a bit of server management and deployment. Nothing too ridiculous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching&lt;/strong&gt;: Haven&amp;rsquo;t watched much this week. There was the really great &lt;strong&gt;Justice League Dark: Apokolips War&lt;/strong&gt; which came out last week. Apparently it&amp;rsquo;s the last one for the DC AMU, or this particular timeline at least.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz&lt;/strong&gt;: We are now up to 3 locally produced online quiz nights per week, which seems like a lot because we only used to attend 2-3 live events per month. I managed to tie for first place in the Geekfight one this week, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t win either of the other two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I played a lot of Divinity Original Sin 2 this week, probably much more than a healthy amount. Really started to get into it, but I think I&amp;rsquo;m not even halfway into the game?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday group also played some Scythe from the Asmodee bundle. It&amp;rsquo;s a challenging worker placement-like boardgame with some combat, but the UI for the PC version is pretty terrible. I did not win during our first session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech&lt;/strong&gt;: Got tired of my terrible audio jack which has been emitting static to my speakers and earphones. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t clean it, instead I went ahead and ordered some fancy HyperX gaming headphones from Lazada, which has already started selling nonessentials again. Might take a couple of weeks to get here though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Site Updates&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this site used to have a live backup available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.github.io/&#34;&gt;roytang.github.io&lt;/a&gt;, but starting this week the builds have been failing. I assume it&amp;rsquo;s because my repository has gotten too large. Most of it is images and videos. I may need to consider an alternative approach where only the text stuff is in the repos, to keep the repo size down, otherwise we are really gonna have scaling issues down the road. Need to think about this for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent Links of Interest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I always like it when a &lt;a href=&#34;http://tttthis.com/blog/if-i-could-bring-one-thing-back-to-the-internet-it-would-be-blogs&#34;&gt;post about blogs&lt;/a&gt; makes it to the front page of Hacker News. It means the &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23205588&#34;&gt;ensuing discussion&lt;/a&gt; has a lot of people talking about why blogs aren&amp;rsquo;t actually dead and many sharing their own blogs which I get to take a look at. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll write a post detailing how I think about this particular post. If I feel like it. After reading through all the blogs from these links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://macwright.org/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html&#34;&gt;This post by Tom MacWright&lt;/a&gt; encapsulates much of how I feel by the modern push toward React and other frameworks in web development. Old-school web dev forever!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/09/the-real-lord-of-the-flies-what-happened-when-six-boys-were-shipwrecked-for-15-months&#34;&gt;Fascinating story&lt;/a&gt; about a real-life Lord of the Flies situation that turned about much better than the very pessimistic book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it for this week!&lt;/p&gt;

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/nobody-knows-for-sure-whats-going-to-happen/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I mean, that&amp;rsquo;s true in general of course. But it certainly seems much more true in these &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/covid19/&#34;&gt;pandemic times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before all of this &lt;em&gt;waves hands arounds frantically&lt;/em&gt;, people had a general sense of routine and predictability about their daily lives. It varied person by person of course, but many people had regular things like a steady job that kept them occupied for most of the week, a school where their kids could go off to most days, maybe a favorite bar or restaurant they visit every week or so, church on Sundays, friends you saw every other weekend or so, malls or stores they would pass by regularly, and so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I had a generally looser schedule than most, I was still often able to plot out my coming days with relative accuracy. Oh, I have a client meeting on this day. Then the next day I have to run these errands. Then meeting up with friends (maybe for a quiz night) the evening after. On the weekend a visit with my brothers and the nieces. That kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I would have had some fairly safe medium-term predictions too. If you had asked me at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/01/new-years-checklist/&#34;&gt;start of the year&lt;/a&gt;, I would have thought I&amp;rsquo;d have seen the Black Widow movies by now, played Final Fantasy VII Remake, and got together with the family in April to celebrate birthdays. But none of those came to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, that kind of reasonable prediction seems like a distant memory. Weeks come and go and all the days seem to blend in together, each one indistinguishable from the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about writing something about what to expect down the road, or the &amp;ldquo;new normal&amp;rdquo; or what not, but (a) so many people (many of whom I&amp;rsquo;m sure are better qualified) are already writing things like that; and (b) I think a lot of it is largely pointless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have all these models and graphs and projections coming out, with varying degrees of reliability. They tell us things like, there will be M cases and N deaths by so-and-so date unless we do this or that. Each model is slightly different, depending on many factors like the country being studied or the data being analyzed and such. And maybe they&amp;rsquo;re right. Surely at least some of them are, right? But all of these are, to make a software development analogy, estimates. Some are certainly more accurate than others - it falls to our individual discernment whether we choose to believe experts and scientists or populist politicians or whatever - but in the end, all of them are still just estimates. Trend-spotting based on data that is probably largely incomplete (certainly so in the case of my own country). And just like estimates, there&amp;rsquo;s no way to know for certain which will turn out to be correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of all the models and trends and predictions, the future remains incredibly hazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many cases will we end up with? How many deaths? All as of yet unknown, but almost certainly far too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will we have a vaccine this year? Next year? In 2022? No one knows for sure. There are many vaccines and treatments in development, but we won&amp;rsquo;t know for a while which ones will turn out effective, if any. There may never be a permanent vaccine, the same way we don&amp;rsquo;t have one for the common cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will there be a second wave? Seems likely. Will it be under control? Who knows. Even countries we previously thought to be doing well are in danger of a possible resurgence, so what then? How much more countries like us that have done far worse in controlling the spread?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will the ECQ in Metro Manila be lifted after the 15th? Nobody knows, even up to now, a mere 5 days before the deadline. And if it is lifted, what happens then? There are people counting down to the ECQ lifting as if it would be &amp;ldquo;back to normal&amp;rdquo;, I can&amp;rsquo;t say it will be, but it almost certainly shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be. Maybe there will be an explosion of people, tired of being cooped up in their houses, and a corresponding explosion of cases, and we are forced to go back to a stricter lockdown. That&amp;rsquo;s my guess, but again, nothing is certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When will people be able to go back to work? When will your favorite restaurant be open again? When will you get to meet up with friends again? When can I travel to other countries again? All of these, nobody knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joke with my parents and brothers that the next time we&amp;rsquo;ll be seeing each other in person again would probably be in August during my birthday month, but something that far off might not come to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And people are talking about what the &amp;ldquo;new normal&amp;rdquo; is going to be like. That we might have to live with social distancing precautions in the medium-to-long term moving forward. We may be looking at months or maybe even years of social distancing measures. Or cycles of lockdown and loosening, until there is a widespread vaccine, or maybe forever? All distinct possibilities, but again, there&amp;rsquo;s no certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are people that say humanity is going to learn our lesson from this crisis and realize that so many things we previously accepted in our daily life are BS that we can do without. Short list: overpopulation, inequality, low pay for essential workers, work commutes, dress codes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies will see that work from home is effective, so it will be more common moving forward! The anecdotal reports of companies implementing draconian surveillance schemes to monitor their remote workers makes me doubt that one actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t buy that this crisis will change society for the better (though I am more than willing to be surprised). Many humans are too set in their ways and can&amp;rsquo;t even be bothered to endure minor inconveniences like wearing a mask to costco or whatever. And there are many who can&amp;rsquo;t wait to be right back there sucking at the fresh teat of capitalism, instead of maybe looking for alternatives that promote and protect the commons instead of exploiting the vulnerable. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong - there are many positive and hopeful stories coming out of this pandemic, of people helping other people get by - that heighten my faith in humanity. My faith in humanity&amp;rsquo;s leadership and elite, however, is probably at an all-time low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the models and projections and predictions for the new normal, these things are useful at the policymaking levels. But for those of us just living our every day lives, it is difficult to look so far ahead. Right now, we are roiling about in a sea of uncertainty, unsure of what the future brings. All we can worry about will be what the next day looks like. Maybe the best we can do right now is just to take it one step at a time, and hope that we are making the right decisions to build towards a new normal that will actually be better than the last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post turned out more ranty than I thought it would be.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;My Stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early this morning I took a walk outside for the first time since the lockdown started. Previously I had only gone out for groceries and meds. Only for less than 30 mins, and only in our subdivision, walking up and down the street. It&amp;rsquo;s good to be walking again, although this short and limited route is quite boring and full of neighbor&amp;rsquo;s dogs barking at me, so I&amp;rsquo;m not too fond of it, but it&amp;rsquo;s better to get the habit started again since I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling the fatness piling on due to the quarantine and the lack of exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work&lt;/strong&gt;: A few consultation meetings here and there, but starting next week I may need to do some actual coding work for other people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching&lt;/strong&gt;: Watched a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/lists/2020/movies/&#34;&gt;few movies this week&lt;/a&gt;, The Siege (caught it on TV during my lunch break), Skull Island (because Brie Larson), Ready Player One (it&amp;rsquo;s Cyclops!), and also watched Ang Huling El Bimbo the Musical (Not really a movie, but ok). I also ended up watching the 2 episodes of the Battlestar Galactica miniseries; apparently I had not watched this before watching the 2004 series. I also watched the hilarious Middleditch and Schwartz improv comedy specials on Netflix, fun times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;: Played a bunch of Divinity Original Sin 2 this week, though I guess I&amp;rsquo;m still not that far along in the story? I also purchased the Humble Asmodee bundle, for more boardgames-converted-to-PC-games that my weekend playgroup can do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Site Updates&lt;/strong&gt;: Been putting up some content elsewhere on this site. You can find it easily if you look around, but nothing to announce publicly yet. Need to think about how to present properly, good permalinks, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent Links of Interest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of starting a separate regular type of post where I just post links to things I found on the internet. Kind of like the links page, except with more commentary? I know people like &lt;a href=&#34;https://pluralistic.net/&#34;&gt;Doctorow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kottke.org/&#34;&gt;Kottke&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://waxy.org/&#34;&gt;Waxy&lt;/a&gt; have been doing this kind of thing for a while, thinking of something along the same lines I guess? Something I can maybe turn into some kind of newsletter later on? We&amp;rsquo;ll see if it pans out. For now, let&amp;rsquo;s keep it in the weeknotes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somewhat related to the first bullet: Great post from &lt;a href=&#34;https://secondbreakfast.co&#34;&gt;secondbreakfast.co&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;https://secondbreakfast.co/its-too-late-to-collect-sand&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s too late to collect sand&lt;/a&gt;. Basically saying if there&amp;rsquo;s something you regret not being able to start earlier on, it would be a trap to think that you can&amp;rsquo;t just start it today. I say somewhat related to the first bullet because as I was reviewing some older blog entries during the past few weeks I was wondering if I could have made it as a &amp;ldquo;successful blogger&amp;rdquo; like the people mentioned above if I had only been more consistent with my content. Such regrets are ridiculous, as the post implies, because I could always just ramp up my linkblogging now if I wanted. Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;ve also scanned a few of the other posts on secondbreakfast.co, and many of them are fairly good reads, so this one might end up being added to the regular follows and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/blogroll/&#34;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AirBNB is laying off one-fourth of its staff and refocusing its priorities. This is not exactly unexpected given the current situation and the bleak outlook for the travel industry in the near term, but what I found exceptional was &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.airbnb.com/a-message-from-co-founder-and-ceo-brian-chesky/&#34;&gt;CEO Brian Chesky&amp;rsquo;s message to their employees&lt;/a&gt;. Announcing layoffs is obviously a feel-bad, but this note was handled extremely well, walking through the rationales and the painful decision and giving their staff clear expectations on what will happen moving forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One tech company that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been treating their employees too well however, has been Amazon. Last week, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/04/29/Leaving-Amazon&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; from Amazon VP, Senior Engineer, and XML spec-writer Tim Bray made the rounds as he publicly declared he was resigning from his position (costing him around a million dollars) because of how the company has fired whistleblowers who were complaining about Covid-19 safety concerns at their warehouses. Good for Bray, and boo for Amazon. One may also find the links he posted in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/05/06/Answers&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Responses&amp;rdquo; post&lt;/a&gt; of interest as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/magazine/closing-prune-restaurant-covid.html&#34;&gt;Great article in the NY times&lt;/a&gt; (Annoying paywall warning!) about what it&amp;rsquo;s like owning and having to shutdown a restaurant in these times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/&#34;&gt;68 bits of unsolicited advise&lt;/a&gt; from Kevin Kelly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying Tom Scott&amp;rsquo;s Youtube channel recently (unsurprisingly, he&amp;rsquo;s a very popular Youtuber). I recently found out his background is actually in linguistics! Anyway, here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4bmZ1gRqCc&#34;&gt;a video from him about confusing differences in numbers across languages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Singapore, they have &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/8/21251788/spot-boston-dynamics-robot-singapore-park-social-distancing&#34;&gt;a robot dog making sure people are social distancing in public&lt;/a&gt;. This is why &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/no-black-mirror-episodes-creator-162238548.html&#34;&gt;the creator of Black Mirror isn&amp;rsquo;t even bothering right now&lt;/a&gt;, reality is just too much already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping we have a good week incoming, despite the current situation!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Last week, Wizards announced that they were &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wizards.com/Magic/PlaneswalkerPoints/36918016&#34;&gt;sunsetting DCI numbers and Planeswalker Points&lt;/a&gt;, this felt like an appropriate time to do a retrospective on my 25 years playing Magic the Gathering. Strap yourselves in, this is going to be a long one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-early-years&#34;&gt;The Early Years&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started playing MTG in my fourth year of high school, so that&amp;rsquo;s around sometime 1994-1995. The most recent expansion releases at that time were The Dark and Fallen Empires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blame for this lifelong hobby/obsession lies solely at the feet of the older brother of one of my HS batchmates, who introduced me and a few friends to the game. (Said older brother would later go on to become one of the first few MTG Philippines national champions). Back then each of us only had a few cards and supply was tight. I remember there was only one nearby store in SM North that sold booster packs, and they only had a few come in every other week or so. The earliest card I remember opening from a booster pack was a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=446206&#34;&gt;Juggernaut&lt;/a&gt; from Revised. (I remember being amazed because it can&amp;rsquo;t be blocked by walls!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our early decks in those times were super crude, with vanilla creatures all over. &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=189903&#34;&gt;Craw Wurm&lt;/a&gt; was a big deal! We called decks that opened with turn one Forest into &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=201404&#34;&gt;Scryb Sprites&lt;/a&gt; as &amp;ldquo;fast decks!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We carried on playing the game into our college days of course. We hung out with a group of other Magic players and played a lot of random decks. Most of it was casual in-between classes games, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I missed at least one exam because I was too busy playing Magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this time, we also started joining some tournaments, most of them held at a restaurant along Katipunan called &amp;ldquo;Chinoys&amp;rdquo;. These tournaments don&amp;rsquo;t appear in my DCI history, so either they weren&amp;rsquo;t official DCI tournaments or I have some other DCI number floating around in the ether with history I&amp;rsquo;ll never be able to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember running a red green deck with &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383122&#34;&gt;Taigas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=442130&#34;&gt;Lightning Bolts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413679&#34;&gt;Kird Apes&lt;/a&gt; and such. I also had the classic &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=438723&#34;&gt;Channel&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=438694&#34;&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; combo in the deck, with cards like &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=184678&#34;&gt;Tinder Wall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383038&#34;&gt;Orcish Lumberjack&lt;/a&gt; for the random off chance of a turn 2 or 3 kill. (I couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382866&#34;&gt;Black Lotus&lt;/a&gt; for the turn 1 kill!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a time before internet usage was widespread, so netdecks weren&amp;rsquo;t really a big thing yet. So there was a huge variation in the decks we&amp;rsquo;d face in these tournaments and casually elsewhere. Some of the decks I remember playing against during this era:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a blue red deck that killed me during a tournament with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=438631&#34;&gt;Mana Drain&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=106636&#34;&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there was this guy who always went to tournaments with a Goblin deck, using cards like &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=159759&#34;&gt;Goblins of the Flarg&lt;/a&gt; combined with &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=442110&#34;&gt;Ball Lightnings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=201272&#34;&gt;Blood Lust&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=438485&#34;&gt;Goblin Grenades&lt;/a&gt; for quick wins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I remember playing a discard deck with &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=190566&#34;&gt;Hypnotic Spectres&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413634&#34;&gt;Hymn to Tourach&lt;/a&gt; at a smaller tournament (not at Chinoy&amp;rsquo;s) somewhere where the opponent was using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=83058&#34;&gt;Disrupting Sceptre&lt;/a&gt; on my draw step even though I later realized that ability can only be played during his turn. At that same tournament, some guy also used &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=201122&#34;&gt;Boomerang&lt;/a&gt; to pull his spell back off the stack into his hand for some reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I remember a white deck that used small creatures like &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=394374&#34;&gt;Icatian Javilineer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2011&#34;&gt;sac lands&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413544&#34;&gt;Balance&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=441994&#34;&gt;Armageddon&lt;/a&gt; to seal the deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this time, one of the main sources of MTG info was &lt;em&gt;Inquest&lt;/em&gt; magazine. It included things like card lists, rumors and info on upcoming sets, MTG puzzles, trivia, interviews and other such fun stuff. I think I might even have a few copies lying around the house somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-competitive-years&#34;&gt;The Competitive Years&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My earliest competitive tournament records under my DCI number were in 2001. One of them was this standard tournament held at the UP College of Science, I ran 5-3 and finished 7th place. I remember running a RGBw Invasion-era deck with &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209155&#34;&gt;battlemages&lt;/a&gt; (because I loved the card advantage) and even had a mascot &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=469888&#34;&gt;Shivan Dragon&lt;/a&gt; in the deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite Limited tournaments was also in 2001, it was an Invasion block team limited trios tournament held in Makati. Our team finished the swiss in the top two teams, so we got to play Rochester draft in the finals. I believe this was the only time I ever played Rochester draft. We ended up finishing second and going home with a box of Apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My competitive play stepped up when I started working in Ortigas in 2003. In the upcoming years, many major tournaments would be held at the Robinson&amp;rsquo;s Galleria mall, only a 15 minute walk away from our office. A bunch of other office mates got into the hobby as well, which was really helpful for the purpose of playing competitively - we could borrow/trade cards easily and it also meant we had a pool of regularly accessible playtest partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My peak competitive years were during 2006-2009, where I played 575 tournament matches over those four years. It&amp;rsquo;s not a lot compared to some of the more hardcore members of the local community, as I mostly didn&amp;rsquo;t play smaller tournaments like FNMs. I usually played larger events like regionals, nationals qualifiers, grand prix trials, and pro tour qualifiers. At that time there were enough that I could usually play a larger event weekly or every other week. I had a few top 8 finishes in regionals, ptqs and gpts, but never managed any big finishes or things like qualifying for nationals or worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest tournaments I was able to play in during these years were Grand Prix Manila in 2006 and 2008. I enjoyed playing Grand Prixs so much I decided to play my first foreign tournament in Grand Prix Bangkok in 2009. I really enjoy Grand Prixs, they&amp;rsquo;re the highest-level events I&amp;rsquo;m able to play (since they&amp;rsquo;re open), so they&amp;rsquo;re super competitive, and it&amp;rsquo;s like an entire weekend devoted to Magic. Oh, and the venues are usually much better (more spacious, more food available, etc) than our usual weekend tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-and-off-again&#34;&gt;On and Off Again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2010 to the present, my MTG activity started to taper off. Both of my play groups kind of fell apart - my HS magic group had mostly moved overseas and many of the ones in my work group had lost interest. I was still playing regularly, but at a much lower frequency. I tried not to miss new set prereleases, those are always chill and fun and easy. I also still played in GPTs and PTQs and larger events like that, whenever the opportunity arose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also took the opportunity to keep playing Grand Prixs. I took the opportunity to travel whenever there was a Grand Prix in Singapore, since some of my HS magic group live there now and it was always an opportunity to play with them. So far I&amp;rsquo;ve ended up playing 12 Grand Prixs lifetime, 5 in Manila, 4 in Singapore, and 1 each in Bangkok, London and Seattle. You can see my Grand Prix tournament reports &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/grand-prix/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve not had particularly awesome results for my GP runs either. Of 12 GPs, I&amp;rsquo;ve qualified for day 2 twice, both times finishing in the top 30-40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the Grand Prixs, I&amp;rsquo;ve also managed to play overseas for a few other opportunities. I&amp;rsquo;ve done a prerelease at Hareruya in Tokyo, one in Barcelona, and a couple of years ago I got to do an RPTQ in Kuala Lumpur. Playing overseas and with players of different cultures is always a great change of pace and a good experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with playing so sporadically of course was that it was difficult to get a good grip on the Standard format. From 2014 forward, I started preferring the Modern format for constructed, since it&amp;rsquo;s an eternal format and in theory decks last much longer and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to spend much time/resources keeping up. (Tell that to my banned Splinter Twin deck!) In 2019 some friends also started to get me into Pauper, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how much I like it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-online-era&#34;&gt;The Online Era&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was for paper Magic. In 2009, I started playing Magic Online. By all accounts, Magic Online is a terrible platform and piece of software, but it was better than nothing! MTGO meant I could play Magic anytime at my convenience (subject to the whims of my internet connection). I ended up playing mostly limited of limited on MTGO, I think I only played constructed for one season with a cheap monored deck. The downside of course, was that MTGO was only slightly less expensive than paper Magic. Maybe someday I&amp;rsquo;ll gather stats on how much I spent on MTGO, but I suspect I won&amp;rsquo;t be too happy with the totals lol. My playing MTGO has been on and off though, similar to my paper magic run during the past decade or so. Typically I&amp;rsquo;ll favor one or the other during a particular season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people will say they prefer playing in paper Magic over online, but I&amp;rsquo;m not one of those people. Paper has several distinct disadvantages for me over online:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having to go places to play, especially annoying given the poor traffic situation in Metro Manila. Most venues are also poorly ventilated and you spend a lot of time in uncomfortable chairs and unable to get food between rounds. Compare that to being able to play in the comforts of home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having to shuffle. For longer tournaments, my being &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2008/04/pasmado/&#34;&gt;pasmado&lt;/a&gt; has always been problematic. In the later rounds, my hands to get very sweaty and thus my sleeves start to clump together, and also shuffling starts to become a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;much more difficult to acquire cards. Especially here in the PH where ordering singles online isn&amp;rsquo;t always viable or economically feasible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having to watch out for cheating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having to talk to people. I&amp;rsquo;m not as social as other players lol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more robust and interesting online platform was the introduction of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/12/mtg-arena/&#34;&gt;Magic Arena&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing it since the closed beta and I much prefer playing on Arena than on MTGO, mainly because on Arena I can get by with being completely free to play, and still be able to play top-tier constructed decks (and occasionally some limited runs as well). Arena still has a lot of limitations - it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have my favorite format Modern for one thing, and it will be a while before older card sets are available there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;stats-and-competitiveness&#34;&gt;Stats and Competitiveness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;ve played a lot of Magic through the years (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/04/1254830015717404674/&#34;&gt;230th overall&lt;/a&gt; in lifetime PWPs in the country), I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself a particularly &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; player. Maybe slightly above average at best. My &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/stats/mtg/&#34;&gt;paper MTG stats&lt;/a&gt; bear that out, with my overall win rate only being slightly higher than 50%. I wish I could get my stats for MTGO and Arena as well though - maybe that would improve things a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the old timey players in the local community do know me though, due to playing a lot in the 2000s and being around for so long. On occassion, some people may have also referred to me as a &amp;ldquo;limited specialist&amp;rdquo; for some reason. My draft and sealed win rates are slightly better than my constructed win rates, but not by much. I do enjoy limited a lot, and a an important reason for that is that I don&amp;rsquo;t much like the &amp;ldquo;collectible&amp;rdquo; part of Magic. My favorite part of limited events is that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about finding singles and putting together a deck beforehand, I just get to show, build a deck, and play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite not considering myself a particularly good player, I still do identify as a competitive &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Spike&#34;&gt;spike&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. I attribute my poor win rate and lack of competitive success largely to being lazy. I don&amp;rsquo;t like to grind too much and I don&amp;rsquo;t like to spend too much time play testing, both of which are important factors in getting top tier results competitively. I can play reasonably well, but lack of consistent practice means my execution can be off, or I might miss more complex lines of play, but to get the best results you basically need to be playing perfectly almost all of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;favorite-decks&#34;&gt;Favorite Decks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;m reminiscing, I want to remember some favorite constructed decks I&amp;rsquo;ve playted through the years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for casual play, there was this fun deck I used to play back during the college days where I basically put together a bunch of fun cards into a mostly singleton deck featuring &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=27634&#34;&gt;Questing Phelddagrif&lt;/a&gt;. This was before Commander was ever a thing!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prior to 2008, I was mostly a rogue deckbuilder, coming up with my own brews to bring to tournaments. One of my favorite rogue brews was this monoblack &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=136208&#34;&gt;Korlash Heir to Blackblade&lt;/a&gt; deck I ran &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2007/05/future-sight-inaugural-ng-galleria-26-may-2007/&#34;&gt;before regionals in 2007&lt;/a&gt;. (I ended up netdecking for regionals itself)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there was this fantastic Bant &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=451135&#34;&gt;Finest Hour&lt;/a&gt; list that I played to a top 8 finish in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2009/05/regionals-2009-finest-hour-top-8/&#34;&gt;2009 regionals&lt;/a&gt;. It was a fun aggro-control deck that also had a lot of challenging technical lines of play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in 2015, I day 2&amp;rsquo;ed Grand Prix Manila with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/02/grand-prix-manila-2015/&#34;&gt;this great Jeskai Ascendancy standard deck&lt;/a&gt; that I had a blast playing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for Modern, my current deck of choice is Grixis &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=425889&#34;&gt;Death Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, which I last played in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/08/mcq-richmond-modern-with-grixis-death-shadow/&#34;&gt;an MCQ in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. I love these interactive and grindy midrange decks where you try to gain incremental advantage every turn, very skill-testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;moving-forward&#34;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to expect for me personally in terms of MTG moving forward. The main consideration is financial: since I&amp;rsquo;m not working full-time anymore, I can&amp;rsquo;t really be spending so much money on Magic as a hobby, especially for travelling. I&amp;rsquo;d probably still enjoy playing in a Grand Prix if there&amp;rsquo;s a local one, not sure if foreign GPs would still be worth it. And while paper tourneys are really the only way for me to enjoy Modern (when Modern is good), I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;m cut out for travelling through Metro Manila traffic to spend my entire day in a hot crowded tournament venue anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even given all of that, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to say I&amp;rsquo;m quitting paper Magic. I&amp;rsquo;ve already said that too many times in the past. And I&amp;rsquo;m still sitting on a sizeable pool of cards (shared with some friends), so before I quit, I&amp;rsquo;d have to consider some kind of exit strategy for that (and probably my MTGO collection too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what is going to happen to competitive paper Magic moving forward. As I recall, there weren&amp;rsquo;t any APAC GPs scheduled this year, whereas before we always had at least two per year. If there&amp;rsquo;s a new GP Manila, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably want to play that, but who knows when that will be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still love playing the game itself. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried various other CCGs over the years, both offline and online, and really nothing compares to Magic still. It is the king of CCGs in terms of being enjoyable and in terms of presenting fun and complex and interesting lines of play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the likelihood is that Magic Arena may very well be my preferred platform for playing Magic moving forwards (assuming Wizards doesn&amp;rsquo;t screw it up because of tightening up the generosity for F2Pers like myself), with the occasional foray into paper tournaments as needed. Realistically, I may still be playing Magic another 25 years down the line!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;First week of May. At least two more weeks of quarantine remain. &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/covid19/&#34;&gt;COVID19 Diary&lt;/a&gt; still exists, only updated every so often. I stayed in the entire week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week was slightly more productive than the last one, at least in terms of personal projects. I moved a couple of them forward. And also spent a bunch of time spring cleaning and moving stuff around here on the site. Details to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quizzes: I watched the Geekfight, but I could only personally answer like 4 questions maybe. My teammate who was an official player did much better. We joined the PopQuiz one, but got a cursed ace and finished low. Looking forward to next week&amp;rsquo;s quizzes, and there may even be a new organizer setting up an online quiz!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;watching-lately&#34;&gt;Watching lately&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I burned through the remaining 5 seasons of Psych and the 2017 Psych movie as well. Overall it&amp;rsquo;s a really fun series, despite usually sticking to a formula. Chock-full of pop culture references and shout-outs and in-jokes and such, just the kind of thing I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other thing I&amp;rsquo;ve watched this week was the Parks and Recreation reunion special (quarantine edition), fun episode and happy to see these guys all together again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least I can watch other things now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kind of want to be filling out a &amp;ldquo;things of interest&amp;rdquo; section in these weeknotes every week, basically collecting interesting things I found on the internet during the week. I do find/read a bunch of interesting things over the week, but the problem is I seldom log them down for future posting. Will need to correct moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gaming&#34;&gt;Gaming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ikoria drafting is done for me, for now at least. You can view all my Ikoria drafts at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgiko&#34;&gt;MTGIKO tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My FF7 Remake Deluxe Edition copy &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/ff7r/&#34;&gt;got delivered last Friday&lt;/a&gt;! I briefly considered asking my brother to drive over and bring my PS4 home, but that isn&amp;rsquo;t really essential travel so I thought better of it. Cloud and company will have to wait. I&amp;rsquo;m not in a hurry, and really, there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of other games to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription/may-2020&#34;&gt;Humble Choice for May&lt;/a&gt; is out, but not too happy with the choices. I already have X-Com II, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even come with the War of the Chosen DLC! Probably passing on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other things: Trivia team set up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCptXvNbp4ETVttb_k-1oOww&#34;&gt;Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;. I suspect the videos will be more gaming-related than trivia-related though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Site updates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cleanups of old content (mostly stuff that got mangled during import from Wordpress or elsewhere)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;together with the pass over the old content, I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting together some &amp;ldquo;media diet&amp;rdquo; pages. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this in a few other blogs, where they track all their media (TV/movies/books) consumption. I&amp;rsquo;m already doing this more often with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/watching-lately&#34;&gt;Watching lately posts&lt;/a&gt; (and in the weeknotes), and my &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/lists/2020/movies&#34;&gt;2020 movies list&lt;/a&gt;, but I wanted it to include other media types too (including games), so I started putting together the lists. For the older years, I have to reconstruct the media list from old blog posts and so on, so they&amp;rsquo;re bound to be incomplete and probably inaccurate, but it is what it is. I started from 2002 and working my way back to the present. It&amp;rsquo;s still WIP, but the list should be &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/media/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adding some other new stuff/sections, but nothing linked publicly yet. Need to arrange everything correctly, may take a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
