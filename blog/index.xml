            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve not read any Agatha Chrstie, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d rectify that by getting into the Hercule Poirot series of books. To start off I chose &lt;em&gt;Murder on the Orient Express&lt;/em&gt; because &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/07/watching-lately-jun-jul-2019/&#34;&gt;I watched the 2017 movie a couple of years ago&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Death on the Nile&lt;/em&gt; because it has a movie coming out next year. I figure it would be a good contrast of movie-first vs book first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took me a bit under a week of leisurely reading to finish &lt;em&gt;Murder on the Orient Express&lt;/em&gt;. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t in a rush since I already knew how the mystery turns out. The book wasn&amp;rsquo;t very long, but it was very well structured. A couple of chapters of setup before the crime itself happened, then a chapter each for Poirot to interrogate each of the suspects and then a few more chapters to piece everything together. The book pretty much followed the movie closely, though I think they changed some of the character details for the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death on the Nile&lt;/em&gt; had a much different pace, although it&amp;rsquo;s about as short as the first one. It feels like the author spent longer on setup, introducing the different characters even before they met Poirot on the trip to the titular Nile. (As opposed to &lt;em&gt;Orient Express&lt;/em&gt; where the entire book narrated only scenes where Poirot was present.) I finished the book in three days; the last day I binged through the last 2/3 of the book once the crime finally happened. It helped that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the eventual solution (though I had a hunch on who the culprit(s) might be, and the hunch eventually turned out correct), so I was eager to get to the end. I feel like this book gave a better preview of Poriot&amp;rsquo;s investigative abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find myself enjoying the author&amp;rsquo;s writing; the books aren&amp;rsquo;t overly long, and each chapter is usually straightforward, with scenes depicting things that are either red herrings or eventually leading up to the final mystery solution. The books seem like light, leisurely reading, unlike the sci-fi / fantasy epics I&amp;rsquo;m used to. The best comparison I have is to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/01/hardy-boys/&#34;&gt;the Hardy Boys series&lt;/a&gt; although this series is of course way less juvenile. I can easily send myself reading through a few more of these Poirot books throughout the year. (I didn&amp;rsquo;t follow any recommended reading order, but the books are largely self-contained anyway&amp;hellip; though I know &lt;em&gt;Nile&lt;/em&gt; happens after &lt;em&gt;Orient Express&lt;/em&gt; because Poirot references the prior case.) I should also probably try out some of the author&amp;rsquo;s non-Poirot books as well.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Peter Rukavina &lt;a href=&#34;https://ruk.ca/content/anticipation-truth-real-thief-joy&#34;&gt;quotes the &lt;em&gt;New York Tribune&lt;/em&gt; about how Anticipation is the real thief of joy&lt;/a&gt; (as opposed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/11/comparison-is-the-thief-of-joy/&#34;&gt;comparison&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anticipation is, in truth, the real thief of joy. The best times are always the unexpected ones. It is not the parties that you plan for weeks and look forward to that come off. There must be surprise and novelty and freshness to yield the last word in happiness and thrill. That we had on Thursday afternoon. The real thrill has passed, never to return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the piece is a musing on the pleasures of serendipity and random wandering, I&amp;rsquo;m reminded instead of anticipation&amp;rsquo;s opposite, something I feel often as well: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/10/anxiety/&#34;&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. Whereas anticipation is looking to the future awaiting something you are excited to happen, anxiety is looking to the future awaiting something you dread. And it robs you of joy as well, albeit in a different manner, consuming you with worry. The phrase &amp;ldquo;real thief of joy&amp;rdquo; implies that there can only be one such thief, but truthfully, there can be many, and among them, comparison, anticipation, and anxiety are probably the worst offenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is of course human nature, and often prudent to look to the future, but it is best not to let either anticipation or anxiety overwhelm us. One should always remember to live in the present and not let the future overshadow what we have right in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Thoughts on Vue.js

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not big on modern frontend JavaScript frameworks (mostly because I think web pages should use as little JS as possible), but when I do find the need to use one, my weapon of choice is &lt;a href=&#34;https://vuejs.org/&#34;&gt;Vue.js&lt;/a&gt;. I dislike React, but mostly because (a) my first experience with React was with mobile development using React Native for &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/09/mobile-app-dev/&#34;&gt;mobile app development&lt;/a&gt;, which I generally don&amp;rsquo;t like; and (b) I don&amp;rsquo;t like Facebook, which backs React. I have no opinion on Angular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being my frontend framework of choice, I don&amp;rsquo;t actually have that much experience with Vue beyond a few small projects each with a minimal number of screens / pages. That being said, I do have some thoughts, coming mostly from the POV of a developer &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/02/old-web/&#34;&gt;more used to the old-school ways of Javascript and web development in general&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entry point of course, is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/&#34;&gt;getting started guide on the Vue website itself&lt;/a&gt;, which walks you through most of the framework features. I have no concern about most of these; the features are explained well and I find most of the documentation quite good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My issue is with how the site recommends to beginners to set up their Vue projects: via a script include from a CDN. When I first saw this guide, I assumed this was the standard, recommended way to build a Vue project, so this was how I did it for my first small project, a small demo site I needed to produce in a few days. Due to the short timeframe, I had decided to learn as I go. The component registration section of the guide also gives no guidance or recommendation on how to structure your components or projects, so I ended up with most of the components set up in a single JS file. (Admittedly, as a person with more than a decade of web dev experience, I should have at least split it up into several files, but time was short.) A technical person reviewing the code commented that I had implemented the frontend &amp;ldquo;in a very strange manner&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets worse when you try to install third-party components, which is a big feature of the ecosystem of these frontend frameworks. In my experience, most third-party components will only give instructions for installation via &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; and a JS module system, neither of which are covered nor recommended by the beginner sections of the guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few projects later, and I now know that I vastly prefer developing Vue projects as Node projects built using the scaffolding provided by &lt;a href=&#34;https://cli.vuejs.org/&#34;&gt;Vue CLI&lt;/a&gt;, with the components implemented as standalone &lt;code&gt;.vue&lt;/code&gt; files. The usage of these tools and methods are covered in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html&#34;&gt;Installation section of the guide&lt;/a&gt; (which the &amp;ldquo;Get Started&amp;rdquo; link skips over) and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html&#34;&gt;Single File Components section under the Tooling section&lt;/a&gt; (which seemed like an advanced section a beginner is not likely to get into.) This method also makes installing third-party components much more straightforward. It&amp;rsquo;s not even necessary to cover what tools like Webpack or Babel are doing, since those are largely abstracted away by the scaffolding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically my main complaint is that the guide doesn&amp;rsquo;t do a good job of transitioning from the introducing the beginner to the language specifics to introducing a recommended approach and tools for organizing more intermediate or complex projects. The method of using a script include seems suitable for little more than a single-page todo list webapp. I suppose the perceived shortcoming might be attributed to my background at least partially - I still tend to think like a developer using jQuery, and I don&amp;rsquo;t default to thinking about Node applications when doing webapps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I am overall happy with Vue.js and it&amp;rsquo;s still my choice of frontend framework moving forward (should a frontend framework even be needed!) Although, maybe I should at least consider trying out / evaluating Angular so I can pretend to make a fair comparison?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the last week of May (more or less), and I&amp;rsquo;m mostly looking forward to a new month because I&amp;rsquo;m tired of ridiculous summer heat and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping the sun tones it down a bit in June. The one aircon we have in the house has been busted all summer, so we have been suffering through the heat and surviving mostly through stacking multiple fans and also an excessive number of showers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-quote&#34;&gt;A quote&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We must be willing to let go of the life we planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us.” ― Joseph Campbell &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2014/05/468028741092794373/&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Israel finally &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-ceasefire-palestinians-gaza-survey-destruction/&#34;&gt;agreed to a ceasefire in the Gaza strip&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly afterwards, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ajplus/status/1395716586342948865&#34;&gt;Israeli police stormed the Al-Aqsa mosque&lt;/a&gt;, claiming &amp;ldquo;there were riots&amp;rdquo;.&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://nypost.com/2021/05/21/amid-tentative-ceasefire-hamas-claims-victory-over-israel/&#34;&gt;Hamas claimed victory&lt;/a&gt;. As an example of how the pro-Israeli slant towards these issues is starting to shift, &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.yahoo.com/john-oliver-condemns-israeli-attacks-184359089.html&#34;&gt;John Oliver condemned the Israeli attacks&lt;/a&gt;. All in all, still a very complicated situation; if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in further reading, Andy Baio put together &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/1393630514469244929&#34;&gt;a list of stuff to read on the topic&lt;/a&gt;. One can only hope the ceasefire holds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local pandemic stuff: After people mobbed a vaccination site distributing Pfizer jabs, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1433727/doh-suggests-no-vaccine-brand-announcement-in-jab-site&#34;&gt;DOH declared that LGUs should not announce ahead of time the brand of vaccine to be used at vax sites&lt;/a&gt;, a directive that is problematic at best. Not everyone can get every vaccine, and this seems like it would just waste people&amp;rsquo;s time if they go to a site only to find out what&amp;rsquo;s there won&amp;rsquo;t work for them. I understand trying to reduce vaccine hesitancy, but that can be solved by more transparency and explanations of efficacy and vaccine safety, not less. I did get &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/first-sinovac-dose/&#34;&gt;sinovac myself&lt;/a&gt;, but I do understand the sentiment of prefering the Western brands due to the supposed higher efficacy and effectiveness in preventing transmission. Personally, I just want as many people as possible to get vaccinated, using any brands that are available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vaccination drive (and overall pandemic response) still feels pretty tepid, but at least &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/HerdImmunityPH/status/1395997730556682241&#34;&gt;the vaccination rate is starting to tick up&lt;/a&gt;. Actually hitting the wall of vaccine hesitancy might be a good problem to have soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This weekend was Eurovision, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/05/1129879612534558726/&#34;&gt;something I don&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;get&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, but it got me thinking: why don&amp;rsquo;t we have some kind of Asian equivalent, an &amp;ldquo;Asia-vision&amp;rdquo; if you will. I suspect the authoritarian states won&amp;rsquo;t like it though, as the venue might be used to publicize their nefarious deeds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Making the rounds on Twitter this week: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/angryasianman/status/1395490103913377794/&#34;&gt;The Linda Lindas, a band of young girls, performs &amp;ldquo;Racist, Sexist Boy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; (in a library of some kind). &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3msSlr4PkDE&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the whole set&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was recently reminded of this story from a couple of months back: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dreams_of_sloth/status/1377051721655066629&#34;&gt;A new hire joined a software company, fix a bug that&amp;rsquo;s been bugging him from before the job, then promptly filed his two week&amp;rsquo;s notice&lt;/a&gt;. There is a bit of romantic adventurism here, as I imagine retiring to become a legendary wandering software developer, travelling from company to company, smiting bugs and vanishing just as quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netflix released &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUy0RgeggCQ&#34;&gt;the official trailer for Trese&lt;/a&gt;, an upcmong anime based on a Filipino comic. I&amp;rsquo;m not particularly looking forward to it and I haven&amp;rsquo;t read the source material, but a lot of my friends are hyped about it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My Fitbit strap broke off yesterday morning. I immediately ordered a new one on Lazada before thinking &amp;ldquo;wait, I&amp;rsquo;ve only had this one for around half a year, that seems ridiculous&amp;rdquo;. So I cancelled the order, and instead asked someone to help me &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1396076491021058050/&#34;&gt;apply a DIY fix&lt;/a&gt;. (I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it myself due to poor manual dexterity.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of Fitbit, now that I&amp;rsquo;m fully vaccinated and the NCR case rates are going down again, I&amp;rsquo;ve resumed taking at least some of my walks outside our subdivision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;, once again falling behind on the weekends. Briefly considered just breaking the streak and living with it, but no! The 365 counter is a commitment to doing at least a year of these! As today&amp;rsquo;s sample, here&amp;rsquo;s Batman getting vaccinated:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: This week I watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/ea715fa4d23937c15e47022adf93e192/&#34;&gt;The Spy Who Loved Me (1977)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/09b5a24d69042602b9ac909e277987a6/&#34;&gt;Mortal Kombat (2021)&lt;/a&gt;. My James Bond run is now officially crossing over into the &amp;ldquo;movies released after I born&amp;rdquo; territory. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping I can somehow get through the rest of them before the latest one (No Time To Die) comes out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still playing a bunch of &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4 and &lt;strong&gt;Street Fighter V&lt;/strong&gt; on Steam and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; with the regular Saturday group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still looking for a single-player game to play and stream on twitch when Arena limited is off season, so that I&amp;rsquo;m not only doing Arena streams for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: I finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/c72ceb2e3748ccd8611baab1cbfdfe74/&#34;&gt;What Matters Now, compiled by Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt;, a quick and easy read. After that, I decided to delve into some Agatha Christie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had quiz night last night, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t do particularly well, about the same as the previous week. There is another online quiz night announced and scheduled for next week, by a different group, with topics that we like, but we are hesitant because they have an increased entry fee which is supposed to contribute to a prize pool. Doing online trivia for charity or just for fun has been okay, but I&amp;rsquo;m not really comfortable competing for cash prizes, given that it&amp;rsquo;s all done online and it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to police whether the participants are googling or have a whole army sitting behind them or such. That&amp;rsquo;s also true even if there weren&amp;rsquo;t a prize, but having the prize just gives a lot more incentive for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of trivia for fun, this past week I migrated the &lt;a href=&#34;https://triviastorm.net/&#34;&gt;triviastorm&lt;/a&gt; site back-end code in order to merge it with this site&amp;rsquo;s backend. The motivation for this was to resolve some memory issues on my cheap DigitalOcean droplet; basically running two Django instances meant I was using twice as much memory as necessary. After merging the backends, I replaced the front end of the triviastorm site with a new VueJS-based static site. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write a blog post about VueJS as well, and dipping my toes into it again helped me solidify some thoughts, will probably do sometimes this coming week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern Horizons 2 spoilers (not that I expect to be playing Modern any time soon)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;a-quote&#34;&gt;A quote&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who has never killed an hour? Not casually or without thought, but carefully: a premeditated murder of minutes. The violence comes from a combination of giving up, not caring, and a resignation that getting past it is all you can hope to accomplish. So you kill the hour. You do not work, you do not read, you do not daydream. If you sleep it is not because you need to sleep. And when at last it is over, there is no evidence: no weapon, no blood, and no body. The only clue might be the shadows beneath your eyes or a terribly thin line near the corner of your mouth indicating something has been suffered, that in the privacy of your life you have lost something and the loss is too empty to share.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Mark Z. Danielewski, House of Leaves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Violence escalated in the Israel-occupied Gaza strip over the past week, as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-airstrike-gaza-kills-8-children-u-s-envoy-arrives-n1267490&#34;&gt;IDF bombarded Palestinian-occupied civilian areas and buildings&lt;/a&gt; (including a building housing the Associated Press and al-Jazeera) supposedly in retaliation for missile strikes from Hamas. I won&amp;rsquo;t pretend to be knowledgable in the history and complexities of the Israel-Palestine conflicts. We kind of grew up in a world where the international media narrative has almost always had a pro-Israel slant (especially since the US government tends to support them), so our opinions are often biased in that direction. But this time feels different, this time feels like the state of Israel is losing control of the narrative and more and more people are supporting the Palestinians. I would suggest anyone who has grown up exposed to the pro-Israel narrative to start following some sources espousing the POV from the Palestinian/Arab world. I personally follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tha_rami&#34;&gt;Rami Ismail&lt;/a&gt;, an indie gamedev who happens to be Muslim, his coverage of the current crisis over the past few days has been insightful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, in the US &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ransomware-attack-on-pipeline-propels-gas-to-near-3-a-gallon/&#34;&gt;a gas pipeline fell victim to a ransomware attack&lt;/a&gt;, causing people to worry about a gas shortage and apparently start &lt;a href=&#34;https://god.dailydot.com/americans-freaking-gas-shortage/&#34;&gt;pumping gas into plastic bags&lt;/a&gt;. Eh, what?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US CDC has issued guidance that vaccinated people are no longer required to wear masks indoors, but apparently this relies on some sort of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ryanstruyk/status/1392952564514238467&#34;&gt;honesty system&lt;/a&gt;. Not sure this is going to end well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lockdown restrictions are being lowered in the NCR+ bubble, and the powers-that-be have decided to define an entirely new classification level &amp;ldquo;GCQ with heightened restrictions&amp;rdquo;. Meanwhile, Singapore and Taiwan are increasing their lockdown levels because they got a few dozen cases. The contrast is stark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cory Doctorow writes about &lt;a href=&#34;https://doctorow.medium.com/the-memex-method-238c71f2fb46&#34;&gt;The Memex Method&lt;/a&gt; (warning: Medium), basically reflections on 20+ years of blogging and how it has affected his thinking and note taking and such.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big of Doctorow as a blogger and have been basically following him since his days at &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/blogs-of-yesteryear/&#34;&gt;Boing-Boing&lt;/a&gt;. It feels like we&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging for around the same time, but he&amp;rsquo;s gone a lot further with the practice. I wish I had the energy and capacity he has for the regular, daily blogging and linksharing that he does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of Doctorow, I like &lt;a href=&#34;https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/08/copyfraud/#beethoven-just-wrote-music&#34;&gt;his recent discussion of how copyright filters lead to wage theft&lt;/a&gt;. Excerpt:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impossibility of automating copyright judgments didn&amp;rsquo;t stop Google from trying to perfect its filter, adding layers of complexity until Content ID&amp;rsquo;s appeal process turned into a cod-legal system whose flowchart looks like a bowl of spaghetti. &amp;hellip; The resulting mess firmly favors attackers (wage stealers, fraudsters, censors, bullies) over defenders (creators, critics). Attackers don&amp;rsquo;t need to waste their time making art, which leaves them with the surplus capacity to master the counterintuitive &amp;ldquo;legal&amp;rdquo; framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris McCormick writes about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mccormick.cx/news/entries/one-million-people-saw-my-dumbest-tweet&#34;&gt;how a million people saw his dumbest tweet&lt;/a&gt;, yet another reflection on withdrawing from social media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scott Berkun writes about how &lt;a href=&#34;https://scottberkun.com/2021/why-bad-ceos-fear-remote-work/&#34;&gt;Bad CEOs Fear Remote Work&lt;/a&gt;, a mindset that will hopefully become rarer as we move towards the pandemic-ushered future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StumbledUpon used to be a thing, and there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://stumbled.cc/stumble&#34;&gt;a new site&lt;/a&gt; that kind of aims to be a spiritual successor I guess? I haven&amp;rsquo;t found anything interesting yet in my few rolls though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pottery barn is selling &lt;em&gt;bilao&lt;/em&gt;s as &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/zourrymilf/status/1392423650767171587&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;round wall art&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2018: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/05/google-duplex-and-conversation-ais/&#34;&gt;Google demoed their new AI assistant Duplex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2017: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2017/05/863438304150134784/&#34;&gt;Neil Gaiman on impostor syndrome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2014: My longtime friend David Ramirez &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2014/05/10152950238278912-0/&#34;&gt;published his first sci-fi novel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent most of my afternoon yesterday &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/going-merry-kit/&#34;&gt;putting together this One Piece ship model kit I got in Japan back in 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;, although I am once again behind by a day or so, something that seems to typically happen on the weekend. My favorite sketch this past week may have been this one I did of ramen noodles:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: This week I watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/ba2999c2cc9d8803ad982d24e52035e6/&#34;&gt;The Man With The Golden Gun (1974)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1392042759863689217/&#34;&gt;The Mitchells vs The Machines (2021)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still playing a bunch of &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4 and &lt;strong&gt;Street Fighter V&lt;/strong&gt; on Steam. Kind of stuck in a rut with Balrog (Boxer), need to leve up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currently looking for a single-player game to play and stream on twitch when Arena limited is off season, so that I&amp;rsquo;m not only doing Arena streams for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had quiz night last night, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t do particularly well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did some more work on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://triviastorm.net/&#34;&gt;triviastorm&lt;/a&gt; back-end code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh, nothing in particular I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to this week. Anything I missed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most challenging part for me and my shaky fingers are the tiny tiny stickers. I apologize in advance to anyone offended by my poor sticker application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did poorly applying the jolly roger sticker to the sail, and the rear deck is a bit loose, but I guess I can live with those. Low standards!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized I didnt have a place to display it, so I had to clear out a hole. Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s done!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was Going Merry from the One Piece Grand Ship collection. I actually got this kit waaay back in 2017 from the now-defunct One Piece exhibit at the Tokyo Tower in Japan, took me forever to decide to put it together (because I knew I would be terrible at it lol)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will admit the actual ship turned out a bit smaller than I thought it would be. And a number of the parts are a bit loose and don&amp;rsquo;t snap on super tightly, so the final figure can be a bit fragile (one of Merry&amp;rsquo;s horns fell off while I was positioning it on the shelf!) Might eventually decide to glue some of the pieces in.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This post is being published a day late. Things happen okay? Sometimes you get busy and things need to be pushed back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;like the thug that he is, our dear president &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1390134185222832132/&#34;&gt;claimed that the arbitral award ruling in the PH&amp;rsquo;s favor was nothing more than a sheet of paper he could easily discard&lt;/a&gt;. He also challenged former justice Antonio Carpio to a debate over the West Philippine Sea issue, a challenge the latter quickly accepted. As basically everyone expected, Duterte later chickened out, and offered his spokesman Roque as a distraction, er, proxy for the debate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debris from a Chinese rocket was expected to crash back into Earth sometime this weekend, but no one could predict when or where. Some of my chat groups remarked that if it hits the PH, we are well and truly cursed. It finally landed in the Indian Ocean yesterday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controversial billionaire Elon Musk hosted SNL this weekend and for some reason, this caused Dogecoin to crash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bill and Melinda Gates announced they are divorcing. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1389349579091365888/&#34;&gt;timing is suspicious&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the tech world, enterprise software maker Basecamp got into a bit of brouhaha this past week after a policy announcement of &amp;ldquo;no politics discussion at work&amp;rdquo; eventually led to around a third of their workforce choosing to resign. Casey Newton has &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406673/basecamp-political-speech-policy-controversy&#34;&gt;a great writeup about it&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a big disappointment because the founders of Basecamp have always had a reputation of promoting positive workplace practices, including a book titled &amp;ldquo;It Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Have to Be Crazy At Work&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-29/ignoring-the-rules-sometimes-works-for-elon-musk&#34;&gt;Money Stuff a while back&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;On the other hand, if you send out those cars to drive themselves everywhere and they all crash and kill a bunch of people, that will be bad! You will be in bad trouble. “It’s better to ask forgiveness than to ask permission,” you will say, but this is not quite right; maybe it is better to announce success and then smugly add “sorry we didn’t tell you first,” but it is strictly worse to fail catastrophically and apologize. If you are going to fail it is better to ask permission, because forgiveness will not be forthcoming. If you are going to succeed, sure, it is better to ask forgiveness. “There’s nothing to forgive, you’re perfect, you little scamp,” everyone will reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are doing some bold novel thing, you probably do not know, ex ante, if you will succeed or fail. Therefore you do not know, ex ante, if you should ask permission or forgiveness, if you should follow the law or not. But if you are the founder and chief executive officer of a company whose goal is to do some bold novel thing, you have been selected and encouraged precisely for your borderline-crazy optimism and self-confidence. You can’t do impossible things unless you first believe that you can, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are certain that you will succeed brilliantly in all your endeavors, then often the optimal strategy will sometimes be to ignore the law, or at least the parts of the law that stand in the way of your vision. Not, like, the objectively optimal strategy, but the strategy that you consider optimal given your subjective certainty that everything will work out for you&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signal &lt;a href=&#34;https://signal.org/blog/the-instagram-ads-you-will-never-see/&#34;&gt;tried to release instagram ads that highlighted how targetted advertising works&lt;/a&gt; but their account conveniently got disabled for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zdnet.com/article/facebook-accuses-signal-of-lying-about-its-attempt-to-run-transparent-instagram-ads/&#34;&gt;what Facebook claims was &amp;ldquo;an unrelated payments issue&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.garbageday.email/p/finally-a-weapon-to-surpass-groverhaus&#34;&gt;a recent Garbage Day&lt;/a&gt;, about Spotify&amp;rsquo;s algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve seen how Facebook&amp;rsquo;s algorithmic recommendation of content, based on an algorithm that&amp;rsquo;s maximized for engagement, has started to distort reality. It has started to undermine democracy and amplified really harmful ideologies like white supremacy and white nationalism. And you can already kind of start to see this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bands have kind of started to figure out like, “oh, all of our songs that sound kind of like this do super well with the Spotify algorithm, let&amp;rsquo;s just make more songs like that.” And you can&amp;rsquo;t fault the band for doing that. There&amp;rsquo;s so few opportunities for bands to make a living from their art at this point. But it terrifies me to think about a future where music is created to please some cold-blooded algorithm. And there&amp;rsquo;s just like something uniquely gross about that to me, when I think about how music is something that humans have been making for literally 1000s of years. It&amp;rsquo;s something that&amp;rsquo;s sacred, and, you know, not to pretend that it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been commodified in a variety of different ways for decades, or maybe even centuries. But this feels like a new frontier. That type of automated commodification of something that should be about humans and not robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marvel released what is basically a sizzle reel for the MCU&amp;rsquo;s next 3 years worth of movies: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdpxoFcdORI&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdpxoFcdORI&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m such a fanboy, I will gleefully admit that I got goosebumps when the video continued past the Shang-chi preview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rolling Stone lists the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-lists/best-tv-sitcoms-1162237/&#34;&gt;best TV sitcoms of all time&lt;/a&gt;. The comments are full of complaints about notable omissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got my &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1391294087064477699/&#34;&gt;second dose of the Sinovac vaccine yesterday&lt;/a&gt;! Supposedly it&amp;rsquo;s fully effective about two weeks after the second dose, although studies show the efficacy is rather low. But some protection is better than none. Some better vaccines are starting to come in, we are supposedly due to get (a small amount of) Pfizer soon. I reckon since I&amp;rsquo;m hunkered down at home most of the time anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m okay with the weaker Chinese vaccine and don&amp;rsquo;t mind if the more effective vaccines go to the masses that have to go out and mingle for work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;, although I&amp;rsquo;m a couple of days behind due to the aforementioned alleged busyness. Should catch up soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Didn&amp;rsquo;t watch any last week, should correct that soon. I&amp;rsquo;m not even a third of the way through my James Bond run!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing too notable, now that Invincible is done and we don&amp;rsquo;t have any running MCU series at the moment. Well, I did enjoy the recent two-part story on Supergirl where two characters travelled back to the past to meet young Kara and Alex in school. The rest of the season has bit a bit meh, so this was the highlight for me so far. The young versions were so perfectly cast!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drafted a bit more &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgstrixhaven/&#34;&gt;Strixhaven&lt;/a&gt; on Arena, and finally ran the Sealed Open yesterday!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still playing a bunch of &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4 and &lt;strong&gt;Street Fighter V&lt;/strong&gt; on Steam. Hey, I got Balrog (Boxer) to bronze!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finally finished the second run of Fire Emblem: Three Houses! There&amp;rsquo;s one more branch to explore (well, technically two, but I&amp;rsquo;m not too interested in the other one), but I might put the game aside for a while and find something else to play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Finished reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/snow-crash/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/strong&gt; by Neal Stephenson&lt;/a&gt;, still looking around for what to read next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t have any quiz nights this week! Instead, I started digging a bit into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://triviastorm.net/&#34;&gt;triviastorm&lt;/a&gt; back-end code and added some improvements I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do for a while. When I&amp;rsquo;m done, I hope the answer checking becomes a bit more robust. Will also probably add a new batch of questions to the bot sometime this month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh, nothing in particular I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to this week. Anything I missed?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Book Review: Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I finished reading &lt;em&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/em&gt; in around three weeks, slightly faster than the other comparable work I&amp;rsquo;ve read this year, which was &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/neuromancer/&#34;&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/a&gt;. Comparable of course only in the sense that they both have some kind of worldwide internet-like network as a central plot point. Otherwise, they are not really that similiar, though the review is made easier by having a base for comparison. Snow Crash is much less cyberpunk than Neuromancer, and maybe takes itself a little less seriously too? I mean, the main character&amp;rsquo;s name is &amp;ldquo;Hiro Protagonist&amp;rdquo;, so that ought to tell you something immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snow Crash was published in 1992, while Neuromancer came out in 1984, so definitely the latter book does take a bit of inspiration from the older one, in terms of cyberspace. The version here in Snow Crash is called &amp;ldquo;Metaverse&amp;rdquo;, and it is actually more akin to a shared virtual reality, much like you were plugged in to a MMORPG such as World of Warcraft. Users of the Metaverse even use goggles to participate, something that only became possible in reality during the last 5 years or so. Hiro in this case is one of the premiere hackers of the metaverse, having contributed a lot to the functionality of the virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is only the second Stephenson book I&amp;rsquo;ve read, after Cryptonomicon &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2004/11/cryptonomicon/&#34;&gt;waaaay back in 2004&lt;/a&gt;. I was worried that I would encounter the same issues I had with Cryptonomicon here - the general wordiness and the slow pace. Thankfully, Snow Crash turned out to be faster paced and easier to follow than the other book. The plot moves along at a reasonable clip, and revolves almost exclusively around the actions of Hiro and his partner, the Kourier who calls herself Y.T. (for &amp;ldquo;Yours Truly&amp;rdquo;) as they navigate this strange world where the United States has suffered from a severe economic collapse and had to cede parts of California to what are now a bunch of autonomous and sovereign microterritories, many of them belonging to private franchises with colorful names such as &amp;ldquo;Mr Lee&amp;rsquo;s Greater Hong Kong&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;The Mafia&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of the plot revolves around linguistics, history, archaeology, computer science, and such (unsurprising given the subject matter of Cryptonomicon). It uses this idea that an ancient civilization was able to use language can be used to propagate a &amp;ldquo;virus&amp;rdquo; throughout society by hacking the human brain, in the same way that code can propagate a virus through a computer network. The bad guy in this story is trying to use this concept of a virus derived from an ancient language to control people and create an all-powerful religion with him at the helm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book&amp;rsquo;s title &amp;ldquo;Snow Crash&amp;rdquo; is the name of a digital &amp;ldquo;drug&amp;rdquo; that the bad guy distributes throughout the Metaverse to target hackers. The drug is actually a digital image of random black and white bits (a bit like what a TV/monitor looks like when it loses a signal in those days, literally a crash that looks like snow) that affects hackers&amp;rsquo; brains in a certain way. I guess I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t spoil any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My one complaint would be the ending felt abrupt, although everything was wrapped up neatly, it all happened mostly outside the purview of our protagonists. I do like it more than Cryptonomicon, which was a later book of his (published in 1999). This one felt easier to grok.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Digital Boardgames Review: Root
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/digital-boardgames-review-root/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 07:19:50 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do reviews of them. This is my fourth such review, and this time I&amp;rsquo;m gonna talk about &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/965580/Root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt;. This is a IRL boardgame by Leder Games with the Steam version published by Dire Wolf Digital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Root is a competitive game themed about multiple factions vying for supremacy in a forest area. Each faction vies for control of clearings, draws cards that provide special abilities or items, and generally tries to stop the others from winning the game, which is done via points. The base game has four different factions to choose from (with the Vagabond faction having three different variants) and each faction plays very differently and scores points differently. So there is a bit of a learning curve to familiarize yourself with all the different factions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cats (Marquis) faction are the like the dominant empire in the area, and they gain points primarily by establishing more buildings, but among the factions they get the fewest actions per turn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The birds (Eyrie) represent an old empire trying to make a comeback; they score points primarily by establishing roosts but they follow a strict set of decrees that govern what they must do each turn. If they fail to obey the decrees, their government goes into turmoil, loses some points and has to start over with a new leader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Woodland Alliance represent plucky rebels aiming to establish their own government. They earn points by spreading sympathizers across the map. Whenever other factions attack them or move troops through sympathizer clearings, they earn more supporters, which can be used to establish bases (which let you recruit warriors) and gain even more supporters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the Vagabond is a freelance adventurer, wandering around the land digging up treasure for ruins and trading for items. He gets stronger the more items he has, can score points by crafting new items, completing quests, or fighting other factions. He can lend his support or even ally with one of the factions for a coalition victory. The Vagabond has several variants that start with different item sets and each have a unique special action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recently released (on Steam anyway) Riverfolk expansion adds two more factions and three more Vagabond variants to the game, adding replay value and more variation to an already very varied game. Each game lasts around an hour or so, which is totally reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Root is without question the one my regular gaming group has spent the most time playing among the digital boardgames. Not only because it&amp;rsquo;s fun (and we love interfering with whatever the others are planning), but it mostly because it has a feature none of the other games we&amp;rsquo;ve tried have: asynchronous multiplayer games. That means we can start a game and take our turns even while the others are offline, and people can just come and take their turn as they please (within the limit of minimum one turn every three days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means at the end of our weekly gaming sessions, no matter what we&amp;rsquo;ve played, we usually end with starting a new Root game, that we play throughout the following week. Sometimes we can get two or three games done during the duration of the week, finishing the last game when we start our next weekly gaming session. We&amp;rsquo;ve been playing the game almost continuously since the Steam release in September 2020 and the physical boardgame has at least two other expansions lined up that aren&amp;rsquo;t on Steam yet, so it&amp;rsquo;s very likely that we&amp;rsquo;ll continue to play it for many more months and perhaps years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s already May? April felt like it came and went so quickly. But then again, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/1242953238497751040&#34;&gt;time has little meaning in this accursed pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The brouhaha over community pantries (as &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/weeknotes-2021-04-25/&#34;&gt;described last week&lt;/a&gt;), seems to have calmed down and they are now generally coordinating with LGUs for assistance in maintaining health protocols&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, the government has embarked on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1387324164910981121/&#34;&gt;propaganda campaign to assert that we aren&amp;rsquo;t the worst in terms of pandemic response in the world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certain congress people continue to promote the usage of the drug Ivermectin, which has no known effect on Covid-19, as a Covid-19 cure or something. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1388100027684331520/&#34;&gt;DOH/FDA keep saying there&amp;rsquo;s no sufficient evidence&lt;/a&gt;, but that has no effect when the people promoting it aren&amp;rsquo;t motivated by evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looks like the Office of the Solicitor General of the Philippines &lt;a href=&#34;https://restofworld.org/2021/philippines-data-exposure/&#34;&gt;accidentally leaked a bunch of sensitive legal documents&lt;/a&gt; due to a misconfigured public directory on their web server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently last weekend was the Oscars, which just goes to show how irrelevant they are now that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know until I saw the tweets about it happening live. They tried to re-arrange the awards with Best Actor last, apparently with the hope of ending with a posthumous award to Chadwick Boseman, but the award went to Anthony Hopkins instead, who wasn&amp;rsquo;t even at the ceremony. Awkward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have this mentor. And one of the best pieces of advice that he gave me is ‘always give someone the golden gate of retreat’, which is: give someone enough compassion, enough opportunity in a conversation for them to look good changing their mind. And it’s a really important thing to be able to do, because if you’re just like, ‘Oh you said this thing! You’re racist!’, you’re forcing that person to say, ‘No I’m not’. Et cetera. There’s no golden gate of retreat there. The only retreat there is to just barrel right through the opposing opinion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a constant practice of getting curious about all of the aspects of your experience. Not with the intention of receiving any adult-mind narrative answers, but with the curiosity of a talking monkey who has no ability to understand the universe. &amp;hellip; By continually introducing the immediate experience of not-knowing to your operating system, you will undo the stale old perceptual and cognitive habits of the adult-mind that thinks it knows, that thinks it has seen it all, that it has seen any of this before. It’s a skill like any other, and as you improve with practice you will get better at meeting everything for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

I&amp;rsquo;m still bitter over &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/10/1048949973801267200/&#34;&gt;not being able to recover my Yahoo Messenger convos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

I was tempted to write about my own experiences working with crypto, but I worry that not enough time has passed for me to talk perhaps a bit unkindly about some of the companies I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manuel Matuzovic writes about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matuzo.at/blog/html-boilerplate/&#34;&gt;his current HTML boilerplate&lt;/a&gt;, which at the very least is a good look at how many different tags and other things one needs to put in by default to support various modern web things including social media previews and such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone shared to me this version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyE80ebItlA&#34;&gt;Never Gonna Give You Up with Japanese lyrics&lt;/a&gt; that I enjoyed for some reason.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I found this &lt;a href=&#34;https://acesubido.net/ph-inflation-calculator/&#34;&gt;Philippines inflation calculator online&lt;/a&gt;. Prices have almost doubled from when I started working back in 2003!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For some reason all the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketches&lt;/a&gt; for the past week were done with pen and paper on this tiny pad I keep near my desk. Much quicker to do, but the sketches are also much simpler than anything I do in Procreate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Caught &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/3bf3bc036db88610a1c7b3474555eb69/&#34;&gt;Green Hornet (2011)&lt;/a&gt; on cable, a movie I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know existed. I should resume my James Bond run soonish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched the &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/05/99d3f5dffa9b1e1f2a4029f66c2b4f2a/&#34;&gt;second season of Jack Ryan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/04/183ab94b6cb10f5db0431e715cde1945/&#34;&gt;finished up season 1 of Invincible&lt;/a&gt;, both on Prime Video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Been drafting a bit more &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgstrixhaven/&#34;&gt;Strixhaven&lt;/a&gt; on Arena. I thought the Sealed Open was this weekend, but turns out it was actually next week. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably shift to Quick Drafts next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a bunch of &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4 already after it dropped for free last week. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big fan of the intro sequence, but I&amp;rsquo;ve warmed up to it as the story and the world gradually opened up. I can tell this will take a while to finish though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a bit of Street Fighter V again this week, though I&amp;rsquo;m still languishing in the Bronze ranks again. Have tried shifting to Balrog (Boxer) as my main, though I&amp;rsquo;m not super familiar with the combos and matchups. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how that goes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My regular Saturday gaming group immediately picked up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1586100/Root_The_Riverfolk_Expansion/&#34;&gt;new Riverfolk expansion for Root&lt;/a&gt; when it dropped last week and we had a lot of fun with some of the creepy new additions last night. And I really should get on with that Root review!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: I am close to finishing &lt;strong&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/strong&gt; by Neal Stephenson, should be done this week, hopefully have time to write the review as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia: Didn&amp;rsquo;t do too well in this week&amp;rsquo;s About Quiz, so we ended up in a distant finish in the league overall. No trivia next week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No new One Piece, BNHA, etc, I assume due to Golden Week. Boo!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strixhaven Sealed Open on Arena next week, for real this time!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting my second shot of Sinovac next Sunday!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was a bit rushed, so typos etc are a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/math-and-privilege/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/someone-has-to-run-the-fabs&#34;&gt;a recent STEM-focused newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, Noahpinion talked a bit about the myth of math being an inborn ability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again, we have seen the following pattern repeat itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different kids with different levels of preparation come into a math class. Some of these kids have parents who have drilled them on math from a young age, while others never had that kind of parental input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first few tests, the well-prepared kids get perfect scores, while the unprepared kids get only what they could figure out by winging it—maybe 80 or 85%, a solid B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unprepared kids, not realizing that the top scorers were well-prepared, assume that genetic ability was what determined the performance differences. Deciding that they “just aren’t math people,” they don’t try hard in future classes, and fall further behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-prepared kids, not realizing that the B students were simply unprepared, assume that they are “math people,” and work hard in the future, cementing their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, people’s belief that math ability can’t change becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I touched upon this in passing in a post last week about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/programming-is-hard/&#34;&gt;programming being hard&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people may make it look easy, because they may have a bit more aptitude than others (due to background or whatever), in the same way that some people find math easy and others find it nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about this after a convo with some friends where they mentioned they were teaching their kids to play &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtg&#34;&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; at a young age, since it helps them practice simple arithmetic. It seems like a simple thing, but that kind of thing contributes towards the kids being &amp;ldquo;prepared&amp;rdquo; for a better math education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad also made a comment last week about how when we were young they (our parents) would often be bringing home activity books for us. Basically books with number puzzles, crossword puzzles, logic puzzles, that kind of thing. I loved those activity books! Among other things, I&amp;rsquo;m sure that contributed to my love of math and problem solving, which often appears as &amp;ldquo;natural aptitude&amp;rdquo; to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a form of privilege: parents having the time and energy and know-how to instill additional knowledge in their kid from a young age. I can&amp;rsquo;t expect poor to lower-class people who work hard all day and are tired at night to be able to do that. So less privileged kids tend to grow up thinking they are bad at math, and they have trouble teaching their kids, and the vicious cycle perpetuates itself and inequality grows in succeeding generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During lunchtime on weekdays, I often find myself watching reruns of a certain local quiz show shown on cable TV, and I find myself alternating between laughter and frustration whenever one of the contestants fail a simple math question. Things like &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s the decimal equivalent of 3 and a half percent&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s 75% of 200&amp;rdquo; - questions I&amp;rsquo;d expect any elementary school graduate should be able to do. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to shake your head and blame the poor education system in this country - which is certainly a factor, but I can&amp;rsquo;t help but consider how this kind of inequality, compounding across generations, also contributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do? Adults who grew up without this privilege often think their case is hopeless. &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mahina lang talaga ako sa math&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just really bad at math&amp;rdquo;), people often lament, as if it were some innate ability that they were not fortunate enough to acquire at character creation. And even if they wanted to get better at math, most will not have the time or energy to do so, due to daily life struggles. I would guess at some level it&amp;rsquo;s also a bit harder for such adults to re-learn math as their brains have already been wired not to think that way. It&amp;rsquo;s probably not an insurmountable handicap like a physical injury, but it can be challenging nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just rambling. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a point, nor a solution. I don&amp;rsquo;t know where this post was going.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;the-jam&#34;&gt;The jam&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thing I did last weekend was to participate in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48&#34;&gt;the 48th LUDUM DARE game jam&lt;/a&gt;. Doing gamedev has been a long-time elusive dream of mine, all the way back to my college years. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a number of failed attempts to get into gamedev, both solo and with other people.I&amp;rsquo;ve also played around with things like PyGame, &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2017/01/10155238560218912/&#34;&gt;Unity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2020/11/1326919888472956928/&#34;&gt;DragonRuby&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read about the LD48 game jam this April and signed up to participate. My expectations weren&amp;rsquo;t very high and I was anxious going on; I was pretty sure I was not going to do well and doubted I could even put things together. I had never done a Ludum Dare or a game jam before, heck I haven&amp;rsquo;t even made anything I consider a &amp;ldquo;real game&amp;rdquo; before!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game jam has two modes you can choose to submit to. The 72-hour version (called the &amp;ldquo;Jam&amp;rdquo;) was easier, as you could have a team of people working together, and you could use any assets you had legal access to. The 48-hour version, called the &amp;ldquo;Compo&amp;rdquo; (which I guess is short for competitive?), is much more challenging. You can only work solo, and all assets must be created within the 48 hour period (with a few exceptions like fonts etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no intention of working with a team; in fact I didn&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone I planned to participate until after the jam started last Saturday at 9AM local time. I figured I would try my best and if I finished within 48h, I would submit for the jam. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t, I had an extra 24h to try for the compo, and I could even ask for help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That meant I would be working alone, which meant I would have to do things like art and sounds and music! I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any experience doing pixel art for games or anything like that, so I figured I could get by on &amp;ldquo;programmer art&amp;rdquo;. For sound effects, I knew there were online generators I could use, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried some before. Background music was the real challenge: I have no musical talent at all, so even if I could find tools to do it, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know how to put anything together. These were problems for me 48h into the future though. When the jam started, I just dove in to code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, not really. I woke up late and had to do some errands so I missed the start time by a couple of hours. Still, I dove right in as soon as I was free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-tools&#34;&gt;The tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the gamedev/programming part, I decided to use the Godot Engine game development framework. I had been trying it out since earlier this year, and I was pretty happy with it compared to Unity. The IDE was a lot lighter, the APIs felt more intuitive, and basically it made it easier for me to get into the guts of a game. Unity is great, but it always seemed geared towards 3D gamedev. Godot makes 2D gamedev feel like a first class citizen. I prefer working on 2D because I feel like that&amp;rsquo;s something more achieveable for me as an indie. Doing sprites and such is more in my wheelhouse than 3D models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the art, I&amp;rsquo;ve never tried any pixel art creation tools before, so I just searched online. I settled on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.piskelapp.com&#34;&gt;Piskel&lt;/a&gt; which had the advantages of (a) being free; and (b) running entirely in-browser, without needing me to create an account. Very low friction! I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried such tools before so I was impressed with how mature they were. There were functions similar to what you&amp;rsquo;d find in paint, plus support for layers and export to various formats, including into spritesheets. It was perfect for what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sound effects, I used another free online site &lt;a href=&#34;https://sfxr.me/&#34;&gt;JSFXR&lt;/a&gt;. Basically just kept rolling one of the settings until I got a sound I like. Godot&amp;rsquo;s AudioStreamPlayer didn&amp;rsquo;t seem like it accepted WAVs, so I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://convertio.co/wav-ogg/&#34;&gt;convert.io&lt;/a&gt; to convert the files to OGG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For background music, a friend suggested I tried &lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinesequencer.net/&#34;&gt;Online Sequencer&lt;/a&gt;. I tried it out for a while, banging out random notes since I knew nothing about how to compose music. I looked at a few interesting ones created by other people and tried to adjust the random notes I was banging out to better follow the patterns I saw. I still don&amp;rsquo;t understand, but I was able to create a couple of tracks I was fairly happy with (they sounded like music!) which I used as BGM in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also used one of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/sketchdaily&#34;&gt;sketchdaily&lt;/a&gt; attempts to generate some &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/04/1385956018509664263/&#34;&gt;splash screen/cover art&lt;/a&gt; for the game. The final game used a slightly cleaned up and modified version of that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also needed a Dynamic font, since using Godot&amp;rsquo;s built-in fonts didn&amp;rsquo;t allow me to resize text. The Compo rules allow you to use fonts you didn&amp;rsquo;t make during the jam, so I just used Xolonium-Regular from one of the Godot tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-game&#34;&gt;The game&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme of the jam was &lt;strong&gt;DEEPER and DEEPER&lt;/strong&gt;, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d go the easy route and do something with digging or undersea exploration. I felt like digging would be the more common approach, so I went the other way, since I&amp;rsquo;m a contrarian. I decided to do something inspired by things like the underwater level in TMNT (NES) or the underwater level in Earthworm Jim (SNES). These were the frustrating underwater levels I grew up with, so I wanted to replicate that experience a bit. Basically moving around underwater, with a time limit and trying to avoid obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the idea was to have a deep-sea diver exploring underwater. But for some reason the ocean is full of spikes, so he has to keep moving and swimming to avoid them. All the while trying to go deeper and deeper. I added in a few enemies like jellyfish that acted as moving obstacles, and seeker fish that actively tried to chase you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also added an oxygen tank mechanic to serve as the timer. The tank would be getting depleted constantly as you kept breathing and you had to avoid running out. There would be little things that generate air bubbles you can pick up to increase your oxygen level (this part was inspired by the 3d mario games). Initially the bubble generator was just a jar, but later I changed the sprite to a clam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also decided to add a collectible in the form of gems that you can pick up on your way down. Basically to add more things to do in each stage. And it added a bit of risk-reward mechanics: should I waste time trying to get this gem, when I might run out of air or get hit by enemies? When I added it I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how the gems would be relevant in the game. I eventually decided to have the player earn extra lives whenever he collects 5 gems. The initial gem sprite was a diamond but later changed to a pearl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the basic gameplay: Avoid obstacles, collect gems, avoid running out of air, try to get as deep as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controls were simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your diver is constantly sinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can move left or right using arrow keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can swim up (or bounce, in my internal terms) by pressing space bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bounce was kind of a flappy bird bounce: you hit spacebar and you go up by a fixed amount after which you begin sinking again. I wanted the controls to be not too smooth so that you needed to know the bounce distance really well to navigate tighter corridors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had something basic working, I showed it to some friends to get some feedback, and got some good ideas and bug reports from them. (I figured showing it to other people and getting suggestions was fine within the compo rules, as long as I did all the actual creation work myself!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of Saturday (around 16h after jam start, 32h before compo deadline), I was mostly done with all the mechanics and gameplay and such. But content was lacking: I only had five screens (&amp;ldquo;stages&amp;rdquo;) for the player to navigate through, which I felt was too short. Creating levels was fairly straightforward though once I had all the components ready. The feedback from my friends was also pretty good. By this point I was fairly confident I could finish in time, and probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t lose too much sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent Sunday working more on the game, in between a bunch of family errands. I added another five levels, and fixed a lot of bugs. By the end of day Sunday (around 9h before compo deadline), I was ready to submit. Godot lets me export both to web and to Windows binaries. I could have also exported to other OSes, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to test them. I was originally planning to host the game here on this site, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t decide how / where to put them in the site structure. Instead I went ahead and deployed the game to itch.io, as I already had an account there. This was a relatively easy and straightforward process (though I did have to answer some tax-related questions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the game is here on itch.io: &lt;a href=&#34;https://hungryroy.itch.io/diver&#34;&gt;https://hungryroy.itch.io/diver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ludum Dare requires the source code be made available, I have it up here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/roytang/diver&#34;&gt;https://github.com/roytang/diver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, the page for my entry on the Ludum Dare site itself: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/diver&#34;&gt;https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/diver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aftermath&#34;&gt;Aftermath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After submitting your game, you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to review and rate other people&amp;rsquo;s games, and you want to earn at least 20 ratings to get a &amp;ldquo;final score&amp;rdquo;. Coming in, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really aim to &amp;ldquo;win&amp;rdquo; the compo or anything like that, I just wanted to finish a game. But after submitting and checking out a few of the other submissions, I felt a bit more confident about my chances and am hoping for a decent finish. The &amp;ldquo;play, review, and rate&amp;rdquo; period lasts for 21 days after the jam ends, so it&amp;rsquo;ll be a while before I know the outcome of that! I am doing my part by playing through some of the entries and rating them and leaving helpful comments where I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, very impressed with how Ludum Dare works. The more ratings and quality feedback you give, the higher your game appears in the listings. This makes it more likely for you to receive ratings and feedback yourself, thus incentivizing the same and creating a positive feedback loop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest takeaway is that I learned how to build something with as small a scope as possible. In many of my past attempts, scope creep was always one of the bigger problems. I was used to playing big, epic games like grand strategy or long RPGs or open world games, so I often wanted to make games like those. The 48h limit helped me narrow my focus and reject stuff that would endanger that deadline. I had to discard some other ideas for enemies and stage elements because they would make things more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did enjoy the experience, no matter the outcome, I&amp;rsquo;ve already exceeded my own expectations. I expect to try my hand at game jams again moving forward. Building experience by making a series of small games might be a better way for me to find a path into &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; gamedev. That is, as opposed to &amp;ldquo;hobbyist&amp;rdquo; gamedev, which is the new level I consider myself at now that I&amp;rsquo;ve completed a Ludum Dare!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some screenshots of the game attached below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 20th: The results from the Ludum Dare came out yesterday! Unfortunately, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even crack the top 10 lol. Still, pretty decent finish (out of like 800+ participants) considering it was my first game jam and I had very little experience. Looking forward to the next one!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier review (with some spoilers):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more action-packed and straightforward compared to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/wandavision/&#34;&gt;Wandavision&lt;/a&gt;, jumping straight into the action from the get go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some great performances here, especially from Sebastian Stan (Bucky), Wyatt Russell (John Walker), and Daniel Bruhl (Zemo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bucky and Sam have great chemistry, even though they start out annoyed at each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pacing is a bit odd at times; feels more like an extended movie than a weekly episodic series (especially compared to Wandavision, which took advantage of the weekly format really well)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;although a complete story by itself, this one felt more of a setup for future MCU storylines (again compared to Wandavision)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;while overall the season was good, I find Wandavision was the clearly better watch for me, though I suppose your mileage may vary if your preference is for action sequences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ending spoilers follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details class=&#34;spoiler&#34;&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;(Spoilers)&lt;/summary&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I felt like so much of the finale was rushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final confrontation and resolution with the Flag Smashers felt flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyatt Russell sudden redemption felt undeserved - we go from stripped of position to fighting buddies with Bucky very quickly; would have liked to see him publicly address Sam as Cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power Broker reveal was underwhelming; would have preferred it was done via a post-credits scene, possibly via Sharon telling someone about how she had to kill Batroc because he was threatening to expose her (presumably the earlier confrontation would have been cut to omit the reveal). Overall, I would have hidden the secret more (it was really obvious), so that the reveal at the end would have had a better impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish Bucky&amp;rsquo;s redemption arc had played a stronger part in the finale, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Felt like they could have extended an episode or two to at least make some of these things more impactful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next: Loki in June!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a bit busy this weekend (see below), so this post is running a bit late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ongoing saga right here in the Philippines:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last weekend, community pantries for the needy started sprouting up in Metro Manila and all over the country, largely inspired by one started in Maginhawa here in Quezon City. The central idea was &amp;ldquo;give what you can, take what you need.&amp;rdquo; Stories spread of heartwarming stories like a poor old man donating some food even though he had very little and an ice cream vendor giving away the remnants of his cart for the day to those in the queue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government critics pointed out the need for these pantries was largely a result of the lack of support from the government. (They&amp;rsquo;re not wrong.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predictably, it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for the government to butt in, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/roytang/status/1384280033351462912&#34;&gt;the police reportedly investigating the people behind the pantries for communist links&lt;/a&gt;. Some other national government people even said they might require permits. For what, giving food away?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The backlash was predictably quick, with netizens and even local government offcials and senators castigating the critics. Mayors started chiming in that the community pantries were welcome in their cities and that there was no permit required to help each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, notable spokespersons of the NTF-ELCAC still insisted on insinuating communist links to the pantries. There were also the usual critics who decried people getting stuff for free, speaking from the privilege of their safe houses and expensive cars. Critics also raised whether these pantries were spreading covid because of how people spend a lot of time queued up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some women in Pasig went viral for a bit after they were caught on video raiding a community pantry and getting much more than could be reasonably expected, one of them even carting off a trayful of eggs. They supposedly claimed they were going to give away to their neighbors. They later &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.msn.com/en-ph/entertainment/other/mga-babaeng-nanlimas-sa-community-pantry-sa-pasig-dumepensa-na/ar-BB1fUtan&#34;&gt;apologized&lt;/a&gt;, but supposedly they &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/news5ph/status/1384855185932042241&#34;&gt;were planning to file charges against the person who took a video of them&lt;/a&gt;. My take: the thing about decentralized movements like this is that they tend to easily self-correct through the vigilance of the participants as seen here. There have been no other reports of similar incidents after this one went viral, so at the very least they served as an example of what not to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last Friday, a community pantry started by actress Angel Locsin ended in disaster when an old man died while in the queue. Blowback from the pantry critics and the DDS was fierce. Locsin &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gmanetwork.com/entertainment/showbiznews/news/76345/angel-locsin-issues-apology-after-senior-citizen-dies-in-line-at-her-community-pantry/story&#34;&gt;quickly issued an apology&lt;/a&gt; and accepted the blame, drawing contrasts with how the national government never apologizes or admits to mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently, news broke that the National Security Adviser &lt;a href=&#34;https://onenews.ph/gag-order-imposed-on-parlade-badoy&#34;&gt;had imposed a gag order on the notorious NTF-ELCAC spokespersons re: community pantries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probably one of the reasons we can&amp;rsquo;t have nice things: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LaTtEX/status/1384416859701792771&#34;&gt;people can&amp;rsquo;t be generous without some other people becoming suspicious and assigning nefarious motives&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens with these pantries moving forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of covid, India&amp;rsquo;s experiencing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56798248&#34;&gt;worst surge of the pandemic so far&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://mashable.com/article/twitter-hides-tweets-critical-indian-government-handling-covid/&#34;&gt;accused of censoring tweets critical of the Indian government&amp;rsquo;s covid response&lt;/a&gt;. The US is facing calls to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/25/us-pressed-to-lift-export-ban-to-help-india-fight-surge-in-covid-cases?CMP=twt_gu#Echobox=1619342451&#34;&gt;loosen export bans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/24/covid-vaccines-patents-pharmaceutical-companies-secrecy&#34;&gt;lighten up on vaccine patents&lt;/a&gt; to help out India (and the rest of us in the global south, really).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some lighter news: One year ago in Apr 24 2020, an epic battle among a ton of people named Josh was scheduled a year in advance, to fight for the name. It &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gothspiderbitch/status/1386031209457852418&#34;&gt;happened yesterday&lt;/a&gt;! They had a pool noodle battle and named a 5 year old &amp;ldquo;King Josh&amp;rdquo; or some such. Lots of fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messaging app Signal, famous for its encryption protections, raised concerns about vulnerabilities in software often used by authoritarian regimes to bypass the security of such apps: &lt;a href=&#34;https://signal.org/blog/cellebrite-vulnerabilities/&#34;&gt;Exploiting vulnerabilities in Cellebrite UFED and Physical Analyzer from an app&amp;rsquo;s perspective&lt;/a&gt;. The great thing is how the report does a hilarious &amp;ldquo;wink wink nudge nudge&amp;rdquo; implying the users of such apps might not want to target Signal in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some stuff about blogging and personal websites:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://matthiasott.com/notes/no-wrong-notes&#34;&gt;No wrong notes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kottke.org/21/04/the-conversation-has-never-been-wider&#34;&gt;The conversation has never been wider.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gq.com/story/get-fit-from-just-walking&#34;&gt;How fit can you get from just walking?&lt;/a&gt; One of the tragedies of the pandemic is that I&amp;rsquo;ve had to reduce my general walking output, since I can&amp;rsquo;t just wander around as far as I want anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kottke.org/21/04/make-everything-important&#34;&gt;Mads Mikkelsen: &amp;ldquo;Make everything important.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blolook.osa-p.net/&#34;&gt;page / app you can check&lt;/a&gt; to see how many people have blocked you on Twitter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;did-you-know&#34;&gt;Did you know:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Spanish dub of Terminator 2, instead of &amp;ldquo;Hasta la vista, baby&amp;rdquo;, the Terminator says &amp;ldquo;Sayonara, baby!&amp;rdquo; via &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/mwv4nd/fun_fact_in_the_spanish_dub_of_terminator_2_he/&#34;&gt;reddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jack Black&amp;rsquo;s parents were &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/mxsdzu/til_judith_love_cohen_who_helped_create_the/&#34;&gt;satellite engineers&lt;/a&gt;. (This entry spoils the ending of that entry, sorry!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local liturgical song Tanging Yaman, often attributed to Carol Banawa, was actually &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/04/03/21/behind-the-music-tanging-yaman-by-fr-manoling-francisco&#34;&gt;first recorded by now-Senator Risa Hontiveros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The big thing for me this week (that I hinted at in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/weeknotes-2021-04-18/&#34;&gt;the previous weeknotes&lt;/a&gt;) is that I decided to give &lt;a href=&#34;https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48&#34;&gt;LUDUM DARE 48&lt;/a&gt; a shot! It&amp;rsquo;s a game jam, where you make a game in 48 hours (well, that&amp;rsquo;s the mode I&amp;rsquo;m participating in). Tt&amp;rsquo;s the first time I&amp;rsquo;m doing one, despite a lifetime of flirting with the idea of gamedev. Initial build is &lt;a href=&#34;https://hungryroy.itch.io/diver&#34;&gt;already available&lt;/a&gt;, even though there&amp;rsquo;s still 9ish hours to go. (I need to sleep!) I&amp;rsquo;ll probably (should) write more about this experience in a future post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Around the middle of this week, I got the first ever email that actually complied with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/about/contact/&#34;&gt;the contact protocol I had specified here in the site&lt;/a&gt; and on LinkedIn, namely putting a certain keyword in the subject line. I&amp;rsquo;ve had that condition for years, so I was really amazed someone actually read it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;still sketching&lt;/a&gt;, though I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen a couple of days behind due to the game jam. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1385224243848179719/&#34;&gt;tried to do one on paper like a comic&lt;/a&gt; but my handwriting was so terrible I had to edit it digitally!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/b178a1efcfc005930f062c7be447d7c1/&#34;&gt;Rocky (1976)&lt;/a&gt;, and I meant to watch the next Bond flick too, but ran out of time. New Mortal Kombat movie also came out this past week, I might watch that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt; season finale ran last Friday. A lot of people are happy with it (and the season overall), but I felt like some parts were too rushed and the finale suffered as a result. Will probably post more thoughts on it this week. After this, we won&amp;rsquo;t have MCU content until Loki kicks off next month I think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Invincible&lt;/strong&gt; is getting to the good part!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still drafting a bunch of Strixhaven on Arena (though I had to stop for the weekend due to the game jam). Most of my drafts went well, though the last 2 I did this week were terrible. I ended up listening to &lt;a href=&#34;http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-593-strixhaven-first-impressions/&#34;&gt;the Limited Resources podcast&lt;/a&gt; for the first time and got some good tips, hopefully that improves my drafts moving forward. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably play in the Sealed Open next weekend! Follow along via &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgstrixhaven/&#34;&gt;the MTGStrixhaven tag&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/strong&gt; actually had some progress this week. I really should finish this run soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downloaded &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4 because it&amp;rsquo;s temporarily free! I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to play this for a while, hopefully I have time for it this coming week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played some Street Fighter V again this week; I figured since a new character dropped, it might be easy to find matches again. I did manage to fight quite a few, but I also did quite poorly, dropping back to Ultra Bronze. Thinking about switching to a different character since everyone seems to know how to fight Ryu, so I unlocked Honda! We&amp;rsquo;ll see who I actually end up using.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Currently about halfway through &lt;strong&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/strong&gt; by Neal Stephenson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia: Pop Quiz is back (albeit monthly now, not weekly), so the trivia team was able to join two quizzes this past week. We didn&amp;rsquo;t win either though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a couple of birthdays in the family this weekend, so my game jamming was interspersed with zoom / messenger calls and food deliveries and such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Invincible, One Piece, BNHA, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new expansion dropping for Root, one of the digital boardgames we&amp;rsquo;ve been playing (and the one I have yet to write a review for&amp;hellip; sounds like a perfect opportunity!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strixhaven Sealed Open on Arena next week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was a bit rushed, so typos etc are a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/blogs-of-yesteryear-part-2/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;This is a follow up to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/blogs-of-yesteryear/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Blogs of Yesteryear&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. This is the remainder of my blogroll from 2004/2005. I feel like the second half is less interesting than the first half, but I figured I might as well go through them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;geekiness&#34;&gt;geekiness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the blogs under this session are about general geeky topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absurd Genius&lt;/strong&gt; - looks this was a tech and gaming-focused blog that featured a web portal for the PSP browser. But I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anymore information about the author. It was formerly hosted on base2.org, but that domain doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have any content now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forever Geek&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a blog that covered a lot of geeky topics - tech, anime, gadgets, games, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://forevergeek.com/&#34;&gt;still around&lt;/a&gt;! I no longer follow them though, mainly because that&amp;rsquo;s not really the sort of site I follow anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kuro5hin&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a slashdot-like discussion site that was a bit popular back in the day. According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuro5hin&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the site was taken down permanently in 2016. Kuro5hin was owned by Rusty Foster, who now writes a newsletter, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.todayintabs.com/&#34;&gt;Today in Tabs&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/newsletters-redux/&#34;&gt;newsletters I follow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gaming&#34;&gt;gaming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed a lot of gaming sites back in the day. I no longer follow these, mostly because I&amp;rsquo;m not interested anymore in having 100% gaming feeds in my feedreader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;game girl advance&lt;/strong&gt; - a gaming blog with all women writers. Back then most of the people writing about games were male (I think), so following a site like this one helped diversify your POVs. The site is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gamegirladvance.com/&#34;&gt;still up&lt;/a&gt;, but the last update is from 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GameDevBlog&lt;/strong&gt; - this is a blog by game developer Jamie Fristrom. I think I followed this site after I read an interesting article he wrote about implementing web-swinging in the 2004 videogame Spider-man 2. His &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gamedevblog.com/&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt; and updated as recently as last October!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games from Within&lt;/strong&gt; - this was another game developer&amp;rsquo;s blog (in case it isn&amp;rsquo;t obvious, it is/was one of my interests). The &lt;a href=&#34;https://gamesfromwithin.com/&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt;, last post is from 2018. (Annoyingly, it&amp;rsquo;s one of those sites that doesn&amp;rsquo;t show the post date on the listing screens.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RPGamer&lt;/strong&gt; - a gaming site focused on computer/console RPGs. This and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rpgfan.com/&#34;&gt;RPGFan&lt;/a&gt; were my main source of RPG news back in the day. RPGamer is &lt;a href=&#34;https://rpgamer.com/&#34;&gt;still up&lt;/a&gt; and going strong. (The site even still has the same dragon logo and font!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These Damned Machines Are Killing Me&lt;/strong&gt; - another gaming focused blog, this one was short-lived, looks like it wasn&amp;rsquo;t updated past 2007, after which the site went down. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.damnedmachines.com/&#34;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt; currently redirects to a site called Furious Games, not sure if related.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3rd World Game Designer&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a blog by Gabby Dizon, a game designer from the Philippines! (I&amp;rsquo;m always interested in local content). The site is no longer accessible and the domain is parked. I think I found the author on Twitter, but he seems to be a crypto guy now or some such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;comics&#34;&gt;comics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still read webcomics these days, though not as much, and almost never through a feed reader (most of the time.) Related: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2006/10/webcomics-i-like-2006-edition/&#34;&gt;Webcomics I Like, 2006 Edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PvPonline&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a webcomic about the employees at a gaming publication, it was quite popular back in the day. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://pvponline.com/&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt; and the author recently rebooted/time-skipped the story. I currently follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pvponline&#34;&gt;the author on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and catch up on it whenever I see him update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Penny Arcade&lt;/strong&gt; - one of the longest-running mostly-gaming-focused webcomics (and one of the most well-known). The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.penny-arcade.com/&#34;&gt;site is still going strong&lt;/a&gt; after all these years, sporting largely the same color scheme. I get updates because I follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cwgabriel&#34;&gt;the artist on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comics: Foxtrot&lt;/strong&gt; - one of my favorite slice of life strips, I have a few of the books. It stopped being released as a daily a while back, and the author now only releases a new comic every Sunday, I think. Once again, I am following &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/billamend&#34;&gt;the artist on twitter&lt;/a&gt;. (Starting to see a pattern here.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comics: Sinfest&lt;/strong&gt; - it started out as a dark humor strip about this guy Slick who tries to hit on a girl named Monique and just kept expanding and expanding its scope, covering topics such as politics, patriarchy, religion, that kind of stuff. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://sinfest.net/&#34;&gt;still running&lt;/a&gt; but I mostly lost interest when he tended to do arcs that ran really long. I much preferred his silly, standalone strips like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sinfest.net/view.php?date=2004-04-05&#34;&gt;this one about Apples and Oranges&lt;/a&gt;. Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2010/08/1042004246/&#34;&gt;another one that I liked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dilbert&lt;/strong&gt; - this famous strip is of course still running (currently at &lt;a href=&#34;https://dilbert.com/&#34;&gt;Dilbert.com&lt;/a&gt;), although the author has in recent years come out as Trump supporter with many bad takes. I still read the strip, mostly because it comes with our daily newspaper. (On paper! We still have those!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real life comics&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a semi-autobiographical slice-of-life comic about a guy named Greg. I had stopped following it for a while because of reasons, but last year I found out that (a) it was still going strong; and (b) the author recently &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/reallifecomics/status/1284587454968651777&#34;&gt;came out as as trans&lt;/a&gt;. The strip is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reallifecomics.com/index.php&#34;&gt;still running&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comics: Calvin and Hobbes&lt;/strong&gt; - the quintessential comic about a little kid and his tiger. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why I bothered following this one, since the author stopped drawing the strip in 1995. I believe that I have already read every single strip of C&amp;amp;H, so there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to follow it now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Websnark&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a commentary blog about stuff on the internet, mostly webcomics. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember following it for too long, probably lost interest at some point. The domain currently has nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lifehacks&#34;&gt;lifehacks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are blogs I followed about self-improvement, productivity, that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working Smart&lt;/strong&gt; - looks like this was a blog from a guy who was head of a Christian publishing company. I guess I followed him because he sometimes published about topics like getting things done, communication, tech, gadgets, and blogging. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember following him for very long, so I imagine I lost interest quickly. The site is no longer accessible and he no longer seems to be blogging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve Pavlina&amp;rsquo;s Blog&lt;/strong&gt; - this is a guy who became well-known as a self-help author and motivational speaker. He often wrote about personal development. I&amp;rsquo;m not really into that kind of content anymore so I no longer follow him. He still writes at stevepavlina.com.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;43 Folders&lt;/strong&gt; - a site about &amp;ldquo;tricks, hacks and other cool stuff&amp;rdquo;, named after the number of manila folders in a tickler file. The site is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.43folders.com/&#34;&gt;still around&lt;/a&gt;, but the last update is from 2011. I&amp;rsquo;m currently following &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies&#34;&gt;the author on twitter&lt;/a&gt;, he no longer seems to be blogging and is more of a podcaster now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;feed-readers&#34;&gt;feed readers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the old site, my feeds back then were powered by an app called Bloglines. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloglines&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; says Bloglines became unavailable in 2015, but presumably I stopped using it in 2007 when I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2007/01/newshutch-feed-aggregator/&#34;&gt;switched to a different app called Newshutch&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, I was complaining that &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader&#34;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt;, released in 2007, was &amp;ldquo;slow as molasses&amp;rdquo;! I eventually did migrate to Google Reader and was a faithful user until &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2013/06/347364993144074241/&#34;&gt;it was killed off in 2013&lt;/a&gt;. (In hindsight, this was more recent than I thought it was!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-about-now&#34;&gt;what about now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I follow a mostly different set of blogs now. There&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/blogroll/&#34;&gt;a blogroll&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;rsquo;s a touch out of date and could use some updating. Maybe sometime soon. Looking over the list, it seems I prefer not to follow single-topic blogs anymore and enjoy slice-of-life blogs where people talk about their day-to-day pursuits on a personal level (instead of say, writing as a general-purpose article for any reader). Feel free to send me blogs or blogrolls you recommend, I will gladly spend an hour or so scrolling through a blogroll and clicking through links and checking out blogs!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to think of this past week, feels like it went by quickly. I may have spent too much of it daydreaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NCR+ bubble is now one week into modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ - an acronym that makes no sense). Cases still seem to be pretty high on a day-to-day basis, though we&amp;rsquo;re told the R number is dropping slightly, so that&amp;rsquo;s good I guess? Still, would be nice if the case numbers would calm down. Still lots of stories about people having trouble getting into hospitals and dying in ICUs. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/4/12/Roque-un-Christian-COVID-19-confinement.html&#34;&gt;the presidential spokesperson claims it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;unchristian&amp;rdquo; to ask how he managed to get a hospital booking despite all the problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quezon City is out of vaccines, at least for now, until the national government gives them some more. They were able to vaccinate around 100,000 people so far, which isn&amp;rsquo;t too bad. The two seniors I live with still haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten vaccinated, so hopefully supplies come back up soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a rare show of spine, the Philippine government, in coordination with American friends, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.esquiremag.ph/politics/news/china-backs-down-a00293-20210416-lfrm&#34;&gt;have sent coast guard ships to chase away the Chinese invaders&lt;/a&gt; in Julian Felipe reef!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not sure what&amp;rsquo;s happening with the rest of the world, haven&amp;rsquo;t really been paying attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I guess we could note that in the US, cops are killing more black people while protests about previous killings are going on while a former police officer is on trial for a previous killing, but this sort of thing doesn&amp;rsquo;t really feel &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; for the US anymore. Now, if they actually do something to fix the systemic rot in their police system, that would be news. (Not that our cops here are much better&amp;hellip;) Don&amp;rsquo;t really feel like providing links for this one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google is rolling out a new Chrome feature called FloC that allows the browser itself to profile you for ads, instead of using third-party cookies. &lt;a href=&#34;https://seirdy.one/2021/04/16/permissions-policy-floc-misinfo.html&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s some more info.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://margint.blog/2021/04/05/creating-software-at-scale/&#34;&gt;Everyone is still terrible at creating software at scale&lt;/a&gt;. (I would argue humans are terrible at creating anything at scale&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dorinlazar.ro/2021-02-programming-is-hard/&#34;&gt;Programming is hard, says dorin.lazar.ro&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/programming-is-hard/&#34;&gt;a response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I might not play it, but I like the aesthetic of upcoming Metroidvania &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXDcMVvtPh4&#34;&gt;GetsuFumaDen: Undying Moon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;! Practiced &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1383150746334466051/&#34;&gt;sketching some elaborate hair&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;rsquo;s always a challenge for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tried out &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1382290950483976200/&#34;&gt;these three-cheese donuts from Lola Nena&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;, after I heard about them from a local streamer. Pretty good!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1381509474259673090/&#34;&gt;Airplane! (1980)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/ced0a77eea2857ad31bd014fac3ded9a/&#34;&gt;Live and Let Die (1973)&lt;/a&gt; to continute the James Bond run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt; was mostly set up for the finale next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have also been enjoying &lt;strong&gt;Invincible&lt;/strong&gt;, but I guess that I will reserve commentary until the season is done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did not watch this year&amp;rsquo;s Wrestlemania.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new set, Strixhaven, has dropped on &lt;strong&gt;Magic Arena&lt;/strong&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;m having fun drafting it. Follow along via &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgstrixhaven/&#34;&gt;the MTGStrixhaven tag&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also randomly decided into &lt;strong&gt;Eternal&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Stormbreak open this weekend, did terribly, as could be expected lol. At least I got to open a bunch of packs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other than the card games, I actually didn&amp;rsquo;t get much gaming done this week. I should correct that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/strong&gt; has no progress this past week lol. I really should finish this second run. I did play a bit of &lt;strong&gt;Pac-Man 99&lt;/strong&gt; on the Switch, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t manage to actually win a game, seems harder than Super Mario 99.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Currently reading &lt;strong&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/strong&gt; by Neal Stephenson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia: This past Saturday, our trivia group split into two teams: one played in an Attack on Titan-themed trivia (I didn&amp;rsquo;t join because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be spoiled) while the rest of us played in the regular AboutQuiz, with a poetry-themed game. Coincidentally, we finished in third place for both quizzes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier finale!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Invincible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rose DLC character for Street Fighter V drops on the 19th, part of season 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn will be free on PSN on the 19th, no PS+ required!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final Civ6 balance update drops on the 22nd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A couple of family birthdays next weekend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We actually have two regular trivia events this coming week, since PopQuiz is back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mystery event on Saturday the 24th, I&amp;rsquo;ll post about it if I decide to participate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Google Chrome is adding a new feature that lets their browser target you with ads without using third-party browser cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s some more info: &lt;a href=&#34;https://plausible.io/blog/google-floc&#34;&gt;How to fight back against Google FLoC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But basically it comes down to: if you&amp;rsquo;re a web user who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want your browsing history to be used to target you with advertisments, stop using Google Chrome. There are many alternatives. I&amp;rsquo;m a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; boy myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For site owners, you can add a &lt;code&gt;Permissions-Policy: interest-cohort=()&lt;/code&gt; response header to opt-out of your site being included in the data collected about your Chrome visitors. I&amp;rsquo;ve updated this site to add the header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update 4.18] &lt;a href=&#34;https://seirdy.one/&#34;&gt;sierdy.one&lt;/a&gt; says the &lt;a href=&#34;https://seirdy.one/2021/04/16/permissions-policy-floc-misinfo.html&#34;&gt;fears about FloC aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly accurate&lt;/a&gt;, and that webmasters don&amp;rsquo;t really need to add the response header as long as they aren&amp;rsquo;t using third-party scripts anyway? I&amp;rsquo;ll just keep it around though.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ted Lasso Season 1 spoiler-free review
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/ted-lasso-season-1-spoiler-free-review/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 20:55:21 +0800</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/ted-lasso-season-1-spoiler-free-review/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A number of people I follow have been raving about Ted Lasso for a while, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a try. My thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Season 1 is 10 episodes, each episode 30 minutes long. I finished all of the episodes over the span of one day!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know much coming in: I knew it was about sports, and I knew it was supposedly a comedy. For some reason I assumed it was about American football. It turns out to be about English association football, i.e. soccer!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wikipedia claims the series is a comedy, but it&amp;rsquo;s not a &amp;ldquo;ha-ha / laugh out loud&amp;rdquo; zany situation comedy like say, Brooklyn Nine-Nine or Modern Family. Ted Lasso is more of an &amp;ldquo;absurd premise&amp;rdquo; kind of comedy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bill Lawrence, creator of Scrubs, helped develop the series, but it is much less zanier than that one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, Ted Lasso is the story of an outsider coming into to help a dysfunctional team get their act together. I&amp;rsquo;d say the story it most reminds me of is Mighty Ducks. In both cases, I learned a lot more about the associated sport (Ice hockey / association football) works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difference between Mighty Ducks&amp;rsquo; reluctant coach Gordon Bombay and the titular Ted Lasso is that Ted is earnest, eager, and genuinely cares for his team, and he uses his abundant optimism to plot through any problems that life throws at him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The meat of the story is how Ted Lasso, an American football coach thrust into the unfamiliar world of the English Premiere League navigates both the foreign culture and the many contrasting personalities he has to work with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main plotline of the team&amp;rsquo;s eventual win-loss record is at many times overshadowed by the character arcs and development, as the cast grows to understand each other and their roles within the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think one of the main reasons Ted Lasso has been so popular during this pandemic is the absolute optimism both of the show and the lead character inspite of all the challenges thrown his way. It&amp;rsquo;s a kind of optimism we could all use in these trying times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Programming is hard, but anyone can be a programmer
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/programming-is-hard-but-anyone-can-be-a-programmer/</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 13 Apr 2021 05:25:58 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/programming-is-hard-but-anyone-can-be-a-programmer/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dorinlazar.ro/&#34;&gt;dorinlazar.ro&lt;/a&gt; talks about &lt;a href=&#34;https://dorinlazar.ro/2021-02-programming-is-hard/&#34;&gt;programming being hard&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most beginners in programming eventually end up with the same ingratiating message: „Programming is easy, everyone can do it”, with some threatening message that people doing the gatekeeping should stop doing that. I’m here to tell you that that is not true. Programming is hard, programming is not for everyone, and for the time being everyone might be able to do it, but most definitely most should not. Like most of the empty, shallow, positive messages coming with an automatic defense against refute, in this case talking about this gatekeeping thing that simply doesn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think gatekeeping is definitely a thing that happens. I should know, I used to hold the opinion that not everybody can be a programmer, because there are non-trivial skill sets that are necessary, such as attention to detail, ability to analyze and reason out possible outcomes, the ability to imagine abstractions in your head, and so on. Back when I did training for new hires, I could easily tell who are the people who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t pass, by simply noting who had trouble with things like SQL joins. (This was back in the day when we expected our devs to be able to handle everything from backend database stuff to web frontends with HTML/CSS/JS. I assume modern day frontend devs wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have much use for SQL usage&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, it&amp;rsquo;s not a hard gate, where someone can tell you it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to become a programmer. Anyone can be a programmer, in the same way that anyone can become an accountant or a lawyer or such: it&amp;rsquo;s going to take a nontrivial amount of effort and hard work (I&amp;rsquo;m not claiming that being a programmer is necessarily as difficult as those jobs!). Some people may make it look easy, because they may have a bit more aptitude than others (due to background or whatever), in the same way that some people find math easy and others find it nearly impossible. And a lot of the time it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to detect whether that aptitude exists until you&amp;rsquo;re trying it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also a huge difference between learning to code just to write a few scripts in Python or some macros in Excel vs working professionally as a programmer, possibly in a team, with serious deadlines and crunch and all that. Not everyone is suited to that life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m all for inclusivity - we definitely need more people working in tech, and for people who are struggling, learning to code may be a way for them to live better lives. But we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t sugarcoat the challenges involved or the effort required. &amp;ldquo;Anyone can learn to code&amp;rdquo;, given enough time and effort, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean programming is easy.&lt;/p&gt;

</title>

            <pubDate>Mon, 12 Apr 2021 04:55:06 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/without-their-permission-by-alexis-ohanian/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without Their Permission&lt;/em&gt; is a 2013 book by Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian. The central thesis of the book is that modern-day internet breaks down barriers and allows anyone to accomplish great things without having to go through traditional gatekeepers like publishers and such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually read the first part of the book a few years ago, and just resumed reading the book now because I saw in iBooks that it remembered where I had stopped. The first part covered mostly the author&amp;rsquo;s involvement in two successful startups - Reddit and Hipmunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle part of the book is dedicated to the central idea that &amp;ldquo;all links are created equal&amp;rdquo; and as long as you make something that other people want and make it accessible on the internet, success is possible. The author extols how the modern internet has made it easier for anyone to start something big, the same way he and his cofounder built Reddit. The funny thing for me is he cites a number of interesting startups that he&amp;rsquo;s invested in, but I&amp;rsquo;ve not heard of most of them, so presumably they didn&amp;rsquo;t actually succeed in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last part of the book covers the then-online community&amp;rsquo;s protests against the SOPA and PIPA bills, lobbyist-fueled IP protection laws that would have stifled the open internet, the precursor of the modern DMCA. While the defeats of SOPA and PIPA were early successes for online freedom, these days there are still other insidious challenges such as surveillance capitalism  and the deliberate spread of online misinformation and conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I don&amp;rsquo;t object to this central idea, I feel like it should be tempered with the fact that despite the open internet, success is still much harder than the book might portray it. And despite the waning power of traditional gatekeepers, these days there are online gatekeepers as well that can hinder your success. Online gatekeepers include App Store reviewers, closed platforms like facebook that have unclear moderation policies, censorship from governments, algorithms that decide what to surface to other people, and so on. It&amp;rsquo;s still probably better than the old days, but there are still a lot of challenges on the modern internet. To be fair, the book was released in 2013, which was a lifetime ago on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and Queen Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s husband, has passed away. So has DMX, American rapper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big facebook breach reported, etc. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like news, really. My &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1379404077319168000/&#34;&gt;phone number was among the data leaked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The country is still experiencing a surge in cases, hospitals and  ICUs still bursting to capacity. Yet in spite of the crisis, the president has not been around. This has prompted questions of whether he&amp;rsquo;s  still alive. This in turn prompted multiple proof-of-life photos and videos from the senator-who-is-also-presidential-assistant, some of which &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/News5PH/status/1380408229495119875&#34;&gt;may or may have been photoshopped&lt;/a&gt;. We are told he will make a public appearance Monday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of the president, it feels like an ABS-CBN reporter did more to defend our sovereignty vs China when &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/multimedia/slideshow/04/09/21/china-boat-chase-abscbn-news-team-chiara-zambrano&#34;&gt;they went to report on Chinese vessels near Ayungin Shoal and were harassed for their trouble&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After two weeks of ECQ, the NCR+ bubble is &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ABSCBNNews/status/1381142347489013761&#34;&gt;now placed under MECQ status until the end of the month&lt;/a&gt;. No, I have no idea what that means.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once again, the Philippines in the international news after &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/07/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-cases?#a-man-died-after-being-forced-to-do-300-squats-for-breaking-curfew-in-the-philippines&#34;&gt;a man died because he was made to do 300 squats for breaking curfew&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Wrestlemania weekend! And apparently it&amp;rsquo;s a two-night event this year. I don&amp;rsquo;t really follow WWE anymore, but I do often take the time to at least watch Wrestlemania and the Royal Rumble every year, so I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can get myself a copy somehow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;! My favorite sketch for this week is of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1379656430081351687/&#34;&gt;Akira Kazama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOdgfo7OaLI&#34;&gt;upcoming fighter&lt;/a&gt; in the Street Fighter V season 5 DLC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/first-sinovac-dose/&#34;&gt;got my first dose of Sinovac vaccine today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing the James Bond run with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/8fd56682f77942eb0badef9444d465a4/&#34;&gt;Diamonds are Forever (1971)&lt;/a&gt;, Connery&amp;rsquo;s last outing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt; was great, and those last 10 minutes were intense!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other than that, just the usual weekly shows, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday gaming group decided to pick up &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1075190/A_Game_of_Thrones_The_Board_Game__Digital_Edition/&#34;&gt;Game of Thrones The Boardgame on Steam!&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve played this one IRL before, only once, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t remember much. The digital version reminds me why: It&amp;rsquo;s super complicated! Our first game took two hours, I didn&amp;rsquo;t win. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have time for a second one since I had to get up early for the vaccine appointment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses still progressing very slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This month&amp;rsquo;s Humble Choice was revealed, and was meh for me, so I immediately paused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did get Days Gone via PS+ on PS4 though, I might actually play that one. Though they are also planning to give away Horizon Zero Dawn sometime this month, that might be a higher priority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Finished reading Alexis Ohanian&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Without-Their-Permission-Century-Managed/dp/1455520020&#34;&gt;Without Their Permission&lt;/a&gt;, will write a review soonish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our trivia group posted a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1379623251479908354/#comments&#34;&gt;new trivia video&lt;/a&gt;. Like and subscribe to the channel etc. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly just us playing games and trivia, having fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Falcon and Winter Soldier, Invincible, One Piece, etc&lt;/li&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;h3 id=&#34;the-on-site-process&#34;&gt;The on-site process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got my first shot of the Sinovac vaccine earlier today at Pinyahan Elementary School in Quezon City. My appointment was for 9am, I arrived on-site a bit before 8:30am. There was a short queue outside, so I waited there for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 9am, they called out for anyone booked for 9am and let us inside. They handed us health screening forms and waivers to fill up while we were queued up inside. So many steps!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;initial screening to verify your appointment and categorization (I was under A3 - person with comorbidity) and your QC residence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vitals check (temp and blood pressure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;second screening to&amp;hellip; review things again?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;third screening to check my patient id against the online registration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fourth screening to review medical conditions and hand me my vaccination card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(inside the vaccination room) one more screening to verify registration and some medical things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finally get the shot!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after the shot, go to another room for observation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they take your blood pressure first, then you have to wait for a bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every so often someone comes in to give a briefing about possible side effects and what to do for the second dose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every 20-30 mins, they call out who are the people who are cleared and can already go home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the shot a bit before 11am, and was done by 11:30am. All in all about 3 hours for me on site, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s only because they had to start late? I imagine if your time slot was 11am, it&amp;rsquo;d be a bit quicker for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing this around 3 hours after I got the shot, feeling fine, no apparent ill effects, though they said to monitor for up to 6 hours after the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly satisfied with how things were handled on-site, mostly because the past few days I&amp;rsquo;ve heard horror stories about chaos at some of the other sites, mostly because some sites allegedly allowed walk-ins. The staff at Pinyahan were handling things as well as could be expected, although the whole process felt a bit too redundant with all the checks. Here, when someone asked outside if walkins would be accepted, they were told that the doses available for the day were only those allocated for those who had booked online. Also, they did that annoying thing with the queues for people sitting in chairs where every few minutes you&amp;rsquo;d have to get up and scoot over to the next chair over, until you eventually got to the front of the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;online-registration-and-processes&#34;&gt;Online registration and processes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least the on-site process was a bit better than the online registration, which was kind of a disaster. Basically, early on they said vaccinations would be handled via their Quezon City ID initiative, so people should sign up for that. I applied for mine digitally, while the parents submitted paper forms to the barangay, since someone came around the subdivision surveying seniors who wanted to be registered. My QC ID was approved after a couple of weeks, but up to now still no word on my parents&amp;rsquo; QC ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime in March, they announced that there would be two ways to get vaccinated: one was to register via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.ezconsult.io/&#34;&gt;app.ezconsult.io&lt;/a&gt;, or if you had a QC ID, you could wait for the LGU/barangay personnel to process the lists and give you an appointment. Second option felt like it might take a while, so I went ahead and created an account for myself on ezconsult. My plan was to create an account for the parents after I&amp;rsquo;d seen the process, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to successfully book a vaccine appointment because apparently I had registered too early and the integration hadn&amp;rsquo;t been enabled yet??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, they announced ezconsult was available for everybody, so I proceeded and was able to book an appointment for april 27th, the earliest I had seen available. Weirdly, when I was searching for vaccination sites, it included sites in other cities like Las Pinas, who I assume also have an arrangement with ezconsult. I also created accounts for the parents and submitted them for review. When filling up the form expressing interest in vaccination, some of the fields still assumed you were a health worker, since this sytem was initially used for the A1 priority groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people online were reporting problems with the app saying the email was already taken; turns out they had batch imported some QC ID data and auto-created accounts for those people without informing them, so people had to reset passwords (something a nontechnical person wouldn&amp;rsquo;t think to try!). Since I had created my account before this import, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a problem. Then there also were reports of people being able to book vaccination schedules without being one of the currently allowed priority groups; apparently the site doesn&amp;rsquo;t validate for that. And because Sinovac, the only widely available vaccine in the country, was not advised for seniors, QC government had to advice seniors not to book yet since there were very few stocks of Astra Zeneca for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while my brother, who had previously registered the same slot as me on the 27th, mentioned he had been able to reschedule to an earlier slot, today at 9am. I was like, how did you do that? When I checked the app I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see any free time slots available earlier than the 27th. Checking online, a lot of people were reporting there were free slots, while others said they couldn&amp;rsquo;t see any, so I assume they were doing some kind of manual / batch updates to set free slots, I ended up having to check every few days. It was only last Thursday I was only able to reschedule my appointment to today. And at that time, my parent&amp;rsquo;s accounts were still under review!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then last Friday, the ezconsult app was down for most of the day for some reason. (So, I was lucky to rebook right before that!) Lots of complaints from people, of course. By Saturday morning they were back up, and thankfully, I found that my parents accounts&amp;rsquo; could now schedule an appointment! Except&amp;hellip; there were no slots available again! At this time, the QC government had to send out advisories telling people not to go if they weren&amp;rsquo;t among the priority groups, as apparently large numbers of such people were causing chaos at some of the sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in the queues earlier, I asked about the availability of AstraZeneca for seniors, but I was told they didn&amp;rsquo;t have any today and couldn&amp;rsquo;t say if it would be available until the day itself when they got their deliveries. A few days ago, the FDA had approved Sinovac for seniors, so the few senior citizens in the queues today were getting Sinovac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I got my shot, we were told by a doctor in the observation room that the system would send us an automated email about the schedule for the second shot, but we were told to DISREGARD IT and instead come back on the date specified at the back of the vaccination card. So, their automation wasn&amp;rsquo;t going well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I can&amp;rsquo;t really blame the developers of the app for all the problems, I can only imagine the rapid pace of changing requirements they were subjected to, especially with the flip-flopping on whether seniors could go, or comorbids could go, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully all of the problems are just growing pains and such, and that the systems and processes get better and clearer as time goes on, since we definitely to ramp up and scale up vaccination in this country! Not to mention, they also need to provide alternative methods of registration/scheduling for non-technical people (probably requires legwork by barangay officials), as right now the process is largely inaccessible to the poorer sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;During a recent session of spelunking through old web stuff, I managed to find some older versions of the blog that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t found before (and hence aren&amp;rsquo;t available in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/archives/ancient/&#34;&gt;ancient archives&lt;/a&gt;). Screenshots of those old versions have been &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2004/12/layouts-2004/&#34;&gt;inserted back in the timeline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it&amp;rsquo;s one of those things I never bothered to archive because in theory all of that content had already been exported from &lt;a href=&#34;https://roywantsmeat.blogspot.com&#34;&gt;Blogspot&lt;/a&gt; to Wordpress and eventually to the current site. But there was some content from this archive I hadn&amp;rsquo;t recovered before: the list of blogs I link to in the sidebar! This content was exported from Bloglines, an RSS reader service available at the time (Google Reader had yet to be invented!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of these old blogs no longer appear in my current follows. I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to look at each of them and see where they are in the current web, both as a look at the kinds of stuff I (used to) follow and as a commentary on how very few blogs last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;around-here&#34;&gt;around here&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is blogs of people who I knew to also be in the Philippines, though not all of them I knew personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the beautiful rookery&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a blog written by a batchmate of mine from HS, hosted on blogspot. The blogspot account apparently still exists, but you need to be invited to be able to access it, so IDK what&amp;rsquo;s going on there. I still follow the writer on social media like Insta.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Entertainment Capital of UP Village&lt;/strong&gt; - another HS batchmate, this blog was hosted on LiveJournal which means it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://zukeeper.livejournal.com/&#34;&gt;still accessible online&lt;/a&gt;! He hasn&amp;rsquo;t written anything there since 2015 though. We are still good friends and are in constant contact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sassy Lawyer&amp;rsquo;s Journal&lt;/strong&gt; - this was the blog of a female lawyer in Metro Manila; IDK who it was, and the site is no longer accessible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sachachua&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/strong&gt; - I didn&amp;rsquo;t know Sacha personally, although I knew some of her batchmates. Her url is still active and redirects to her &lt;a href=&#34;https://sachachua.com/blog/&#34;&gt;current blog&lt;/a&gt;, where she writes mostly about Emacs stuff, something she&amp;rsquo;s been doing since 2004 apparently, so that&amp;rsquo;s a bit of dedication there. I think she also used to write about some productivity stuff, but I stopped following her when she started focusing mostly on Emacs, since that&amp;rsquo;s not an interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the babel machine&lt;/strong&gt; - hosted on blogspot and written by a guy called Joey Alarilla. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I knew him personally. He wrote mostly about games and tech and such. The blogspot site is no longer accessible. Looks like he moved to a wordpress site in 2006 and to a personal domain in 2009, but neither are accessible now. He founded a digital media startup called &lt;a href=&#34;https://digitallifeasia.com/&#34;&gt;Digital Life Asia&lt;/a&gt; and I found him &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/joeyalarilla&#34;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clair&amp;rsquo;s Tech Blog&lt;/strong&gt; - I knew Clair from HS, though we weren&amp;rsquo;t batchmates. She used to write about Linux, Emacs, tech, blogging, etc. Her site is no longer available, but I still follow her on Insta. She does art stuff on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/claircolors/&#34;&gt;public instagram&lt;/a&gt; and takes commissions, if that&amp;rsquo;s your thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;general-purpose&#34;&gt;general purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waxy Links&lt;/strong&gt; - by Andy Baio. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://waxy.org/category/links/&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt; to this day and still on my follows!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J-Walk Blog&lt;/strong&gt; - by John Walkenbach, well-known for his Excel knowledge. His blog was &amp;ldquo;all sorts of things&amp;rdquo; kind of blog, and he was prolific, blogging daily. Looks like he &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bitsandpieces.us/2011/10/14/the-end-of-an-era/&#34;&gt;stopped blogging in 2011&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://j-walkblog.com/&#34;&gt;domain is still up&lt;/a&gt;, but IDK if it&amp;rsquo;s still by the same person - the posts seem like the sort of thing I&amp;rsquo;d expect to find in like copy-paste blogs out to earn money from advertising. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any social media presence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boing Boing&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://boingboing.net/&#34;&gt;Boing Boing&lt;/a&gt; is still up, but no longer written primarily by Cory Doctorow I think. Doctorow now writes a new daily blog on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pluralistic.net/&#34;&gt;Pluralistic&lt;/a&gt; and is still one of my follows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tech-blogs&#34;&gt;tech blogs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Daily WTF: The Daily WTF&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a blog that highlighted one programmer&amp;rsquo;s mistakes every day, some of them were funny. &lt;a href=&#34;https://thedailywtf.com/&#34;&gt;The site is still up&lt;/a&gt;! I think I stopped following them a while ago because I kind of lost interest in that kind of thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Blog&lt;/strong&gt; - I think this blog used to cover mostly Google&amp;rsquo;s tech and engineering stuff. The site is still up at &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.google/&#34;&gt;a slightly different URL&lt;/a&gt;, but because of how much stuff Google is into now, it feels like many of their posts aren&amp;rsquo;t of interest to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joel on Software&lt;/strong&gt; - Joel wrote a lot about running a software company back in the day, and his writing certainly influenced a lot of the dev culture at the time (for better or for worse?). His &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt;, but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t post very often these days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ned Batchelder&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/strong&gt; - Ned wrote about tech / programming stuff; his &lt;a href=&#34;https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/&#34;&gt;blog is still up&lt;/a&gt; (and still has roughly the same layout!). I still follow him and he mostly writes about Python these days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scobleizer: Microsoft Geek Blogger&lt;/strong&gt; - Robert Scoble was a tech evangelist for Microsoft I believe. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I followed him for too long, as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t super interested in Microsoft tech stuff back then. A few years ago he was embroiled in a #MeToo controversy and apparently no longer has a social media presence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;interesting-blogs&#34;&gt;interesting blogs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Troutgirl&lt;/strong&gt; - Troutgirl worked in the tech industry, but her blog was a combination of tech stuff, industry stuff and other nontech things. At some point she moved from her own domain to &lt;a href=&#34;https://troutgirl.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;a Wordpress blog&lt;/a&gt;, which is now only sporadically updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ButtUgly&lt;/strong&gt; - ButtUgly is a Finnish blogger who ran his blog on JSPWiki. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecyrd.com/ButtUgly&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt; but the last post is from 2017.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Section&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a blog by Ole Eichhorn, who was very prolific, multiple posts a day, posts whatever interesting things he find, that kind of thing. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://w-uh.com/&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt; and regularly updated and even has the exact same layout!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extraordinary Ordinary Guy In Japan&lt;/strong&gt; - this is a well-written English blog by a Tokyo native. I guess I followed him for more exposure to Japanese culture. It looks like he stopped blogging in 2004. The site &lt;a href=&#34;https://xogij.blogs.com/xogij/&#34;&gt;is still up&lt;/a&gt;, but the actual post contents don&amp;rsquo;t seem to load, I can only see sidebars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gapingvoid&lt;/strong&gt; - a blog by Hugh MacLeod who got some traction back then for drawing cartoons on the back of business cards. He is the source of one of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/3ac092f01e360750d83d1beb1112efa0/&#34;&gt;my favorite quotes&lt;/a&gt;. His domain currently resolves to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gapingvoid.com/&#34;&gt;company site&lt;/a&gt;, where he is listed under the staff. It looks like &lt;a href=&#34;https://thejerusalemseries.com/&#34;&gt;he&amp;rsquo;s writing elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MarkTAW&lt;/strong&gt; - Mark blogged about a variety of topics including economics, psychology, marketing, music, etc. For some reason his domain now redirects to Amazon. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any instance of him writing elsewhere recently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WIL WHEATON dot NET&lt;/strong&gt; - Wil Wheaton is of course of Star Trek fame. Followed him mostly for interesting showbiz-adjacent stories. I believe I kept following him until recently during the Trump era, when his content started becoming mostly about anti-Trump rants. That content is fine with me, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t subscribe to it. His site is still up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neil Gaiman&amp;rsquo;s Journal&lt;/strong&gt; - Gaiman is of course a well-known fantasy writer, even back then. He&amp;rsquo;s still &lt;a href=&#34;https://journal.neilgaiman.com/&#34;&gt;journalling regularly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GELATOMETTI&lt;/strong&gt; - I think this guy was some kind of comic book artist. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://gelatometti.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;blogspot site&lt;/a&gt; is still up, but the content seems different from what the internet archive has, and hasn&amp;rsquo;t been updated since 2005.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fishbowl&lt;/strong&gt; - Another blog by a dev, writing mostly about dev stuff. &lt;a href=&#34;https://fishbowl.pastiche.org/&#34;&gt;The site is still up&lt;/a&gt; and is still being updated. Not sure why I&amp;rsquo;m no longer following his blog, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really subscribe to blogs with mostly dev content anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GirlHacker&amp;rsquo;s Random Log&lt;/strong&gt; - she works in tech, but her blog is more general purpose, things of interest stuff. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.girlhacker.com/&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt;, but she hasn&amp;rsquo;t posted there since 2014.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in my mind&amp;rsquo;s zen garden&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a blog by a guy called randomguru on a site called RiceBowlJournals, which was kind of like a community for Asian blogs. Both sites are no longer accessible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kottke&lt;/strong&gt; - kottke.org is still up and running and going strong, still blogging after all these years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tricks of the Trade&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a weblog that posted tips and tricks for different professions. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it lasted very long. The domain currently returns an error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s actually a few more categories in the blogroll there, but they&amp;rsquo;re mostly gaming related, lifehacks stuff, or webcomics. And this post is fairly long already. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to them in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of old blogs from that blogroll that are still active is actually more than I expected! Though still a lot of them that are dead or inactive now, which says a lot about how pervasive &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/link-rot/&#34;&gt;link rot&lt;/a&gt; is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should make sure to archive a present-day version of my current blogroll and check those sites out around a decade from now, at which time I would hopefully still be blogging!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Book Reviews: Guards! Guards! and Men at Arms by Terry Pratchett

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/book-reviews-guards-guards-and-men-at-arms-by-terry-pratchett/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;So after reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/neuromancer/&#34;&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/a&gt; last month, I was looking for a bit of lighter fare, so I decided to work on some Discworld books and started with the first book of the City Watch subseries, &lt;em&gt;Guards! Guards!&lt;/em&gt;. I was already quite a bit in when I was like &amp;ldquo;why does all of this seem so familiar? Are Discworld books really so same-y that it feels like I&amp;rsquo;ve read this before?&amp;rdquo; The good news is that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t true, Discworld books aren&amp;rsquo;t super-samey; I have read it before, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/12/805050532834353152/&#34;&gt;way back in 2016&lt;/a&gt; in fact. And I also found out that I had &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/08/equal-rites/&#34;&gt;done this in 2016 with another Discworld book as well&lt;/a&gt;! Ok, so I guess that means they are a bit same-y, but on the other hand I am getting better at retention because I actually recognized it this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I went ahead and completed the re-read and proceeded to the next City Watch book, &lt;em&gt;Men at Arms&lt;/em&gt;. And this one was totally new to me, for sure. So, this is a bit of a double review. And maybe a review of the Discworld series as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Guards! Guards!&lt;/em&gt; we get Pratchett&amp;rsquo;s treatment of common fantasy tropes such as dwarves, dragons that can&amp;rsquo;t possibly be flying, and unknown heroes becoming king by slaying evil dragons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have the effrontery to be squeamish, it thought at him. But we were dragons. We were supposed to be cruel, cunning, heartless, and terrible. But this much I can tell you, you ape—the great face pressed even closer, so that Wonse was staring into the pitiless depths of his eyes—we never burned and tortured and ripped one another apart and called it morality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Terry Pratchett, &lt;em&gt;Guards! Guards!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Men at Arms&lt;/em&gt;, Pratchett expands on the cast of the City Watch subseries, explores the guild structure of the city of Ankh Morpork, and expands the lore of races such as dwarves and trolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.
But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that’d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years’ time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.
This was the Captain Samuel Vimes “Boots” theory of socioeconomic unfairness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Terry Pratchett, &lt;em&gt;Men at Arms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yes, the Discworld books are maybe kind of same-y, but that&amp;rsquo;s kind of a good thing? You usually know what to expect. They&amp;rsquo;re light reading, they&amp;rsquo;re funny in a dry British humor kind of way, and Pratchett likes to attack and parody and deconstruct common fantasy tropes. I like the books, despite their sameyness, although I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;ll ever be able to work my way through the entire series.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s April! Or as it&amp;rsquo;s otherwise known, March 2020 month 13. As is usual, we are suffering the sweltering summer heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it&amp;rsquo;s Easter Sunday, if that means anything to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surprising almost no one, the PH government extended the ECQ lockdown in the NCR+ bubble. Anyone with half a brain could have told you that the one week ECQ was no way going to be enough, given what we know about the virus&amp;rsquo; life cycle. Meanwhile, we continued to hit record numbers of new cases, our 7-day rolling average now the highest in SEA since the pandemic began. It&amp;rsquo;s like we&amp;rsquo;re in the same situation we were in last year, except the numbers are much, much higher. And yet our leadership is like &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/inquirerdotnet/status/1377810270500790274&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not so bad, even France has lockdowns!&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Sigh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Austin Kleon reminds us that we all need &lt;a href=&#34;https://austinkleon.com/2018/01/19/something-to-look-forward-to/&#34;&gt;something to look forward to&lt;/a&gt;. (Arbitrary stupid goals!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was fascinated by this &lt;a href=&#34;https://theconversation.com/the-man-with-no-plot-how-i-watched-lee-child-write-a-jack-reacher-novel-51220&#34;&gt;article about how Lee Child writes Jack Reacher novels on the fly&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because that seems like the sort of &amp;ldquo;less work&amp;rdquo; approach I&amp;rsquo;d prefer when writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a curiosity: &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law&#34;&gt;Benford&amp;rsquo;s Law&lt;/a&gt;, or the law of anomalous numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://newrepublic.com/article/161106/defense-nothing&#34;&gt;In defense of doing nothing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent a long time working with Java projects, so &lt;a href=&#34;https://advancedweb.hu/a-categorized-list-of-all-java-and-jvm-features-since-jdk-8-to-16/&#34;&gt;this long list of new features from Java 8 to 16&lt;/a&gt; was interesting to me. After reading this, I asked my old workmates what version of Java they were now using, and they were still on Java 8, the same version as when I left there 6 years ago! Time flows differently in the enterprise universe I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My friends were amazed I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-1Ue0FFrHY&#34;&gt;Long, Long Man japanese commercials&lt;/a&gt; before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Peu6lw0nido&#34;&gt;this case study by Elsa Charretier of a Hawkeye comic book panel by David Aja&lt;/a&gt;. Probably helpful in my own sketching! Subscribed to her channel as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sony announced that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-store-shut-down-ps3-vita-psp&#34;&gt;they will be shutting down the PS3, Vita and PSP stores&lt;/a&gt;. End of an era really. A lot of people are complaining about content that will be forever lost, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure that there are people working to archive this stuff and make it available through other means. &lt;em&gt;Wink wink&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a person with comorbidities (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2005/05/hypertension/&#34;&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;), I&amp;rsquo;m in vaccine priority group A3, right after senior citizens (A2s). And since the stock of AstraZeneca is limited, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/QCGov/status/1377997094431129606&#34;&gt;QC is now allowing A3s to go ahead of A2s&lt;/a&gt;, so I was able to book a vaccine appointment on the 27th. Its a ways off, but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that means they&amp;rsquo;ve learned to streamline their on-site processes by then, so hopefully things go smoothly. It&amp;rsquo;s weird to have booked a schedule even before the more at-risk parents though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a bid to minimize having to go outside, we decided to try ordering groceries online via &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.metromart.com/&#34;&gt;Metromart&lt;/a&gt;. The first-time experience wasn&amp;rsquo;t great; we had to buy from a different grocery (since our usual one wasn&amp;rsquo;t available), not all the regular items we needed were there, and some items were way more expensive. And worst of all, I ordered Tostitos cheese dip and they bought spinach dip instead!! The weird thing is, there were some other items that were out of stock that they called me about (even though I explicitly set that if there were missing items, just don&amp;rsquo;t buy them??), yet for the dip, they just went ahead and bought a different flavor. I ended up having a long convo with their customer support about how disappointed I was, and somehow despite saying there&amp;rsquo;s nothing they could do, they later ended up offering me P100 store credit as compensation. I guess it will be useful if ever we decide to try this again. Anyway, we ended up doing a supplementary grocery run yesterday to cover the items the online delivery didn&amp;rsquo;t get (and the cheese dip!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only one movie watched this week, continuing the James Bond run: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1a1ab3ad610478ba3b672b0a89c26333/&#34;&gt;On Her Majesty&amp;rsquo;s Secret Service (1969)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supergirl&lt;/strong&gt; has started up again, carrying over baggage from the cut-short previous season, same as Flash. The writing was marginally better though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt; was pretty good, though I still found Wandavision more exciting overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tried grinding to Master Rank in Eternal on the last day of the month, but I ran out of time with half a level to go. Sigh. Arena I didn&amp;rsquo;t even bother and ended the month in platinum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a couple of Civ6 games, mostly achievement hunting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a bit more &lt;strong&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/strong&gt;, now down to 1 achievement remaining, but it requires going through all the secret levels, I think?? That might take a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s multiplayer games with friends: Blood Rage, Sentinels of the Multiverse, Root, and Orcs Must Die 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Finished reading Discworld&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Men at Arms!&lt;/strong&gt;, maybe I can write book review(s) this week. Need to find a new book to read, probably a nonfiction one this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was the second Holy Week in a row where we were just stuck at home all day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Falcon and Winter Soldier, Invincible, One Piece, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the last weekend of March. It feels like the month went by quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local covid response: The government introduced the concept of an &amp;ldquo;NCR Plus&amp;rdquo; bubble last Monday, restricting travel in and out of the NCR and adjacent provinces, in response to the rising cases. Still, the daily counts kept rising, hitting record highs of almost 10k cases daily. Even before the dust has settled on the bubble response, they decided to announce last night a reversion to the stricter ECQ. Shades of last year, during the run up to the first lockdown announcement: rumors circulated via chat groups about the impending lockdown before the government finally made their announcement. As can be expected, memes quickly circulated about how we came back to ECQ more than a year after the first lockdown. The lockdown is imposed only for one week, during the Holy Week period, presumably to take advantage of the two holidays in the week to minimize economic impact. The fact that they imposed two different levels of responses one after another &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1375737016407625729/&#34;&gt;reeks of poor planning and analysis&lt;/a&gt;, as if they were just making all this up as they go along, which might not be far from the truth. What happens if the case counts continue to rise until next Sunday?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a bit of economically-devastating-yet-unintentionally-hilarious world news: a very large container ship, the MV EVER GIVEN, ran aground in the Suez Canal, blocking passage, and has been stuck there since Tuesday-ish, clogging up global shipping trade through the canal. Apparently losses are at the order of $400M per hour or something? IDK, I&amp;rsquo;m not an economist. All I&amp;rsquo;m sure of is the internet almost immediately produced a &lt;a href=&#34;https://nypost.com/2021/03/25/the-best-suez-canal-memes-the-stuck-ship-ever-given-inspired/&#34;&gt;bunch of memes&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=&#34;https://jezebel.com/yes-people-are-writing-horny-fanfic-about-the-suez-can-1846562940&#34;&gt;horny fanfic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read this interesting post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.ayjay.org/blogging-and-the-blogosphere/&#34;&gt;blogging and the blogosphere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something that interested me mostly for trivia purposes: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nme.com/photos/30-covers-that-are-better-than-the-originals-1405281&#34;&gt;30 covers that are better than the originals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Paul Graham reminds us to &lt;a href=&#34;http://paulgraham.com/simply.html&#34;&gt;write simply&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Sketching, sketching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing my run on the Bond movies with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/fb71576d1974213ea471b5cda8a20948/&#34;&gt;You Only Live Twice (1967)&lt;/a&gt;. Secret volcano lair!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also managed to convince myself to sit down and watch &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/snyder-cut/&#34;&gt;Zack Snyder&amp;rsquo;s Justice League&lt;/a&gt;. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t manage to sit down for four hours straight, so it was two sittings over two days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second episode of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier last Friday. Still a bit meh, mostly because there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been anything I haven&amp;rsquo;t expected yet. But that&amp;rsquo;s bound to change as I think all the content from the trailers have been shown by now. Some good acting by Sebastian Sean though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finished watching &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek The Animated Series&lt;/strong&gt;, Star Trek TV series completion!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First 3 episodes &lt;strong&gt;Invincible&lt;/strong&gt; have dropped on Prime Video. Most of the first episode is good, clean superhero fun, but by the end of the episode you are dissuaded of that notion. Pretty good pacing, seems mostly accurate to the source material, looking forward to the rest of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also been rewatching The Office as my background watching, mostly because I listened to a podcast of Office trivia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run: Still ongoing, somehow. It feels like I&amp;rsquo;m doing these in real time, only advancing one week of the game per week of real life. At that rate, I should be done in like six months lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After five years of playing Street Fighter V, I managed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1374367400276025345/&#34;&gt;dig myself out of the pits of the bronze ranks and hit silver&lt;/a&gt;! Surprisingly, on the next two days after this, I had trouble finding ranked matches again. I took that as a sign to take a break before attempting to climb up to gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final Civ6 NFP drop came out as expected. Not super hyped, but I have started a Portugal game already, they seem really strong especially on island maps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strixhaven official previews kicked off, and I&amp;rsquo;m really hyped for the set, mostly because I really &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1375147827110629379/&#34;&gt;like the Mystical Archive cards&lt;/a&gt;. Collecting all of them on Arena is gonna be a challenge though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supposedly Magic Arena is now available &amp;ldquo;everywhere&amp;rdquo; on mobile, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/mdf9dp/androidios_versions_not_available_in_southeast/&#34;&gt;not in Southeast Asia though&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; I mentioned last week that I started reading the Discworld book &amp;ldquo;Guards! Guards!&amp;rdquo;, but for some reason everything seemed so familiar, and soon I realized it was because I had &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/12/805050532834353152/&#34;&gt;already read it back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Doh! I was enjoying it anyway, so I finished the re-read and will probably publish a review, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have one in 2016. But I&amp;rsquo;ll finish the next City Watch book first: Men at Arms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AboutQuiz this week a bit better than last week, but I still miss the other trivia groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1374212757189369861/&#34;&gt;I hit the 800-day streak on Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New FatWS episode, etc etc. I presume new Invincible episode as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe the world will miraculously be better next week? IDK, one can always hope right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Holy Week! Normally a big deal for the RC faithful in this country, but this time everyone has to stay at home for the second year in a row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ECQ! Well, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect me much, though there are now some errands that we have to push back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;See also: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2017/11/931540341919965184/&#34;&gt;Justice League spoiler-free review (2017)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is basically a movie that&amp;rsquo;s more than 3 years old, we&amp;rsquo;re not holding back on spoilers here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plot basically follows the same beats as the theatrical cut&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;except this time we have a lot more team setup time (one of my criticisms from the previous version), giving the characters stronger backgrounds, especially Cyborg and Flash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ray Fisher was right to complain; in this version he&amp;rsquo;s one of the important characters of the ensemble while he was basically a minor guest character in the theatrical cut&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more DC characters make appearances in this version, among them Ryan Choi, DeSaad, Granny Goodness, Martian Manhunter, the Joker and of course Darkseid himself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I accept this version as a better version of the original theatrical release and is my new DCEU headcanon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it never would have worked in theaters anyway, given the four hour runtime. Maybe if they split it into two movies&amp;hellip; (and I actually did take two sittings to watch this one!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anyway, this version does a much better job of setting up any succeeding movies, including the upcoming Flash movie (although I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the changes cause any continuity issues with the 2019 Aquaman movie&amp;hellip; not that the DCEU cares too much about continuity anyway&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over the past couple of days, our nationwide daily covid cases broke 7000+, the highest recorded so far.  Have to be super careful when going out for errands. Not that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t being careful even before, mind you. Just now, government has announced we are still under GCQ (see my post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1373562580375986178/&#34;&gt;the PH quarantine levels&lt;/a&gt;), but with more restrictions, etc. Looks like they are still hesitant to provide a stronger lockdown which would require paying people to stay home so they don&amp;rsquo;t starve to death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.protocol.com/internet-archive-preserving-future&#34;&gt;The internet is splitting apart. The Internet Archive wants to save it all forever. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/01/checklist-achievements-happiness-boxes/617756/&#34;&gt;Stop Keeping Score&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also could&amp;rsquo;ve sworn there was a bunch of funny stuff I read on Twitter this week that I can&amp;rsquo;t find anymore. I need to get better at marking/sharing things I find funny or interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Sketching, sketching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing my run on the Bond movies with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/273eae12d668c24135d4db358511c9d4/&#34;&gt;Goldfinger (1964)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/c6152994fa5ddf4b9c3302bcddfdd699/&#34;&gt;Thunderall (1965)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I keep threatening to watch the Snyder Cut, but have yet to find a four hour block of time to do it. FOUR HOURS!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, I watched the first episode of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Kind of meh, though I appreciate the emotional angles they&amp;rsquo;re going for. Might have been more hyped if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware a certain character was going to be introduced in this series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finished watching &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;, now almost through the Animated Series. Almost to Star Trek TV series completion!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run: Still ongoing, somehow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to play Valkyria Chronicles 4 on Steam since I got it from Humble Choice, but since I&amp;rsquo;m still in the middle of a Fire Emblem run I keep putting it off. It feels weird to have two anime-styled tactical RPGs running at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I actually managed to finish a run of &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127610/Iris_and_the_Giant/&#34;&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/a&gt;! I still have a few more achievements to get, then I&amp;rsquo;ll probably write a review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually managed to play a fair bit of Street Fighter V over the past week, after getting inspired by watching some Justin Wong videos. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve found the sweet spot / happy hour for actually finding matches where I am, so here&amp;rsquo;s hoping to play more moving forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Finished reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/neuromancer/&#34;&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/a&gt;. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d follow it up with some lighter reading, so I got started on a Discworld book: &amp;ldquo;Guards! Guards!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/2021-site-update/&#34;&gt;Site changes applied!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We did an AboutQuiz this week, but it was terrible (for our team at the very least). I&amp;rsquo;m hoping the more mainstream pop culture trivia quizzes like PopQuiz and Geekfight come back some time soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe (could be wrong) that the Invincible animated series is coming out on Prime Video at the end of the week. I read a fair bit of the comic, though I don&amp;rsquo;t remember much of the later parts, so I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to this. I feel like JK Simmons as the protag&amp;rsquo;s dad is going to turn out to be a great casting decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;final drop in the Civ6 New Frontier pass, with new Civ Portugal, is coming out this week. I&amp;rsquo;m not very hyped for it, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy the recent barbarian update too much, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll give it a go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Falcon and Winter Soldier etc etc. WandaVision really got going by the end of episode 3, but FatWS is only 2/3rds as many episodes, so I assume important things are gonna be happening in episode 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>2021 Site Update
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/2021-site-update/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2021 07:18:03 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/2021-site-update/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of weeks or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve made quite a few changes to the site, mostly focused on frontend/layout/UI changes. The changes are more or less done, so here&amp;rsquo;s a changelog entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main driver of the changes was this post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://seirdy.one/2020/11/23/website-best-practices.html&#34;&gt;best practices for text websites&lt;/a&gt;. Not all of it applies to the site, since I do have a bunch of image content around as well, but enough that I was spurred to apply many of the points and also include some additional changes I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do. Secondary objectives include: improving site performance, accessibility, and code output; and hopefully making the site menus more organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layout changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplified top header content. V-card and some other stuff moved to the footer. Merged &amp;ldquo;Blog&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Notes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Links&amp;rdquo; into &amp;ldquo;Posts&amp;rdquo; for shorter menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed sidebar. Most of the sidebar links for my own use/benefit anyway, and not for the potential blog reader. Most of the content has been moved into the home page, footer, and the new explore page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added submenus to most listing pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standardize display of page title/description where possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added support for &amp;ldquo;prefers-color-scheme: light&amp;rdquo;. I still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/4d1fb5fa3502d4df0ff4f70f9891a7c3/&#34;&gt;default to dark mode&lt;/a&gt; though!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switched to a monospace font. Honestly I find it hard to decide whether I like monospace or sans-serif more, but let&amp;rsquo;s go with this for now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaned up/reduced the meta info at the bottom of each post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Client-side performance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;full-size images are now set to lazy load, so the browser doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to download them all immediately for example when &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook&#34;&gt;viewing an album&lt;/a&gt;. Only the thumbnails are loaded immediately, full-size images are shown only when activating &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/hugo-lightbox/&#34;&gt;the lightbox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;featured image for blog posts now use a thumbnail when shown in list view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also wanted to improve &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.webbloatscore.com/&#34;&gt;the WebBloat score&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s currently fine for text-heavy blog posts, but I guess I can&amp;rsquo;t avoid a higher score for image-heavy content since the crawler they use ignores the fact that I lazy load the full-size images and they are initially hidden. Something to consider in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new front/home page with content samplers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;added &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/explore&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Explore&amp;rdquo; page&lt;/a&gt; where I can put links that don&amp;rsquo;t belong in any of the submenus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improved &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/now&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now&amp;rdquo; page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cleaned up some out of date stuff in the About pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use profile photo as favicon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backend/code changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML Validation: Most pages should now validate without warnings/errors on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://validator.w3.org/nu&#34;&gt;W3C HTML validator&lt;/a&gt;. There was actually a lot of broken HTML I had to fix (due to me mistyping things and so on.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made sure most images had alt-text, even if just default values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Score of 75/100 on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/roytang.net&#34;&gt;Mozilla Observatory&lt;/a&gt;. It was at 20/100 before. The only thing I hadn&amp;rsquo;t implemented yet was the Content Security Policy (CSP) header, as it would have caused some issues on certain pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also tried to generally reduce the page weight, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually that high before, so I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s any measurable change there. Minifying HTML/CSS was a possibility, but that just makes it harder for me to debug things, and really feels like something too serious for a hobby site like this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripts and cookies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the site already uses minimal JS in a few places: there&amp;rsquo;s a captcha for comments, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/locations&#34;&gt;locations page&lt;/a&gt; requires JS, and some of the stat pages load data remotely via JS, but that should be it. 99% of the pages of the site should be JS free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also don&amp;rsquo;t use any cookies myself. But I do have Cloudflare enabled on the site, and they do add a &lt;code&gt;__cfduid&lt;/code&gt; cookie, supposedly to detect bots. This &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.cloudflare.com/deprecating-cfduid-cookie/&#34;&gt;cookie is being deprecated by May 2021&lt;/a&gt; though, so by then the site should be cookie-free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should be it! I had some other features in mind to implement (never ending scope creep when you have a personal project really), but I&amp;rsquo;ve already spent too much time on this and need to work on my other shenanigans as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing: attaching some images so that I can compare to the future look of the website:&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Book Review: Neuromancer by William Gibson
</title>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It took me more than three weeks to get through Gibson&amp;rsquo;s influential work Neuromancer, a book that pioneered the cyberpunk genre and even introduced terms like cyberspace, ICE and &amp;ldquo;the matrix&amp;rdquo; into popular lexicon. It&amp;rsquo;s not because the book is bad or anything, it&amp;rsquo;s just that Gibson tends to describe everything very vividly, and almost all of it from the POV of our lead character Case, who is sometimes in the real world, sometimes in cyberspace, and sometimes simply just drunk or high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself taking time with each scene to visualize where Case was and what was going on. In later parts of the book, it became even more complicated because Case gained the ability to see the world from the POV of his ally, the cybergirl Molly. So for many chapters the POV would consistently shift between Case in the real world, Case in cyberspace, Case looking through Molly&amp;rsquo;s eyes, and so on. Some of it even takes place in space / low-gravity scenarios, so the perspectives being described can be challenging to imagine. Throw in a lot of high-tech / near-future slang and Rastafarian accents and it can make for a challenging read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made it to the end, somehow, though every step of the way I doubted whether I understood what was really going on. In fact, I had to read a plot summary afterwards to confirm that yes, I did in fact understand the story and I was not being dumb. Hard to tell without spoiling anything, but it&amp;rsquo;s really the sort of thing you&amp;rsquo;d expect from a cyberpunk story anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did enjoy the book, though I suspect I would have liked it more as a movie, as that would have been easier to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Alignment Shift: No Longer Lawful
</title>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;When I was much younger, I used to strongly identify as &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2008/02/im-lawful-good/&#34;&gt;Lawful Good&lt;/a&gt;. Whenever I&amp;rsquo;d play any of the old-school DND RPGs like Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate or Neverwinter Nights, I&amp;rsquo;d find my main character almost always being a Lawful Good Paladin goody-goody type. This was back when I was younger and more idealistic and a stronger believer in &amp;ldquo;rule of law&amp;rdquo;-type principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the years have gone by, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that my alignment has shifted considerably. Part of it is a strong disillusionment with the &amp;ldquo;law&amp;rdquo; part of lawful. As I&amp;rsquo;ve become more immersed with events in my country and the world, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that adherence to law and order isn&amp;rsquo;t always in the best interest of people or society. The imperfect men implementing the laws can always be corrupted or can find ways to abuse or circumvent the law, while staying within the purview of legality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even in the ideal case where a society is able to consistently &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/11/laws-not-men/&#34;&gt;apply the laws over the whims of men&lt;/a&gt;, the laws in place can still be disadvantageous to the progress or greater good of society. Laws in place have a tendency to be used to preserve the status quo, which in many cases means reinforcing inequality or imbalanced power structures, favoring the entrenched and the elite over the greater majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still largely advocate for following the law and obeying the authorities, but only where it makes sense. In order for society to progress, we must be willing to shake off old norms and challenge the law and authorities where applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original online alignment quiz is no longer available on the current Wizards/DND site, but there are some that have &lt;a href=&#34;http://easydamus.com/alignmenttest.html&#34;&gt;replicated it elsehwere&lt;/a&gt;. I recently took it again to confirm what I&amp;rsquo;ve know for a few years now (image result attached). My current alignment is &lt;strong&gt;Neutral Good&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://easydamus.com/lawfulgood.html&#34;&gt;Description of Lawful Good&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.easydamus.com/neutralgood.html&#34;&gt;Description of Neutral Good&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DND Alignment system is of course an imperfect and vastly oversimplified method of ascertaining one&amp;rsquo;s personality (after all, very few people would openly accept being called &amp;ldquo;Evil&amp;rdquo; on this scale), but I find it can sometimes be helpful as an abstraction of a person&amp;rsquo;s general outlook on life, as long as you know the model&amp;rsquo;s limitations. Individual moments or actions of course, are not obliged to follow one&amp;rsquo;s given alignment, and as it can see here, alignment can easily shift over time. The alignment system is probably roughly as useful as Myers-Briggs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Happy Pi Day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the one year anniversary of the world&amp;rsquo;s longest lockdown. In some kind of sick anniversary celebration, local covid cases are on the rise. Yesterday, 5000 new cases were reported, the highest daily rate in 6 months or so. And now a Philippine variant has been detected. Now is not the time to be complacent, we all need to be more careful. The government seems unwilling to impose another widespread ECQ and are focusing on targetted, granular lockdowns. Not sure how effective this would be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://seirdy.one/2020/11/23/website-best-practices.html&#34;&gt;An opinionated list of best practices for textual websites&lt;/a&gt;. Reading this reminded me there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of updates to this website I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bikobatanari.neocities.org/posts/2020/personal-museum.html&#34;&gt;My Website is a Personal Museum: the creative freedom we lost in the age of social media&lt;/a&gt;. This article, and the referenced &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/&#34;&gt;How the Blog Broke The Web&lt;/a&gt; are nostalgic for the days of curated homepages instead of blogs/social media platforms characterized by chronological feeds. Taking these into account as I consider how to reorganize the content on this website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/19/can-not-quit-facebook/&#34;&gt;Facebook invested heavily in the one feature it knew people couldn’t leave behind: Their groups&lt;/a&gt;. It kind of feels like an opportunity for a new contender to sneak in and develop a better social media platform that&amp;rsquo;s group-centered. Yahoo Groups provided this service in the 00s, but Yahoo being Yahoo, they screwed it up and YG had to close up last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/KimsConvenience/status/1369013822145576964&#34;&gt;Kim&amp;rsquo;s Convenience has been cancelled&lt;/a&gt;. I liked &lt;a href=&#34;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/kims-convenience-the-end-of-the-dream&#34;&gt;Noahpinion&amp;rsquo;s writeup about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;, not missing a beat apparently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in the final season of &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also started reading up on the show&amp;rsquo;s reception, which apparently wasn&amp;rsquo;t great, especially compared to the other Trek shows it succeeded. Not surprising, but the show isn&amp;rsquo;t that bad, really. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of doing a blog post reviewing all the Trek shows, but I should probably watch The Animated Series first for completion purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a long time now I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to watch the old pre-Brosnan Bond movies, which I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen. Maybe mostly for trivia purposes. I got started on this last week with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/2b14f8356f57460da0a4790b27b44b8a/&#34;&gt;Dr No (1962)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/096b7c67797c165b01283d0c7cd6c016/&#34;&gt;From Russia With Love (1963)&lt;/a&gt;. Side note: I&amp;rsquo;m a bit amazed about how they&amp;rsquo;re able to do a sequel based on the success of the previous film in just a year. Modern day Hollywood films cost so much and are so complicated the typical spacing for sequels is at least three years. Next is Goldfinger!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run: Such slow progress, but progress nonetheless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still trying to finish &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127610/Iris_and_the_Giant/&#34;&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Still very slowly reading cyberpunk classic &lt;em&gt;Neurmancer&lt;/em&gt; by William Gibson. I&amp;rsquo;m about 75% through, so maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll finish this in a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started applying some layout changes and other stuff to the site, things will probably be moving around for a bit. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll write a blog post about it when I&amp;rsquo;m done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coming out this week: Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Zack Snyder&amp;rsquo;s Justice League! More looking forward to FatWS than ZSJL obviously. I am awaiting ZSJL with more of a morbid curiosity than anything else, i.e. my expectations are low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have more medical errands to conduct this week, seems like a bad habit that I keep having to get into too often. Comes with the age, I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Digital Boardgames Review: Blood Rage
</title>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do reviews of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s review is for &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1015930/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage: Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;. This is a Norse mythology themed game based on a IRL boardgame. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those &amp;ldquo;place your guys on the map&amp;rdquo; boardgame where each player vies for control of provinces. The game is divided into three ages, and at the end of each age one of the provinces is destroyed as part of ragnarok. The players place units in each of the provinces, which have limited slots for units. During your turn you can choose to pillage a province, and other players can fight you for it if they have units there as well or can send units from adjacent provinces. A successfully pillage earns you a stat boost, and successfully defeating other players earns you glory, which is used to score for victory at the end of the game. The age ends when all the provinces have been pillaged or all the players no longer have any possible actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of each age the players draft 6 cards that will be available for them to use during the age. These include battle cards (which give you bonuses or abilities when fighting to pillage territories), upgrade cards (which give you either new abilities or new units or monsters to summon, each with special powers), or quests (which give you glory and stat bonuses at the end of the age if you fulfill their conditions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle and upgrade cards are mostly themed around the Norse Gods - Odin, Thor, Loki, Frigga, and Tyr. Each god has a different set of effects, and some can change your strategy so that you can win without having to actually win battles. For example, Tyr&amp;rsquo;s battle cards are all about giving you bonuses to combat, but Loki&amp;rsquo;s cards are all about earning you benefits when you lose combats. In many of our games, one of the player ends up being the &amp;ldquo;Loki player&amp;rdquo; who just joins every battle he can trying to gain those Loki bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battles are encouraged though; many of the upgrades and quests reward you with more glory for fighting and dying in battle, and having your units destroyed in ragnarok gives glory bonuses as well. At the start of each age, all previously destroyed units are again available for placement, so constantly getting into fights and getting sent to Valhalla can be a strategy as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve also gotten and played two of the expansions DLCs: &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1354120/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition__Mystics_of_Midgard/&#34;&gt;Mystics of Midgard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366580/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition__Gods_of_Asgard/&#34;&gt;Gods of Asgard&lt;/a&gt; (recently released). Mystics add a new unit type that can be drafted, including an annoying unit that can&amp;rsquo;t be killed as long as it has a province to retreat to after battle. The mystics usually end of being high draft picks. Gods of Asgard adds two randomly chosen Norse God figures to the board (among the 5 mentioned above), each one applies special properties to the province where they&amp;rsquo;re in, and they move do a different province after every pillage attempt. For example, Tyr makes it so that battles in the province only count battle cards and not the strength of the involved units; while Frigga makes it so that units in the province cannot die in battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was a bit buggy when we first got it in mid 2020, since it was just released, but it has steadily improved since then. We played it again recently after some time away and noted many improvements to the UI and quality of life changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is fun; we&amp;rsquo;ve played a reasonable amount of it (I&amp;rsquo;m at around 47 hours as of this writing.) It&amp;rsquo;s the kind of game where it&amp;rsquo;s easy and fun to mess around with what your opponents are doing, especially if you drafted some of the trickier cards. The only bad side would be that the games tend to go long, especially if someone drafted a good Loki deck or the Mystics are around or other such tricks. In our last session, we played 2 games for around 3 hours total.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;March has begun. Did it ever really end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vaccination finally starts in the country, with initial donated batches of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccine arriving in the country. Just in time for the one year anniversary of the world&amp;rsquo;s longest lockdown. SinoVac isn&amp;rsquo;t the best choice, but many of my doctor friends say they&amp;rsquo;ll settle for it if that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s available for them. I think QC is planning to use AstraZeneca for their citizens, but worrying is that AZ&amp;rsquo;s efficacy has been shown to be not so good against certain variants such as the South African one, which has already been detected in the country. Cases have been on the rise in the past couple of weeks as well, possibly due to the variants. We may very well be in a race against time now (maybe we always have been). The next month may be the most crucial phase of the pandemic for us, as vaccination drives hopefully kick into gear to try to overcome the accelerating spread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohhelloana.blog/catching-up-on-my-bookmarks/&#34;&gt;OhHelloAna.blog shared a whole bunch of bookmarks&lt;/a&gt;. Quite a few look interesting. Looking forward to going through this list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/&#34;&gt;Great article about cutting loading times in GTA&lt;/a&gt; went around last week. A case study in the problems with blindly relying on dependencies perhaps, and the complexities of C code performance, and even software performance in general.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rachel True had &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RachelTrue/status/1365461618977476610&#34;&gt;problems with iCloud&lt;/a&gt; after accidentally inputting her last name in lowercase. Feels like the sort of thing that can be maybe part of standard QA test suites? Hope she gets it resolved soon!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this fan video: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UngE0qn3VRY&#34;&gt;What if Wes Anderson directed X-Men?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/NonsenseIsland/status/1366449816042102787&#34;&gt;this thread on classical music in classic cartoons&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m no musical expert by any means, so it was even educational for me!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve switched back to doing digital sketches via Procreate, with kind of a different style this time? I kind of like it, more or less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today I was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/lzagfz/eli5_whats_the_difference_between_joules_watts/gq0i81h/?context=3&#34;&gt;mentioned via the u/hungryroy syntax on reddit&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. Not a big deal, I was just surprised lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally the pandemic and the quarantine hasn&amp;rsquo;t hit me as bad as other folks. My day to day routine hasn&amp;rsquo;t actually changed that much, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t really go out too often even pre-pandemic. That being said, I do miss being able to go out to places just to wander around, take my daily walk in a public place like &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1366349139559129088/&#34;&gt;the QC circle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/01/saturday-morning-up/&#34;&gt;the university campus&lt;/a&gt;, or even just loitering at the mall. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I miss being able to hang out with other people (although I do to some degree as well). More like I miss the ability to be outside, alone, in public, just sitting quietly and letting the universe wash over me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; is done! Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/wandavision/&#34;&gt;a spoiler-free review&lt;/a&gt;, something I used to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/spoiler-free-review/&#34;&gt;do more regularly&lt;/a&gt;. I have more spoiler-related thoughts, but they may be too much for this space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m almost done with season 2 of &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;, which means I&amp;rsquo;m about halfway through the series overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Flash&lt;/strong&gt; started its new season last week, but it feels like their episodes are like 90% nonsense now. (Used to be closer to 60% nonsense.). Second ep of &lt;strong&gt;Superman and Lois&lt;/strong&gt; was okay, although we are definitely getting more moody teenager problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run: still WIP. Moving forward slowly, ever so slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got last month&amp;rsquo;s Humble Choice, and decided to go ahead and install and try out some of the games in the bundle.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started by playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127610/Iris_and_the_Giant/&#34;&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice little tactical battle indie game with CCG mechanics &amp;ndash; think Slay the Spire, but with turn-based tactical RPG battles that can also feel very puzzle-like. I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying well-designed indie games recently, and this one seems to fall into that bucket. It has a unique, minimalist aesthetic and the story is about a young girl&amp;rsquo;s mental health? Maybe? I&amp;rsquo;ll know more if I actually managed to finish a run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also tried to play a game of &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/392110/Endless_Space_2/&#34;&gt;Endless Space 2&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not unfamiliar with 4X games of course, but this one was a bit confusing for me. In the one game where I managed to get anywhere, it felt like I was always behind in tech, and there&amp;rsquo;s so many indicators and UI elements on the different views that I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand. I can see there&amp;rsquo;s going to be a learning curve for this one, so it may take a few games for me to get the hang of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of Humble choice, the next one has Control as a showcase game, but I already got that off PS+, so I think I&amp;rsquo;m pausing on this one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday regular gaming group decided to play &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1015930/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/a&gt; again yesterday, and we found out there was new DLC so we all decided to buy that and try it out. Might do a review for this game this week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also did quite a few Starcraft 2 1v1s with friends this past week. I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself very proficient with SC2, mostly because I&amp;rsquo;m very micro-averse, but I still enjoy playing it. Maybe not ladder though. We recorded some of our games, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bINjaPjt1M&#34;&gt;the first one is up on the Team Camote youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;, if you&amp;rsquo;d like to watch me be terrible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of reasons, I browsed some Ludum Dare games the other day. My favorite is this short and simple one: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/a-monster-hunter-story&#34;&gt;A Monster Hunter Story&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Still very slowly reading cyberpunk classic &lt;em&gt;Neurmancer&lt;/em&gt; by William Gibson. I&amp;rsquo;m about halfway through, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I understand everything that&amp;rsquo;s going on. Might need to look for a recap later on. Still, I soldier on!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh, nothing. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s going to be one of those weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;#WandaVision spoiler-free review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall, I really liked it, and I think they did well with the one-episode-per-week format. The show certainly would not have been this hyped if it all came in one drop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Really difficult to not spoil. If you have somehow avoid being spoiled by the internet until it all dropped, good for you!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A very emotional story of Wanda dealing with the aftermath of Infinity War/Endgame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good usage of the sitcom tropes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fantastic performance by Elisabeth Olsen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lots of fan service for comic book fans to dig into. Maybe too much even; don&amp;rsquo;t overthink or overhype it to yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most of the episodes have something like 5-6 minutes of credits. Episodes 7 and 8 have a mid-credits scene. Episode 9 has both mid and post credits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to Falcon and Winter Soldier next!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Today is the last day of February. Tomorrow, we march on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biden ordered his &lt;a href=&#34;https://thehill.com/policy/defense/540631-Biden-orders-US-strikes-on-iranian-backed-militia-facilities-in-syria&#34;&gt;first military strike last week&lt;/a&gt;. America is back, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This past week, embrassingly our local police and anti-drug agency got into a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/pnp-pdea-shootout-bungled-buy-bust-operation-ever-gotesco-quezon-city&#34;&gt;shootout&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;against each other&lt;/em&gt; near the Ever Gotesco mall in Quezon City. Both sides claim they were doing a buy-bust, which is impossible. As usual, there is little transparency about what actually happened, and many promises of &amp;ldquo;impartial&amp;rdquo; probes and investigations. People speculate that at least one of the parties involved really was dealing drugs, and they got into a shootout because they were afraid of being EJK&amp;rsquo;ed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have any of these today, sadly. This is why I don&amp;rsquo;t have a newsletter, I&amp;rsquo;m unable to promise regular content lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week was busy with family and medical errands, so not much else was accomplished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; penultimate ep, people still liked it, but it was a bit meh for me. Still looking forward to next week&amp;rsquo;s finale, as there are still so many things to wrap up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started watching &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;, the last of the non-animated Trek shows I have yet to watch. (I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the TOS animated series). It&amp;rsquo;s Scott Bakula! Their uniforms here remind me of something like modern astronaut wear, so I assume they wanted something closer to &amp;ldquo;modern day&amp;rdquo; Earth to bridge to the Star Trek future. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting because at this point the relationship between the humans and Vulcans isn&amp;rsquo;t well established, there is no federation, no prime directive, etc, so we get to see the beginnings of those things later on I guess?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also watched a couple of movies this week. First was &lt;strong&gt;Space Sweepers&lt;/strong&gt;, a Korean space sci-fi adventure on Netflix. Entertaining enough, though the plot is easily predictable and the villain seemed like a moron. Great visuals and special effects, miles apart from anything local cinema has to offer. One-inch barrier of subtitles, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second movie was &lt;strong&gt;Once Upon A Time In Hollywood&lt;/strong&gt;. This was a very laid-back, relaxed movie, unfolding mostly as a series of slice-of-life vignettes of what life was like Hollywood in 1969, with no real plot urgency to speak of. The climax sort of just happens through no real actions by the main characters. Fairly long, took me four sittings to get through. Was surprised to find out later that it was based on a true story of a massacre that took place at that time, with Margot Robbie playing a real-life actress who was the victim in the actual massacre. The story unfolds a bit differently, probably due to the presence of fictional protagonists Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth (portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt). Bruce Lee also makes an appearance!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last week was also the premiere of &lt;strong&gt;Superman and Lois&lt;/strong&gt; on CW. I still like these positive portrayals of Superman better than something like Snyder&amp;rsquo;s Man of Steel, although I&amp;rsquo;m a bit meh on the premiere overall. Everything about the teens gives me Smallville vibes. They had a really big missed opportunity to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/1364758520885772288/&#34;&gt;match a scene from the opening sequence with a classic comic cover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a bit of Civ6 now that the Barbarian Clans mode has dropped. Restarted a few times with Kublai Khan before I got a decent start. Not super impressed with the Barbarian Clans mode so far, seems like the main effect is that we get more city-states going into the endgame. Will probably still try it out for a few games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run still in progress, finally got to the Edelgard decision point, and went as I planned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have been trying to figure out why I&amp;rsquo;m having &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/lquag0/sf5_is_it_expected_to_be_so_hard_to_find_a_match/&#34;&gt;so much trouble finding matches in Street Fighter V&lt;/a&gt;. Still no luck though. I want to indulge myself by getting the season 5 pass, but it&amp;rsquo;s not worth it if I can&amp;rsquo;t actually find matches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always annoying whenever this happens, but next month&amp;rsquo;s PS+ games include FF7 Remake, which I&amp;rsquo;ve already played and finished. Good for everyone else though! New content was also announced for the PS5 version of the game, which is also annoying since it&amp;rsquo;s probably goinna be a while before I bother with a PS5 (maybe waiting for a smaller version!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit: One of my loyal readers pointed out I failed to mention that we played a few games of 4-player Free For All in Starcraft 2 last Saturday. I won one and some undeserving people won the other two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Finished reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/ghost-of-my-father/&#34;&gt;Scott Berkun&amp;rsquo;s Ghost of my Father&lt;/a&gt;. Then started reading pioneering cyberpunk classic &lt;em&gt;Neurmancer&lt;/em&gt; by William Gibson. Kind of a challenging read, I&amp;rsquo;m inching through it slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz&lt;/strong&gt;: We managed to win the AboutQuiz league, just barely. Yay us!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managed to sneak in a few minor upgrades to this here site, mostly CSS and rendering improvements on the frontend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WandaVision finale!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Flash season premiere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New One Piece later tonight!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supposedly vaccination in this country will finally kick off!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Game Review: Knightin&#39;
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/game-review-knightin/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2021 04:41:32 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/game-review-knightin/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A while back, on a whim I purchased this indie game &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/922710/Knightin/&#34;&gt;Knightin&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; on Steam. I forget how I came across it and why I decided to buy, but no regrets. It&amp;rsquo;s a tightly-focused dungeon crawler in the style of original Legend of Zelda/Link to the Past dungeons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each dungeon is a set of rooms you clear one at a time, until you get  to the dungeon boss and beat him. Clearing rooms involves defeating  enemies, solving puzzles, avoiding obstacles and opening chests. It&amp;rsquo;s a  short game, there are only four dungeons to clear each slightly more difficult than the last. There is no plot at all. The game itself openly admits this by painting the thinnest of flavors. You play Sir Lootalot and you want to beat the evil dark lord at the end of the fourth dungeon. For treasure! No princess to save or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I say &amp;ldquo;tightly-focused&amp;rdquo;, I mean that the game is barebones and does only what it says, but it does it very well. I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of how well-designed it is. It&amp;rsquo;s entirely predictable, you know what you&amp;rsquo;re getting into, but each part is executed really well. Each dungeon consists of multiple floors. Each floor has exactly twelve rooms, arranged in the same 3x4 rectangle shape every time. There&amp;rsquo;s a minimap that never changes shape, but maps room paths as you go. The minimap has a nice notation that indicates things like stairs up, stairs down, a merchant, a warp point, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combat is simple and straightforward as well. You don&amp;rsquo;t get a plethora of weapons like Link does in the Zelda series. You start out with a sword (obviously) and later you get access to a wand that lets you shoot fireballs, and those are your only weapons ever. Later you also learn to dash (which hits enemies with the sword), fire dash (which leaves a trail of flames as you dash), and learn a spin attack (a la Link to the Past). You only ever have to remember four buttons: swing sword, shoot wand, dash, and raise shield (and I very rarely use the shield).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obstacles in your way include enemies of course, and the difficulty ramp is great here as well. You start out with enemies that just walk around randomly and they damage you if they bump you. As you progress you meet more complicated foes. Enemies with ranged attacks. Enemies that chase you. Enemies that can move faster. Enemies that can pop out from under your feet. Enemies that can reproduce. And so on. They are always introduced one new enemy at a time so you get to know their shtick before you meet them in more difficult rooms. Rooms can also have obstacles, such as blades that suddenly jut out of the ground, rotating saw blades, pillars that shoot projectiles, and so on, all adding to room difficulty. Some rooms will have a merchant who sells stuff (you get gold from enemy drops), or chests you can open. Everything is pre-placed, no procedural generation here.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some puzzle rooms, which come in two types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;switch rooms, where you need to figure out which switches to turn on to access a chest or unlock a path. These are handled well enough. Although there&amp;rsquo;s no dialog anywhere, hints for the correct switch positions are scattered visually throughout the same floor of the dungeon where they are found. When you encounter a switch room, it&amp;rsquo;s usually just a matter of going back to previous rooms to see what the hints mean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;block rooms, where you need to push blocks around (only push! no pull!) to get them into the correct positions. I enjoyed the block puzzles more. They are relatively well-designed, and some took me a bit more time than I expected (maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just dumb? Lol)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements&lt;/strong&gt;. Completion in this game is largely straightforward as well. Most of the achievements are geared towards acquiring all the upgrades, opening all chests, and beating all the dungeons. The only two I didn&amp;rsquo;t get (and probably won&amp;rsquo;t bother to) are for doing a speedrun under 90 minutes and for doing a no death run. I tried a couple of post-game runs, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure I can do both of those after some number of tries, but I think I&amp;rsquo;m way too lazy for that. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it installed and maybe someday I&amp;rsquo;ll get around to it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall&lt;/strong&gt;: A very tight, focused, well-designed and quick indie game experience (my total play time so far is less than 3 hours). It&amp;rsquo;s relatively cheap on Steam too. It&amp;rsquo;s not super groundbreaking or anything, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth it for a couple of hours of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://scottberkun.com/the-ghost-of-my-father/&#34;&gt;Ghost of My Father by Scott Berkun&lt;/a&gt; this past week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book isn&amp;rsquo;t my usual fare. It&amp;rsquo;s a memoir about the author&amp;rsquo;s father and their relationship and family life. I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with the author&amp;rsquo;s work, but mostly in the realms of tech, design and public speaking, but this book was largely personal, and mostly talking about strangers I had no real interest in. I think the only reason I have a copy at all is because I was on the author&amp;rsquo;s mailing list and got a review copy of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started reading it because I was looking for a new book to pick up, and with the first few pages I was like &amp;ldquo;Oh, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like something for me, I probably won&amp;rsquo;t finish it.&amp;rdquo; but before I knew it, I had finished 40% of the book in one sitting. I consumed mostly as if it was a work of fiction, about strangers and their relationships. Humans like stories after all, and this is a story about people who are only human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author&amp;rsquo;s relationship with his father was strained at best, and it affected the rest of their family as well. I can&amp;rsquo;t personally relate to that, as I have a pretty good relationship with my family. The author&amp;rsquo;s difficult family life provides a window into a kind of human interaction I&amp;rsquo;m not too familiar with. But I do empathize with how it can be difficult to deal with certain people, and how sometimes the people you need closure from the most will simply have no interest in providing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not a long book, it was a quick read for me (less than a week). I probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have sought out such a book on my own, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad I read it.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Digital Boardgames Review: Scythe
</title>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do reviews of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second review is about &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/718560/Scythe_Digital_Edition/&#34;&gt;Scythe: Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;. Scythe is a competitive game where you play one of seven factions in an alternate history post-war Eastern Europe. Players vie to control territories, hire workers, build mechs, accumulate resources, accomplish secret objectives, and other such goals. Accomplishing secret objectives, winning combats or maximizing one of the several metrics (workers, money, popularity, military power, recruits, structures, mechs, etc) earns you stars, and the game ends when at least one player has six stars. Having six stars doesn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee victory, as points are then tallied up depending on various factors including stars, territories, money, popularity, and so on. Having separate victory and end conditions creates a bit of tension and a balancing act between progressing stars and earning points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players play as one of seven available factions, each with preset locations on the board. The board is preset and consists of hex tiles, each with different movement limitations and resources that can be produced. The board also has &amp;ldquo;encounters&amp;rdquo; on certain tiles, basically roleplaying opportunities where you get the choice of an action to take, typically trading one type of resource for another, usually a good deal, if you can pay the costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board is fixed, but each player is randomly assigned a mat that determines the actions available during their turn. The mat is split into top actions (produce, move, bolster, trade) each paired with one of the available bottom actions (upgrade, deploy mech, recruit, build structure). During your turn, you may play one top action followed by the corresponding bottom action, and you cannot do the same action pair on successive turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weird action structure makes the game challenging. Typically, the top actions generate resources, while the bottom actions consume them to advance your goals. If you get a mat with pairings that are poor for your particular situation, it may take a while for you to get into a regular rhythm of production to actually get anything done. Other players can also interfere with you by sending their character and/or mechs to attack or harass your territory or workers. I usually find that I need to plan ahead 2-3 turns to accomplish a simple goal like building a mech. Beyond the 3-turn window, who knows what the board looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combat is kind of straightforward - you can attack a hex with one or two combat units, and up to two combat units will defend it. Each side can spend up to 7 military power, plus play one combat card per unit on their side, each card adds 2-5 to your total. The attacker wins all ties, favoring aggressors. Due to the way military power and combat cards are accumulated, it&amp;rsquo;s risky to initiate combat unless you have at least 14 military power (this ensures you have a fighting chance against a counterattack). Furthermore, each faction can only gain up to 2 stars from winning combats, so you want to make them count. In our games, we find that typically the winning faction will use two combats to try to earn 2 stars in one turn and end the game, and often those will be the only combats that happen in the entire game. Not sure if we are playing this optimally!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games tend to go at least an hour long, roughly 20 or so turns in our experience. Because of the game&amp;rsquo;s pacing and action structure, you can have games where it feels like I haven&amp;rsquo;t accomplished much by then. Usually this creates a bit of snowball effect as well - the player who gets his act together earlier will tend to pull ahead and be difficult to catch up to. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComebackMechanic&#34;&gt;comeback mechanism&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;rsquo;re missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The display is literally just the actual board, and the camera can be a bit finicky sometimes. In my last game I accidentally rotated the view and took a minute to figure out how to get it back. The UI is also fairly sparse and a lot of information or options can be hidden in the weirdest places. Like, figuring out where your faction is allowed to cross rivers can be challenging for new players. I&amp;rsquo;ve attached some screenshots to this post, but they&amp;rsquo;re nothing special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably just relevant to my playgroup, but because of the slow pace, we tend to play a second metagame on top of the endgame scoring, where we consider the player who has spent the least amount of time on his turns (as seen via the turn clock) as &amp;ldquo;winning by time&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the digital board games we&amp;rsquo;ve played, this is the one where we have the least amount of playtime. Unsurprising given how slow the pace is and how difficult it is. For this reason, I think it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to recommend to any boardgame newbies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Last week of February is about to start. Time flies, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Texas (and other parts of the southern US I guess) have been hit by heavy winter storms, with accompanying power grid failures and such. We have some relatives there so it&amp;rsquo;s a concern. Meanwhile, their governor falsely blames renewables for the power problems and their senator went to Cancun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.platformer.news/p/facebook-calls-australias-bluff&#34;&gt;Facebook cut off Australian news links&lt;/a&gt;. I think both sides of these are dumb, but that is the big tech controversy of the week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NASA has landed &lt;a href=&#34;https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/&#34;&gt;the Perseverance rover on Mars!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsurprisingly, we still do not have vaccines in this country.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a bunch of family and medical stuff to do this coming week, so I don&amp;rsquo;t expect to be very productive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had a &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/02/1362173871806287872/&#34;&gt;Globe fiber internet outage&lt;/a&gt; last week, starting Tuesday afternoon until Thursday morning. So I spent all of Ash Wednesday without internet, which is appropriate as a bit of &lt;em&gt;penitencia&lt;/em&gt; I guess. Spent the downtime complaining at their customer support account, and also reading and playing offline things. I thought about writing a post about their customer service, but it was an actual outage that affected a bunch of people in the area, and the customer service can&amp;rsquo;t really do much about that, so it seems a bit mean to pile on now that the service has been restored (and I seem to have gotten a rebate for the lost days). Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll still write the post, we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caught up with B99 up to season 7. Looks like the final season might not come out until 2022 though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went ahead and finished The Expanse season 5 yesterday. Overall the season wasn&amp;rsquo;t as exciting as some of the earlier ones, but still pretty good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; ended on another cliffhanger this week as usual, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big surprise for me, given everyone on reddit had been predicting it. Two eps to go, hoping for a strong finish!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I played a lot of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/Kaldheim&#34;&gt;Kaldheim limited this week&lt;/a&gt;, drafts at first as usual, then I did some sealeds to prep for the Arena Open, which I also did as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/02/1363386731240726533/&#34;&gt;season finale&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmU0vkKslGXgza5YFq3PfZZGHwyRIYYU-&#34;&gt;Kaldheim limited youtube playlist&lt;/a&gt;. I enjoyed this format, though I wasn&amp;rsquo;t super good at it (mostly my fault, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t really read up on pick orders and such early on). It&amp;rsquo;s fun and challenging. Looking forward to Strixhaven!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks to our internet outage, I finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/922710/Knightin/&#34;&gt;Knightin&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;! There&amp;rsquo;s a couple of achievements I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten which I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;ll bother - they&amp;rsquo;re for doing a speedrun and a no-death run, both of which I can probably do with a bit of practice, but not sure it&amp;rsquo;s worth it. I did like the game though, I might write a short review this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run still in progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks to our internet outage, I finished reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/walkaway/&#34;&gt;Cory Doctorow&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Walkaway&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Also started reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://scottberkun.com/the-ghost-of-my-father/&#34;&gt;Scott Berkun&amp;rsquo;s Ghost of my Father&lt;/a&gt;, which turned out to be a quick read, will probably finish it tonight or tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;penultimate WandaVision ep!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Street Fighter 6 first drop for season 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Civ6 New Frontier Pass free update for February (improved Barbarians mode!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Superman and Lois premiering this week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holiday on Thursday! (EDSA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AboutQuiz league season finale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;various family celebrations and medical errands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Book Review: Walkaway by Cory Doctorow

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Walkaway-Novel-Cory-Doctorow-ebook/dp/B01FQQ47OC/&#34;&gt;Walkaway&lt;/a&gt; is a novel by blogger Cory Doctorow. It tells the story of a near-future world and a trend of people going &amp;ldquo;walkaway&amp;rdquo;. This term means walking away from what they call &amp;ldquo;default society&amp;rdquo;, characterized by late stage capitalism, massive inequality, ever-present surveillance, and a world controlled by what they call the zottarich, or simply zottas. Not too far from our own present reality of course. Later, the novel also delves into the near-future (?) concept of humans being to upload their consciousness into machines, effectively allowing them to cheat death by running as a &amp;ldquo;brain in a jar&amp;rdquo; on a cluster of computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going walkaway means giving everything up and deciding to live communally and off the land, as it were. This near-future world makes this possible due to the abundance of materials and equipment that have been left behind or abandoned due to failed cities, institutions or companies. Resources that are presumably being wasted or going unused because of insane things like copyright controls, patents, and so on. Walkaways are shown building entire communities by sending out drones to seek out and gather nearby raw materials and constructing machines like fabricators that can spin out food and clothing, all powered by open source code that is freely shared and improved upon by walkaways worldwide via a highly distributed and decentralized walkaway network. &amp;ldquo;Default&amp;rdquo; society and media portray walkaways as anarchists and terrorists, living on the fringe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot centers upon a small group of twenty-somethings (including one zotta heiress) who initially flirt with the idea of going walkaway, and then decide to jump right in. Under that thin veneer, the novel feels mostly like an opportunity to explore how such an idea could work, and how it could bridge the gap between our current society and an idealized future, post-scarcity and even post-human. That gap is not bridged easily of course. Discoveries in walkaway culture and science such as human mind uploads threaten to overturn the &amp;lsquo;default&amp;rsquo; society and thus draws the ire of the zottas, who send in mercenaries and even armies to disrupt, arrest, and take down walkaways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author is a blogger I&amp;rsquo;ve known about for a while, and his interest in various kinds of technology and possible future applications to help supplant late-stage capitalism are made obvious through the novel. I initially thought it was being a bit too preachy and idealistic about walkaway culture being the right path for humanity. The story argues that there is plenty to go around, and that people shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be coerced to work and should have an abundance mentality, freely helping and giving away to others, something that works in the novel because of the existence of fabricators and the apparent abundance of raw materials, but which I am unsure would be true in the real world. This is why we still have a lot of people arguing against things like UBI and so on. The novel anchors itself from a point where the scarcity issue is mostly addressed, what&amp;rsquo;s left is to overcome the regressive &amp;ldquo;default&amp;rdquo; capitalist systems holding us back from a brighter future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kind of find myself aligned with the author in terms of ideology; I am very much hoping we as a society find a way past the perils of capitalism, but I&amp;rsquo;m not yet so optimisci that it could work. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure whether the story should be classified as a dystopia - it certainly describes a very dystopian status quo, but that status quo is not too far from our current one. And ultimately, despite all the trials and tribulations our walkaway protagonists are subject to, the novel still exudes optimism about humanity&amp;rsquo;s future. So, a hopeful dystopia, a dystopia that can be defeated? A dystopia that is merely a stepping stone towards what the walkaways call &amp;ldquo;the first days of a better nation&amp;quot;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do reviews of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/337150/Sentinels_of_the_Multiverse/&#34;&gt;Sentinels of the Multiverse&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ve played the IRL boardgame of it before during one of our sporadic in-person meetups. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, it&amp;rsquo;s a comics-themed coop game where up to 4 people play as a group of heroes to beat a villain (basically comic book shenanigans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a large variety of heroes available to play, each with unique abilities and play styles. Some of them are straightforward and some are super complicated and fiddly to play. The villains you have to beat vary from super simple to really difficult, with advanced variants for even more challenge. The game also provides a &amp;ldquo;weekly one-shot&amp;rdquo; challenge which provides a fixed scenario/villain and set of heroes to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve played a lot of games of Sentinels, and probably only won something like 60-70% of them. Each game takes around an hour or so, maybe more if it was super difficult. Usually we lose when we choose some combination of random heroes just to try them out then get beaten terribly by the villain. Then we go on a revenge run using one of the simpler heroes like Legacy or Tachyon (or we just put in a healer like Dr Medico).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digital version has the advantage that it automates a lot of the ability triggers and checks that the boardgame requires, which would usually be a lot of work. On the other hand, it has a UX disadvantage for those scenarios where an ability triggers multiple times and you want to make the same decision every time. In the real board game, you can just handwave it off by saying &amp;ldquo;Ok, we choose X is every time&amp;rdquo;, but in the digital version you have to click through every confirmation dialog every time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game&amp;rsquo;s aesthetic is very much classic comic books, even multiplayer games are joined by entering a code in the format of a comic book issue like &amp;ldquo;Justice Comics #153&amp;rdquo;. The art isn&amp;rsquo;t the most elaborate and could be better; in fact, they are planning a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/27/22250963/sentinels-of-the-multiverse-definitive-kickstarter-street-date-price&#34;&gt;Definitive Edition of the boardgame&lt;/a&gt; that has even better art that is closer to the old-school comic book aesthetic. It looks like a signficant upgrade, so I expect if they ever release a digital version of the new version it would be a completely new game on Steam. Our group has enjoyed our Sentinels games though, so I fully expect we will be getting the new Steam version when it does come out.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trump has been acquitted in his second impeachment trial, proving yet again to the world that the US is a flawed democracy dominated by corruption at the highest levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duterte says &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/duterte-cannot-afford-be-brave-in-mouth-against-china&#34;&gt;he cannot be brave in the mouth against China&lt;/a&gt;. Back before the 2016 elections, somebody I used to know claimed that we needed a &amp;ldquo;rottweiler&amp;rdquo; like Duterte as president because he would be tough against China. I remember this sometimes and laugh and then am also sad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A couple of Zelda-themed videos I enjoyed for some reason:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wsi1IbjPAkM&#34;&gt;Life as a Bokoblin - A Zelda Nature Documentary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDPRwLlpdTU&#34;&gt;The Legend of Beavis&lt;/a&gt;. This one is super dumb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this &lt;a href=&#34;https://cosmicdirtbag.com/2020/12/07/crop-circles-part-01/&#34;&gt;short webcomic series about crop circles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smolcss.dev/&#34;&gt;Smolcss.dev&lt;/a&gt;: Minimal snippets for modern CSS layouts and components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For everyone who likes NPM, there was this &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610&#34;&gt;fun story this week&lt;/a&gt; about attacking private source code repos by creating public versions of their private dependencies, so that NPM would pull those new public versions instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/books/a35118667/how-to-write-a-novel/&#34;&gt;How to Write a Novel, According to 10 Really Good Novelists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275441/jack-dorsey-decentralized-app-store-algorithms&#34;&gt;Twitter&amp;rsquo;s Jack Dorsey imagines a decentralized app store for social media algorithms&lt;/a&gt;. The article is sparse on details and I don&amp;rsquo;t know how accurate it is, but I do like the idea, if only because I hope somebody implements just the chronological timeline algorithm everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still working on that secret thing I&amp;rsquo;m learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote a bunch of actual non-weeknotes &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/blog/&#34;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt; last week, so go check them out! Or don&amp;rsquo;t, I&amp;rsquo;m not your mother.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily sketches still ongoing in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt;, somehow still managing to keep up. I make no pretense that the sketches are actually good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching a lot of old Brooklyn Nine-Nine eps, still haven&amp;rsquo;t caught up to the latest season already on Netflix. Was announced last week that the next season, only 10 eps, will be the last one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also started trying to catch up on The Expanse. This series is so hard to binge because each episode feels so heavy and dense I feel like I need time to absorb and reflect. Would have been perfect to be watching the eps weekly as they drop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; on the other hand continues to be really effective/frustrating with their cliffhangers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/f9e8b66a362f9a61612057f4db10b9cf/&#34;&gt;This note&lt;/a&gt; summarizes how I feel about these three shows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/Kaldheim&#34;&gt;Kaldheim drafts are continuing&lt;/a&gt;, although I find I&amp;rsquo;m much worse at this than Zendikar Rising. Despite being so terrible, I am considering throwing gems away on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/announcing-february-2021-arena-open-2021-02-10&#34;&gt;Sealed Arena Open next weekend&lt;/a&gt;, seems like it could be fund (although there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance of instant regret!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s this small indie game I bought a while back called &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/922710/Knightin/&#34;&gt;Knightin&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, I tried it a bit, kinda neat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Been getting back into Fire Emblem Three Heroes, on my second run at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Couple of gaming things this week that I&amp;rsquo;m interested in:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Street Fighter V made their initial previews for the first drop in season 5. The season pass includes something that lets me random select on ranked! I&amp;rsquo;d love to that, and I&amp;rsquo;d love to play more SF5 despite being so trash at it, except the real problem is I find it so hard to find online matches (possibly because I&amp;rsquo;m so bronze tier). Still, tempted to get this pass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser&amp;rsquo;s Fury for Switch released this week. Was initially not interested since I already finished 3D World on WiiU, but I saw a preview that made Bowser&amp;rsquo;s Fury look like a significant addition, so now I am once again waffling about whether to throw money Nintendo&amp;rsquo;s way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Still reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Walkaway-Novel-Cory-Doctorow-ebook/dp/B01FQQ47OC/&#34;&gt;Cory Doctorow&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Walkaway&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt; We were terrible in this week&amp;rsquo;s About Quiz, mostly due to the abundance of PH-local questions which we always find difficult. We finished second last, but I think we still manage to retain first place in the league, by a razor-thin margin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started to use an electric massager and doing arm rotations and other weird exercises to help loosen up my left shoulder and maybe regain flexibility and alleviate muscle pains. Here&amp;rsquo;s to hoping it works!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My eyes are a bit tired. Quite possibly from playing too much Fire Emblem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward-to-this-coming-week&#34;&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yet another WandaVision ep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new One Piece later today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think we should also be getting details on the next Civ6 New Frontier Pass drop next week? It should just be a free update for this month though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oh Ash Wednesday is this week, I wonder if they&amp;rsquo;ll provide an alternative for people who still don&amp;rsquo;t want to go to the actual church&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Don&#39;t Be Ashamed of Joy
</title>

            <pubDate>Sat, 13 Feb 2021 03:29:55 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/dont-be-ashamed-of-joy/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Lauren R. O&amp;rsquo;Connor &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/the-bts-effect/on-pleasure-510c9795bff4&#34;&gt;talks about a childhood lesson about pleasure&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was eight years old, I saw the movie Back to the Future for the first time, and I fell in love. All I wanted to think and talk about was Back to the Future. I dreamt about Back to the Future at night. I rode my bike down the steepest hill in my neighborhood and pretended I was flying, approaching 88 mph, about to zap myself back in time. I was ecstatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then my mother told me to stop talking about Back to the Future. “Other people are going to think it’s weird,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned three things from this interaction: one, it is bad to be really interested in things; two, if I was really interested in something, I should therefore hide it; and three, my mother cared more about me being normal than about me being happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to blame the parent for this sort of interaction, as most likely they grew up in the sort of society that routinely punished noncomformity (or weirdness). Luckily, in today&amp;rsquo;s modern society, there&amp;rsquo;s less pressure to be ashamed of the things that give us joy, since the online communities make it easier to connect with people who share similar interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The linked post above goes on to talking about how as an adult, she learned to find joy through her fandom of the South Korean group BTS. I have no interest in such things myself, but I follow a few people on Twitter who are unashamedly fans and they will sometimes Tweet something like &amp;ldquo;sorry to my followers for all the spam&amp;rdquo;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my view, such apologies shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be necessary. Social media is a public platform where you&amp;rsquo;re free to follow and unfollow as you wish. If you choose to follow someone, obviously you think some percentage of what they say will be of interest to you, but you should also accept that they aren&amp;rsquo;t the exact same person you are and they may have other interests and they will talk about what they want to talk about. If the volume is unsatisfactory to you, feel free to unfollow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this same reason, I dislike it when people complain to other people on Twitter in the vein of &amp;ldquo;I followed you for $TOPIC, please stop talking $OTHERTOPIC&amp;rdquo;. (Usually $OTHERTOPIC is something like politics.) Basically &amp;ldquo;stay in your lane.&amp;rdquo; People are complete people and not just whatever aspect you happen to enjoy. Let them enjoy what they enjoy and talk about what they want to talk about, and just unfollow if it&amp;rsquo;s too much for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be ashamed to talk about things you enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Obviously, as long as you&amp;rsquo;re not hurting other people. &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/02/be-excellent-to-each-other/&#34;&gt;Be excellent to each other.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Decentralization
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/decentralization/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2021 05:50:47 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/decentralization/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Will Schreiber argues that &lt;a href=&#34;https://secondbreakfast.co/decentralization-is-a-narrative-mirage&#34;&gt;decentralization is a narrative mirage&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human history is a story of increasing centralization. From roaming the plains of Africa, to settling down and building homes, to buying food in central markets, to instituting courts of law. Progression is compression. &lt;em&gt;How can I make it so everybody isn’t making their own shirts? Deciding their own justice? Tabulating their own spreadsheets?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve argued a few times on here in favor of decentralization (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/03/rethinking-facebook/&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/08/blogging-and-the-decentralized-internet/&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/tech-censorship/&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;), and the whole concept of movements like &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/&#34;&gt;Indieweb&lt;/a&gt; is a preference for a decentralized internet where everyone has his or her own personal site, instead of reliance on centralized large silos like Facebook or Twitter or whatever. In fact, I still believe in that ideal for the internet as it was conceived. (See also: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/badnetworker/status/1133363823728091136&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;four websites, each filled with screenshots of the other three&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I can see Will&amp;rsquo;s point. Human history definitely means we trend towards centralization in the long term. (Although our cultural and nationalistic differences are still too wide to tend towards centralized government for the planet&amp;hellip;) Still, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean there isn&amp;rsquo;t room for decentralized networks to also still exist, perhaps on the fringe. After all, not everyone wants to live in the big cities, there are still people who like growing their own food, people who prefer independent films over the ones made by big blockbuster conglomerates, people who want to support the small mom-and-pop stores over the big retail chains, etc. Even as culture and society consolidate and centralize, counter-cultures can still exist and even thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just because things towards centralized platforms doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we have to accept the current platforms as the end state, we can still ask for something better. If the analogy was to compare online platform centralization to the tendency towards people living in large metropolitan areas, then something like Facebook could be considered analogous to the worst of industrialized cities: over-populated, polluted, scammers and other shady characters abound trying to see if they can make a quick buck off of you, strangers shouting at each other, law enforcement going after you for arbitrary reasons, and so on. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be like this. The same way we are trying to have better, well-designed cities with better, cleaner systems to better support populations at scale, we also need to work hard to have better centralized silos and platforms, ones that work for us instead of against us. If we have to in a city, it might as well be a good city.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically: each year would be 13 months of 28 days each, plus a bonus day at the end of each year, for a total of 365 days. This way, the first day of each month would always be a Sunday, the 2nd would always be a Monday, the 3rd a Tuesday, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered this idea before and I do understand the appeal of the regularity, especially from an engineering perspective. But after living through the last year of the pandemic and the lockdown where every day, week, and month passed feeling more or less the same, I now feel like having every month be the same might not be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine, under this scenario: Christmas and other holidays would always fall on the same day every year; If you were born on a Wednesday, your birthday would be on a Wednesday every year. You&amp;rsquo;d never get a weekend birthday party! Also, imagine all the date processing code us programmers would have to rewrite!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem likely that we&amp;rsquo;d ever change our calendar system, it seems far too ingrained in us culturally. Even if humanity eventually expands to the stars and forgot all about Earth&amp;rsquo;s 365 days, we&amp;rsquo;d probably still be wondering whether February of the current year has 29 days or only 28. The only way our calendars would ever change would probably if we met an alien civilization with a completely different culture and thus need a common standard for datekeeping.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A while back I wrote about how &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/08/podcasts-audiobooks-newsletters/#newsletters&#34;&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big fan of the recent trend of newsletters&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized Substack actually publishes RSS feeds for their newsletters, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been following a a bit more of them. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d recommend a few that I&amp;rsquo;ve found to be quite interesting/useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine&#34;&gt;Money Stuff&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/matt_levine&#34;&gt;Matt Levine&lt;/a&gt;. The only non-substack entry on today&amp;rsquo;s list, this Bloomberg column covers financial matters like stock market and investment stuff. (It was certainly useful when following the whole Reddit/Gamestop stock market saga!) Levine likes to go in-depth and long-form, so his columns are usually quite long and cover multiple topics. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that this kind of thing isn&amp;rsquo;t really my specialty, and most of the time I have trouble even getting to the end of any single entry without my eyes glazing over, but I do feel like I learn a lot every time and I hope to someday finish a column claiming I fully understand it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://noahpinion.substack.com/&#34;&gt;Noahpinion&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/noahpinion&#34;&gt;Noah Smith&lt;/a&gt;. Noah Smith writes mostly about economics and US politics. The articles are fairly in-depth (not as much as Money Stuff), and I&amp;rsquo;ve found them generally informative and educational on topics I&amp;rsquo;m not especially familiar with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.todayintabs.com/&#34;&gt;Today in Tabs&lt;/a&gt; by Rusty Foster. I used to consider myself &amp;ldquo;extremely online&amp;rdquo; and aware of most everything on the internet. That might have been true back in 2010, back before all these youngsters came online and added all their vlogs and tiktoks and whatnot. This newsletter (and the next one) helps me keep up with all of the modern internet&amp;rsquo;s day-to-day nonsense. Each issue of Today in Tabs is dense and jam-packed with a whole bunch of recent cool internet things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.garbageday.email&#34;&gt;Garbage Day&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/broderick&#34;&gt;Ryan Broderick&lt;/a&gt;. I first encountered this newsletter when someone shared his &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.garbageday.email/p/everything-you-need-to-know-about&#34;&gt;article giving an explainer about the Tumblr subculture&lt;/a&gt;. It covers a variety of internet-focused topics, but each issue focuses on less&amp;hellip; things than Today In Tabs, albeit covering each item with just a bit more depth. Together, both newsletters give me a good idea of what&amp;rsquo;s happening on the internet on a regular basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://vicki.substack.com/&#34;&gt;Normcore Tech&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/vboykis&#34;&gt;Vicki Boykis&lt;/a&gt;. The author&amp;rsquo;s background is in data science, and from their own description, the newsletter offers &amp;ldquo;takes on tech news that are rooted in humanism, nuance, context, rationality, and a little fun&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t write a better explanation than that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    On 
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/23ef43058c482c829265e01e331d53c2/&#34;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&#34;2021-02-03 15:11:53&#34;&gt;3 Feb 2021 3:11pm&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    I wrote:
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Please write more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just on social media, FB, Twitter, whatever. Write on your own sites and blogs. On your tumblrs, wordpresses, whatever. Long-form, rambling, incessant. The world could use more sincere blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

        






    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above was written mostly as a response to finding &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/link-rot/#2&#34;&gt;so many of my friends&amp;rsquo; old and inactive blogs in my RSS reader&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the term I coined there, &amp;ldquo;sincere blogging&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;d define it as any blogging that isn&amp;rsquo;t for any kind of commercial purpose like for selling something or to generate ad revenue. Sincere blogging can be intended as informative or aspirational or purely for self-expression, as long as it&amp;rsquo;s not mainly commercial in purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it served as reminder to me, as I haven&amp;rsquo;t been writing here as often as I could have. I feel like in the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve filtered my writing a bit by only writing blog posts when I feel like I have something longish or elaborate or profound to say, and that led to making it harder to write posts when I was low on energy or whatever. Most probably a consequence of the proliferation of microblogging, as if a post needed to justify it&amp;rsquo;s length so that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get relegated to the ranks of &amp;ldquo;notes&amp;rdquo;. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been restricting myself to at most one post a day, which is a bit arbitrary and entire meaningless. So, let&amp;rsquo;s change all that, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping. I should be free to post more than once if I want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am with my nonsense again, if you&amp;rsquo;ll have me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Not like I ever left, mind you&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Book Review: The Year Without Pants
</title>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Year Without Pants&amp;rdquo; is a book by writer Scott Berkun about his time as a team lead at Wordpress.com back in 2010-2012. This book came out in 2013, and the conceit of the book back then was that Wordpress.com, run by Automattic, was a fully remote company, something that was still a rarity at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s weird reading this book in the context of the current pandemic, where remote work is now the norm among tech companies. So one of the things I like about the book is it&amp;rsquo;s kind of a time capsule back to an era when remote work was a novelty and not an everyday part of our modern dystopia. That and the stories about the culture at Automattic and Wordpress, arguably one of the main drivers of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/blogging/&#34;&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt; phenomenon at its peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wordpress.com was a force back in the day, and maybe it still is, as Wordpress still powers a good number of sites online I think. I&amp;rsquo;d be eager to read an updated take on what life is like at Automattic/Wordpress.com these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t really recommended the book to anyone who isn&amp;rsquo;t interested in the internet history and the whole tech side of it, but if that&amp;rsquo;s you, it&amp;rsquo;s an entertaining enough read.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h4 id=&#34;1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while now, I&amp;rsquo;d been meaning to go through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/links/&#34;&gt;links section&lt;/a&gt; of this site and clean up/organize all the bookmarks I&amp;rsquo;ve logged there over the years (first via &lt;a href=&#34;https://del.icio.us/&#34;&gt;delicious&lt;/a&gt; and later via &lt;a href=&#34;https://getpocket.com/&#34;&gt;pocket&lt;/a&gt;). One of the first things I had to do was to go through and identify any broken links. So I wrote a quick Python script to ping the URLs and it turns out there were a lot of them, unsurprising given the archives go back to 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not happy with it, but I know link rot is a natural part of the internet, especially as time goes by. Websites fall out of maintenance, run out of funding, get restructured and so on, and the links to those pages break and rot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of link rot is proportional to age: almost half of all the links back in 2004 are now inaccessible, and the percentage drops quickly as we get back to modern day:&lt;/p&gt;

class=&#34;keyText&#34;&gt;Broken links&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been meaning to update the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/blogroll/&#34;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt; on the site, since I haven&amp;rsquo;t added things there in a while. So I went through the good old RSS reader to find items to add to the blogroll, and I noted with sadness a number of blogs from old friends/people I knew who were still on my follows and were no longer active. But at least they were still there and I can still revisit all their old posts and thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse than the inactive ones are those that are no longer accessible at all, either because their domains were no longer renewed, or their accounts on platforms like wordpress.com have been deactivated. Just another form of link rot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s one of the disadvantages of the whole &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/personal-domain&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;owning your personal domain&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; principle promoted by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/&#34;&gt;Indieweb&lt;/a&gt;. Domains require maintenance, which means money, and which also means such personal sites can easily fall out of maintenance and thus contribute to link rot. Granted, running your website on one of the silos has no guarantees either (see: Geocities), but at least those silos have more resources than any individual and are likely to give you a chance to archive your data before they shut down, if ever. (Well, IDK if Parler let their users do that&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Link rot is one of the reasons that when I no longer use Twitter embeds on this site, since if the source tweet is deleted or the account gets banned or goes private, the embed breaks (and back when I was using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; it would even break the build completely)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Link rot is inevitable, as I said. It&amp;rsquo;s part of the nature of the internet. Despite services such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/&#34;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s probably impossible to keep the entire web of the internet online at the same time. Links will break and rot as time goes by. Maybe trying to avoid link rot completely is an impossible ideal, akin to wishing people never die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I guess that it&amp;rsquo;s also a bit selfish of me to want everything to be preserved no matter what. People have a right to want their content off the internet or be private if that&amp;rsquo;s what they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for my own content, I am well aware of my own mortality, and hope all this nonsense I write, such as it is can somehow survive beyond me. Aside from my current hosting, a mirror of all the site content is currently published to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/&#34;&gt;mirror.roytang.net&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, that&amp;rsquo;s still under my domain, so if I ever slip and lose the domain, or if I kick the bucket, it won&amp;rsquo;t be accessible either. But at least all my content exists in source form on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/roytang/blog/&#34;&gt;github repo for this blog&lt;/a&gt;. And a good chunk of that has already been preserved in &lt;a href=&#34;https://archiveprogram.github.com/&#34;&gt;Github&amp;rsquo;s Arctic Code Vault&lt;/a&gt;, so at the very least if all of humanity perishes, some record of me personally may still survive.&lt;/p&gt;
