If you&rsquo;re not familiar with the series, One Piece is an anime about pirates, the same way Naruto is about ninjas. Like Naruto, they don&rsquo;t live in a world very different from our own. The One Piece universe is a lot more insane than Naruto&rsquo;s though. I&rsquo;ve only watched less than a hundred episodes, but so far the Straw Hat Pirates have encountered giant sea cows, talking reindeer, a guy who can eat anything, a man-shark&hellip; too many to mention.

I&rsquo;ve been asked if I would be willing to be temporarily posted in another country, halfway across the world, for around half a year.
On the surface, it seems like a good idea &ndash; I don&rsquo;t have any definite plans for the next few months, so there&rsquo;s nothing in the way. It would be new stuff, new places, people, experiences, etc., a most welcome change of pace.
But the first emotion that grips me is fear.

Post Part I:
This being my first week back to work after a month-long hiatus, I inevitably get the usual sort of questions people ask when you get back from a vacation:
&ldquo;Hey, where did you go?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do you have any pasalubong?&rdquo; (souvenirs)
&ldquo;So, what did you do for one month?&rdquo;
I&rsquo;m amused by how very few people seem to get the fact that I didn&rsquo;t do &ldquo;anything&rdquo; in particular over the break.

Played yesterday at Galleria. With a whole bunch of people: three from the Zu crowd and I think five or six from the office. Insane number of people, as expected. I got there about ten minutes after the mall opened (I came from work), and I was already preregistered, but I only got to sign up for the sixth flight (Flight F). They had to buy extra tables from a nearby Office Warehouse.

I&rsquo;m going to try out a new feed aggregator for a while &ndash; NewsHutch. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Bloglines is nice and all, but one gets tired of the UI after a while. NewsHutch looks&hellip; nice.
And don&rsquo;t get me started on Google Reader&hellip; that one is slow as molasses. (I added it to my Google Customized Homepage though, maybe that makes it better)

Since I&rsquo;m going back to work starting on Saturday, I thought I&rsquo;d try to look for ways to improve my productivity at work.
I&rsquo;ve downloaded a few utilities that I can try at work to see if it can improve my workflow.
The first one is SlickRun. Basically it&rsquo;s a Start -&gt; Run replacement &ndash; press a predefined hotkey and a small command line tool appears where I can type shortcut-like commands.

The original is here. Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t like the header image so I removed it.
I&rsquo;m tired of moving themes around, so I&rsquo;ll settle on this for a while. Simple and clean. I&rsquo;ll just fuss around with the plugins later.
And yeah, I&rsquo;m also changing the categories around. There should be a plugin to search posts and assign multiple posts to new categories at the same time.
My vacation time is almost up&hellip; I still have too many things to watch&hellip;

I played the same deck again this past weekend, but I forgot to name it &ldquo;Nameless Deck Wins&rdquo; this time, so I posted a much worse record. =(
I went 2-3-drop, with the losses all going to aggro decks (2 Boros, 1 KarstenBot). The Boros matchup is winnable, but really tight, with no room for error.
Anyway, with Planar Chaos coming out, my colors (Red/Green/Black) look like they&rsquo;re getting a good boost, so hopefully I can further improve this deck.

I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write more about my time in Hong Kong.
One of the many new things I experienced there was the food. People who&rsquo;ve eaten out with me on a regular basis know that I&rsquo;m quite the picky eater. In general, I dislike eating veggies and seafood (yeah, I&rsquo;m an unhealthy carnivore). In Hong Kong, you cannot avoid vegetables and seafood; every meal comes with some form of green stuff or shrimp or whatnot.

Wow. It took me three months to finish FF12!
Fun game, weak story.
No strong lead character to carry the game.
Gameplay is very MMORPG-like. The grinding was ok, but they could&rsquo;ve done some quests like WoW to make it better.
I&rsquo;ll fight the optional bosses someday.
Will I play the next FF game? Don&rsquo;t know. Time is the most difficult factor, as it demands a lot. Took me about 65 hours to finish this one, playing 3-4 hours a day after I came back from Hong Kong.

A work in progress of course, as always. I hope I don&rsquo;t screw things up too badly. Better backup WordPress&hellip;

I upgraded my Kubuntu Linux installation to Edgy Eft during the Christmas break. Some notes:
  Why can&rsquo;t there be a one-click install? You know, some pop-up alert bubble in the corner saying &ldquo;A new version of Kubuntu is available.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t see why the user needs to edit the sources.list file, do the apt-get stuff, etc., when all of this can basically be automated away.
  Except for one thing, I can do everything I need to do using Kubuntu instead of using Windows.

This year, I resolve to find more direction.
That being said, I&rsquo;m kind of behind already. I usually manage a total cleanup of all the stuff in my room before the New Year. This year? Not even close.
At least I have an additional 3 weeks of vacation to finish everything.
Review of last year&rsquo;s resolution:
&ldquo;I will try more new things this year&rdquo; : I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s a resounding success.

It&rsquo;s around 7 PM on the 31st of December.
Around this time it starts to become dangerous to walk upon the streets of Metro Manila. In fact, I would never go out on the streets after dark on New Year&rsquo;s Eve. People are starting to throw their pyrotechnics around, and no matter what community you live in, there&rsquo;s a chance of some reckless kid carelessly tossing some dangerous firecracker somewhere in your direction.

I was going through the bookstores at yesterday&rsquo;s sale day at SM North, hoping to find some bargains. I found a copy of The Rock&rsquo;s book, The Rock Says going for the bargain basement price of 50 pesos (roughly 1 US dollar). What a steal!
In case you&rsquo;ve been living under, well, a rock, you&rsquo;re probably aware that The Rock was one of the most popular, most electrifying men in professional wrestling, lovingly termed &ldquo;sports entertainment.

One of the nice things about Magic: Online is the concept of &ldquo;Nix Tix&rdquo;. Basically, for a few days during holidays, 8-man drafts no longer require the usual 2 tickets to play. You simply need the product used for the draft (3 booster packs) in order to join an 8-man draft. And since the payout is also in booster packs, distributed as 4-3-2-2, you can basically keep playing 8-man drafts for free as long as you get at least two wins per draft.

My mother told me it&rsquo;s so they don&rsquo;t try to take home anything from their shoes. She said she heard it from someone who works at SM, supposed to be some kind of standard procedure in department stores. So yeah, I have no idea if it&rsquo;s true.

Via insertcredit.com :
Apparently, DQ IX coming out on the DS is a big deal over in the land of the rising sun. And the fact that the combat system will be action-style instead of turn-based. Did they really expect the game to keep doing the same thing again and again forever? Anyway, the DS is a better platform for it&hellip; Square-Enix already has one flagship RPG series on the consoles (Final Fantasy), and none yet on handhelds, so why not just move their second-oldest title there?

Something I didn&rsquo;t expect from the Youtube phenomenon: apparently, FAQ writers can now link to instructional videos for difficult to describe game walkthroughs. If you don&rsquo;t have any idea what I mean, an &ldquo;FAQ&rdquo; is a document that helps someone to do a particular thing by providing answers to Frequently Asked Questions. In my case, I most often read FAQs for video games to help through the difficult spots, usually from GameFAQs.

Awesome article in The Escapist titled The Rise and Fall of Troika, which gives a good view of the problems facing game development studios with regards to production/publisher issues.
I got the link from the blog at rampantgames.com which I&rsquo;ve been following for a while now. I find the articles about the indie gaming field very enlightening, and I have to say going the route of an indie game developer is much more appealling to me especially after reading about all the issues game dev studios have with big-time publishers.

When you&rsquo;re a kid, the days leading up to Christmas are full of wonder and anticipation, and you eagerly await that time when the gifts under the Christmas tree are finally handed out to the recipients and you tear open those packages with such enthusiasm and disregard for the effort put into wrapping it.
As an adult, the days leading up to Christmas are filled up with days of overtime as you struggle to meet year-end targets, constantly having to attend gathering after gathering, and worrying about whether you&rsquo;ve gotten the right presents for people.

Today is the first day of my four-week hiatus from week, after an exhausting three-day overtime streak I basically collapsed into bed last night.
Over the past week people have been asking me why I would take a month-long break from work. Am I going somewhere out of town? Sightseeing? By sheer coincidence I was also looking over a copy of The Little Prince, and one of the chapters there echoed perfectly my sentiments about all these questions: why are all you grown-ups so worried about so-called &ldquo;matters of consequence&rdquo;?

I remember looking for the signs that would tell me where to find the A11 bus that could take me to North Point. My instructions were to find the McDonald&rsquo;s inside the airport and look for the exit nearby. Sure enough, the signs pointed me to the bus terminal. I bought a ticket, and as I arranged my luggage for easier carrying I didn&rsquo;t notice that I had dropped the just-purchased ticket to the floor.

on the PSP. How sad that my all-time favorite console game is getting a bunch of spiffy new features on a handheld I chose not to support. =(
At least we are getting a Dragon Quest release for the DS.

I made it back to the country just two days before the last big Standard event of 2007, and I had no deck ready.
On Saturday morning, I quickly cobbled together a RGB off the obvious theme of hating Islands. Minor land destruction theme (4 Cryoclasm, 4 Mwonvuli Acid-Moss), Elephant and Solifuge beats and always going for the Demonfire finish. The black was in the main only for Hit // Run, my answer to Akroma and Bogardan Hellkite.

One of the difficult things about my three-week sojourn is that I had almost no internet access; the one internet terminal we could use at the site was unbearably slow, and even when it was free, it was hard to slack off reading Slashdot when there were several other people busily working nearby.
Being without internet is like living under a rock apparently; you have no idea what&rsquo;s going on in the world.

Yeah I know, Hong Kong is technically a part of China, but my feet actually did manage to walk some non-Hong Kong Chinese territory. Too many stories accumulated in three weeks to tell in one post though, but to say the least I actually got to experience a bit more of Hong Kong this time, as opposed to the five-day almost-all-work schedule that I had last time.
Unfortunately, I did not get to experience any kung-fu in the streets, although I did manage to get a picture with Jacky Chan.

What a long, arduous journey it has been for Roland of Gilead, last gunslinger, in his inexorable quest for the Dark Tower. And now that I&rsquo;ve read the final volume of Stephen King&rsquo;s magnum opus, I find out that it is an even crueler fate that awaits him at the end of the seven books.
I dare not spoil it, though Wikipedia has a nice summary, say thankya. Save to say that Stephen King seems to be correct &ndash; the ending of the Dark Tower series does seem to be the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; one, despite some disappointments in writing.

Same deck as last week.
Round 1: 2-0 vs WUb Sliver-Mill.
I asked him afterwards why he didn&rsquo;t show me any Traumatize, he said it was only in the board.
Round 2: 2-0 vs Solar Flare
Game one he only gets four lands, he manages to animate a Skeletal Vampire, but Glare taps the blockers and pushes the kill.
Game two he gets nothing but ten lands and a Remand.

I predict that eventually, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t&rdquo;, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t&rdquo;, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t&rdquo; and the like will eventually become their own words, dropping that weird apostrophe they have.
A few decades after this happens, some people will wonder what &ldquo;wan&rsquo;t&rdquo; used to stand for.

This tournament and three others for each Saturday of November are run-ups to the Time Spiral Gold Rush tournament in December. I&rsquo;ve been agonizing over the past couple of weeks as to what I can play in the diverse new standard enivornment. In the end, instead of doing my usual thing and building an original decklist, I decided to work from an existing archetype instead. I believe that in order for me to become a better Standard player, I have to get more match experience before designing decks, since my thinking is still on a casual level most of the time.

I was holding off on buying the sixth installment of the Dark Tower until I could find a printing which matched the previous five books, but as I was browsing through the new Fully Booked at SM North I felt a compulsive urge to buy *something*, and lo and behold, Stephen King was on the shelf right beside me!
As usual, the tale of Roland and his party on their quest for the Dark Tower is quite the page-turner, especially since this particular piece of fiction intersects with the real world in an intruiging way&hellip; the author himself, Stephen King, appears in this book as the would-be creator of Roland&rsquo;s world!

This series is simple awesome. The writing is excellent, and the fact they&rsquo;re using a lot of precognition implies how well the entire series should tie together.
Hiro continues to be the shining star here. Future Hiro&rsquo;s appearance promises us several things, namely:
  Hiro will eventually stop being so dorky. And he&rsquo;ll get a sword!
  Hiro will eventually learn to speak English well
  Peter will eventually get a scar

I wish I had a camera right now so I could post a picture of it, but yeah, I now have a brand-new 19-inch widescreen LCD monitor on my desk. Wow, I have so much space! Both physical space and desktop space!
I came home at past 12 midnight last night and was so sleepy I would have immediately went into a catatonic sleep had my brother not brought home and installed this new monitor.

Awesome thing for old-school gamers &ndash; CGW has made available PDFs of their first 100 issues here. It&rsquo;s fun to read reviews and insights about old games. Ah, and the ads! I like seeing old ads for some strange reason.

Yesterday at NG Galleria. My record for this event was 4-3, running B/G with red splash. I initially thought red was very weak in TS limited, but as I got to the end of the tourney I found myself splashing more and more red cards. Bogardan Rager in particular I underestimated.
At least I can somehow feel my skill level improving. There&rsquo;s this guy who&rsquo;s beaten me two tourneys in a row now, both with edge-of-the-seat wins decided in a single turn.

I predicted it as soon as I saw one of those DS thingies:

The stylus should have a little rope tying it to the DS.
