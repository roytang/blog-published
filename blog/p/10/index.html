So last April my friends and I took a second trip to Japan. This time we mostly stayed around Tokyo, while taking a few days off in-between to visit Fuji, Hakone and Nikko.

My first Persona game was Persona 4 Golden on the Vita &ndash; a fantastic game. After that I dived into Persona 3 Portable and eventually the spin-off games Persona 4 Arena (and Ultimax) and Persona Q on 3DS. So it was no surprise that one of the game releases I was most looking forward to this yearÂ would be the next numbered game in the series: Persona 5 on the Playstation 4.

I haven&rsquo;t been blogging too much recently. I got busy for a while and had to skip a few weeks, and then general laziness prevented me from resuming a regular posting schedule. (Hopefully that ends now.) Most of the time my ranting was on social media, which got me thinking: Is writing on your own blog still useful in this day and age of social media?
I&rsquo;ve been blogging for a long time &ndash; my archives say 2002 &ndash; waaay before Facebook or even Twitter came around.

First, the spoiler-free summary (spoilers after this part):
 overall a very entertaining movie to sit down and watch popcorn and to enjoy the jokes and the space battles and the different colored lights and the tiny adorable tree creature GOTG&rsquo;s humor was one of its strong points and for the 2nd movie, they push the comedy up a notch, perhaps a little too much in some places. Lots of funny gags and one-liners I felt like some of the character/background development stuff was pushed a bit too hard as well the movie&rsquo;s plot also felt a bit thin and straightforward.

I recently attended a few training sessions for MarkLogicheld at an office in a nearby business center. Now, I'll forgive you for not knowing what MarkLogic is, as even I hadn't heard of it before six months ago. MarkLogic is (apparently) the leading Enterprise NoSQL provider.     NoSQL is big and sexy right now because of the supposed advantages in handling big data, and large web companies like Google and Facebook use a lot of NoSQL in the backend.

A couple of years ago, two friends and I were being tourists in Barcelona. With its wide, spacious streets and strangely uniform city blocks, we walked around a lot. During one of our tourist days, we decided to eat someÂ paellaÂ on the way back to our AirBNB. Who comes to Barcelona and doesn&rsquo;t eatÂ paella right?
We ended up walking for quite a while. Every time we came upon a new restaurant that servedÂ paella we would consider the price and the restaurant and would think, hey maybe we can find somewhere better or cheaper further along the way.

With The FFXIII trilogy not being particularly well-received and FFXIV being an MMO, Final Fantasy XV has been a long awaited as the next mainline single-player game in the much-acclaimed series. This review will have minor spoilers.
Story
FFXV follows the story of Noctis, prince of Lucis and his band of brothers (okay they&rsquo;re not really brothers, but they might as well be). They&rsquo;re supposed to be on a road trip to get Noctis married, but things happen along the way and eventuallyÂ they haveÂ to figure out how to liberate their homeland from The Evil Empire.

Back in 2004, I signed up for the Google Code JamÂ for the first time. Unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t make it past the qualifying round.
I was a bit luckier in 2008 and 2010, making it to round 2 both times. In fact in 2008 as I recall I was one of only two participants from the Philippines who made it to round 2, which allowed me to jokingly brag about being the #2 programmer in the country.

I&rsquo;m not a fan of scary movies. I don&rsquo;t appreciate the idea of paying money to get surprised by jump scares or whatever.
Back when I was a kid I remember my dad watching a Betamax copy ofÂ The GateÂ back home and me and my younger brother were watching with him and the movie seriously creeped me out. There was this one scene where a demonic eye manifested on the lead kid&rsquo;s palm and that scene stuck with me for a while.

Heir to the Empire by Timothy Zahn My rating: 4 of 5 stars
I realize that the Thrawn trilogy is no longer canon, what with The Force Awakens and all. But I remember reading an interview with Zahn in Inquest Magazine a lifetime ago and how his trilogy was one of the best parts of the extended universe so when I found a used copy I picked it up. The story is pretty good, taking place 5 years after Jedi, and explores what happens to the galaxy and the efforts of the Empire remnants to mount a comeback.

Yet I&rsquo;ve worked as a software developer for more than a decade now. Literally zero times have I needed to write a sorting function or balance a BST.

At any point in time, what you are doing can be grouped into one of four buckets:
 Planning Executing a plan Reacting to something Relaxing (leisure time)  Overthinkers tend to do too much of #1. The most efficient people probably spend most of their time in #2. People whose lives are chaotic do too much of #3. Almost all people don&rsquo;tÂ get enough #4. (I might be doing too much of #4~)

I&rsquo;ve been hesitant to try Python 3.x because it&rsquo;s not backward compatible with Python 2.x which I&rsquo;ve been using for scripting since forever. But recently I found out that since Python 3.3, they&rsquo;ve included a launcher in the Windows versionÂ that supports having both versions installed.

We put people into boxes because it is convenient.

I had been meaning to try writing a Twitter bot for a while now.Â I figured a trivia bot would be pretty easy to implement, so I spent some time a couple of weekends to rig one together.
It&rsquo;s (mostly) working now, the bot is active asÂ triviastorm on Twitter, with a supporting webapp deployed onÂ http://trivia.roytang.net/. The bot tweets out a trivia question once everyÂ hour. It will then award points to the first five people who gave the correct answer.

There&rsquo;s this well-known idea that it takes ten thousand hours of practice to become an expert in something. But of course, it has to be ten thousandÂ meaningful hours of practice. Meaningful here means that you are actually learning something from your practice. If you are repeating the same hour ten thousand times, that&rsquo;s not worth very much.
Instead, we should be actively learning while we practice. This means identifying our weak points and learning how we can improve.

What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures by Malcolm Gladwell My rating: 4 of 5 stars
I don&rsquo;t even know when I started reading this, I&rsquo;ve had a bookmark in it for maybe three or four years now. It&rsquo;s a collection of Gladwell&rsquo;s articles from the New Yorker, so that&rsquo;s to be expected - not exactly designed to be consumed all in one sitting. The book is Gladwell&rsquo;s usual mix of anecdotes spun into pop psychology and meant to make you ask questions or suggest some insight about this or that.

After Hearthstone, I tried out a couple of other digital CCGs:Â Spellweaver and Eternal, but neither one hooked me. The one I enjoyed the most and did pick up to play regularly was Duelyst. So this review is written from the perspective of someone who has played both Magic the Gathering (MTG) and Hearthstone (HS).
Hearthstone, Spellweaver and Eternal played like digital MTG with some advantages, as I outlined in the HS post linked above.

There are a few things that one should consider when using and integrating an open source library into your application:
 What are the licensing terms for the library? There are some liberal licenses that mostly let you do anything you want. The MIT license is an example of a very permissive license. Other licenses may provide a number of restrictions. Can you integrate with closed-source software? Can you distribute binaries without the source?

Back when IÂ was starting out as a software developer, webapps weren&rsquo;t really a thing. Not as much as they are now anyway.Â My company provided training to new hires, but I didn&rsquo;t get any web development training at the time, even though they already had a few web development projects in play at the time.
Instead my initial training involved mostly development of so-called client-server software. This was software that was installed and run on the client machine but they would connect to a remote database server.

Hopefully by now most developers and project managers are well aware ofÂ the mythical man-month and Brooks&rsquo; Law:
 Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later
 The idea is that communications overhead scales up quickly as you add more people to a project. Oftentimes it is counter-intuitively not worthwhile to keep adding more people to try to catch up. Some implications of larger team/project size may not be immediately obvious.

At my old job I used to have this group of coworkers I had Friday lunch outs with. Inevitably, every Friday around noonÂ someone would message the others asking &ldquo;where are we eating?&rdquo;. Now, there are a lot of good places to eat around the area and we&rsquo;ve all been working there a while so most of the time we don&rsquo;t care where we eat and we&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;ll decide when we get to the elevators.

Just a list I&rsquo;ve been maintaining for a while:
(Disclaimer: This list in no way implies that developers who don&rsquo;t exhibit all of these attributes are terrible human beings who don&rsquo;t deserve to live. But working with developers who exhibit many of these traits will probably result in a better experience over the course of your developer career.)
 Laziness, Impatience and Hubris &ndash; from the well-known (notorious?) Larry Wall quote Communicates well; is able to explain and communicate his ideas clearly, especially to nontechnical people; able to write good documentation Understands the concerns with scheduling and project management and communicates clearly with the team to avoid problems.

So the other day I wasÂ reworkingÂ a Python script that I had been using for years on my home PC to manage and categorize some downloaded files for me. This time I wanted to add some smarter behavior to make it more able to figure out when to group files into folders without constantly needing manual intervention from me. To do this, I needed to persist someÂ data between runs &ndash; so that the script remembers how it categorized previous files and is able to group similar files together.

&ldquo;Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.&rdquo;
  â Winston S. Churchill
 In the current world political climate, it seems that in many instances democracy and the related values (equality, human rights, and so on) are increasingly taking a back seat to populism and increasingly authoritarian leaderships. One sometimes has toÂ consider whether authoritarian states would in fact be more effective in this day and age.

<div class="content p-summary">
Because of the nature of the web and the fact that you should never trust user input, allÂ the validation in a web application should be done on the server side. You can additionally provide validation on the client side (via JavaScript), but this is only a concession towards a better user experience and should not be used as a substitute for server-side validation.
One would think that anyone with a basic understanding of how HTTP works would understand the above easily and any failure to practice it should be considered amateur hour.

The Hobbit or There and Back Again by J.R.R. Tolkien My rating: 5 of 5 stars
Starting the year off right with some Tolkien. The book is unapologetic about how it drags both unsuspecting Bilbo and the reader down a long adventure that includes a lot of singing and being captured and being almost eaten. I&rsquo;m not sure how they managed to stretch it into three movies though, the book isn&rsquo;t particularly long.

Just in time for the end of the year, I finally finished Xenoblade Chronicles X, which I started playing around the first week of August (5 months!), with 120+ hours of game time. The game doesn&rsquo;t have the best graphics (WiiU, etc), but I really like how it looks and how the world is built and all the different environments and the weird and sometimes absurdly large beasts.
There&rsquo;s a whole lot of stuff to do in-game.

In one of my most recent projects, a large system that had gone through a relatively long and unstable period of many, many changes due to sales demonstrations, different clients and whatnot, one of the &ldquo;fun buffer tasks&rdquo; I always kept around for devs was code cleanup. Because of the unstable nature of the project, there was always a lot of duplication, unused/unnecessary/obsolete classes/functions/files and so on. Unnecessarily large CSS files where most of the selectors were no longer really needed or JS libraries that weren&rsquo;t actually used.

<div class="content p-summary">
I traditionally try to save some time on the week between Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s Day to do some cleaning up and decluttering of my stuff. One would assume that having more time meant I would be better able to organize my stuff and all that, but one would be wrong. My room still has stacks of books, toys, Magic cards and other stuff in random places.
Or maybe I just have too much OCD that I want everything to be neat and organized, but I&rsquo;m not industrious enough to make it happen.

While many people working as programmers/software developers are happy enough specializing in a single programming language or platform, I generally consider it a better idea to have a wider toolset and the ability to easily pick up new programming languages as needed. The benefits should be obvious: when you have a wide variety of tools under your belt and areÂ able to quickly learn to use a new tool, the number of work options you have increases greatly.

When Hanamichi Sakuragi from the mangaÂ Slam Dunk tries to get into the basketball club, he insists he&rsquo;s a genius who doesn&rsquo;t need to practice the basics and instead wants to go immediately to doing spectacular things like Slam Dunks.
Sadly, the vast majority of us cannot claim to be geniuses at anything, and we are forced to undergo a bit of hard work if we want to learn a new skill.

In any reasonably large software project, the system will be so large that no one developer will have a good grasp of the details of every function in the codebase.
The tendency is for developers to specialize &ndash; that is, developers tend to focus only on certain parts of the codebase and become more familiar with that part, while not having much knowledge about the other parts. This tendency is self-reinforcing &ndash; once it becomes known that the developer is an &ldquo;expert&rdquo; in the given module, there is a tendency that he will be assigned the most difficult and urgent tasks or fixes related to that module, further cementing his expertise.

I was in a meeting once with my boss (literally the CEO, a Malaysian) and some representatives of another company (Americans) where we were discussing the technical details of a possible future partnership.

As I recall, today was at least my fifthÂ Nanowrimo attempt; the first one was sometime before 2003 (I would guess it was in 2000 or 2001 before I graduated from college), the second one was in 2003, then 2006, then 2011, then finally the fifth one this year. My best prior attempt was back in 2011, when I made it up to 22,000+ words.
At just around 1am on the early morning of November 30th this year, I beat that record and have won Nanowrimo for the first time.

<div class="content p-summary">
In JavaScript, referencingÂ variables that are declared outside of a function&rsquo;s scope can be tricky.Â If you have code like this:
var btn = document.getElementById(&#34;BTN&#34;); var test = 1; btn.onclick = function() { alert(test); } test = 2; The click handler above retains a reference to the test variable even though it falls out of scope as soon as the script block finishes execution. When you actually click the button, the alert will show the last value of the variable when the block finished execution (2) instead of the value at the time the function was initialized (1).

If a friend found out your work was horrible, would you want to know? Or would your feelings be hurt?
If your coworkers think you&rsquo;re doing something wrong, would you prefer that they keep quiet or that they call you out?
As a leader, do you prefer to have sycophants who sing your praises or people who are willing to tell you that you have no clothes?
Is your ego more important than doing a good job orÂ self-improvement?

The Amber Spyglass by Philip Pullman My rating: 3 of 5 stars
Pros:
- I liked having the bear back
- Diamond-legged creatures with wheels!
- An honest effort to tie up all the loose ends and give each character decent endings
- A decent read, at least
Cons:
- allegories aren&rsquo;t very subtle
- people get miraculously redeemed, even Mrs Coulter who was such a great villain
- build up of Asriel&rsquo;s awesome plan to take the War to Heaven only to find out he didn&rsquo;t really know what he was doing until he found out he had to somehow help two kids find their pets
