Globe&rsquo;s Spam Reports Policy
A few days ago I got dragged into a debate over Twitter regarding Globe&rsquo;s policy on handling reports sent in via Twitter about spam/scam text messages. When you send in reports of text spams via Twitter, one of Globe&rsquo;s representatives will ask you to agree that in case the spammer disputes the allegation, they would have to disclose your mobile number to them. For me, the policy seems completely reasonable: if you accuse someone of a crime, they should have a right to know what exactly they are accused of and who exactly the victim was.

Thirty-six is a semiperfect number, meaning it is the sum of some subsets of its natural divisors.
 Like thirty-six, life isn&rsquo;t perfect either. But there&rsquo;s still much to be thankful for.
I am grateful that I have a roof over my head and am able to eat at least three square meals a day (if I so choose).
I am grateful that I have wonderful parents and siblings who are always ready to support me no matter what shenanigans I get into.

Well, I haven&rsquo;t written anything in a while, so I figured I&rsquo;d write some words on the new Spider-Man movie. Spoilers abound!
Action-packed! The web-swinging is fun and looks and feels just like Spidey from the comic books. Spider-man moves and fights and banters pretty faithfully to the comic book version of our favorite wall-crawler, so that&rsquo;s a definite plus. Peter&rsquo;s Spider-sense is portrayed as a slow-motion bullet-time kind of deal which allows him to react quickly and save all the people while dodging everything.

I wrote some stuff about Vita vs 3DS in a Reddit post, I thought I&rsquo;d expand on it here.
I have access to both a first-generation 3DS with ambassador status (this is actually my brother&rsquo;s but he doesn&rsquo;t use it much) and a PS Vita which is only a couple of months old. I use the Vita a lot more because reasons:
 The screen is very very nice, especially compared to the 3DS screens.

 Movement for Good Governance briefers on Senatorial candidates Rappler Senatorial profiles I would also Google &ldquo;rappler [candidate name] interview&rdquo; for the interview article for each candidate (too many to list here)  Here&rsquo;s a link to a Google doc of my own notes on each candidate, which I used as basis for recommendations below.

People who follow me on Facebook or Twitter know that I&rsquo;ve been recently made a number of anti-Nancy Binay posts. For a while now I&rsquo;ve been wanting to write a blog post about that and several other election-related thoughts. I&rsquo;ve decided to present these thoughts it as a fictional chat between made-up characters. Totally fictional characters. Any resemblance to actual people living or dead = pure coincidence. (Although if you must try to imagine these characters, you can imagine jaeger as a dashing idealist, in-in as a cynical pragmatist, ORYLY as a carefree vagabond and Scrappy coco as someone who just wandered into the wrong room.

Just rewatched the ending of X-Men First Class. As far as origin stories go, it&rsquo;s pretty decent (although a number of continuity issues with the other X-Men movies exist). Charles getting crippled during the time that he and Erik part ways is certainly better than the canon comics story of him getting crippled by a random alien. The use of the Cuban Missile Crisis was also a good idea considering how the timeline matched up with Erik&rsquo;s time in the Nazi camps.

Wednesday, March 20, 7:56pm We were four of us walking down the barely lit passage on the side of the building. The guard had lazily pointed us to a large open door near the back of the building. The interior was a studio-type area and there was a group of three women dressed in white who had arrived ahead of us and we followed them up a narrow set of stairs to an elevated lounge area with chairs and tables.

Due to general business and/or laziness I&rsquo;ve missed a few weeks of posting so to get back into pace I&rsquo;m going to go through the current Marvel NOW titles and see how they&rsquo;re going so far. (We&rsquo;ll see if I have time for DCnU later)
Captain America (4 issues in) - I&rsquo;m not a big fan of Romita&rsquo;s art but at least it&rsquo;s better in this book than his AvX work.

&ldquo;Sir, baka pwedeng lipat na lang kayo ng taxi,&rdquo; the driver said to me apologetically. &ldquo;Hindi na po kasi ako aabot sa garage sa Sta. Mesa.&rdquo; He offered to drop the flag-down fee from the fare so I just agreed. I got off and looked around.
One of the reasons I agreed to let him off despite the late hour was that I knew the place where we were passing by &ndash; a well lit area where I could easily get another taxi or take an alternative form of transportation if needed &ndash; it was the neighborhood I grew up in.

It&rsquo;s a satisfyingly good ending. The book is action-packed, with 80-90% of the book just bloody, bloody fighting, and very little of the whiny manipulative bitchiness that characterized some of the weaker books in the series. As far as I can tell most of the dangling points are wrapped up neatly, many characters get to be heroes and die, etc. Part of me wonders whether I&rsquo;d be this satisfied if Jordan had managed to finish everything himself.

Here are the first few Marvel comics I read this week:
Savage Wolverine #1 by Frank Cho is a fun, action-packed ride. It doesn&rsquo;t explain much of what the heck is going on, but it does feature Wolverine chopping heads off and stabbing dinosaurs in the face so hey, I guess I&rsquo;ll read it for a while!
All-New X-Men #6 sees the young X-Men trying to settle into modern day. I found young Scott&rsquo;s trying to wrap his head around mobile phones, bottled water and $5 magazines particularly amusing.

 Beast newly mutating again. It's not too radical, but I wasn't really a fan of cat-beast anyway, so I don't mind something new Stuart Immonen's artwork is still pretty good My favorite panel here has to be the one with Jean finding out about what happened to her from furry Beast. (See below) It's a nice collage that will be enjoyed by long-time X-fans who will most likely try to identify each and every scene depicted by Immonen in this spread.

 Kenneth Rocafort's art is as usual the highlight of the book for me. This time he gets to draw a full book of Superman in his Action Comics shirt and jeans, plus a few panels of the Justice League. Rocafort is easily the best artist DC comics has at the moment. Amazing build-up of Lex Luthor and how much of a genius/threat he is to Superman. It's terrific that faced with a threat beyond his grasp, Superman's first move is to consult his arch enemy before the Justice League.

DC has an extra week of #15 releases on the first week of January (January 2), since they only had two issues out on Christmas week, which were:
Justice League #15 and Aquaman #15 (Throne of Atlantis)
Geoff Johns finally gives us a bit more characterization in the Justice League, stepping up from the previous issues that seem a bit filler. We get a glimpse of Cyborg&rsquo;s current relationship with his father Clark and Diana on a date in secret identity mode and later saving people together mode (with Lois looking on wistfully maybe?

When I first heard about Amazing Spider-Man ending and being replaced by a new Superior Spider-Man series starring someone other than Peter Parker, my first thought was: maybe they&rsquo;re finally retiring Peter for good. Peter is at a pretty good point in his personal life: he has a good, fulfilling job at Horizon Labs so he doesn&rsquo;t have to miss the bills, Aunt May is well taken care of by Jameson Sr.

It&rsquo;s &ldquo;Last Week in Marvel NOW!&rdquo; since this is going up on Sunday/Monday. And what a lot of Marvel NOW! we got, since many of the top titles are double shipping this month. Hopefully the schedule normalizes back to monthlies soon, I&rsquo;m already reading far too many books as it is! (Well, that&rsquo;s kind of a good problem to have right?) Luckily Marvel only has two books coming out on Christmas week, gives me some time to catch up.

For some reason I remembered today this D&amp;D roleplaying session with some people a while back (I wasn&rsquo;t participating, just observing). The party had come into a village tavern looking for information, and there was this tavern wench who was acting a bit suspiciously in their eyes. As she exited the main tavern room (presumably to get more ale or whatever), one of the party members who for some reason was armed with a pitchfork declared that he would stop her from leaving the room by throwing the pitchfork in her path.

There&rsquo;s really far, far too many comics I read each week to cover them in one blog post so I&rsquo;ll just cover them in groups. First, the non-Marvel NOW! series:
Hawkeye #6 is the highlight of this week&rsquo;s Marvel releases. The book is consistently funny, down-to-earth and awesome, and this issue is one of the best so far. If you haven&rsquo;t heard about it, the series written by Matt Fraction is one of Marvel&rsquo;s best ongoings right now.

Well, missed posting about last week&rsquo;s comics due to some technical difficulties with my home computer, let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t get back on track.
There&rsquo;s a lot to look forward to this week on the Marvel side. There&rsquo;s All-New X-Men #4 where we&rsquo;ll finally get to see Cyclops face off with his younger/older self. My other favorite so far of the Marvel NOW! books has the second issue this week: Avengers #2 continues the introductory arc to Jonathan Hickman&rsquo;s Avengers epic, let&rsquo;s see how he handles the large cast he&rsquo;s playing with.

Easily the best comic I&rsquo;ve read this week (and I&rsquo;ve already read a lot!) is the Marvel NOW! Relaunch of the Avengers book. Avengers vol. 5 #1 by Jonathan Hickman and Jerome Opena ushers in a brand new era of Avengers; bigger, bolder and looking to be a lot more epic.

8 Dec 2012 3:49pmClose   Jonathan Hickman, fresh off what many consider to be the best Fantastic Four run in recent history (if not all-time), takes over from former Avengers showrunner Brian Michael Bendis and immediately shows us how his take on the Earth&rsquo;s Mightiest Heroes is going to set itself apart from Bendis&rsquo; 200+ issue run.

It&rsquo;s actually kind of a light week this week. There&rsquo;s a couple of Marvel NOW! #1s coming in, and nothing too exciting particularly on the DC side.
The #1 I&rsquo;m most looking forward to the most this week has to be Jonathan Hickman and Jerome Opena&rsquo;s Avengers #1 (link leads to preview pages). It&rsquo;s a new era for the Avengers as a new creative team takes over from Bendis, and it looks like Hickman will be bringing over his tendency for epic-scale adventures from the Fantastic Four books over to the Avengers franchise.

Let&rsquo;s see what the comic book man brought us this week! (Mild spoilers may ensue)
Uncanny Avengers #2 (Marvel)

30 Nov 2012 1:09pmClose   To be honest this book was not at the top of my to-read list since I was a bit underwhelmed by the first book. But that may have been a product of reading too many preview pages so that basically the only surprise I got was the shock ending of what Red Skull was doing to Xavier&rsquo;s corpse.

Writing regularly is something I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be able to do but like most things I have trouble with, it&rsquo;s the lack of discipline that gets me.
Take this blog for instance. I randomly think of things to write about while I&rsquo;m idling or commuting or waiting in line or any of the dozen or so other opportunities during the day when my mind wanders, but because of laziness and/or lack of discipline, these ideas never get very far.

This week&rsquo;s biggest issue was Amazing Spider-Man #698. With three issues before the series finale and Dan Slott hyping up the ending arc and still keeping a tight lid on who may be taking over Peter&rsquo;s role in Superior Spider-Man in January, I was really excited to be able to read the first part of the final Dying Wish arc.

When I was growing up, our mom would make this sandwich spread concoction that was a mix of cheese, butter, sugar and milk. I loved it, and when my mom told young me what the ingredients are I quickly gave it the name &ldquo;Cheetergarmi&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m sure you can figure it out). She still occasionally makes some for us to this day, just had some for a midnight snack!
Also, I pretty much wrote this post so that I could have a Google search term that returns a single hit to a blog post of mine.

The last two entries (here and here) took too long to write, and there&rsquo;s a helluva lot of other titles to go through. And many of them don&rsquo;t deserve much comments, so I&rsquo;ll just go through the rest quickly or I might never finish.
Action Comics &ndash; the younger Superman stories are interesting, but occasionally Morrison goes off on one of his weird tangent stories. Superman&rsquo;s early years are largely re-written, and that&rsquo;s understandable, he&rsquo;s never had particularly interesting events in his history anyway

Last weekend was Grand Prix Manila 2012, held at the SMX at Mall of Asia. I don&rsquo;t really consider myself a &ldquo;regular&rdquo; Magic player anymore so I&rsquo;m not going to give a full tournament report, though I will record some details for posterity.
Let&rsquo;s start with the deck. I played some version of Naya Pod, limited by what cards were available as usual:
A Pile of Naya  Creatures   4 Birds of Paradise   3 Avacyn Pilgrim   1 Ulvenwald Tracker   4 Strangeleroot Geist   2 Thalia, Guardian of Thraben   1 Daybreak Ranger   2 Borderland Ranger   2 Blade Splicer   2 Fiend Hunter   2 Wolfir Avenger   1 Phyrexian Metamorph   2 Hero of Bladehold   2 Huntmaster of the Fells   3 Restoration Angel   1 Oxida Scrapmelter   1 Acidic Slime    Spells   2 Birthing Pod   1 Bonfire of the Damned    Lands   4 Copperline Gorge   4 Razorverge Thicket   3 Sunpetal Grove   2 Rootbound Crag   2 Gavony Township   1 Slayer Stronghold   2 Cavern of Souls   4 Forest   1 Mountain   1 Plains    Sideboard   1 Ancient Grudge   2 Ray of Revelation   1 Zealous Conscripts   2 Garruk Relentless   2 Celestial Purge   3 Thunderbolt   2 Arc Trail   1 Surgical Extraction   1 Oblivion Ring       It&rsquo;s a pretty straightforward deck, what with the turning guys sideways and all.

This is part 2 of my DC New 52 Review. Part is here. Hopefully I finish this series before the reviews become too out of date.

I decided to read every book of the New 52 to widen my horizons regarding my comic book reading, and one of the greatest advantages has been exposure to Scott Snyder&rsquo;s work. I have a tendency not to remember writers and artists of comics I read, except for the very famous ones, so I wasn&rsquo;t aware that I had read his work before during the Black Mirror arc in Detective Comics pre-New 52.

Time for some Monday morning quarterbacking!
Disclaimer: I Am Not A Lawyer. I&rsquo;m just a guy with opinions. And you know what they say about opinions&hellip;
Today, the Philippine Senate has impeached the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court by a vote of 20 to 3.
I&rsquo;ve generally kept silent about the CJ trial, mainly because I know people who are rabidly pro-Corona and I don&rsquo;t feel like getting into an argument with someone who&rsquo;s obviously biased (I&rsquo;m sorry my friends, we are going to have to agree to disagree now).

If you&rsquo;re reading this, that means I&rsquo;ve done it: I&rsquo;ve read the first eight issues of every DC New 52 book. I&rsquo;ve always been a Marvel fan more than DC, my previous DC reading having been restricted to JLA and the Batman books, so I figured exposure to the New 52 would widen my appreciation of the DC stable of heroes. Here are my reviews:
Justice League
While the art is Jim Lee-fantastic, the first story arc left much to be desired.

Somehow the years seem to fly by more quickly nowadays. They all seem to blend in together too, at least in my memory. When I was thinking of what to write for this post I thought that this was the year I had taken my break from working. That was actually last year.
I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a sign that I&rsquo;m growing old. Maybe more of a sign of the fact that I&rsquo;ve settled in to some sort of routine that makes it difficult to tell the days or even years apart.

Hi,
About this new website design/whatever. I am glad that you know have 2-factor authentication to protect me from fraudulent online transactions, but please check the following problems ( I gave up trying to post this using your messaging system, see #3 below):
  Please fix or replace the horribly unusable custom combo box control you have. When using it to select a payee while making a payment, it&rsquo;s difficult and counterintuitive to scroll up and down the list (it seems I must hover my mouse over the up and down arrows on the scrollbar).

So Metro Manila is at the peril of heavy rains, flooding and traffic again (as often happens this time of the year) and I thought I&rsquo;d do some actual blogging for a change.
I didn&rsquo;t want to brave the rush hour traffic last night so I finally got around to watching X-Men First Class (luckily it was still showing at Mega). I had actually seen Green Lantern first despite X1C showing two weeks before the DC movie.

Haven&rsquo;t done a tournament report in a while. Heck, I haven&rsquo;t really played tournament Magic in a while, not seriously at least. For that reason it may have been a bad idea to run with a deck that requires a lot of matchup knowledge to play. The tournament was Grand Prix Singapore 2011, the format was standard and my weapon of choice was Caw Blade:
  Lands   4 Island   3 Plains   4 Celestial Colonnade   4 Glacial Fortress   1 Inkmoth Nexus   1 Marsh Flats   1 Scalding Tarn   4 Seachrome Coast   4 Tectonic Edge    Creatures   4 Stoneforge Mystic   4 Squadron Hawk   2 Mirran Crusader    Spells   4 Preordain   4 Spell Pierce   3 Mana Leak   3 Into the Roil   2 Condemn   1 Sword of Feast and Famine   1 Sword of War and Peace   1 Batterskull   1 Jace Beleren   4 Jace the Mind Sculptor    Sideboard   1 Sword of Body and Mind   1 Sylvok Lifestaff   2 Spellskite   3 Flashfreeze   2 Divine Offering   2 Celestial Purge   2 Day of Judgment   2 Dismember       I actually ran this deck through a couple of grinders, both times losing to RUG variants, and that was practically all the playtesting time I had aside from a few random casual games the Friday before the GP.

I was in Singapore from June 2 &ndash; June 6, mostly to visit friends who are getting married and compete in the MTG Grand Prix held there last weekend. I like bullet points, so here&rsquo;s a summary of my trip:

 public transportation. One thing Singapore and Hong Kong have in common: well-defined, convenient and tourist-friendly public transportation systems, namely trains and buses. It makes our local buses and trains here pale by comparison.

Okay, story time.
On my way home today as I was about to get on the jeep to Tandang Sora, a woman got off the jeep crying uncontrollably and declaring she would not go with him. Unsure what was going on I walked past the woman who was now wailing unintelligibly outside the jeep. I got on the jeep and took a seat. Inside was this man who was gesturing to the woman outside and telling her to be quiet and just get in the jeep.

I&rsquo;ll spare you the boring details, except for the fact that at some point I had to be given spinal anesthesia while I was fully awake. Now, if you&rsquo;ve never been given spinal anesthesia before, let me give you a rundown: you&rsquo;ll be asked to lie on your side and curl up into something like a C-shaped fetal position so that the anesthesiologist can inject a tiny needle into a small area between the discs of your spinal column.

So, through a complicated series of circumstances where I initiated the process but actually managed to get myself surprised, I now own an iPad Wifi+3g 64GB (yes, it&rsquo;s the most expensive model, don&rsquo;t worry it did not break the piggy bank). It was purchased from Singapore and brought to me by a friend last Friday. I&rsquo;ve used an iPad before (during the CCS trip Baguio), but this is the first time I&rsquo;ve had the chance to customize the applications and content, and have it exclusive for my own use.

I haven&rsquo;t written a tournament report in a while (maybe because I&rsquo;ve been playing rather poorly lately? =/), but Prereleases are always fun right? Here&rsquo;s my Scars of Mirrodin prerelease report!
The first hour was spent waiting in an unbearably hot basement area for the 8th player on our table to register his sealed pool. What? yeah, he was late, and the event started early so the airconditioning was not yet on.

24 Aug 2010 12:15amClose   August 23, 2010: A disgruntled and decorated police officer who had been dismissed on charges of extortion took hostage a bus full of tourists from Hong Kong. The hostage drama unfolded in front of the Quirino Grandstand in Manila with the expected media circus, confused cops and SWAT who didn’t know what to do and a tragic ending that involved dead hostages and a bullet to the head.

I maybe getting older but as anyone can attest, I&rsquo;m still a child at heart.
As they say: life is a journey, not a destination. I still don&rsquo;t know what my destination is, but I&rsquo;ll keep moving forward one step at a time.
Looking forward to the next power of two.
