Yup. This week, for the first time ever, I&rsquo;m leaving the country, and flying down to HK to provide support for the rollout of the project I&rsquo;ve been with for the past year and a half. First time to leave the country, and I&rsquo;m gonna be flying alone to a country where people speak a language I can recognize but not understand. I&rsquo;m understandably a bit freaked out; who wouldn&rsquo;t be, right?

I hate KOTOR. Not because it&rsquo;s a bad game, in fact it&rsquo;s the exact opposite. It&rsquo;s a fantastic game. With the unfortunate side effect that everything else gets pushed back so I cam play some more. This was actually the first time I&rsquo;d done some serious &lsquo;net surfing since I borrowed David&rsquo;s KOTOR copy. Here&rsquo;s my take on it in a post to RPG-Skies: This game is fantastic! I borrowed my friend&rsquo;s copy after he finished it, so I only started it last week, but it&rsquo;s already eaten up a lot of my (non-work) time.

Seeing as how Cheese (the machine I bought in March) broke down for the umpteenth time, I finally decided to buy a second computer, and went out and bought a new machine (code-name: Barbecue) the day before Christmas. Spent less than I had expected, but the machine is pretty decent, except my video card is a measly 64Mb GeForce2. I&rsquo;ll probably post the specs later. Finished Final Fantasy X-2, at 67% story completion (Yeah I suck&hellip;) Maybe I&rsquo;ll post a review of it later.

 a nice website about gaming. I think the contributors all live in Japan, as they always seem to talk about prices in Yen. They&rsquo;ve got some neat stuff, I wish I&rsquo;d found their website before. Also, they keep talking about something called the GP32, and some of the things they say make me curious about it. It&rsquo;s some sort of gaming platform, apparently, but I&rsquo;m too lazy to go through google and find out more details.

I got it same time as FFX-2. However, I can&rsquo;t get it to run&hellip; when I choose &ldquo;Game&rdquo; from the launcher, I just get the little spinning disc cursor for a while, then nothing. I&rsquo;ve tried most of the stuff found in the accompanying troubleshooting doc, and I&rsquo;ve sent Lucasarts a plea for help, but no response so far. Any help?
Actually I had the same problem with Neverwinter Nights when I first got it, and I was able to work that out by downloading the most recent patch.

I&quot;m about two or three hours into it. I like it. But then again, I like anything with a job system and learnable abilities. I find myself excited at the prospect of learning abilities with weird names such as &ldquo;Cheap Shot&rdquo;, &ldquo;Initiative&rdquo;, &ldquo;Flametongue&rdquo; and &ldquo;Silent Samba&rdquo;!
The game itself has a very &ldquo;happy&rdquo; feel&hellip; the battles are fast-paced and the general mood is upbeat. If you came in looking for a Final Fantasy game, you&rsquo;re gonna be disappointed.

Since I got Windows XP a little less than a year ago, I&rsquo;ve tried looking around for cheap (read: free) ways to customize the interface. I did eventually find some solutions, but after trying a nice chrome theme for a while, I eventually went back to the default XP look. Why? I realize now, I like the Luna interface. It&rsquo;s neat. It&rsquo;s one of the best things to come out of Microsoft in eight years.

I&rsquo;m alive, I think.
 Last Saturday, I helped an old man cross a very dangerous street! This may seem a weird thing to report, but it felt unusual enough to be helping a complete stranger. I&rsquo;m not saying I don&rsquo;t normally help complete strangers, but I rarely see people helping old people cross the street!
 I&rsquo;m thinking of getting a domain name and paid webhosting&hellip; there&rsquo;s this host that&rsquo;s cheap and local&hellip; .

So I saw Matrix: Revolutions last Friday. Nice movie, entertaining to watch, but it&rsquo;s not as deep as you&rsquo;d expect, and the Matrix trilogy really ends not with a bang but with a whisper. I like this review, it analyzes things very well.
 I feel like quitting Warcraft III for a while — maybe a couple of weeks. I&rsquo;m not really getting any better at it, and I&rsquo;m a bit bored with it now.

Things are flaky. Have setup this blogger thing to publish to the fateback account (roytang.sinfree.net), seems to be working fine now. Ressurrected one of the older page layouts and added the pandaren brewmaster! Anyway, I&rsquo;ll also probably most of the website stuff from topcities to fateback, seeing as how topcities has gotten crappy lately with the FTP problem. That is all, back to work&hellip;

Whee&hellip; holiday. For those not from the Philippines, All Saints Day and All Souls Day are non-working holidays for us, and the roads are generally jammed anywhere near cemeteries as Filipinos flock to the graveyards to remember their deceased loved ones. Sadly, since my folks are out of town, and I have no idea how to get to the resting place of my grandparents without them, all I can do is say a prayer for them right here.

Yesterday, at around 6 PM, as I was winding up the day&rsquo;s work, we received a request from the user that they wanted some maintenance work done on one of the more obscure programs. And they needed it the next day! And we still had to have a meeting (we had originally scheduled the meeting for 3:00PM but had to keep pushing it due to stuff coming up) I wanted to reach out across the internet and slap whoever made the maintenance request on the head.

&ldquo;If history is to change, let it change!
If the world is to be destroyed, so be it!
If my fate is to die, I must simply laugh.&rdquo;
&ndash; Magus, Chrono Trigger
 For as long as I have known about it, I have always liked this quote. It speaks of a certain ferocity, a certain stubbornness, a firm, unbending belief that whatever life throws at you, you will be able to not only handle it, but laugh in the face of its absurdity.

Well, not exactly. But I am now 25, in any case. Looking back, there are many things I might have regretted, but my life philosphy tells me that there can be no regrets. The past is past, and the future is yet to come. Somehow, I&rsquo;m only a few steps closer towards achieving my lifetime goals, but my gut tells me to keep on dreaming. Such is the folly of a dreamer.

I installed Civilization III, and told myself, &ldquo;Gee, I guess I&rsquo;ll try it out for an hour or so.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t stop for six hours. So much for getting anything done over the weekend. Luckily (or not), my being awake those six hours of early morning allowed me to catch some late-breaking news. Apparently, disgruntled young officers of the not-so-prestigious Armed Forces of the Philippines had taken control of some building in Makati, laying bombs and stuff around and with snipers on the roof and all.

Free time&hellip; that&rsquo;s something I haven&rsquo;t had in a while. Work is tough right now, as we&rsquo;ve got a big deadline coming up in August. I&rsquo;ve been putting in 10-12-hour days on a regular basis over the past couple of weeks or so, so I barely have any time to do anything. (Except for a few quick games of The Frozen Throne (yay!) before going to bed of course.) Of course, the other reason I haven&rsquo;t updated this thing in a fairly long while is that my PC broke down!

Last Tuesday, I got a very rare treat (?). I was invited (under false pretenses I might add) to a seminar trying to sell me to the concept of network markets. It was by a group of people called &ldquo;Network 21&rdquo; who supposedly have a corporate partner in Amway.
Now, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I have nothing against these people, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re enjoying themselves looking for sucke-I mean clients, and convincing them to buy Amway toothpaste and shampoo and vitamins and god-knows-what.

Good plot twists you could see from a mile away.
Unfortunately, we had arrived at the theater too late to catch the start of the last showing of Gangs of New York, so we had to settle with the second choice. _The Recruit _didn&rsquo;t get as much critical acclaim as Gangs, but what the heck, Al Pacino in a spy thriller? How could I lose?
The story is simple enough. Colin Farell plays James Clayton, a young man just out of MIT, recruited by CIA agent William Burke (Pacino).

How&rsquo;s work you ask? It&rsquo;s going pretty well actually. Everything&rsquo;s still easy-peasy for me as I&rsquo;m undergoing some training and stuff. I&rsquo;m a bit worried about what happens after the training though, from the looks of it people put in a lot of overtime here. :( The best thing about the job is that I&rsquo;m learning a lot of stuff. In two weeks I learned SQL, PL/SQL and Delphi. Starting tomorrow I&rsquo;m gonna be training on Oracle Developer.

Yes I do. I bought a new hard drive yesterday, a 40Gb 5400RPM Seagate. It took me a while to get the system up and running again after my plugging it in. First I had to wrestle with my PC&rsquo;s small case, trying to figure out where to place the thing. Then, given how old my PC is, it predictably failed to detect the whole capacity of the drive, insisting it was only 8 Gb.

Well, trying to make this a weekly format thing obviously fizzled out. What with me starting work on Friday, I just give up. I&rsquo;ll keep this site up and put up stuff of interest whenever I feel like it, just like before. So what&rsquo;s new? As I said, work starts Friday. I went to an orientation for the job last Friday and it seems like a tough and demanding job, but I rise to the challenge in any case.

Anyway, I&rsquo;ve had a couple of days to think about it, so I&rsquo;d like to share my thoughts on the matter.
First, the facts:
Enix and Square are merging. Square stock will be bought out for Enix stock at 0.81 Square per 1 Enix. The Square president will be head of Square Enix, the Enix board remains in place, they&rsquo;ll move into Enix headquarters in Shibuya.
All currently announced releases will go on as scheduled.

The Bourne Identity A new action hero is Bourne
I was a bit anxious to see this movie, as I had thoroughly enjoyed the book of the same name a long time ago, and I was hoping the movie would give me the same satisfaction. The Bourne Identity stars Matt Damon as rogue CIA agent/amnesiac Jason Bourne. In his quest to uncover his own identity, Jason travels all around Europe pursued by the CIA&rsquo;s agents and dragging along an innocent gypsy girl who just happened to be his best shot for a ride to Paris.

I turned 24 yesterday.
Generally uneventful birthday, as usual. I&rsquo;m glad I got the whining done in the last post. Spent the night before at David&rsquo;s (whose birthday is a couple of days before mine). Dave, Mon and I played approximately seven hours of CvS2, watched a Jet Li flick then played around eight hours of Warcraft III. WC3 is the bomb! (And it further highlights my craving for a new computer) Anyway, went home the next morning, got some sleep.

I&rsquo;m pissed off.
Today I went to Ortigas for a job interview with a nameless IT company where my cousin Rachel works. I was quite optimistic too — the position was for a &ldquo;Java Trainee.&rdquo; I was more than willing to be trained, and a trainee position meant you didn&rsquo;t have to be proficient in Java right? Turns out I was wrong. =( Apparently they needed someone with some experience in Java, preferably with a project or two under his belt.

My mom had me meet with him hoping he could give me some job-hunting advice. He says that the best thing to do would be to specialize in something like network engineering, 'coz that's where big bucks are, or something.

I originally wasn&rsquo;t going to have a rant today, but while surfing the web I thought about one of the things I like about it: personal websites.
That&rsquo;s right, personal pages. Some people might argue that personal pages are like the dregs of the internet. And they&rsquo;re probably right. Given that any random joe-on-the-street can get on Geocities and build his own website, (like royness.vze.com for instance) we&rsquo;re certainly bound to see all sorts of stuff (and accordingly, all sorts of crap) on the internet.

Sometimes my still being unemployed depresses me greatly (Although my periods of depression typically last no more than thirty minutes.)
The biggest problem in my job-hunting woes is the fact that the type of job I want varies greatly from what I have training in.

Well I finally decided to start a full-blown web journal. I used to keep one some years ago — I think it greatly helped me develop my english skills. Or not.

First off, I haven&rsquo;t finished the game yet, I&rsquo;m somewhere in Chapter 5. I stopped playing the game a month or so ago out of sheer irritation.
For the uninitiated, H:RBE is a tactical RPG for the PSX, released during the last year the PSX. The game is similar in some respects to games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre, with an emphasis on turn-based squad-level combats. Unlike FFT and TO&rsquo;s similar Active Time system, H:RBE uses a system called RAP, where each character can perform as many actions as he wants provided he still has the RAP gauge to pay for it.

I stood there wordlessly, inching my way through the unending mass of people. There must have been several hundred people crammed into less than two hundred square meters of mall area, interspersed with some twenty cubicles filled with various displays and banners. What madness is this you ask? What product could be so enticing that hundreds of otherwise sane people to participate in such a gathering, jostling for space and risking being elbowed, stepped on or maybe even pick pocketed?

Hey, we have cable again! Okay, so we never actually _lost_ cable, but it felt like we had, back when the Star network withdrew its channels from Home Cable around six months ago. Now they&rsquo;re back, which means I once again get to watch Simpsons, Futurama and Whose Line Is It Anyway? =)
In other news, I&rsquo;m still unemployed and cashless. =(

So the ECE board exams are now over. Six months (okay three) of hard work and preparation (well alright, occasionally glancing at my books) and what do we get? A bunch of questions chosen seemingly at random. The Math and Electronics parts were good enough actually, and I felt pretty confident there. The second day was bad. The Communications exam might as well have been a random set of questions about cookie dough and displacer beasts.

April Fools day today. The Gaming Intelligence Agency says they&rsquo;re shutting down, but it&rsquo;s likely one of their famous AFD pranks.
Board exams coming up next week, Tuesday and Wednesday. I need to borrow a calculator — the one I have isn&rsquo;t on their list. I really should study more but for some reason I&rsquo;m really confident. promises to study more
So I applied for a job at ASTI. Sure it&rsquo;s a government place, but I know a lot of guys there and it looks like fun.

(2018 Edit: I found this in my WordPress drafts folder, not sure why it wasn&rsquo;t published when I first imported it. It&rsquo;s true it was on my old site, but I can not find a reliable indicator of what date it was published. So I will publish it with an arbitrarily chosen date of March 1, 2002.)
Officially, this rant should be available upon the re-opening of the NFT Zu webpage, version 4.

Website updates: New text files in features section!
Ack&hellip; haven&rsquo;t been doing much lately. My time has been consumed by the evil monster that is Sierra&rsquo;s Betrayal at Krondor. It&rsquo;s an RPG based on Raymond Feist&rsquo;s Riftwar series of books. Haven&rsquo;t read the books myself, but the game is well done, and is still enjoyable despite its age (I think it was released in &lsquo;92 or such). The game was released by Sierra as freeware to promote the sequel, and it can be downloaded at happypuppy.

Updates: Added Square NES ROMs, Programming section, updated links. Went back to text-based navigation. While image navigation is nice, it&rsquo;s hard to update and slow-loading. Added links to funtrivia trivia quizzes.
It&rsquo;s been a slow couple of days really. Some board reviewing, sporadic Japanese learning. Finished DW7 a couple of nights ago — finally! Currently playing on PS: Ehrgeiz Quest Mode! Kinda tough, tho. For the NES, a discussion on FFFade me download a whole bunch of Square NES ROMs!

For some reason, I keep wanting to update this site. I&rsquo;m actually doing this more often than studying for the board, studying game development, studying Japanese or writing anything else. I wonder why? Anyway, I added a humor page and a special &ldquo;Who Am I?&rdquo; page. Check &lsquo;em out. Also the Anime ROMs site should be fully operational by now.
So I went and saw Lord of the Rings last Friday.

Hopefully, the site is now Netscape-safe&hellip;
Uploaded more stuff today: I put up an ECE Board Exam Reviewer — it&rsquo;s a software that helps me review for the upcoming ECE boards. It&rsquo;s in the files section. I really should add that to the list of resolutions: WILL STUDY FOR BOARD EXAM!
I also decided to renovate and re-use the geocities site so I put up an Anime ROMs site there. I wanted to put up the Anime ROMs before, but I was worried about what Topcities might do, since Ihaven&rsquo;t heard anything about what they do to copyright violations on member sites.

Changed the layout even more! Added a start page containing the menu only, so that visitors wouldn&rsquo;t have to listen to me ranting all the time. Uploaded some stuff, since my COMPUTER IS PROBABLY GOING TO DIE SOON! It&rsquo;s on its last legs&hellip; I can feel it. Over the next couple of days I&rsquo;ll probably be uploading stuff that I don&rsquo;t have backed up elsewhere. For now the only new upload is a bunch of high school pics.
