I stood there wordlessly, inching my way through the unending mass of people. There must have been several hundred people crammed into less than two hundred square meters of mall area, interspersed with some twenty cubicles filled with various displays and banners. What madness is this you ask? What product could be so enticing that hundreds of otherwise sane people to participate in such a gathering, jostling for space and risking being elbowed, stepped on or maybe even pick pocketed?

Hey, we have cable again! Okay, so we never actually _lost_ cable, but it felt like we had, back when the Star network withdrew its channels from Home Cable around six months ago. Now they&rsquo;re back, which means I once again get to watch Simpsons, Futurama and Whose Line Is It Anyway? =)
In other news, I&rsquo;m still unemployed and cashless. =(

So the ECE board exams are now over. Six months (okay three) of hard work and preparation (well alright, occasionally glancing at my books) and what do we get? A bunch of questions chosen seemingly at random. The Math and Electronics parts were good enough actually, and I felt pretty confident there. The second day was bad. The Communications exam might as well have been a random set of questions about cookie dough and displacer beasts.

April Fools day today. The Gaming Intelligence Agency says they&rsquo;re shutting down, but it&rsquo;s likely one of their famous AFD pranks.
Board exams coming up next week, Tuesday and Wednesday. I need to borrow a calculator — the one I have isn&rsquo;t on their list. I really should study more but for some reason I&rsquo;m really confident. promises to study more
So I applied for a job at ASTI. Sure it&rsquo;s a government place, but I know a lot of guys there and it looks like fun.

(2018 Edit: I found this in my WordPress drafts folder, not sure why it wasn&rsquo;t published when I first imported it. It&rsquo;s true it was on my old site, but I can not find a reliable indicator of what date it was published. So I will publish it with an arbitrarily chosen date of March 1, 2002.)
Officially, this rant should be available upon the re-opening of the NFT Zu webpage, version 4.

Website updates: New text files in features section!
Ack&hellip; haven&rsquo;t been doing much lately. My time has been consumed by the evil monster that is Sierra&rsquo;s Betrayal at Krondor. It&rsquo;s an RPG based on Raymond Feist&rsquo;s Riftwar series of books. Haven&rsquo;t read the books myself, but the game is well done, and is still enjoyable despite its age (I think it was released in &lsquo;92 or such). The game was released by Sierra as freeware to promote the sequel, and it can be downloaded at happypuppy.

Updates: Added Square NES ROMs, Programming section, updated links. Went back to text-based navigation. While image navigation is nice, it&rsquo;s hard to update and slow-loading. Added links to funtrivia trivia quizzes.
It&rsquo;s been a slow couple of days really. Some board reviewing, sporadic Japanese learning. Finished DW7 a couple of nights ago — finally! Currently playing on PS: Ehrgeiz Quest Mode! Kinda tough, tho. For the NES, a discussion on FFFade me download a whole bunch of Square NES ROMs!

For some reason, I keep wanting to update this site. I&rsquo;m actually doing this more often than studying for the board, studying game development, studying Japanese or writing anything else. I wonder why? Anyway, I added a humor page and a special &ldquo;Who Am I?&rdquo; page. Check &lsquo;em out. Also the Anime ROMs site should be fully operational by now.
So I went and saw Lord of the Rings last Friday.

Hopefully, the site is now Netscape-safe&hellip;
Uploaded more stuff today: I put up an ECE Board Exam Reviewer — it&rsquo;s a software that helps me review for the upcoming ECE boards. It&rsquo;s in the files section. I really should add that to the list of resolutions: WILL STUDY FOR BOARD EXAM!
I also decided to renovate and re-use the geocities site so I put up an Anime ROMs site there. I wanted to put up the Anime ROMs before, but I was worried about what Topcities might do, since Ihaven&rsquo;t heard anything about what they do to copyright violations on member sites.

Changed the layout even more! Added a start page containing the menu only, so that visitors wouldn&rsquo;t have to listen to me ranting all the time. Uploaded some stuff, since my COMPUTER IS PROBABLY GOING TO DIE SOON! It&rsquo;s on its last legs&hellip; I can feel it. Over the next couple of days I&rsquo;ll probably be uploading stuff that I don&rsquo;t have backed up elsewhere. For now the only new upload is a bunch of high school pics.
