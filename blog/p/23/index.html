Previously: I installed Kubuntu, but failed to get the internet working.
But now, since we got a router to service our home network (whereas previously we were using a cross-cable directly connecting two computers), I decided to give it another shot. Apparently, if I have a router between my PC and the DSL line, I can use something called DHCP to automatically configure my ethernet connection. And I did that! Woohoo, and now I&rsquo;m posting from Linux!

Wooo!
I&rsquo;m not sure how to begin; my brothers and I have been wrestling fans for almost twenty years now, and as far as I can remember this was the only time that the WWE ever came to the Philippines. The last time was a long time ago, and although I wanted to see it, there was no way I could convince my parents then that the largish amount of cash needed to go was worth it.

Lest I be accused of avoiding the real world by writing about TV shows while events start to unfold which may or may not plunge our nation into chaos , I suppose I should put my two cents into the matter. For those who read this text in the future at a time when all these links are broken, the current President of the Phillipines, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has declared a state of national emergency today, claiming that a broad alliance encompassing traditional oppostion groups and the far left and the far right are trying to bring her down.

I figure there are three reasons why people continue to watch Smallville:
 We want to see Clark become Superman (and Lex become&hellip; Lex) We want to see all the cool comic-book references and cameos We actually like all the drama and though we know otherwise, we harbor some sort of hope that maybe Clark and Lana will still get together anyhow  As a comic geek, I guess I&rsquo;m more inclined toward the first two.

I remembered that I haven&rsquo;t written an About page yet. This post will go there.
The Blogger profile describes me as a &ldquo;Programmer, engineer, scientist, critic, gamer, dreamer, and kid-at-heart.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s break that down, shall we?
Programmer : Since January of 2003 I&rsquo;ve been working as a software developer for the RP office of a Hong Kong-based company. I&rsquo;m no Computer Science graduate, but I did manage to fake it well enough to pass the JITSE certification exams.

pamie.com: Open Up and Say Yumburger.
Awesome, awesome blog post about some &ldquo;Ugly Americans&rdquo; and their um&hellip; &ldquo;unique&rdquo; experience dining at Jollibee. Highlights the world of difference between the American palette and the Filipino one. While they make a good point that Jollibee is the &ldquo;crappy burger joint food&rdquo; of the Philippines as compared to McDonald&rsquo;s which is the &ldquo;crappy burger joint food&rdquo; of the US, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever heard any Filipino reference Jollibee food in any such disparaging manner.

On our way down the mountain from Batangas, we stopped in a small, quaint town filled with old-fashioned simple folk. For some reason, I took the opportunity to vanish into the shadows and watch as the buses left me behind. I roamed around the small town, hoping to find some sort of means with which I could escape my mundane life and start over in a some other paradise.
Twice people from the company came back, looking for someone, but apparently not me.

13 Feb 2006 6:58amView postClose    This is the photo I decided to put on the front page of http://roytang.net while I wasn't sure yet what to put there.  We were at Punta Fuego in Batangas last Jan 30-31 for our coincidentally-coinciding-with-the-HK-Chinese-New Year-weekend annual company outing. Those who know me in person might be aware that I'm not really big on out-of-town trips.

<div class="content p-summary">
The response of the western world to the recent backlash against published cartoon depictions of mohammed could be described as the unavoidable result of two completely distinct cultures clashing against each other. On one hand, Islam dictates that any such depiction of the prophet Mohammed are considered as blasphemy; on the other hand, Western media views it as a free speech issue; since every other religion in the world tolerates media lampooning, why shouldn&rsquo;t Islam?

This was Scott Adams&rsquo; first non-Dilbert book. If you&rsquo;re used to reading Adams go on about Induhviduals and stupid managers, or if you&rsquo;ve never read Adams trying / pretending to sound philosophical in one of his books, then this isn&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;d expect.
Adams describes it as a &ldquo;thought experiment&rdquo; of sorts, one where he tries to provide some sort of explanation for basically life, the universe and everything. Although it&rsquo;s a work of fiction, it sounds like Adams is trying to see how people will react to his form of philosophy — it seems to be one of his favorite things to do something just to provoke reactions.

In a few months people will forget anyway.
Yesterday 74 people died in a tragic stampede.
The reason? Crowding to get into the one-year anniversary show of a local noontime variety show. Wowowee.
This is ridiculous, an obvious barometer showing how desperate many of our countrymen have become. The show was offering prizes in the form of raffle draws and contests, and many were hoping to win a house and lot or at least some cash to help them get by.

Yeah, so I was bored and went ahead and got a domain name. ^_^I&rsquo;m wondering if I&rsquo;ve wasted money, but webhosting is really cheap nowadays anyway. Thanks to the nice folks at pinoywebhosting.com for their quick service!
Anyway, I hope you&rsquo;ll pardon me if some parts of the site aren&rsquo;t fully up-and-running (the about page is still the wordpress template for one), I haven&rsquo;t had much time to play around with wordpress yet.

Yeah, I haven&rsquo;t been posting lately. I still have a lot of thoughts running around my head, and often throughout the day I find myself thinking, &ldquo;I should post an entry about this.&rdquo; But at the end of the day, I&rsquo;m tired and I&rsquo;m exhausted from thinking about two hundred different issues and juggling twenty different priorities, so I don&rsquo;t post about it. I note it somewhere and sooner or later it becomes irrelevant and I forget why I wanted to post it in the first place.

Anyway, I went for a dual boot of Windows XP and Kubuntu, supposedly an easy-to-use Linux distro. So yeah, I even watched this video online that showed how to do the installs.

&hellip; but I just want to see what happens now.
The transition from the last year felt a bit strange to me. Usually, the new year is a time for letting go of the past, and looking ahead to a whole new future. That so perfectly described the end of the last year, as things changed around me and just naturally fell into positions where I would be able to leave them behind.

Sid Meier&rsquo;s Civilization &ndash; one of the most highly-acclaimed strategy game series in existence. Any serious gamer worth his salt knows about it &ndash; whether he plays turn-based strategy games or not. And the fourth installment was eagerly awaited in our home &ndash; two out of four brothers were eager to play the latest update.
And Civ4 is in many ways the same game all over again. The basic premise is still there &ndash; explore, build cities, research technologies, kick other civivlizations while they&rsquo;re down, race to space, etc.

As I watched my brother playing the latest incarnation of EA&rsquo;s FIFA game, I can&rsquo;t help but consider that there must be a staff of developers over at EA dedicated solely to the task of churning away to release updates to EA&rsquo;s flagship lines of sports games year after year.
I wonder how fulfilling that kind of job actually is&hellip;

Not that it&rsquo;s a bad game mind you. From the ten or so hours I&rsquo;ve played it&rsquo;s definitely a lot better than the previous game in the series. And the voice acting is really great this time, with a bunch of British people doing the over-the-top voices. The battle system is still a bit simplistic, and the main quest seems very straightforward. From what I&rsquo;ve seen, it&rsquo;s probably an above average game.

I was getting a bit bored with the place, so I spruced it up a bit, switched some colors, moved stuff around. You know, just to pretend something&rsquo;s happening. And to showcase my sorely lacking UI design skills. :p

I&rsquo;m no music critic; often I can&rsquo;t even carry my own tune. But I do know what I like, and I know I like the Eraserheads&rsquo; music. If you don&rsquo;t know who the ‘heads are, they&rsquo;re basically the Beatles of the Philippines, galvanizing the local music industry and serving as an example and inspiration to numerous other bands that followed after them. It&rsquo;s only fitting then that many of the current crop of Filipino performers pay tribute to them in the form of Ultraelectromagnetic Jam.

I had three teeth taken out today, all of them deep in the bottom-left part of mouth. One of them was apparently a wisdom tooth that had lodged itself in a peculiar angle. That one required surgery (and was not covered by my health card).
When you&rsquo;re there, even when your mouth is numb, even if you&rsquo;re not really scared or anything, once you start to feel that pressure on your jaw, you can&rsquo;t help but be at least a little bit anxious.

So, my brother needed to present 20 java programs for school. He didn&rsquo;t have to make them himself, he said. Just to print them out and submit them. (What kind of ridiculous compsci teacher asks for hardcopies of source instead of softcopies?)
Anyway, I said, sure. I&rsquo;ll make some, it&rsquo;ll be easy. After all, trivial programs shouldn&rsquo;t take me more than 5 minutes each right? It was true, each one didn&rsquo;t take long.

At least, that&rsquo;s what I was thinking when I was listening to today&rsquo;s Gospel regarding the parable of the talents.
Bsically, I think the gist of it is: God gives us talents, we should do the best we can; if we don&rsquo;t, how can we complain when others do better?
Yeah, I pay attention in Church. Go me!

I was introduced to nano a few years back when some fanfiction writers I knew online told me about it. I&rsquo;ve attempted it every year, and failed each time. I just don&rsquo;t have the drive.
I figured I wouldn&rsquo;t start this year. After all, here I am, it&rsquo;s the ninth of November, and I don&rsquo;t have anything, prepared or otherwise, why fight a losing battle right?
If you think I don&rsquo;t fight losing battles, you don&rsquo;t know me very well.

Only 11 are PC games, 4 of which are from Blizzard.

<div class="content p-summary">
Filipinos traditionally take the weekend of All Saints/All Souls Day off, to rest and to visit their dearly departed. Westerners, particularly Americans, treat this time, specifically All Hallow&rsquo;s Eve, as a children&rsquo;s holiday. Given GMA&rsquo;s penchant for holiday economics, it was evident we would get at least Monday and Tuesday off, and they were indeed declared as holidays, so Filipinos got a respite shortly before the much-dreaded EVAT implementation.
Not me, though.

I have to work today :( And probably tomorrow and the day after as well, although both are local holidays.
On what may very well become one of the company&rsquo;s biggest projects I might add, if we get the contract.
On an unrelated note, these filler Naruto episodes are just silly. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense that Raiga, one of the Seven Shinobi Swordsmen, can be defeated by Naruto and Lee (no matter how drunk Lee is); Raiga is supposedly on par with his former comrade Kisame, who was easily able to take on two of Konoha&rsquo;s jounins.

Voting for the Walk of Game is up.
My votes were: Starcraft, Civilization, Final Fantasy and Street Fighter II. Also Sid Meier and the Pac-man guy.
Edit: After some thought, it&rsquo;s kind of silly to have a poll where you could vote everyday. There&rsquo;s no chance for Pac-man to beat Final Fantasy here, as FF has an army of fanboys willing to vote everyday, and Pac-man&hellip; well, a lot of his fans might vote once buy many won&rsquo;t even realize or care that they can vote again.

A post I made today had a 23-Oct timestamp.
After some investigation, I determined it was because I had left the create post screen open in a firefox tab last 23-Oct, then closed my browser. On my next launch of firefox, the SessionSaver extension automatically reloaded my previous session, but the create post screen still had the 23-Oct date. I had to manually change the date.
Note to self: Refresh the create post screen always.
