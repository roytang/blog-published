I recently imported my old reviews from Goodreads into this blog as posts. These days I generally prefer just writing my book reviews here anyway, so I will likely stop using Goodreads as a service completely.
To facilitate tracking of my read/unread books (and perhaps to inspire me to read more, as I really should), I&rsquo;ve published an old file which I&rsquo;ve been using as a sort of &ldquo;to-read&rdquo; list since 2010.

Magic Arena&rsquo;s community was in an uproar this past weekend over the latest state of the beta, mostly over the announced plans for Arena&rsquo;s eternal Historic format that will become relevant with the coming rotation. It&rsquo;s likely that Wizards will backpedal in some way in response to the community, but here are my thoughts for now:
Historic cards to cost double wildcards to craft This is the universally-reviled bit and has been the target of much outrage, accursing Wizards of being greedy etc.

Hmm, surprisingly I haven&rsquo;t watched too much stuff this month.
Eigasai I watched a Japanese film at Eigasai in UP Diliman for the first time ever, upon the invite of some friends. We saw One Cut of the Dead a comedy zombie film. It was great and it was hilarious, although you must make sure not to lose patience with the first thirty minutes. I went in blind not knowing anything about it other than &ldquo;Japanese comedy zombie movie&rdquo;, so you should too!

I read this post: Why I&rsquo;m automatically deleting my old tweets using AWS Lambda where the justification for regularly deleting your old social media content is that they are no longer representative of the current version of you and thus can be misleading. This has certainly been the case when famous people&rsquo;s older tweets resurface (James Gunn comes to mind).
To each his own and I kind of understand the intent, but this kind of thinking is a bit anathema to me.

Back when I was still learning Python in 2008, one of the first &ldquo;fun&rdquo; scripts I wrote was a text generator using Markov chains. I&rsquo;d run it against all the chat logs I had with people at work and serve the results from a webserver on my computer. THe results were often amusing and sometimes hilarious.
Since I&rsquo;ve been going through my old scripts lately, I thought I&rsquo;d update that script to Python 3 (read: add parentheses around print params and use pathlib) and run it against all the posts on this here site.

Ever since I started learning Python back in 2008ish, I&rsquo;ve been using it as my primary scripting language for various tasks such as processing log files, organizing my own file system, processing stuff on this blog, and so on. A lot of it is basically moving files around. In the days of Python 2, that involved a lot of imports of different libraries like os, shutil and glob. It can become a bit messy with so many imports, and I often can&rsquo;t remember which import I need for a particular case and end up having to search for the documentation (or stackoverflow, let&rsquo;s not kid ourselves here).

I brought up among one of my friend groups this Reddit thread where the poster says they were able to buy hundreds of dollars worth of Magic cards from a garage sale for around $70. (Not gonna link to the original thread because it might seem like I&rsquo;m shaming the OP.)
Not that there&rsquo;s anything bad with such &ldquo;garage sale finds&rdquo;, as it were. These things are posted every so often on subreddits especially those dedicated to some sort of collectible.

Shogun There&rsquo;s a quote I like from James Clavell&rsquo;s novel Shogun:
 “It&rsquo;s a saying they have, that a man has a false heart in his mouth for the world to see, another in his breast to show to his special friends and his family, and the real one, the true one, the secret one, which is never known to anyone except to himself alone, hidden only God knows where.”

Big news in online repositories this week is that Bitbucket is sunsetting support for Mercurial! This might be the death knell for Mercurial, although Git was already the super popular choice before. Back when I started using online source control for my personal coding projects I started out with Bitbucket over Github because they offered unlimited private repos and Mercurial (which I had already tried out before at work, so at first I preferred it over git).

I might be lending out my PS4 next month when the latest annual release of a sports franchise rolls around, so I figured I&rsquo;d finish off a PS4 game before the console vanishes on me for a few months. What Remains of Edith Finch came out on PS+ a couple of months ago and people are always raving about how good it is and how it&rsquo;s relatively short, so I decided to give it a go.

My current desktop PC has been with me since late 2015, so going on 4 years now. I bought relatively high-end parts for it at the time, hoping to be a bit future-proof so that it would last me longer than previous desktops. So I was a bit worried when I started encountering issues during the recent weeks.
Here&rsquo;s the timeline:

0 A while back, I read this post from 2015: Who is doing this to my internet? lamenting the changing nature of the internet due to commercialization and advertising.
1 It&rsquo;s a bit funny that the OP was lamenting about the &ldquo;good old days&rdquo; of the internet back in 2012, when by then the big social media networks like Facebook and Twitter were already relatively well-entrenched. When I think of the &ldquo;good old days&rdquo; of the internet I tend to harken back pre-social media to the heyday of blogging around 2005-2008 maybe?

I recently found myself doing a really small project as sort of a proof of concept/demo for a potential client. It often seems that it might be a waste of time to do something like this since you don&rsquo;t know if the project will actually push through or maybe the client will want something else. To kind of hedge my bets a bit, I decided to take the opportunity to try out some new technologies so that no matter what I at least learned something from all of this.

Should I still write tournament reports even though I did poorly? Spoilers, but the answer is that has never stopped me before!
In today&rsquo;s installment of &ldquo;I thought you were quitting paper Magic?&rdquo;, I attended an MCQ yesterday for MC Richmond. The format was Modern constructed.
I initially wasn&rsquo;t planning to play because (a) the entrance fee was kind of ridiculous; (b) modern is a bit of an unbalanced debacle right now because of Hogaak; and (c ) my one assembled Modern deck (Grixis Death Shadow) hasn&rsquo;t been used since 2017, and was completely absent in the meta for the recent MC Barcelona.

In perhaps what is a perfect example of how writing bring clarity, I started drafting a post listing out the problems with my current notes/todo workflow and ended up coming to a conclusion as to how to make things better for myself.
The main issue is that I have a smattering of todo-lists and notes scattered over several platforms: plain text files (in different places!), evernote, google keep, google docs, standard notes, and recently I also started trying Trello.

I don&rsquo;t remember where I read it online, but I have this in my notes:
 we write to discover truths about ourselves (paraphrased)
 The basic idea being that the mere act of writing down our thoughts can bring clarity and help us identify some truths about ourselves we never knew existed.
I think it works similarly to the programmer practice of rubber ducking, where the mere act of describing something helps you gain a better understanding of it.

&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not insomnia&rdquo;, my friend said, &ldquo;You have something like a 28-hour sleep cycle.&rdquo;
I laughed and uttered &ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of sync with this world!&quot;
I was describing why I was almost late meeting the group for lunch, telling him I had trouble going to sleep and slept at 7am, only waking up at 10am. During the past few days my sleep times have steadily been moving later and later until they pushed into the early morning.

Such an uninteresting number. And it hasn&rsquo;t really been an exceptional 365 days around the sun either, but this has become a bit of a yearly tradition now.
Things I considered doing today:
 spend the entire day offline (Hah! As if.) go out for a walk at the old university (unlikely to push through, given the gloomy weather recently) go to the mall and buy a new external hard drive and a new monitor and eat at Yabu (I like Yabu) and maybe watch a movie in the cinema (I don&rsquo;t really feel like going to the mall on a Friday, and there aren&rsquo;t any good movies to watch apparently) play through Ducktales Remastered on Steam, which I bought last night because it was about to be removed from the store, and stream it live on Twitch binge one of the shows on my TV backlog read through a book.

I decided to start doing small &ldquo;devnotes&rdquo; on developer stuff I&rsquo;m doing so I can refer to them later (and also because I feel like I could use more technical content on this blog)
Today is about PostgreSQL. I haven&rsquo;t used it much beyond standard ANSI sql stuff. You won&rsquo;t always have a graphical interface to access your database, sometimes you need to ssh to prod and query the database from the shell.

<div class="content p-summary">
This past weekend was EVO 2019, the world&rsquo;s biggest celebrations of fighting games. If I had stayed in the US another month maybe I could have gone to Vegas to attend and lose badly. Instead, I thought I&rsquo;d write about fighting games.
I consider fighting games one of my weaknesses, in the sense that (a) I easily succumb to the temptation to spend money on them; and (b) I&rsquo;m not very good at them.

I thought about making a tag &ldquo;things that would only interest me&rdquo; for this one lol.
I&rsquo;ve uploaded some old web archives of the oldest versions of my site - back when I still had free sites hosted on the likes of Geocities, Tripod and the lesser-known TopCities. Click here for the index!
I&rsquo;ve had these archives for a while and only now decided to put them up on the site.

I forget where I got this book recommendation from, but it did go on sale for Kindle a while back so I got a copy. The full title is &ldquo;Utopia for Realists: How We Can Build the Ideal World&rdquo;.
Summary: I really like this book, though I think it falls short in providing concrete steps for how to get from where we are to the idealized utopia he presents. Still, in this world of ever-increasing bad news and crises, the optimism of this book is a welcome respite.

As is my wont, I&rsquo;m almost never satisfied with a website&rsquo;s layout, so I&rsquo;ve been tinkering with this blog&rsquo;s layout on the backend. To make a long story short, I decided to start working on a Hugo theme. It&rsquo;s still largely a work in progress, as there&rsquo;s a bunch of things I wanted to implement. But it was good enough to replace the old one so I went ahead and deployed it, so maybe some bugs here and there on some pages.

I was travelling for most of the past two months, so this covers both June and July, and I guess I haven&rsquo;t been able to watch too much. Maybe? IDK, we&rsquo;ll see.
Since I was in the US, I took the opportunity to finish watching Voltron: Legendary Defender which only had two seasons available on PH Netflix. Pretty good adaptation, lots of fun callbacks to the old series. Some annoying filler eps, especially in the middle seasons onwards.

I know I already made a whole post about the MCU after Endgame came out, but after the MCU Phase 4 announcements this past weekend at SDCC I was a bit hyped. I thought it would be fun to look back at the past 10 years of MCU Phase 1-3 and see what I wrote about the movies.
Iron Man (2008)
Surprisingly, I had written nothing about watching this film at all, and I don&rsquo;t remember going to the cinema to watch it.

I have a small mobile app that I wrote using React Native (henceforth RN) back in 2017, currently deployed on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. Shortly before my US trip, I got an email from Google telling me about a required action:
 By August 1, 2019, all apps that use native code must provide a 64-bit version in addition to the 32-bit version in order to publish an update.

People travel for different reasons.
My parents travel mostly for shopping purposes. Which meant when I flew back home with them during the recent trip, we came back with an additional 3 fully-packed pieces of luggage full of shoes and clothes and such. As someone who doesn&rsquo;t really indulge in shopping, I can&rsquo;t relate to this, and in fact it runs anathema to my philosophy of always packing as little as necessary when travelling.

The topic of the mythical &ldquo;10x programmer&rdquo; has been the topic of discussion recently on tech twitter, due to a thread listing out the supposed signs of being such a mythical beast.
10x engineers
Founders if you ever come across this rare breed of engineers, grab them. If you have a 10x engineer as part of your first few engineers, you increase the odds of your startup success significantly.
OK, here is a tough question.

I had written about travel anxiety before, but I&rsquo;m revisiting the topic because the recent US trip reminded me how much of a problem it is for me.
The US trip was a new experience because I would be abroad for 40 days with multiple travel legs, it involved 4 international flights (back and forth) plus three domestic flights within the US, and on one leg and several flights I would be travelling alone.

After the Seattle part of the trip, I reunited with family for the final leg of the trip where we all be hanging around the San Francisco bay area. We were based in my uncle&rsquo;s place in Vacaville, which one of my friends kindly described as &ldquo;in the sticks&rdquo;, i.e. basically far away from everything. Like Houston, we had to rely on the kindness of relatives who were willing and available to drive us around.

First, the spoiler-free review, then more spoilery stuff afterwards.
 I watched Far From Home while I was&hellip; far from home. great movie, lots of fun, and the stakes are a lot higher than the Vulture just stealing some tech off Tony Stark basically a story of Peter Parker the high school student trying to juggle his Spider-Man problems with his high school life, which was one of the best eras of comic book Spider-Man the movie gives us a look at what the world looks like post-Endgame and how weird it is for everyone if you&rsquo;ve seen the trailers, you know who the &ldquo;villain&rdquo; is and you have certain expectations coming in.

- I watched Far From Home while I was&hellip; far from home.- great movie, lots of fun, and the stakes are a lot higher than the Vulture just stealing some tech off Tony Stark- basically a story of Peter Parker the high school student trying to juggle his Spider-Man problems with his high school life, which was one of the best eras of comic book Spider-Man- the movie gives us a look at what the world looks like post-Endgame and how weird it is for everyone- if you&rsquo;ve seen the trailers, you know who the &ldquo;villain&rdquo; is and you have certain expectations coming in.

Seattle was the riskiest part of my trip, relatively speaking, because it was my solo leg - I didn&rsquo;t have any friends or relatives in the city I could turn to in case of an emergency. I had also read online that while Seattle was very much a walkable city, there was a nontrivial homeless population, and some areas may be a bit sketchy after dark. As a friend of mine said though, &ldquo;sketchy&rdquo; in the US is probably a lot safer than &ldquo;sketchy&rdquo; in Metro Manila.

Grand Prix / MagicFest Seattle Photo Dump:
 I wasn&rsquo;t actually planning to play much competitive Magic this year, at least not on paper, but when the family planned a US trip in June, I figured I&rsquo;d take a short side trip to attend and experience a US GP. I had the choices of Washington DC on the 14th-16th (Limited), Seattle on 20th-23rd (Limited), or Dallas on 28th-30th (Modern). After some wrangling with the family&rsquo;s schedule, Seattle was the one most convenient to go to, and Limited meant I didn&rsquo;t have to try and put together a decent deck.

Not much to say about Anaheim, it felt like the town was all about Disneyland and not much else. But then again we did spend our three days there just going to Disneyland, so what can you do?
In LA we stayed in the Koreatown district, so everything felt weirdly Asian. Not Asian like living in Asia, but like Chinatown in any other city I guess? The city felt a bit dirty, I&rsquo;m told the metro elevators smelled bad, and there was grafitti everywhere and a high incidence of homeless people.

I&rsquo;m not a big fan of theme parks. I think for the most part they are overpriced and not worth the time, effort or money. And I&rsquo;d probably never go to one by myself or without one of my nieces/nephews. I understand the impetus of bringing kids to a theme park of course, they really enjoy it. Prior to this trip, I&rsquo;ve only ever been to a theme park once, and that was in Unversal Studios Singapore with my brothers back in 2015.

My US trip started on the first of the month. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write more regularly about it, but one thing I had forgotten was how exhausting it would be to be a tourist, walking everywhere all of the time. Here&rsquo;s how many steps my Fitbit recorded during that first week:

8 Jun 2019 5:56amClose   I finished this week with a bit more than 105k steps, which I&rsquo;m pretty sure is a lifetime record (though I dont have the data anymore from the Europe trip in 2015 - I suspect that it&rsquo;s comparable in scale.

30 May 2019 5:56amClose   Damn, that was a grind. But it felt super rewarding especially as a free-to-play player since the closed beta, always struggling for wildcards to build the decks. I had never tried going for Mythic beyond the first month, when I realized what a grind it was. This standard format was also pretty dynamic, which meant the best deck changed constantly, so it was hard to be successful by sticking to one deck, which meant a lot of WCs are needed to be able to shift with the meta.

I remember when playing the original version of Civilization back in the day, the &ldquo;most advanced&rdquo; form of government was Democracy, with the only downside of it being you can&rsquo;t declare war (because you had a senate that would stop you.) The other available forms of government were typically not very useful, but Democracy massively increased your trade output, so most often I would build the Pyramids (a wonder which allowed switching to any government immediately and without penalty), and spend the rest of the game toggling between Democracy and Despotism (for when I wanted to go to war).

The big TV thing of May 2019 was of course, the much maligned finale for Game of Thrones. I&rsquo;ve written about that separately here.
Most of the US TV series also ended their runs in May. Arrowverse show seasons were littered with poor writing as usual. I rank the seasons in this order:
 best is Legends of Tomorrow season 4. The reason Legends is the best is that they&rsquo;re not afraid to be outrageous.

Most of us hold the dream of becoming something better than we are, something larger, richer, in some way more important to the world and ourselves. Too often, the way taken is the wrong way, with too much emphasis on what we want to have, rather than what we wish to become.” — Louis L’Amour

<div class="content p-summary">
After a much-maligned eighth and final season, HBO&rsquo;s Game of Thrones is done. Unmarked spoilers follow.
The eighth season was so notoriously bad, we got petitions asking for rewrites. Here&rsquo;s how I explained it to a friend after the notorious episode 5:
 It&rsquo;s not about characters being killed, it&rsquo;s about bad writing because they&rsquo;re cramming. The writers were determined to finish the show in 2 smaller seasons so they&rsquo;re skipping a lot of necessary character development and characters just do stupid things because the plot demands it.

The results are disappointing, but that&rsquo;s only because we expected better. Historically, those who have made it into the Senate did so mostly on name recognition. What does it matter if Diokno had the best resume of all the candidates, if many of the voters did not know who he was? How could he compete against someone who appeared on a hit primetime TV series right up until the start of the campaign period?

Continuing with the Wheel of Time re-read! I devoured Eye of the World much more quickly than I expected, finishing the book in less than 3 days. It helps that I had already read it before of course, but I think there&rsquo;s also a part of me that enjoys escaping into this fantasy world when the real world outlook seems dire.
Anyway, the book shows a lot of Tolkien-esque plot influence, especially near the start: Some kids from a backwater village are visited by a magic user and after some troubles are forced on the run from black riders?

The PH senatorial and local elections are on Monday. I almost didn&rsquo;t want to write the usual election post, mostly because I was annoyed with and tired of the electorate and the politicians and the system and all that. But we shouldn&rsquo;t give in to despair.
Often when choosing who to vote, it will be difficult to find candidates who align perfectly with your values. You make compromises to prioritize those issues you think are more important.

Since I was going to be taking a long trip in a month, I was looking for some books to read on the plane and in airports and whatnot while waiting. I settled on a re-read of Robert Jordan&rsquo;s Wheel of Time series, a pretty good time for it since by next year we may have a TV series from Amazon (hopefully better than Game of Thrones). Side note: Wheel of Time is also why I&rsquo;m not optimistic that GRRM can finish ASoIaF in just two more books - Jordan took forever and died before he could finish WoT and even Sanderson who took over needed an additional three books to finish the saga.

I often prefer having a randomly changing background wallpaper, even back in the day when Windows didn&rsquo;t support it natively and I had to install various plugins to support it. I like the variance! The one I&rsquo;ve been using recently was this set of wallpapers based on Street Fighter stage backgrounds, which I got from a reddit thread that I unfortunately can&rsquo;t find anymore (I&rsquo;ll update this post if I find it later).
