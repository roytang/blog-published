A post I made today had a 23-Oct timestamp.
After some investigation, I determined it was because I had left the create post screen open in a firefox tab last 23-Oct, then closed my browser. On my next launch of firefox, the SessionSaver extension automatically reloaded my previous session, but the create post screen still had the 23-Oct date. I had to manually change the date.
Note to self: Refresh the create post screen always.

I&rsquo;m never really sure.
I woke up this morning with a slight headache, compounding my annoying cough and colds. I&rsquo;m sure I would have been able to make it to work and put on a whole day&rsquo;s work, albeit probably at a less productive level. But then again, if I rest today, I may be able to put in a 110% productive day tomorrow, whereas not resting might cause me to be unproductive for more than one day.

After seemingly being the last man in the Philippines without a cellphone for so long, I broke down and bought one a couple of weeks ago. I&rsquo;d post a picture, but I can&rsquo;t find the digicam, and the phone can&rsquo;t take a picture of itself.
The 6020 itself seems pretty okay, although as a phone newbie I really have not much of a basis for comparison. The camera is nifty, but it took me a while to find a data cable for the phone.

It nevers fails, every week, around 1-2pm on a Sunday. For some unexplainable reason, an overpowering drowsiness steps in, and I must sacrifice 2-3 hours of my time to sleep.
it&rsquo;s not a normal sleep either, it&rsquo;s the kind of sleepm that&rsquo;s very hard to break. You wake up it&rsquo;s 4pm, and think &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some stuff I have to do,&rdquo; but by 5pm you&rsquo;re still happily sleeping.
Only happens when I&rsquo;m at home though (which is most Sundays), and not just to me.

In my line of work, which is to say &ldquo;large-scale database systems&rdquo;, there&rsquo;s always the idea of &ldquo;journalling&rdquo; or the &ldquo;audit trail.&rdquo; Basically, it means that for every transaction of significance, a record is kept of that transaction, stored in a log somewhere, so that should something malefic happen, the logs can be parsed and the trail can be followed, blame can be assigned and countermeasures can be taken.
Okay, that&rsquo;s not really limited to large-scale database systems.

Advent Children is a DVD-movie about the events that happen two years after the events of the game.

I&rsquo;ve never really read much Neil Gaiman before — I&rsquo;m not a particular fan of the Sandman series, for which he is most known. But I know some people who are big fans, so I respect his work at least.

I saw an interview with Manny Pacquiao on Rated K, apparently after his celebrated win last Sunday. Korina referred to him as a millionaire because of his share from the match, but Manny said he&rsquo;s going to be giving a lot of it away. People told him to donate to Katrina, but he says there are also a lot of needy people in his own country so he&rsquo;s giving to them first.

Anyway, yeah. I&rsquo;m supposed to be trying to get a phone. People have been harassing me for years about the fact that I don&rsquo;t have a phone. Since my vacation is already half-wasted already, I figure I&rsquo;d go online and get some info on what phone I&rsquo;d buy.
Now, bear with me a bit, I&rsquo;m really stupid when it comes to phones, since I&rsquo;ve practically never owned one.

It may very well have been a mistake. Buying and installing World of Warcraft on the first day of my leave, that is. Now I spend some 3-4 hours daily on the addictive beast. It&rsquo;s hard to stop!
In case you haven&rsquo;t heard, World of Warcraft is Blizzard&rsquo;s MMORPG take on it&rsquo;s famous RTS series, and it&rsquo;s one helluva good game. It looks excellent, the gameplay is terrific, people don&rsquo;t seem to be assholes, etc.

One of the things I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do during this hiatus was to watch more movies — we&rsquo;ve got a ton of DVDs downstairs I haven&rsquo;t seen yet. Since I had just finished the fifth book of Stephen King&rsquo;s western fantasy, I started this task with Sergio Leone&rsquo;s western opus, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.
I haven&rsquo;t watched many westerns before. This is probably the first one I completed.

&ldquo;There will be water if ka wills it.&rdquo; &ndash; Roland of Gilead
I had a Powerbooks gift certificate the other week, and the Powerbooks at Megamall happened to have a sale, so I took a look around. And lo, I was lucky enough to find a copy of the fifth book of Stephen King&rsquo;s epic western fantasy, The Dark Tower. It was a huge book, larger than my copies of the first four, but with the same cover style and by the same publisher, so it was the copy I wanted.

My hiatus involves quite a bit of TV of course, especially since I get some idle time while waiting for installations/formatting/downloads to finish. Today, for the first time in maybe twenty years, I saw an exciting action-packed episode of the A-Team!
For those not in the know, the A-Team was a bunch of rogue ex-commandos who usually acted as mercs, fighting for good, beating bad guys and saving the day. In the parlance of Roland of Gilead, gunslingers.

Bought a brand-spankin&rsquo; new 160GB hard drive yesterday. Seagate Barracuda 7200. Yessir, ups the total hard drive capacity at home to 240 gigs, I hope we don&rsquo;t fill it up too fast.
Moved the 40GB hard drive on the primary computer to the secondary (for a total of 80 on the secondary), and installed the new one on the primary. My brother Alvin was working with me on this, and it took us a better part of three hours to get the connection right (one of the casings wasn&rsquo;t very agreeable)

Freedom from work at least. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to take a two-week leave since late last year, but never found a chance. Now is the perfect time, just before I jump full-swing into the next large project (which may or may not be confidential in nature)
So, no thinking about work for two weeks, unless they call me in for an emergency :(
What stuff do I have planned? I&rsquo;m not skipping town or anything.

As you may have heard, Google Talk is up. The client looks neat and all, but there&rsquo;s not much reason for most people to start using it. Sure, the voice chat thing is neat, but I know that Yahoo Messenger supports it, and probably some of the others do? Otherwise, the client seems awfully thin. Simple, like Google, but it needs to be a lot more than that to make a difference.

I&rsquo;m thinking of getting some webhosting. Not that I&rsquo;m unsatisfied with my free webhosting and Blogger mind you, but sometimes I just get the urge to do some server-side chicanery.
Mandatory:
 PHP/mySQL Good service, tech support, fast response time No-hassle payments (which means I prefer local, I don&rsquo;t want to have to pay through credit cards or anything) Of course, a good deal on space, bandwidth, reliability, etc.  Optional:

I&rsquo;ve known of Markku Seguerra&rsquo;s rebelpixel website for a while, having enjoyed his constant stream of OPM-friendly lyrics section.
Today, I came upon his blog post about his band with some Pisay 96 batchmates. Their band is Pop Ratio, and he&rsquo;s made available some original tracks and also some covers on his website. They&rsquo;re pretty okay, you might want to listen to a few.
I know some of my own batchmates are active in bands, I wonder if I can get any (free) samples of their music?

In any case, we have spent at least ten thousand pesos (roughly two hundred american) on pirated PS2 games. And out of those hundred copies, some games we have two or three copies of (due to the problems generally associated with illegal copies); Out of all those pirated games, I&rsquo;d make a conservative estimate that at least 20 games were actually playably good.

The whole web developer thing was boring me for a while. But last week I got to help on some preliminary webpage design for one of the projects, so my interest in HTML/CSS/Javascript is a bit tweaked. (Hence the slightly updated stylesheet — try changing font sizes now.)
Anyway, here&rsquo;s some HTML/CSS trickery. I&rsquo;ll add stuff here as I try them out.
If you&rsquo;re using IE, you wouldn&rsquo;t appreciate it much.

Yeah, so there.
It was an impromptu hiatus anyway. Unplanned and whatever. Work has been hell lately. Not a tedious kind of hell though. Just the sort that sucks up a lot of time. I spent more than 15 hours in the office on my birthday.
Twenty-seven huh? I wish I had more to say, but birthdays seem to matter less and less as I get older. I&rsquo;m in a good place right now, but I&rsquo;m still not where I ultimately want to be.

Or so the paper says.
The Philippine Daily Inquirer had an article today about Oracle targetting local SMEs. Apparently they have an advantage because they use &ldquo;the Linux shareware.&rdquo;
Too bad I can&rsquo;t find the article online.

I remember the atmosphere at UP around the time of the infamous second evelope at Erap&rsquo;s trial. Even the normally apathetic Engineering students were being woken out of their political stupor by outrage at the turn of events by the Estrada-friendly senators. Everywhere you go in UP, people would be asking you if you were coming to the big rally on EDSA.
Today? Today, the conversations are like this:

Should I get a Hipster PDA? I&rsquo;m thinking about it. Or something similar.
Not really for organizing tasks and stuff. Only for jotting down temporary things when away from a computer. So I can remember them later. I often think up incredibly clever world-shaking ideas while commuting, it would be nice to remember all of them.
I still largely prefer the advantages of electronic storage: cut/paste functionality, easy to make backups/copies, distribution, easily searchable etc.

One word: Suxxor.
Well, not really. It&rsquo;s okay I guess. When I first heard they were making a Fantastic Four movie, my first reaction was, &ldquo;Uh&hellip; that can&rsquo;t be good.&rdquo;
The plot is barely servicable&hellip; the thing that really made me think &ldquo;suxxor&rdquo; was how Victor von Doom&rsquo;s role was handled. I mean, in the comics, Doom was a monarch, ruler of Latveria. He wasn&rsquo;t a madman bent on revenge. He was a madman bent on world domination!

I was going to ahead and break my blog silence on the whole Gloriagate thing, but I realized I should read the whole transcript at PCIJ first, boring as it is. That way, I can at least say I&rsquo;m basing my opinions on known facts unlike roughly 90% of the rest of the participants in this debacle.
I went through it in about thirty minutes, skimming most and picking out only the parts that seemed most interesting, and skipping anything that was too vague or that I didn&rsquo;t strictly understand the mechanics of.

Radio is so primitive. You can&rsquo;t skip songs, you can&rsquo;t get to listen to a single track repeatedly, you can&rsquo;t jump to random tracks, you can&rsquo;t listen to only artists that have songs about Superman. Listening to random music some random guy thinks you will like, with no guarantee of whether he actually knows your taste or not. Granted, you can increase that likelihood by listening to the right station, but unless we had one station for every person, it&rsquo;s impossible for the radio station to fully satisfy your tastes.

Awesome. Definitely better than the all the other Batman movies. This movie is no kids&rsquo; movie either. The movie is less about Batman&rsquo;s crimefighting adventures and more about Bruce Wayne&rsquo;s journey from being a angry, confused rich orphan to the billionaire playboy/costumed vigilante popularized by the earlier films.
The movie captures the essence of Batman&rsquo;s character perfectly. It&rsquo;s all about fear — Bruce overcoming his fear of bats and eventually turning that fear into a symbol to strike terror into the hearts of criminals.

Gmail is better, since it explicitly says &ldquo;older&rdquo; and &ldquo;newer&rdquo;; With Yahoo, I&rsquo;m always wrong when I guess. After some experimenting, I figure it out. &ldquo;Next&rdquo; and &ldquo;Previous&rdquo; are based on the sort order in the list of messages. Since the default is sorted by date descending (newest first), &ldquo;Next&rdquo; corresponds to Yahoo&rsquo;s &ldquo;older&rdquo; by default.

Download recordings of alleged destabilization tape &ndash; INQ7.net
Transcript at PCIJ blog
I don&rsquo;t do much politics, but for those out of the loop, the government has recently released some tapes of conversations allegedly edited to make it look like the President has been participating in electoral fraud.
I&rsquo;m actually more interested in the tech part of this &ndash; these are supposedly mobile phone taps, so I guess they should have come from the mobile service provider?

I should&rsquo;ve thought of this as soon as I got DSL: I went ahead and downloaded Transformers the Movie.
Transformers was of course, the epitome of my youth. Unlike most other guy kids, I preferred the Transformers to G.I. Joe. I guess I preferred high-tech fantasy over soliders back then, with the war of the heroic Autobots and the Evil Decepticons appealing more to my young mind than soldiers trying to fight terrorists.

We saw Revenge of the Sith at the Gateway mall in Cubao. It&rsquo;s less than a year old, and it&rsquo;s target audience is a higher class than the usual malls. It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s trying to be something like the Podium, which makes it a bit out of place in Cubao. The mall is good anyway, as you&rsquo;d expect. Not my type of place to hang out, but has the comforts you&rsquo;d expect of such a mall&hellip; clean, not much of a crowd, and people greeting you when you get off the taxi.

The circle is now complete. The whole tale has been told. Revenge of the Sith completes Lucas&rsquo; space opera. And the Force is strong in this one.
Highly enjoyable movie, if you take the time to push away your inner critic and look past the spotty acting, the so-so dialogue, and all the little flaws and inconsistencies you spot throughout the movie. Get past all of that, and it&rsquo;s a decent enough ride, and a fitting conclusion to the Star Wars epic.

Yeah, so I guess I&rsquo;m hypertensive. I get dizzy occasionally, and today I decided to pass by the Clinic to consult about it. My BP reading was a 150/110! The highest reading I&rsquo;ve had, ever. I hope it&rsquo;s not too serious though. Will find out soon.
I don&rsquo;t really mind not being 100% healthy, and taking maintenance medicine could hurt a bit in the pocket (although I don&rsquo;t care much for money) What I don&rsquo;t like about not being healthy is the diet.

Just saw a segment on Oprah where Oprah helped a 15-year old girl realize her wildest dream &ndash; to meet Ashton Kutcher.
Is must be nice to have a lifetime dream so easy to achieve. Oprah&rsquo;s job is nice too. She finds some poor little girl whose dream is to meet a B-list Hollywood celebrity. Wow, how hard was it for her to fulfill that?
Seriously, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s great, it&rsquo;s sweet that Oprah&rsquo;s doing this for the kid, who has some sort of vision-related medical problem.

One of my officemates is now a proud father-to-be! I&rsquo;d be extremly happy for him, if not for the fact that he has to take a week off to attend to his family matters, and now I have to take up his workload. And just one day after I had finally managed to catch up to my own schedule!
I expect to be in crunch mode for a week at least.

The metro has been suffering from sweltering heat the past few days. That&rsquo;s why this sudden heavy rainshower is severely welcome.
My mother says all the people in the metro must have been praying for rain — the shower is rather fierce.
Sweet glorious rain.

<div class="content p-summary">
A while back, inspired by the CSS Zen Garden, I modified my Blogger template to use entirely CSS-based design. That is, I can know update the layout instantly simply by replacing the stylesheet file used by template (like now!)
The new layout uses up a wider screen space, but I think it&rsquo;s neat. The lighter colors are easier on my tired, computer-strained eyes. Hopefully, this new CSS-based design allows me to do more experimentation and improve my ability to design web UIs.

Haven&rsquo;t read Robert Jordan in a while. Someone gave me Crossroads of Twilight as a gift, so I read it and hope that his pacing has improved. It has not. He writes well enough, dialogue is nice, descriptions are more than adequate, but I expect some things to happen in his books! He has so many plots running at once, he should at least resolve two or three per book. Perrin, Mat and Elayne get a lot of chapters, but they barely get anything done.

Pimp My Rig is a hardware review side associated with a friend of mine from high school. Yes, I was asked to help promote it. 😀
I haven&rsquo;t worried about hardware issues in a while, since I usually ask my kid brother to handle most hardware purchases/setup at home. So, I don&rsquo;t really know much about the latest and greatest hardware but this site looks helpful enough to be given a try, especially if you&rsquo;re the sort who enjoys putting together his own PC.

I only had three tasks laid out for me this weekend:
  Watch season 4 of X-men Evolution. I realize that X-men Evo was not as popular as some of the other superhero series such as Justice League and Teen Titans, but I mostly like it anyway. It&rsquo;s more of a light-hearted version of the X-men universe , really. (Presidential hopeful Senator Kelly of canon is merely Mayoral hopeful Principal Kelly here!

One thing about spending a free day at home. The temperature in my room gets really high during the afternoon, it&rsquo;s quite uncomfortable. Especially since I&rsquo;m used to wasting away most of my daylight hours in an airconditioned office.
It&rsquo;s good to spend a couple of days away from the office though &ndash; God only knows I&rsquo;ve been so damn uninspired with work lately. For the past two weeks or so, I haven&rsquo;t had much heart for my work.

Smart and complex, you always love a new intellectual challenge.
Your biggest pet peeve is people who slow you down with trivial chit chat.

Some weirdness today.
Around 4PM, word spread through the office that some sort of psychic nun had predicted an intensity nine earthquake today at 5PM. (This fantastic prediction came through SMS of course. Despite my not having a cellphone, I am not outside its&rsquo; influence.) Since we work on a rather high floor, an earthquake would be very bad ™ from us. Of course, nobody took it seriously, although I suspect some wanted to take the opportunity to dodge some work.
