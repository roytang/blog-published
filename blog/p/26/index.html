[OriginallyÂ posted to the GameFAQs message boards]
Now, there are rude and annoying people everywhere, especially on the internet. And normally, I don&rsquo;t care, I just ignore them. On battle.net, I just let them be, and keep on playing. Every so often however, some guy comes along who just pisses me off completely.
So I play random 3v3, right? It&rsquo;s not the most &ldquo;skillful&rdquo; type of battles, but it&rsquo;s fun and I enjoy it.

As it may mention in the page title, I&rsquo;m currently screwing around with the blogger template, so this blog may look a bit&hellip; um&hellip; screwy for a while.
I&rsquo;ve been wanting to toy around with Javascript hacks to extend the Blogger template functionality. The first thing I did was add some Javascript that allows you to show/hide individual posts on the page. But actually, I don&rsquo;t really like it, I&rsquo;ll remove it later.

An actual conversation I had this morning, as my brother Alvin and I were on our way back home (by foot) from somewhere. (Paraphrased somewhat, mostly because we don&rsquo;t really speak in English all the time.)
Alvin: Shall we take the shortcut through the seminary? Do you think the gate is open?
Roy: I don&rsquo;t think so, let&rsquo;s just take the direct route.
Alvin: Oh come on, I think it&rsquo;s still open, we can take the risk.

I seem to be slightly more alert in the morning and a bit more agressive throughout the day with less sleep (around 6 hours). Taking eight or more hours of sleep seems to leave me slightly laid-back for the rest of the day. I&rsquo;m trying to be more aware of my sleep dependencies, as I&rsquo;m probably going to have to work 12-hour days for a while (maybe up to the end of April) :(

<div class="content p-summary">
A while back I blogged aboutÂ Bob Ong&rsquo;s first book. A short while after, I also picked up his next two books,Â Bakit Baliktad Magbasa ng Libro Ang Mga Pilipino? (Why Do Filipinos Read Backwards?) andÂ Ang Paboritong Libro ni Hudas (Judas&rsquo; Favorite Book).
&ldquo;Bakit Baligtad&rdquo; focuses on the Philippines, its people, its quirks and its problems. &ldquo;Paboritong Libro&rdquo; is a lot harder to classify, as it jumps across several topics, with the unifying theme being the chapters named after anagrams of the seven deadly sins.

Currently listening to &ldquo;Boulevard of Broken Songs&rdquo;, a neat mashup mainly of Green Day&rsquo;s &ldquo;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&rdquo; and Oasis&rsquo; &ldquo;Wonderwall&rdquo;. This and some other mashupsÂ here. (haven&rsquo;t listened to the others though&hellip; )
Another interesting mashup that came out quite a while back wasÂ &ldquo;This Is How You Remind Me Someday&rdquo;Â , where Nickelback is caught basically reusing the same chords for two songs. Great stuff.
Other songs/bands I&rsquo;ve been listening to lately:

The last Zelda game I played (as in, to the end) was Link To The Past, and I think it was on David&rsquo;s old SNES. Or it may have been on ZSNES, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure anymore. Before that was the first Zelda, which I actually finished on its original console!
Seems that the years have been kind to the Zelda formula: Octoroks and Tektites on the world map, Bats, Skeletons and Wizrobes underground, Boomerangs and Arrows to throw about, Pieces of Heart to collect, Swords, Bottles, hidden passages, name it, it&rsquo;s all here.

Bomb blasts rock Davao, General Santos, Makati &ndash; INQ7.net
 Makati City, three people were killed while at least 20 others were injured after an explosion rocked a bus plying EDSA as it passed underneath the Metro Rail Transit&rsquo;s Ayala Station, Metro Manila police chief Director Avelino Razon Jr. said.
 What a way to celebrate Valentine&rsquo;s day. And here I was justÂ blogging about security issues. (Although looks like this incident wasn&rsquo;t actually in the MRT.

Optical media and the MRT/LRT
I&rsquo;m pretty sure what is described in the above blog post (confiscation of unlabelled optical media from LRT/MRT commuters) is obviously stupid, though probably not illegal. The rail authorities can probably refuse entry to anyone for any reason they consider valid.
It&rsquo;s probably legal, but I doubt it&rsquo;s enforceable though. Anyone who&rsquo;s ridden the MRT during rush hours knows what I&rsquo;m talking about. Security inspections last roughly half a second for every three passengers; the security personnel will simply make a quick pass through your bags with their stick.

GearLive: Why Sony&rsquo;s PSP will suck
I&rsquo;m not actually particularly interested in the PSP, but this article is interesting and has quickly convinced me that the PSP will in fact, suck.
As a handheld platform, I think it&rsquo;s pretty hard to beat the GBA. I&rsquo;m already thinking of buying one, as it would give me access to all those great Nintendo franchises [1] in their pure 2D forms, without me having to buy a different console.

<div class="content p-summary">
I tried to play two PS2 games today: Spiderman 2 and Naruto &ndash; Narutimate Hero 2. I knew we had pirated copies of both.
Spiderman 2 &ndash; failed. The PS2 wouldn&rsquo;t even play the disc. Instead it made a wonderful churning noise that made me quickly hit the eject button. This is Sony&rsquo;s best form of copy protection: In my experience, our PS2 can only play somewhere between 30% &ndash; 50% of all pirated discs out there.

Ctrl Alt Del &ndash; Tragically l337
Never actually read Ctrl-Alt-Del before, although I have heard of it. The webcomic is somewhat Penny-Arcade like, except with more continuity and only one of the two guys on the couch is insane.
The comic linked to above is my favorite so far. =)

Khan-fusion and a cabbie tale &ndash; INQ7.net
Cool story on INQ7 about a 40-year old cab driver who plays popular MMORPGs here in the Philippines. Goes to show how well MMORPGs like Ragnarok, MU, etc. are doing locally. Even though they&rsquo;re not considered &ldquo;big&rdquo; compared to American giants like Everquest and World of Warcraft, they&rsquo;ve definitely captured the Pinoy market quite well.

RPGamer &ndash; News Bulletin &ndash; Namco, Capcom Combine Forces to Create Sim-RPG
Wow. I mean, wow. The game will feature playable Namco and Capcom characters apparently, and not just from RPGs. Street Fighter RPG! I&rsquo;d play it. :p
Note: This is the first time I&rsquo;m using Blogger&rsquo;s BlogThis! feature. It&rsquo;s neat.
Edit: They&rsquo;ve got screens
! Morrigan finally gets a new sprite!

This game is the third and last installment of Tri-Ace&rsquo;s venerable space opera science fiction RPG, spanning across three consoles [1] , and it&rsquo;s a good finish. I finished the main story just before the year&rsquo;s end [2] . But I&rsquo;ve still been actively playing it, going through the bonus dungeons [3] The fact that I finished it, and the fact that I am still playing it, and the fact that I am still planning to finish it on both of the higher difficulty levels, all of these facts speak volumes about how good this game is, given that I don&rsquo;t have nearly as much time to play as I did before I was working.

I moved some of the &ldquo;journal&rdquo; posts I had from there into blogger, using a very detailed process I shall refer to as &ldquo;manual copy-and-paste and editing of links&rdquo;.

&ldquo;I resolve to live life on purpose, to take control of my fate, to sieze each day as if it were my last. I will be reckless. I will be daring. I will be strong. I will challenge fate. I will defy the gods. Or I will die trying.&rdquo;

This entry is being published in April 2021. Around this time, I was digging around the wayback machine and found some old versions of my blog, so I thought I&rsquo;d take some screenshots and psot them here, backdated into their proper place in the timeline. The two screenshots here are from 2004 and 2005, but I didn&rsquo;t want to bother creating two separate posts.
This was back when my blog was powered by Blogger and it was hosted on a free web hosting service called Fateback.

I usually prefer my holidays to be times of rest. Times to be free from work and stress, to indulge in things I like to do. I&rsquo;ve just realized that Christmas is a rather stressful season.
For one thing, there&rsquo;s the multitude of Christmas gatherings one has to attend. With family. With relatives. With friends. With friends of family. With coworkers. With coworkers who are friends. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t enjoy myself at these gatherings mind you.

The Christmas season has been hellacious. Deadlines to catch up with at the start of the next year meant crunch time for most of the past two weeks. So, for my first blog post on my first rest day in a while, I&rsquo;ll bring home some work.
I have a problem with Excel. I&rsquo;m writing a web app that generates HTML files which are exported to Excel. In most cases, it&rsquo;s easy, I just follow the template generated by using Excel-&gt;File-&gt;Save As-&gt;HTML

Evil illegal loggers have been in the news lately, mainly due to their being blamed as scapegoats for the rash of flooding during the last two typhoons that left hundreds, maybe thousands, dead in their wake and strewing devastation upon this blighted land. I&rsquo;m not here to talk about whether the loggers are indeed to blame, or how it&rsquo;s silly for the government to try to implement a total log ban when they can&rsquo;t even implement a selective log ban, or how chances are everyone important will forget about this in, say a month tops, while the victims continue their struggle to recover even a fraction of their once-normal lives.

And that explains why this blog&rsquo;s layout has changed again.
I would have posted this (and some other stuff) earlier, but I was in AN ETERNITY OF PAIN for the past two and a half hours. I would like to take this time to berate my stupid, stupid impacted molar, and the stupid, stupid painkillers that took over two hours to kick in. Along with my stupid, stupid thyroid gland, which, because of hyperthyroidism, prevents me from having dental surgery on this sucker.

Mike: I thought you were broke?
Me: That&rsquo;s just a lie I tell people who ask me for money.
 I forgot to talk about this. We played Champions of Kamigawa Team Sealed a couple of weekends back. For the uninitiated, ChK is a Magic:the Gathering set, and Team Sealed is our favorite limited format! I think it&rsquo;s mostly because if we lose, I can blame my teammates for screwing up, unlike in regular tournaments where it really is my fault.

Sir Alexander Alix, quintessential Pisay trigo and calculus teacher, passed away recently due to cirrhosis of the liver. There&rsquo;s a service for him at Pisay tomorrow, Dec. 3, Friday. Since I doubt I can go, I&rsquo;ll say my piece here.
Alix was a helluva guy. Friendly and gets well with the students. And he gave high grades. Seriously. He gave me flat 1.0s (highest possible grade) for all four quarters of fourth year math.

I went to the dentist yesterday (irrelevant), and at National Bookstore Shangri-la, I found a copy ofÂ The Waste Lands, a day after I blogged about looking for it! They also had a copy of the fourth bookÂ Wizard and Glass, but I only had enough cash for one.
On a website note, if you&rsquo;ll notice, I added entries from myÂ del.icio.us accountÂ to the blog. It&rsquo;s done using the excellentÂ Feed2JS tool.

Really. I&rsquo;ll read most anything. Books, comics, magazines, newspapers, leaflets, articles, essays. Well, anything well-written at least. When I first got access to the Internet, I was overjoyed. &ldquo;Wow! Lots of stuff to read!&rdquo; And I read a lot online. I started mostly with anime fanfiction, but pretty soon I enjoyed reading discussions on mailing-lists, message boards, news sites, etc. The internet is a treasure trove for one who always strives for information.

Interesting storyÂ about a guy who had to shell out 350 dollars to quote Radiohead lyrics in his book. Even though he was able to quote from many other bands, books, and even a separate Radiohead album for free. Even he had personally met the band before, and had freely let them quote his own works in their concerts. Gives a good idea of how fucked-up the worldwide copyright system is.

The evolution of the web as a gaming platform seems to be coming along lately. With games often serving as pioneers into new frontiers, I believe this is merely signifying the trend of software products transforming into services instead of commodities.
Anyway, what I mean to say is, I&rsquo;ve been spending quite some time with web-based games lately. Mostly it&rsquo;s the fantastic and funny web-based parody RPG Kingdom of Loathing, which I&rsquo;ve mentioned before.

<div class="content p-summary">
The other day, while waiting to get a blood test at Clinica Manila, Megamall, I managed to finish about 2/3rds of Paolo Coellho&rsquo;s best-seller The Alchemist. I finished the last 1/3rd during a 15-minute bathroom break back home. It was a short book. Lots of people have raved about how good it is. What do I think? It&rsquo;s okay, but nothing overly special. Maybe I didn&rsquo;t get too much of it because it didn&rsquo;t have much new material for me.

I am a man of many things, of many passions. I work as an engineer, remodelling space shuttles so that they don&rsquo;t crash and burn on reentry. I play the piano, the trombone and the harmonica. I am a columnist for an internationally acclaimed newspaper. I produce and direct award-winning movies. To relax, I write full-length novels, solve transcendental math problems and practice karate, taekwondo and aikido.
I save people from drowning, I protect children from danger, I patrol the streets for litterbugs and jaywalkers, I go to government offices and streamline their processes.

Interesting read: There&rsquo;s thisÂ spouse of an EA developer who&rsquo;s taking it to EA&rsquo;s supposedly unfair labor practices on livejournal. Cool thing: AÂ chess program that shows you the computer&rsquo;s train of thought! Interesting English Trivia &ndash; yes it&rsquo;s geeky ð Tech news:Â Winamp is dead, long live Winamp! I actually like Winamp, especially version 5. There are quite a number of things I&rsquo;d like to change with it, but it&rsquo;s a lot better than WMP.

&hellip; or maybe just distracted. After putting in some fifty hours over a four-day period last weekend, I thought I&rsquo;d cool off for a few days, doing nothing but what needs to be done, and some surfing and sleep when I get home.
But I&rsquo;m back! And I&rsquo;m going to get my gaming groove on! I got a new copy of Star Ocean: Til The End of Time, hopefully this one&rsquo;s a good copy, I haven&rsquo;t tested it yet.

It&rsquo;s 1:30 in the morning, and I plan on being at work by 8AM, so I&rsquo;ll just throw out a quick book review before I buzz off to meet the sandman.
Neil Stephenson&rsquo;s Cryptonomicon is the only book I managed to finish out of the three I took with me to Bicol. And I actually started reading it about a month and a half earlier.
In a word, the book isÂ wordy.

In a fit of awe-inspiring common sense, I want swimming with my eyeglasses on. And, as expected when one makes such a gargantuan mistake, the Sea was aware of my folly. It sent its minions, one after another, to take my precious away from me. Again and again I bore their onslaught, as wave after wave came after me, yearning to knock me off my feet loosely planted upon the sandy earth some four and a half feet below water level.

As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, Daet is a small town. When I was there, I was mentally comparing it to the UP Diliman campus. Main reason being, we had a tendency to walk everywhere we went. Just like in UP, everything was literally within &ldquo;walking distance&rdquo; &ndash; the beach, the church, the cemetary, etc. So in my mind, the UP Diliman campus and Daet, Camarines Norte occupy roughly the same area, even though technically, one is a university campus and the other a full-sized town.

Well, not really, seeing as how there aren&rsquo;t really any mountains anywhere near here. I&rsquo;m in Daet, Camarines Norte, if that means anything to you. It&rsquo;s great to be back here â apparently the last time I was here was in 1996.
Some things have changed, but mostly things are still the same. There&rsquo;s some sort of minimall now, and a Shakey&rsquo;s, and a Jollibee. ð And there&rsquo;s internet! I&rsquo;m posting right now from a dingy internet cafe near my grandmother&rsquo;s house.

I need to escape from this madness, this constant flow of unfinished tasks. I am leaving for the land of my ancestors, returning to my roots, seeking the tranquility that has eluded me these weeks past. For seven long years have I not ventured there, and yet now I find myself seeking its warm comforts. What will I find when I return to those shores? Will it be the same simple, quite town I once knew?
