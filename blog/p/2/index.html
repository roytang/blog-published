Leaving Hugo It&rsquo;s been a bit under two years since I migrated the site from Wordpress to Hugo. As discussed in this post one year ago, I was very happy with the general workflow of managing posts through markdown files in git, but had big problems with the Hugo build time, largely a consequence of my social media archiving. At that time, I didn&rsquo;t want to invest effort into migrating to a different backend, but the problem has only gotten incrementally worse since then, so I decided to take the jump and started working on it last month.

Server migration update: I had encountered some trouble with the Travis-CI -based Hugo build generating this here website last week. Luckily, most of the migration work to the new backend was already done, so I went ahead and switched over the servers. So this site is no longer plain-old deployed HTML, but rather powered by a Django backend. The site should be mostly the same, though I did take the opportunity to move some stuff around.

So I got a Nintendo Switch last month. One of the first games I had gotten for the system was the recently released Super Mario 3d All-Stars. I had really been wanting to play Super Mario Odyssey instead, but my brother had a copy of that game that I could borrow later, so I decided to get 3dAS first, as I had never really played the 3 games on the collection.

So my current webhost finally decided to give me a deadline, the long and short of it is that my new server needs to be ready by December the 9th, giving me a bit under a month to get things in order. I&rsquo;m already in the middle of setting up the new server, so I think I&rsquo;ll be ready by early November anyway. Most of the code to run the new blog is also mostly ready (who knows how many bugs there are though!

The world continues to be terrible. The PH government wants people to get back to work and everything to spur the economy (with health precautions and everything). A lot of people have no choice, but I&rsquo;m fortunate enough to not have to go out there yet, and I&rsquo;m sure people like me will still hold back. This all would have been a lot easier if the government had gotten control of this pandemic early on but it is what it is.

October is imminent! There are two distractions I&rsquo;m looking forward to in the coming month.
  The first one is Inktober, which I&rsquo;ve been doing since 2016. Basically it&rsquo;s just to do 30 ink drawings in October, one per day. There are some official prompts, which I&rsquo;ll probably follow. I haven&rsquo;t really done any serious sketching in a while, maybe this will help me get back into the groove.

It&rsquo;s hard to imagine this is already the 3rd week of September, it feels like the month is passing by quickly, although I haven&rsquo;t been particularly busy recently.
I did do some paid work this past week; not a lot, just filling in to provide some emergency support/consultation.
I guess the reason it feels like the week passed by quickly is that I started a new side project (like many programmers, I am afflicted by the curse of wanting to start too many side projects).

It has certainly been a week, yes it has. The world continues to turn (and burn even).
I&rsquo;ve been busy. Not so much with work, though there was a bit of that due to a required emergency software change (aren&rsquo;t they always emergencies?). I wasn&rsquo;t doing the emergency work myself, more like consulting and advising how to approach it, so not much to tell there.
I did quite a bit of work on my personal data processes/backups/workflows.

<div class="content p-summary">
I finished Uncharted 4: A Thief&rsquo;s End yesterday, and I felt like making a post about it, since I had a bunch of screenshots. Late game review because the game came out in 2016. I think I got it from PS+? Certainly didn&rsquo;t pay for it.
I first played the original Uncharted trilogy back in 2010-2011, but I found out just now while writing this post that I never finished Uncharted 3 (started yes, apparently), so that explains why some story elements seemed unfamiliar in the 4th game.

It&rsquo;s September! The last six months were a blur.
It&rsquo;s considered &ldquo;Christmas season&rdquo; over here already I guess. The local memes are that once the clock hits midnight between Aug 31 and Sep 1, your neighbor&rsquo;s Christmas lights are magically up. Also of course the famous Jose Mari Chan gets famous starting September, since malls and stores love to play his Christmas songs during this time. IDK what to expect for Christmas season this year though, since we are still in a pandemic.

This last week was weird. I feel like I didn&rsquo;t really get much done in terms of productivity, yet I don&rsquo;t feel I was unproductive. A very relaxed and chill week.
Once again a tiny bit of work done this past week, some fixes, including to side projects. I also spent some time preparing for some events next weekend. Although I wasn&rsquo;t productive this week, I did outline a bit of a roadmap of new features for one of my side projects, hopefully I can get into that in the coming weeks!

The week after I posted about phoning in the weeknotes, here I am with one where there&rsquo;s nothing much to report. Not that surprising, given how busy I was over the previous few weeks, I took the opportunity to take a more relaxing week.
There was a bit of work to be done, but very miniscule by comparison. Minor fixes here and there, including to some side projects.
I did get to write on the blog more, as expected.

Filed under &ldquo;Things I Don&rsquo;t Really Grok&rdquo;
Podcasts and audiobooks These 2 are kind of in the same boat. Their main sin is that they are audio-only. When consuming content, my order of preference for formats is roughly:
 text (+images I guess) (most preferred) video (with audio) audio only (least preferred)  I think these preferences have to do with information density: I&rsquo;m pretty sure I prefer text because text can convey the most amount of information in the least amount of bits.

Mozilla made the tech news recently for laying off a whole lot of people. (Official statement). People were alarmed and worried about the future of what is the last major independent browser and the open web, bit it looks like it isn&rsquo;t that bleak. Most of the layoffs were to teams other than those working on Firefox, things like the experimental browser engine Servo, devtools, and MDN. The core Gecko team seems to be unaffected.

These weeknotes are coming in late in the day because of reasons. (The reasons being laziness and procrastination.)
Actually, I feel like I&rsquo;ve been kind of phoning in the weeknotes over the past few weeks, they&rsquo;ve mostly been &ldquo;hey, I&rsquo;ve been busy, so nothing of significance happened, but here are some things I watched/played.&rdquo; Supposedly one of the side effects of writing regular updates is that you tend to look out for more interesting things to do so you have something to write about, even on an unconscious level.

Still kind of busy, although there&rsquo;s a bunch of things I hope I can finally wrap up this week, so I can move on to the long list of other things I want to be doing. The world continues to be bleak, so I&rsquo;m still hiding from it.
My stuff:
 Forty-two. I thought about just merging these into a single post for the day, but nah, this seems better. Reworking the old charity side project still ongoing.

Forty two is of course the &ldquo;Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.&rdquo; (if you haven&rsquo;t yet read the 5-book Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy trilogy, I suggest you do so, you are in for a treat.)
 For some reason I imagined I would be able to take at least a couple of days off of everything else I&rsquo;m doing to chill and actually craft a well-written, deep, introspective post for the occasion, but alas, various things I&rsquo;m working on and all the usual distractions means I am here in the early morning hours of the day itself typing this out.

Kind of a busy week for me again, so the week kind of passed me by quickly. It&rsquo;s August! In one month it will be (PH) Christmas season! It feels like July went by more quickly than other quarantine months.
My stuff:
 A bit of consulting work. Reworking the old charity side project still ongoing. I was hoping to finish all the changes last week and next week would be testing and deployment, but stuff got in the way (and estimates may have been a bit off), but the spillover is small and we should still be fine for finishing everything next week.

 hm. I was a bit busy this week, so I wasn&rsquo;t paying too much attention, so I don&rsquo;t have too much to rail against today. Well of course, things are still ongoing. There&rsquo;s still the pandemic, fascist police state philosophy continues to rear it&rsquo;s ugly head in the US, PH gov&rsquo;t continues to be dumb, etc., but this week seemed a bit tame comparably.

Just in time for #JRPGJuly, I finally managed to complete my platinum run for Final Fantasy VII Remake! Spoiler-free review first, then the rest of the sections are no-holds barred.

22 Jul 2020 12:00amView postClose   Spoiler-free review The game is a fantastic retelling of the original FF7&rsquo;s Midgar section. The plot largely tracks the original, except greatly expounded.

So recently Github secretly rolled out a new feature where you can create a file named README.md in a repo named github.com/&lt;your github username&gt;/&lt;your github username&gt;, and that markdown file would be rendered on your Github profile page. It means, you can now put basically anything you want on your Github profile!
I just read this post from Simon Willson about using this new feature + Github actions and a Python script to automatically generate and update his Github profile.

My country:
 Friday afternoon the president sighed the controversial &ldquo;Anti-terror law&rdquo; that vastly expands police powers, allows people to be arrested without warrants on mere suspicion of terrorism etc. Interesting timing, right after China applies a new anti-terror low to Hong Kong (and rightly gets castigated for it by countries all over the world) and also right after the PNP (who promise not to abuse their newfound powers) are under criticism for killing some soldiers in a misencounter and tampering with the crime scene to cover it up.

My stuff:
 This week&rsquo;s pandemic notes. Easily the most annoying thing this week: our broadband modem conked out Wednesday night. Customer support isn&rsquo;t super responsive for local telcos: I called their support line the next day (support line is not even available 24/7!), got put on hold for 45 minutes TWICE before they agreed to send a repair crew over the next day (Friday). Friday morning I got a text that the technician visit was actually scheduled for SATURDAY morning.

I had been meaning to quit Facebook for more than a year maybe, but I kept putting it off. The main reason being that I like having backups of my own digital data (still very much a pack rat), and Facebook&rsquo;s social media export is less than ideal, for me at least.
Less than ideal why? It doesn&rsquo;t include a lot of content I would like backed up, including:
 comments on my posts (there have been some good conversations with friends over the years I would prefer to preserve) things I&rsquo;ve reposted from other people content of certain groups I&rsquo;m members of (again, mostly for some interesting discussions over the years) pictures posted by other people that I&rsquo;ve been tagged in  For a while I looked around for scraper programs/scripts to this for me, but none really did what I wanted.

My stuff:
 This week&rsquo;s pandemic notes. Some days still hot, but weather beginning to turn for the better. Sleep kind of better and a bit more regular too. Did my quarterly medical checkup this past week (slightly delayed). No issues, but I need to do an FBS test for next time. Sleep schedule kind of settling back into my usual biphasic sleep. Although the second phase seems to move around a lot&hellip; Not much work-wise the past week, and a bit more family-related expenses.

Surprisingly, no new crises have emerged during the past week. I think. More of the same crises, carrying on.
Last Friday was the PH independence day holiday. I didn&rsquo;t feel like celebrating. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like we are free. In any case, a protest rally against the yet-to-be-signed terror bill took place at the university that morning, inspite of threats from the authorities that it wasn&rsquo;t allowed. The protestors spaced themselves out and everything.

Why? It&rsquo;s not you, but it&rsquo;s not me either. It&rsquo;s Facebook. There&rsquo;s a ton of reasons for quitting Facebook, but here are some highlights:

A while back I got an export of my Foursquare/Swarm data. If you&rsquo;re not familiar, these were a pair of apps that were used for &ldquo;checking-in&rdquo; to particular locations, with a sort of gamification system where if you checked in at a place often enough, you would earn points and eventually become &ldquo;Mayor&rdquo; of the venue. The idea being that owners of those venues might give some benefits to those who check-in often at those locations (AFAIK, this never really caught on in the Philippines).

A bit of brouhaha a couple of weeks ago after the National Telecommunications Commission ordered the country&rsquo;s biggest broadcaster ABS-CBN to cease operations because Congress had been remiss in renewing their franchise.. This despite the NTC earlier promising they can operate provisionally while the franchise renewal is being processed, a change of heart apparently due to a legal opinion by the SolGen. Some thoughts:
&ldquo;Bias&rdquo; The speaker of the house says:

My stuff:
 This week&rsquo;s quarantine notes. the weather has been so hot lately, I&rsquo;ve taken to shifting my sleep schedule to afternoons so that I can maximize the use of the air-conditioning to when it&rsquo;s most needed. It also helps me be more productive, since I can get more things done if I&rsquo;m awake during the cooler hours of the day. I think I&rsquo;m more looking forward to the end of summer than the end of quarantine.

Previously.
In the most recent weeknotes, I mentioned this post about bringing blogs back to the internet and the ensuing discussion on Hacker News.
Some further thoughts on blogging based on the HN discussion:
On Traffic and Engagement Someone mentioned that one of the reasons most people stop blogging is that it feels like there&rsquo;s nobody reading their work. This reminds me of a convo I had with a friend a couple of years back when he saw one of my blog posts.

My Stuff:
 This week&rsquo;s quarantine notes. Work: A bit of Laravel work, and a bit of server management and deployment. Nothing too ridiculous. Watching: Haven&rsquo;t watched much this week. There was the really great Justice League Dark: Apokolips War which came out last week. Apparently it&rsquo;s the last one for the DC AMU, or this particular timeline at least. Quiz: We are now up to 3 locally produced online quiz nights per week, which seems like a lot because we only used to attend 2-3 live events per month.

I mean, that&rsquo;s true in general of course. But it certainly seems much more true in these pandemic times.
Before all of this waves hands arounds frantically, people had a general sense of routine and predictability about their daily lives. It varied person by person of course, but many people had regular things like a steady job that kept them occupied for most of the week, a school where their kids could go off to most days, maybe a favorite bar or restaurant they visit every week or so, church on Sundays, friends you saw every other weekend or so, malls or stores they would pass by regularly, and so on and so forth.

My Stuff:
 Early this morning I took a walk outside for the first time since the lockdown started. Previously I had only gone out for groceries and meds. Only for less than 30 mins, and only in our subdivision, walking up and down the street. It&rsquo;s good to be walking again, although this short and limited route is quite boring and full of neighbor&rsquo;s dogs barking at me, so I&rsquo;m not too fond of it, but it&rsquo;s better to get the habit started again since I&rsquo;ve been feeling the fatness piling on due to the quarantine and the lack of exercise.

<div class="content p-summary">
Last week, Wizards announced that they were sunsetting DCI numbers and Planeswalker Points, this felt like an appropriate time to do a retrospective on my 25 years playing Magic the Gathering. Strap yourselves in, this is going to be a long one!
The Early Years I started playing MTG in my fourth year of high school, so that&rsquo;s around sometime 1994-1995. The most recent expansion releases at that time were The Dark and Fallen Empires.

First week of May. At least two more weeks of quarantine remain. COVID19 Diary still exists, only updated every so often. I stayed in the entire week!
 The week was slightly more productive than the last one, at least in terms of personal projects. I moved a couple of them forward. And also spent a bunch of time spring cleaning and moving stuff around here on the site. Details to follow.

I was reading this post about how to respond to the &ldquo;Nothing to Hide&rdquo; argument against the concept of privacy. The quoted DuckDuckGo blog post lists some pretty good reasons, but I thought I&rsquo;d expound on some thoughts as well.
The core of the &ldquo;Nothing to Hide&rdquo; argument is that if you, personally, have nothing incriminating or illegal to hide, then you don&rsquo;t need to worry about privacy intrusions. The argument is used mainly to justify things like state-sponsored surveillance, but might also be applicable to data collection activities by large corporations such as Facebook or Google.

I&rsquo;ve had the good fortune to be on the interviewer side of technical interviews much more often than I&rsquo;ve been the interviewee. I&rsquo;ve been doing a few more of these over the past couple of years and made some notes, so I thought I&rsquo;d talk about technical interviews for a bit. Caveat: these are largely based on my own experiences, in the local environment here in the PH.
