It&rsquo;s 8:30 pm on Friday. I step out of Maxim&rsquo;s, a fastfood place near the office in Hong Kong. I flew in to HK the morning of the day before, and had given a presentation over a conference call on Thursday night. This was the only free time I had during the entire trip since I had to fly back the next morning. I decided to take a walk for maybe an hour or 30 minutes, to savor the cool night&rsquo;s weather before going back to hot and humid Manila the next day.

I had actually read the much-acclaimed graphic novel only last year. And while I found the story decent enough, I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether to like it or hate it. Undoubtedly it was an important point in the history of &ldquo;superhero&rdquo; comics, but I was never entirely sure about it&rsquo;s point.
So of course I saw the movie, and it had remained roughly 85-90% loyal to the source material, which made it a bit boring for me since I generally knew what was going to happen most of the time (except for you know, that thing about the bad guy&rsquo;s master plan&hellip; ).

For the record, I purchased an original R1 copy of Street Fighter IV for the PS3 last Tuesday, and we&rsquo;ve been pretty much playing it whenever we had free time at home. The one time I came in late to work during the month of February was because of Street Fighter IV.
Street Fighter IV came in with ridiculously high reviews for both the XBox 360 and PS3 versions, the PS3 version garnering a 94 (universal acclaim) on Metacritic It can&rsquo;t be denied that it&rsquo;s an awesome game, although not everyone agrees.

I reinstalled MTGO3 last week because I figured I could get some casual play out of it at least. After installation I found out that Conflux release events were this weekend so I might as well play, since I was not able to play IRL at this time. I was hoping MTGO3 had improved by now, and that they had sufficient server loading, etc. to handle the number of players without the servers being crashy and laggy and whatnot.

I had time to kill before going to see my brother&rsquo;s art exhibit at megamall, so I went and watched Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li.
It was so bad. I could&rsquo;ve been able to forgive the fact that they roughly 80% of the story shied away from Street Fighter canon, had the movie&rsquo;s storyline actually been good. As it is, you can expect short, unsatisfying fight scenes, ridiculous background stories, disjointed plot/scenes (reminds me of Smallville and/or Heroes writing =/), terrible wigs and the ridiculous sight of Michael Clark Duncan getting beaned by a pineapple.

You may have noticed the new color scheme and new &ldquo;Theme Switcher&rdquo; widget in the sidebar. I had done some CSS work during the past month in the office and it made me want to tweak the stylesheets on this site a bit. I figured I might as well make it easy to switch stylesheets, so I wrote a small Theme Switcher django app. (Well, it&rsquo;s more of a stylesheet switcher I guess)

Excellent talk given at the Canadian University Software Engineering Conference (CUSEC) last year (2008). The presenter is Zed Shaw who&rsquo;s a famous Ruby guy or something. The video is around 70 minutes long. The first part of the talk is mostly about a Document Management System he worked on, kinda interesting, but the second part is better where he talks about people who program cool things as a hobby and how to avoid becoming just another corporate code.

Amazingly, despite my work schedule I still managed to finish a rather old-school RPG. I finished Star ocean: Second Evolution for the PSP today, clocking in 30 hours of playtime. I have to say I quite enjoy playing RPGs on handhelds. RPGs are usually rather long games so it&rsquo;s nice being able to handle them in bite-sized chunks while commuting, et cetera.
Star Ocean: The Second Story was probably one of the best Japanese RPGs to come out of the Playstation era, despite the lackluster translations of that time (hey, it was pre-year 2000, all translations were pretty bad then!

The situation is:
Player A controls Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker, at starting loyalty.
Player B controls Ajani Vengeant, Tezzeret the Seeker, Elspeth, Knight-Errant and Sarkhan Vol, all at starting loyalty.
Assuming each player has no other permanents and they cannot play any other spells.

I decided to attend the Conflux release event last Saturday, Feb 7 at Neutral Grounds Galleria. As usual, I still had to go to work first so I didn&rsquo;t make it in time for the first 32-man flight and had to wait for NG to restock on product for the second flight. Unfortunately, they were short on SoA boosters, so we would be playing sealed with 6 boosters of Conflux. Yes, six.

I was doing code reviews on an interface file-processing framework to be used in one of our projects. The code was workable and already being used by several programs, and I didn&rsquo;t see any major functional flaws. But design-wise I felt that it could stand for some improvements/refactoring to be &ldquo;better object-oriented code&rdquo; or &ldquo;easier to maintain&rdquo;.
The current design required a lot of inheritance &ndash; the usual way of doing things in older Java code at work.

It&rsquo;s my first Magic outing after more than a month of hibernation. Hopefully Conflux shakes up standard and makes Magic more fun again. Let&rsquo;s go!
Usually I have to register an awesome pool and then get passed a mediocre one. I knew it was different this time around when the guy two seats to my right announced he was able to form a good Naya deck from the Shards of Alara packs alone!

Finally finished Valkyria Chronicles last Saturday, clocking in at around 25 hours. Quick Review:
 Beautiful, beautiful game, even on my SD TV; it&rsquo;s like watching a flowing watercolor painting When you start the game, all the dialogue/cutscenes seems a bit draggy but eventually you get used to the pacing and then you don&rsquo;t mind because the battles are really engaging. Speaking of battles; I&rsquo;m not sure if it would be good for beginners to tactical games.

I actually had some trouble using django-pingback on my custom blog engine; the django-pingback documentation is mostly fine, but there were some caveats that I had to discover myself through a bit of debugging:
  The URL specified for the XML-RPC endpoint in the HTML head needs to be a full absolute url including domain, i.e. http://roytang.net/xmlrpc/, which gave me trouble when I was trying to test using localhost pinging to an online server.

For the past few months, I&rsquo;ve been encountering the COM Surrogate Has Stopped Working Error in Windows Vista, as described here. Unfortunately, most of the recommended fixes on this page didn&rsquo;t work for me. (I had neither DivX nor Nero installed, etc.) Eventually, I had to download InstalledCodec and use trial and error disabling of all the codecs in my system to trace the problem. I narrowed it down to the Xvid Codec and ended up having to disable it.

I came across a website that provided an online Speed Reading Test. Most people I know generally know me to be a fast reader so I decided to take the test.
My results: 472 words per minute screen reading, at 82% comprehension, which the website says classifies me as a &ldquo;good reader&rdquo;. Apparently the best readers can read at 700wpm at 85% comprehension, sounds tough =/
Try the quiz and post your results here.

My current blog app supports syntax highlighting in the blog posts, something I cribbed off Djangosnippet #119
One problem I encountered was that there was no quick visual reference for the styles available with pygments, so I wrote a short demo page here so that I could easily see the appearance of each syntax highlighting class.
Of course, I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to use it in a post yet&hellip;

Frontend: All page templates are valid (X)HTML. However, I choose not to claim valid XHTML (and no doc type declaration) since I can&rsquo;t guarantee that blog posts I write are compliant! The site uses standard CSS and uses the Blueprint CSS Framework for the grid layout of the page. The site design is entirely original (if not simple and bland &ndash; I&rsquo;m not very good with website design yet!). The site has minor usage of JQuery Javascript library in some parts.

Previously I hosted two separate WordPress blogs on roytang.net, the old one I&rsquo;ve had since forever, and a separate one that discussed only magic related articles. It was a bit bothersome to have two WordPress installs though. Now that I&rsquo;ve migrated to a Django backend, I decided to merge the blogs back into one.
The blog now has the following sections/categories:
 Magic the Gathering &ndash; for posts related to MTG Software Development &ndash; for posts related to Software Development (hopefully I can write more about this topic) Gaming &ndash; originally I didn&rsquo;t have this category, but looking at previous contents of the blog and my delicious links, this is one of the things I write about the most, so I made it a separate category Weblog &ndash; everything else I can think of  Each category has a separate RSS feed you can subscribe to &ndash; so that if you&rsquo;re only interested in MTG posts you can subscribe to the MTG category feed, etc.

To show how indecisive we are, here&rsquo;s the conversation we had at the store:
 Saleslady: Sir, anong kulay ang gusto nyo? Black, silver or white?
Me: Alvin, ano gusto mo?
Alvin: Kahit ano, silver na lang siguro.

I&rsquo;m on vacation, so it means I actually have time to hit FNM. I sleeved up the Kithkin deck (no more Blightning for me!) and headed over to Robinson&rsquo;s Galleria (Getting robbed along the way fyi). Nothing surprising, I managed to make 3-1, good enough for fourth place and four packs with crap rares inside. My loss was to the mirror match, most probably due to my lower card quality, as I had only 1 planeswalker in my deck.

I wish there was more to the story, but the true story is rather short: I had a moment of carelessness as I hurriedly tried to disemabark from the crowded MRT, and by the time I was getting on an FX at Megamall I noticed that the front pocket of my bag was open and my phone was missing.
The PSP which was in the same pocket was still there so I guess the thief was in a hurry.

I played around with the built-in comments app today, trying to clean it up.
Some findings:
 Some of the moderation views, such as flagging a post or deleting a post, accept a next parameter that determines where the view will redirect to after the operation. However, the way the url&rsquo;s are set up, there&rsquo;s no easy way to pass this parameter normally, even through query strings. This lovely bug is documented in http://code.

I&rsquo;ve been busy at work so fell a bit behind with Django. Last night I worked on a WordPress importer, so that I could migrate posts from my current blog(s) into the Django-powered blog that I&rsquo;m coding. I&rsquo;m using BeautifulSoup to parse the WordPress export file and insert them as Django objects.
Since I was running the script repeatedly, I had to figure out how to easily run it from the command line, without having to run it from inside manage.

The PTQ was last Sunday, November 17 at Robinson&rsquo;s Galleria.
As per usual, I opened and registered a pretty good pool with 2 Battlegrace Angel and Tezzeret the Seeker. The pool I got passed to me and the deck I built below:

Just kidding. I don&rsquo;t have a draft cap or anything. I went drafting with our would-be GP Taipei contingent last November 12 (Wednesday). I actually almost never play sanctioned matches outside of the weekend tournaments, but I was a bit tired from work and wanted to blow off steam, so I went ahead to Robinson&rsquo;s Galleria and waited a couple of hours for the 8-man draft to fill up.
I opened with Cruel Ultimatum as my first pick, then got a couple of white weenies (Akrasan Squire and Sigiled Paladin) before getting a 4th-pick Agony Warp.

Tournament was last November 2 at Robinson&rsquo;s Galleria. The format is Shards of Alara sealed. Because the store lacked tourney packs, the tournament was split into two halves; one half would get 1 tourney pack + 2 boosters, the other half would get 5 boosters. I played in the tourney pack half.
My pool and decklist to follow. Basically, I played Naya again, splashing blue for (this is ridiculous) 2 Kederekt Leviathans!

I wanted to add some basic tagging to my blog app so I tried out django-tagging. Unfortunately, the featured downloads on the Google Code site are quite out-of-date and would not work with Django 1.0, so I did a subversion checkout instead. If you&rsquo;re getting an error like &ldquo;ImportError: cannot import name parse_lookup&rdquo;, then you need to get the source code from SVN.
Adding the tagging to the blog was pretty easy:

2nd Trial for Taipei was last Sunday, October 17 at Robinson&rsquo;s Galleria. I open to register a very mediocre pool while the rest of the guys at my table open awesome pools with lots of bombs. &ldquo;Gee, I hope we don&rsquo;t keep this pool.&rdquo;
The judge comes over, rolls the dice and we keep our pools. Awkward.

So I got a basic blog app up and running.
Posting, paged archives, etc.
Comments implemented using the django.contrib.comments. No problems here, the only caveat being most of the current documentation found by Google searches refer to the pre-1.0 version. Need to peruse the official docs for 1.0 stuff.
RSS feeds implemented using django.contrib.syndication, this one seems fine.
I tested it and it&rsquo;s running fine on localhost. I also have a free django hosting account at http://bells-n-whistles.

My dad asked me to help book a flight from Manila to Boracay for my uncle who would be a balikbayan this weekend. The rates at PAL were better, so we decided to book using their website. I did the search for the flights, booked the seats, input my uncle&rsquo;s details, etc. When we got to the screen to input the credit card info, my dad went to call my uncle to confirm and to get his credit card.

My brother pointed me to a new (to me at least) online music service called imeem. The website caught my interest for two reasons.
 It uses Adobe Flex, a technology which I&rsquo;ve been using for the past year or so. Any Flex developer knows it&rsquo;s Flex just by looking at the widgets. (Click to enlarge the screenshot!)    (Click to view full-size)    
21 Oct 2008 5:29amClose   The service allowed me to find an mp3 which I&rsquo;ve never found before and have used as a benchmark for how good an mp3 search service is.

&ldquo;when redirecting, how can I make the redirect URL decoupled from the urls.py of the parent app?&rdquo;
-&gt; It turns out that HttpResponseRedirect supports relative paths, so this was fine.
return HttpResponseRedirect(&quot;../&quot; + str(post.id) + &quot;/&quot;)
I got the basic posting structure up.
/post/new/ -&gt; To make new posts
/post// -&gt; To view a single post
/post/all/ -&gt; To view all posts
I should probably start thinking of a better url scheme.
