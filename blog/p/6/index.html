I&rsquo;m not a big fan of theme parks. I think for the most part they are overpriced and not worth the time, effort or money. And I&rsquo;d probably never go to one by myself or without one of my nieces/nephews. I understand the impetus of bringing kids to a theme park of course, they really enjoy it. Prior to this trip, I&rsquo;ve only ever been to a theme park once, and that was in Unversal Studios Singapore with my brothers back in 2015.

My US trip started on the first of the month. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write more regularly about it, but one thing I had forgotten was how exhausting it would be to be a tourist, walking everywhere all of the time. Here&rsquo;s how many steps my Fitbit recorded during that first week:

8 Jun 2019 5:56amClose   I finished this week with a bit more than 105k steps, which I&rsquo;m pretty sure is a lifetime record (though I dont have the data anymore from the Europe trip in 2015 - I suspect that it&rsquo;s comparable in scale.

30 May 2019 5:56amClose   Damn, that was a grind. But it felt super rewarding especially as a free-to-play player since the closed beta, always struggling for wildcards to build the decks. I had never tried going for Mythic beyond the first month, when I realized what a grind it was. This standard format was also pretty dynamic, which meant the best deck changed constantly, so it was hard to be successful by sticking to one deck, which meant a lot of WCs are needed to be able to shift with the meta.

I remember when playing the original version of Civilization back in the day, the &ldquo;most advanced&rdquo; form of government was Democracy, with the only downside of it being you can&rsquo;t declare war (because you had a senate that would stop you.) The other available forms of government were typically not very useful, but Democracy massively increased your trade output, so most often I would build the Pyramids (a wonder which allowed switching to any government immediately and without penalty), and spend the rest of the game toggling between Democracy and Despotism (for when I wanted to go to war).

The big TV thing of May 2019 was of course, the much maligned finale for Game of Thrones. I&rsquo;ve written about that separately here.
Most of the US TV series also ended their runs in May. Arrowverse show seasons were littered with poor writing as usual. I rank the seasons in this order:
 best is Legends of Tomorrow season 4. The reason Legends is the best is that they&rsquo;re not afraid to be outrageous.

“We are, finally, all wanderers in search of knowledge. Most of us hold the dream of becoming something better than we are, something larger, richer, in some way more important to the world and ourselves. Too often, the way taken is the wrong way, with too much emphasis on what we want to have, rather than what we wish to become.” — Louis L’Amour

<div class="content p-summary">
After a much-maligned eighth and final season, HBO&rsquo;s Game of Thrones is done. Unmarked spoilers follow.
The eighth season was so notoriously bad, we got petitions asking for rewrites. Here&rsquo;s how I explained it to a friend after the notorious episode 5:
 It&rsquo;s not about characters being killed, it&rsquo;s about bad writing because they&rsquo;re cramming. The writers were determined to finish the show in 2 smaller seasons so they&rsquo;re skipping a lot of necessary character development and characters just do stupid things because the plot demands it.

The results are disappointing, but that&rsquo;s only because we expected better. Historically, those who have made it into the Senate did so mostly on name recognition. What does it matter if Diokno had the best resume of all the candidates, if many of the voters did not know who he was? How could he compete against someone who appeared on a hit primetime TV series right up until the start of the campaign period?

Continuing with the Wheel of Time re-read! I devoured Eye of the World much more quickly than I expected, finishing the book in less than 3 days. It helps that I had already read it before of course, but I think there&rsquo;s also a part of me that enjoys escaping into this fantasy world when the real world outlook seems dire.
Anyway, the book shows a lot of Tolkien-esque plot influence, especially near the start: Some kids from a backwater village are visited by a magic user and after some troubles are forced on the run from black riders?

The PH senatorial and local elections are on Monday. I almost didn&rsquo;t want to write the usual election post, mostly because I was annoyed with and tired of the electorate and the politicians and the system and all that. But we shouldn&rsquo;t give in to despair.
Often when choosing who to vote, it will be difficult to find candidates who align perfectly with your values. You make compromises to prioritize those issues you think are more important.

Since I was going to be taking a long trip in a month, I was looking for some books to read on the plane and in airports and whatnot while waiting. I settled on a re-read of Robert Jordan&rsquo;s Wheel of Time series, a pretty good time for it since by next year we may have a TV series from Amazon (hopefully better than Game of Thrones). Side note: Wheel of Time is also why I&rsquo;m not optimistic that GRRM can finish ASoIaF in just two more books - Jordan took forever and died before he could finish WoT and even Sanderson who took over needed an additional three books to finish the saga.

I often prefer having a randomly changing background wallpaper, even back in the day when Windows didn&rsquo;t support it natively and I had to install various plugins to support it. I like the variance! The one I&rsquo;ve been using recently was this set of wallpapers based on Street Fighter stage backgrounds, which I got from a reddit thread that I unfortunately can&rsquo;t find anymore (I&rsquo;ll update this post if I find it later).

I am, admittedly, a grammar nazi.
I think it&rsquo;s something that comes with being a voracious reader, especially as a child. When you have been reading (and speaking) English so much from an early age, you come to have an instinctive grasp of what is and what is not proper sentence construction. Some sentences just look right and some just look wrong. I&rsquo;m not saying I have perfect mastery of the English language or anything.

Someone once described me as a tinkerer, i.e. someone who likes taking stuff apart or putting them together or otherwise experimenting to figure out how they work. This is not entirely inaccurate, though I prefer not to tinker with real world stuff because of my poor dexterity. My tinkering is usually limited to software and tech devices. I&rsquo;m always willing to try different things to figure out how to get software to work.

From a friend&rsquo;s Facebook post:
 Less than 2 weeks to the elections, I want to share a hard lesson I learned from the previous one. Especially given that I&rsquo;ve had formal lessons in rhetoric and logic.
Do not believe that logical fallacies are fallacies. Or rather&ndash;understand that they are logical fallacies, but that the world does not run on logic and so any classroom lessons on what arguments are fallacious have no relevance.

I follow a lot of strangers over on Twitter, each one usually for a different reason that I find interesting. Sometimes they follow me back for one reason or another, and it gives me a little bit of anxiety. The anxiety is because here is this person whose content I like, who followed me back probably because of an interaction we had, and she is expecting that my tweets will be more of the same kind of content.

Now that I&rsquo;m playing MTG again regularly on MTG Arena, maybe I&rsquo;ll start writing a bit more Magic stuff. With War of the Spark now out and the metagame not yet established, I thought I&rsquo;d be foolish and waste my wildcards on some brewing. As a reminder, I&rsquo;m still an F2P player on Arena, so wildcards are precious and few lol. I did have some 50k in gold and a few gems saved up when War of the Spark hit, so i have already played a few sealeds (only 1 got to 7 wins) and opened quite a few packs.

&ldquo;Never give in, never, never, never–never, in nothing, great or small, large or petty. Never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense.&rdquo;

I&rsquo;ve already written extensively about Avengers Endgame, but there are other things I watched this month too.
Shazam came out early this month, and while it was unfortunately sandwiched between MCU blockbusters, it was a fun adventure romp and surprised me in a few ways. I wrote a short spoiler-free review over on Tumblr.
TV-wise, I&rsquo;ve been on a rewatch binge of 30 Rock that unfortunately started with season 4 due to Amazon Prime&rsquo;s weird way of presenting things.

I already wrote about Avengers Endgame a bit in yesterday&rsquo;s post, but that was a bit rushed and I had more thoughts, so here we are. I figured I might as well get everything out. There will be unmarked spoilers for Avengers Endgame and Agents of SHIELD.
Before even going into the movie that was seemingly sold out everywhere despite being on almost every cinema screen in the Metro, I was thinking to myself what a phenomenon.

- I watched Endgame exactly 365 days after watching Infinity War! (And also 3 years to the day after watching Civil War)- I approve of this movie as a fitting end to the last decade of Marvel films. This is a slam dunk ending. They could end it here, with no additional MCU movies/shows coming out and that would be completely fine- I approve of how little information about the movie managed to leak, I approve of the trailers and the marketing campaign: just enough to get hyped but nothing too spoilery- There is a lot to unpack, but its impossible to cover anything without getting into spoilers, but I&rsquo;m very happy with the movie and the fan service, especially as a comic book fan.

Last Monday, a magnitude 6.1 earthquake hit northern Luzon. The rocking was felt strongly in Metro Manila; I normally don&rsquo;t feel any earthquakes and only learn of them after the fact via friends or social media. But this time I was on a bed and I could feel it physically shaking, which was impressive given I was only on a second story. Imagine what it must have been like to be in a high-rise condo.

A friend messaged me a while back asking for advice as he was going to be a first time project manager. I don&rsquo;t identify as a project manager (even though I have done quite a bit of project management work), so I didn&rsquo;t really have much to say.

Since I&rsquo;m easily distracted, I often tumble down rabbit holes way too easily. You know the kind of rabbit holes I&rsquo;m talking about: you just want to lookup the name of that actor who appeared in that movie and suddenly you find yourself forty minutes into a Wikipedia dive with three different tabs open, none of them remotely related to what you were originally searching for. (Wikipedia could also be IMDB, Reddit, or TV Tropes).

My earliest memories of Holy Week are my grandmother telling us about how solemn the days off were supposed to be and that we kids were supposed to be quiet and not make so much noise and not be playing around so much. That, and the only thing being available on TV being The Ten Commandments starring Charlton Heston and Yul Brenner. In the early 2000s, what we often watched were the marathon episodes of Seventh Heaven shown on Studio 23 (the actor for the dad/pastor in that show later on confessed to being involved in a child molestation scandal, ironically.

<div class="content p-summary">
Rami Ismail of Vlambeer points out some of the problems with the mobile app ecosystem: platform SDKs update so often, so older mobile games often break, such that the reasonable option is to make freemium games that you update continuously rather than single purchase games that won&rsquo;t work a year later unless you burn capital on them:
 &ldquo;&hellip; I’m just a little wary of the smartphone market right now. I don’t currently feel at ease developing for those platforms because the SDKs change, their hardware specs change and when you don’t update the game just breaks.

No, not the TMNT villain or the kitchen utensil. Some years back I jokingly put &ldquo;a shredder&rdquo; on a Secret Santa wishlist, which I knew was way outside the roughly $10 range that locals usually set for Secret Santa gifts. I put a lot of other options on (usually food stuff like quezo de bola or Spam), so I wasn&rsquo;t expecting to actually get a shredder. But I did!
It might be a bit weird to have a shredder at home, but I find it useful (occasionally).

It&rsquo;s been nine years since Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty came out, and the last expansion Legacy of the Void came out four years ago in 2015. I bought all three releases as soon as they came out and recently found the boxes while spring cleaning.

Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
&ndash; Winston Churchill
 I already typed the above quote into the post, then realized I had already used it before. Whatever, just goes to show, I&rsquo;m no stranger to failure.
I was reminded of this quote because recently I prepared a demo for a project that didn&rsquo;t push through. At first I was annoyed at the wasted effort, but I realized that I had wisely taken the demo project as an opportunity to learn/sharpen some skills.

There are two kinds of tasks you get done:
 there are the tasks that you just want to get over with, the ones you only do because you basically have to do or face more dire consequences later. An example going to the dentist. (Nobody enjoys going to the dentist right?) You can&rsquo;t just put it off forever, so you just want to get it done as fast as possible.

I&rsquo;ve been diagnosed as hypertensive for fourteen years now, so I&rsquo;ve been taking these maintenance meds every morning. I&rsquo;m terrible at it, mostly due to forgetfulness, so I often miss some days. Just this morning, I was watching a Parks and Recreation 10th Anniversary Reunion panel after coming back upstairs from breakfast, and I saw the meds on my desk and I was like &ldquo;I should take my meds now. Wait, have I already taken my meds?

I found myself poring over the Wikipedia entry for the Ship of Theseus the other day. If you&rsquo;re not familiar, it&rsquo;s basically a thought experiment along the lines of &ldquo;if a given ship&rsquo;s parts are replaced at every port it visits, and eventually none of the parts are from the original ship, is it still the same ship?&rdquo; The thought experiment questions the meaning of identity of a whole composed of many individual parts, such as a ship, or even a human.

“It is necessary to be lost.
There is a simple logic to this. You cannot find yourself without first being lost. You cannot catch what you do not drop. You have to open your fist and let what you are clenching fall.&rdquo;

I usually log links to interesting articles that I read over on Pocket, which get fed into the links list on this blog, but that page only shows the most recent ones, so I thought I&rsquo;d highlight some in a post as well.
 Recent science news: scientists have managed to image the event horizon of a black hole! Here&rsquo;s a nice article about why that&rsquo;s a big deal and some interesting science stuff behind it.

Many of the manga series I used to follow from long ago have since ended, the only ones still running now are One Piece and Hajime no Ippo. So I thought I&rsquo;d follow some newer ones. Here are some short reviews:
The Promised Neverland
I picked up this one due to a strong recommendation from someone I follow on social media. The premise starts out with some super smart kids who grew up in an orphanage without any knowledge of an outside world.

I read a recent blog post from a friend about the large page sizes on initial load of a web page. From there, I got to a link which said that the average page size nowadays is at least 3MB.
This led me to check the performance of this very blog/site. Initial load of the home page clocks in with 13 requests weighing around 140KB total. This is not bad, in fact it would be a significant improvmenet since I migrated to a static site using Hugo.

I recently found out about the blog at geocities.institute where they dig through the Geocities archive torrent extracted by the internet archive and write about interesting things they find. That of course eventually led me to traipse through the internet archive&rsquo;s wayback machine again, especially looking back at some of my older websites.
I like having the ability to dig through time and find old content I&rsquo;ve written or created. (Which is only one of the reasons why I advocate backing up your social media content regularly).

Another repost from my Quora answers. Back in 2016 when I was on a work hiatus, I answered a lot of &ldquo;how to live&rdquo; questions on Quora, this is one of them.
 How can I find my interests in life?
 Look everywhere. Try everything.
Life is varied and has a wider scope than you could possibly imagine. Step outside your comfort zone. Visit new places. Sign up for strange classes.

<div class="content p-summary">
There is plenty of advice about how living a life of gratitude can lead to happiness. And that&rsquo;s fine, gratitude and thankfulness are good traits to have.
But in addition to gratitude, I would recommend wonder. That is, seek out wonder in your life. Put yourself into situations where there&rsquo;s a good chance of wonder, awe, or amazement. Seek out things that amaze you and make you go &ldquo;Woah!&rdquo;
You won&rsquo;t always succeed, but that&rsquo;s okay, the moments when you do will be worth it.

I worry about a lot of things. Recently with the planning for the US trip, the worry that comes to mind is financial: this trip is expensive, should I be cutting back? Can I afford this Airbnb? Can I afford going to Disneyland with my nieces? etc.
All this worrying is silly of course. I already know I can well afford the trip, but the fact that it&rsquo;s so expensive triggers the spendthrift in me to worry that I might be spending too much and I might be on a slippery slope to financial ruin.

If I could send one message back to my young teenage self it would be &ldquo;take care of your teeth.&rdquo; Okay, that&rsquo;s not true, the first two options would most probably be &ldquo;buy Apple stocks before 2007&rdquo; and &ldquo;get as much Bitcoin as you can before it&rsquo;s worth $10&rdquo;. But the teeth thing is really important, it&rsquo;s most probably up there somewhere in the top five.
I don&rsquo;t have a good record of taking care of my teeth.

via /u/haveanicedayreddit on reddit:
 The very fact that our nation&rsquo;s highest court is weighing in on the amount of cruelty we can inflict upon those we put to death suggests we&rsquo;ve taken a wrong turn. And yet the very subject invites some to ask why we should even care about the feelings of rapists or murderers.
Here&rsquo;s why we need to care. We need to care because our justice system demands it.

I liked this movie, it had good heart, fun kid-friendly humor, and a strong message about family basically the story of a kid with a messed up life being stupid and trying to be better john glover is here! does he now hold the record for portraying the most number of parents of bald supervillains? that’s not a spoiler right? this movie is kid-friendly, aside from the violence and the occasional swear word there is a mid credits scene and the post credits scene.

I&rsquo;ve written a bit about the need to reduce social media usage, so this month I&rsquo;m gonna give it a try and have decided to disconnect from Facebook and Twitter until the end of the month. Actually, the real motivation is to minimize the chances of accidentally reading spoilers for Game of Thrones and Avengers Endgame! But taking a trial run of a social media purge seems a good secondary reason too.
