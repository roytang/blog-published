I read a recent blog post from a friend about the large page sizes on initial load of a web page. From there, I got to a link which said that the average page size nowadays is at least 3MB.
This led me to check the performance of this very blog/site. Initial load of the home page clocks in with 13 requests weighing around 140KB total. This is not bad, in fact it would be a significant improvmenet since I migrated to a static site using Hugo.

I recently found out about the blog at geocities.institute where they dig through the Geocities archive torrent extracted by the internet archive and write about interesting things they find. That of course eventually led me to traipse through the internet archive&rsquo;s wayback machine again, especially looking back at some of my older websites.
I like having the ability to dig through time and find old content I&rsquo;ve written or created. (Which is only one of the reasons why I advocate backing up your social media content regularly).

Another repost from my Quora answers. Back in 2016 when I was on a work hiatus, I answered a lot of &ldquo;how to live&rdquo; questions on Quora, this is one of them.
 How can I find my interests in life?
 Look everywhere. Try everything.
Life is varied and has a wider scope than you could possibly imagine. Step outside your comfort zone. Visit new places. Sign up for strange classes.

<div class="content p-summary">
There is plenty of advice about how living a life of gratitude can lead to happiness. And that&rsquo;s fine, gratitude and thankfulness are good traits to have.
But in addition to gratitude, I would recommend wonder. That is, seek out wonder in your life. Put yourself into situations where there&rsquo;s a good chance of wonder, awe, or amazement. Seek out things that amaze you and make you go &ldquo;Woah!&rdquo;
You won&rsquo;t always succeed, but that&rsquo;s okay, the moments when you do will be worth it.

I worry about a lot of things. Recently with the planning for the US trip, the worry that comes to mind is financial: this trip is expensive, should I be cutting back? Can I afford this Airbnb? Can I afford going to Disneyland with my nieces? etc.
All this worrying is silly of course. I already know I can well afford the trip, but the fact that it&rsquo;s so expensive triggers the spendthrift in me to worry that I might be spending too much and I might be on a slippery slope to financial ruin.

If I could send one message back to my young teenage self it would be &ldquo;take care of your teeth.&rdquo; Okay, that&rsquo;s not true, the first two options would most probably be &ldquo;buy Apple stocks before 2007&rdquo; and &ldquo;get as much Bitcoin as you can before it&rsquo;s worth $10&rdquo;. But the teeth thing is really important, it&rsquo;s most probably up there somewhere in the top five.
I don&rsquo;t have a good record of taking care of my teeth.

via /u/haveanicedayreddit on reddit:
 The very fact that our nation&rsquo;s highest court is weighing in on the amount of cruelty we can inflict upon those we put to death suggests we&rsquo;ve taken a wrong turn. And yet the very subject invites some to ask why we should even care about the feelings of rapists or murderers.
Here&rsquo;s why we need to care. We need to care because our justice system demands it.

I liked this movie, it had good heart, fun kid-friendly humor, and a strong message about family basically the story of a kid with a messed up life being stupid and trying to be better john glover is here! does he now hold the record for portraying the most number of parents of bald supervillains? that’s not a spoiler right? this movie is kid-friendly, aside from the violence and the occasional swear word there is a mid credits scene and the post credits scene.

I&rsquo;ve written a bit about the need to reduce social media usage, so this month I&rsquo;m gonna give it a try and have decided to disconnect from Facebook and Twitter until the end of the month. Actually, the real motivation is to minimize the chances of accidentally reading spoilers for Game of Thrones and Avengers Endgame! But taking a trial run of a social media purge seems a good secondary reason too.

Daily news reading is a habit I inherited from my father, who tends to read the morning newspaper at the dining table during breakfast every morning and most other meals as well, even to this day. Some would say a bad habit, especially when among company. These days my morning newspaper consists mostly of Flipboard articles, then the local newspaper during lunch and dinner if I am at home.
Aside from mealtime readings, I also regularly take breaks to check what is going on in social media and my RSS reader.

The big one this month was Captain Marvel. I posted the usual spoiler-free review over on Tumblr, but I have some more spoiler-y thoughts over here:
(Spoilers)   While I thought the movie was ok, I was underwhelmed by the third act and specifically the lack of any serious threat for Carol to defeat towards the end of the movie. As this tumblr post explains more clearly than I ever could, perhaps the issue is that the narrative is not something targetted towards me as a man, who has not experienced the emotional gaslighting IRL that many women are exposed to.

I posted a quote yesterday about how if you&rsquo;re feeling like an outsider or you don&rsquo;t belong, you should take the take to try and &ldquo;find the others&rdquo; who are more similar to yourself. For every person, there likely exists a &ldquo;tribe&rdquo;, not necessarily all in one place, a community where that person would fit in. And in the modern age, the internet and social media make it all the more easier for such &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo; to connect with each other.

They&rsquo;re pulling the plug on it by end of this month. I got an email telling me to backup my content from there so I did, not that I had much. I don&rsquo;t think I wrote any original posts there, the export was mostly +1s and shares and such. Maybe I&rsquo;ll dig through it in detail in the future.
I wish I could say they tried their best with Google+, but they really didn&rsquo;t.

I wish I had a more concise way to describe it, but I really don&rsquo;t.
Some time ago this guy I follow on Twitter, visakanv wanted to know how to do a certain search: he wanted to know who a given famous person follows on Twitter, and among those, finds the one who follow him (visakanv), so he could network through them. I might not be explaining the concept too well, here&rsquo;s the thread.

The concept of a &ldquo;meritocracy&rdquo; has come to the fore again with the recent college admissions scandal in the US, where wealthy parents bribed coaches and other professionals to get their kids into high-end universities with supposedly high standards.

<div class="content p-summary">
Earlier this week, Google officially announced their much-rumored streaming game platform, Google Stadia.
Initial thoughts:
 If this works out, it will greatly lower the barrier for access to AAA games, since people won&rsquo;t have to buy desktops or consoles anymore, and you would be able to game on laptops without worrying about overheating. Sadly like many online services, it will probably be a while before it even becomes available over here in the PH (I believe even Sony&rsquo;s Playstation Now is not yet accessible here) One would presumably worry about how well it would work with the limited bandwidth available to third-world countries like ours, but I had this worry too when Netflix first became available here, and that worked out fine Speaking of Netflix, if Stadia manages to have a Netflix-like unlimited access service, that can only mean my gaming backlog is going to get a lot worse!

Scenario: Someone I know, let&rsquo;s call him/her Person A, appears to be supporting Party B, who in my opinion represents some of the worsts traits of Philippine politics (including but not limited to corruption, patronage, personality politics, etc). Now, I like to be optimistic about people and give them the benefit of the doubt, so in a bid to understand I tried to list down some possible motivations for Person A to do so.

With the PS Vita recently being discontinued by Sony, I decided to work on reducing my Vita backlog a bit. One of the games I&rsquo;d been meaning to play for a while now was Zero Time Dilemma, the third game in the Nonary Games trilogy. I&rsquo;ve only previously played the 2nd game in the series, Virtue&rsquo;s Last Reward, which is a bit appropriate given how the events in these games often unfold nonlinearly.

<div class="content p-summary">
Another repost from my Quora answers, this time some info for anyone looking to move into programming.
 How much of what we learn in school helps us in real life?
 The stuff school teaches you - literature, mathematics, art, history, science, and so on - are intended to give you a broad enough base from which you can freely choose the direction you want to go in life. This means that as you specialize, many of these subjects may become “irrelevant&rdquo; to you, but having this broad base of knowledge gives you a better foundation in life.

&ldquo;If the world were merely seductive, that would be easy. If it were merely challenging, that would be no problem. But I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.&rdquo; - E.B. White
 I am fortunate that with my flexible working schedule I get to choose whether to derp around or to be productive every day.

<div class="content p-summary">
If I could give some advice to someone starting out in their software development career, it would be this: Don&rsquo;t stay in the same place too long.

A few months back, my current web host WebFaction announced they had been purchased by GoDaddy, which was worrying. Back then they hadn&rsquo;t announced any details other than there would be some account migrations and single sign on, so it wasn&rsquo;t a big deal yet.
I initially joined WebFaction back in 2008 because they were a Python-friendly and developer-friendly host that had some reasonable budget options, allowing me some space to host this blog and any side projects I wanted to deploy.

I read this tweet from @GaryGulman, a standup comic who gives out tips for comedy writers:
 Today, put together a list of the most embarrassing moments in your life. Take one or two and write them out in detail. Next time you’re in front of a warm crowd, work on telling the story.
 The idea being of course, that such an exercise trains you to be more vulnerable in front on an audience.

I posted the other day about trying to get back into the habit of early morning walks. Unfortunately, I failed to continue that habit the very next day (hopefully I&rsquo;m able to succeed on upcoming days). The main reason I failed is that I was unable to sleep early on the preceeding night. My sleep cycle is horribly irregular, given my flexible working hours. I tend to be easily tempted to take naps at odd hours.

Another repost from my Quora answers, this time some info for anyone looking to move into programming.
 What are the pros and cons of making your career in programming?
 Pros:
 It is a very rewarding career financially. Software development often ranks in the top 10 highest-earning careers in most countries There is a lot of scope - you could be developing web applications, mobile applications, embedded applications, client-side, server-side, data analysis, artificial intelligence, games, etc It is very difficult to be bored.

I stepped out of the house a bit past five in the morning today. I haven&rsquo;t done this in a while, taking my daily walk in the early morning. I used to do it pretty regularly, except back then I confined myself to the inner roads of our subdivision, or doing loops around the covered court in the nearby seminary. Walking the same routes every morning and doing repetitive routes got boring after a while, and combined with my erratic sleep schedule the habit soon fell off the wayside.

I&rsquo;ve mentioned 750 Words before. It&rsquo;s a pretty neat service that allows you to write privately online. It&rsquo;s not public like blogging is, so if you&rsquo;d like to develop a daily writing habit but don&rsquo;t want things to be available to the world, it&rsquo;s a pretty good option. You can of course, just write on paper or on local files and just not upload anything to the cloud at all. But there&rsquo;s some benefits to an online service like this one too - the most obvious one is that you can write anywhere, with any internet connected device, but they also have a few other nifty features like tracking streaks (which can be great for building habits), and 750words even allows you to attach daily metadata to your posts (such as a number indicating your mood for the day or how many hours you slept) and it can later show you a chart of how that metadata changes over time.

Our instinct tells us to fear the unknowns, especially the ones that loom large in our imagination. The bigger the unknown, the more fear and uncertainty it generates, and in some cases it can lead us to paralysis and inability to move forward.
Most often, the only way to conquer these unknown obstacles is to face them head on. Study them, attack them, break them apart, until you understand what they are.

It&rsquo;s fun to think about what might have been, but often regret is tinged with optimism - the optimism that given another chance, we might have made different decisions and obtained better outcomes. But different doesn&rsquo;t always mean better, so such visualizations are often pointless speculation.

Sometimes you just come up short. You try to work your brain but it always comes up dry. It happens, even to the best of us. There&rsquo;s no shame in failure or in defeat. It&rsquo;s only human. We can&rsquo;t be at our best all the time, otherwise it&rsquo;s not our best. What&rsquo;s important is you pick yourself up and try again the next day. Tomorrow, we can do better.

movie was pretty good, no major issues doesnt follow the typical MCU origin story ‘formula’ some weird pacing issues in a few places, but that just might be because of the chosen story direction lots of little call-outs and tie-ins to the other MCU movies (although I feel like they could have done a bit more in some spots) I am not a cat person. But if you are a cat person, you might like this: there is a cat.

&ldquo;Whatever doesn&rsquo;t kill you, only makes you stronger.&rdquo;
 Nietzche   I liked this quote a lot when I was younger and more gung-ho, especially about things like work. In fact, I may have considered it as a bit of a defining quote back then. I guess the idea was &lsquo;ok, we&rsquo;ll rush in and try anything, at worst we learn a lesson and be better for next time&rsquo;.

The PS Vita has officially ended production.
Sadness for the little handheld that could. The PSP that came before it was a juggernaut, and so was the 3DS it went into battle with. Unfortunately Sony never gave the Vita proper support, and third parties didn&rsquo;t follow, so the handheld never lived up to its true potential.
I haven&rsquo;t had much opportunity for handheld gaming the past few years, since I don&rsquo;t travel as much anymore.

If you haven&rsquo;t figured it out yet, I watch a lot of TV shows, rarely on TV itself though. I outgrew scheduled television maybe more than a decade ago. I&rsquo;m reminded of this because I was going through some old disks and found burned episodes of stuff like Smallville, Heroes, The Simpsons, various anime, and so on.
Those were from the days before streaming though. These days an abundance of content is available online via the streaming services, no need to store all those episodes yourself.

Given my recent misgivings about Quora, I thought it might be a good idea to cross-post some of my answers from there into this blog, with some edits even. So here&rsquo;s the first one! (stuff in italics were added during the cross-post)
 How can you read and study a large software project source code?
 Attacking a large, existing codebase that you are unfamiliar with can be a daunting endeavor.

Sometime in the last week, I broke past four hundred thousand words total on this blog, as noted on the archive page.
Four hundred thousand words! That number sounds insane for some reason. Over 17 years of blogging, that&rsquo;s an average of 23,500+ words a year. I could have written like 17 short stories or 8ish novelettes or 3-4 decently sized novels.
This post is just me navel-gazing over that number.

As I&rsquo;m writing this, I&rsquo;ve been grinding Eternal&rsquo;s ranked ladder, trying to beat the end-of-month ladder reset and hoping to make Master rank again. Since this morning, I&rsquo;ve been moving up and down the threshold of the Diamond I, the rank just below Master, hence frustratingly there has been little progress, less than 24 hours before the ladder reset. I usually do manage to hit Master rank a bit earlier than this, but I&rsquo;ve been a bit busier this month for some reason, so my daily Eternal grinding had been reduced to the token one win per day.

The popular adage is that on your deathbed, you would not be regretting not having worked more. I think about this often, especially when there are people trying to convince me that I should do this work or that, because they have no one else to turn to or something or the work desperately needs to be done.
It seems that there&rsquo;s always work that desperately needs to be done, but if you look at it closely the consequences are rarely that life-altering.

Some things I&rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:
I watched Alita: Battle Angel, with the friend who introduced me to the series in the first place. The movie looked fantastic and the fight scenes were great. Plot was supercondensed, several books&rsquo; worth of story combined into one. Ended in a weird place, kinda? Easily the best western live action anime adaptation by far.
On 7 Feb 2019 2:06pm I wrote:  Watched Alita: Battle Angel earlier today.

<div class="content p-summary">
I have my share of sleeping problems, but it gets slightly worse when I&rsquo;m sleeping on a new, strange, unfamiliar bed. It always takes me some time to adjust to any new trappings, and I almost always expect on my first few nights at a new place that I won&rsquo;t get the correct amount of sleep or be awake at the proper times.
I wonder if there is some primordial instinct that causes us to be wary of unfamiliar sleeping arrangements, granting (against our will) heightened awareness in case of predators.

The EDSA revolution was a promise. &ldquo;Never again.&rdquo; They cried. But the scope was never clear. Never again to a dictator? Okay, but if not that, then what? What of corruption, of patronage, of poverty, of oligarchy, of ignorance? We thought the job finished and patted ourselves on the back and assumed everything would go back to normal, without regard to what &ldquo;normal&rdquo; needed to be. The same evils took different guises, and today the forces of darkness and dictatorship are almost close to fulfilling their return.

“Of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these, &lsquo;It might have been.&rdquo;
― John Greenleaf Whittier, Maud Muller - Pamphlet
 It is human nature perhaps, to think about those alternate realities that might have come from different decisions or different dispositions.
If only I was braver.
If only I was more decisive.
If only I didn&rsquo;t have something holding me back.
If only I knew what I knew now.

“None of us are getting out of here alive, so please stop treating yourself like an after-thought. Eat the delicious food. Walk in the sunshine. Jump in the ocean.
