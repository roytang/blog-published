&hellip; especially for strongly-typed languages.
In one of the bigger Java projects that I took over, I was often annoyed to find some devs had written method signatures like

Overhead scale up rapidly as project team size increases. Every time you add a new person to the team, he comes with a lot of overhead such as the need to learn the project details, responsibilities of other team members, who to consult when there&rsquo;s trouble, custom project procedures, and so on
It&rsquo;s a reinforcing cycle too. As overhead increases, the team imposes more processes and restrictions to make sure everyone is doing the right thing and there are no screw-ups.

Asians, and maybe Filipinos more specifically, have this cultural bias towards trying to avoid conflict. So often there will be people who don&rsquo;t like to speak up when they think something is wrong, either just tolerating it or hoping someone else will take it up. A software dev in another company once told me that he felt like he was complaining so much that he was looking like a bad guy

Overtime in software development projects seems to be a given. Sure, there are projects and companies that don&rsquo;t need it, but those feel like the exception rather than the norm
Overtime in software development is a natural consequence of schedule pressure and the fact that estimation is hard, which is why it&rsquo;s understandably common, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we shouldn&rsquo;t try to avoid it
More than once I&rsquo;ve been in a situation where the team stays overnight to try to get a build or release ready for the next day only to run out of time and have to delay the deployment anyway.

Almost six years ago, I had to undergo minor surgery and had to endure the pain of being administered spinal anesthesia. I was reminded of this recently because a loved one with an even lower pain tolerance than I did recently had to undergo a similar procedure
I have a pretty low tolerance for pain myself. I tried to spin it a bit positively in the blog post linked above, but there&rsquo;s no question many times during the procedure I felt miserable and in lots of pain.

A while back, news came out that an AI was able to perform a diagnosis after the human doctors were stumped. Having just finished binge-watching the entire run of Star Trek Voyager, I immediately thought that was the sort of AI advancement that could lead to such things as Voyager&rsquo;s Emergency Medical Hologram, an AI which could replace a human doctor. Of course, it is still very unlikely for this to happen anytime soon, medicine is a very complex field and new things are still being discovered all the time.

I remember having a discussion with a friend a few years back where I made the following list to emphasize a point:
 8-9 hours at work (possibly more) 7-8 hours of sleep 3-4 hours commuting in Metro Manila 2 hours for meals  That leaves you between 1-4 hours for all forms of recreation including exercise, sports, TV, derping around on the internet, hanging out with friends, and so on.

Without a doubt, the number one problem in software development projects is **schedule pressure, **that is, the pressure to meet unreasonable deadlines and targets
Almost all other problems can be overcome if there were no schedule pressure:
 weaker developers could be mentored to become better, more productive, and commit less faults less faults overall will be committed anyway if there were no schedule pressure poor requirements could be threshed out in more detail difficult clients can be argued, worn-down, and eventually reasoned with problematic team members can be counseled, or replaced with new blood and so on  But of course, the reality is that we live in a world with deadlines and targets, many of them set by people who have no idea about the complexities of software development.

Some days you are tired
Maybe you are tired of all the work
You can&rsquo;t keep up with, it all piles up
Of all the meetings and reports
That come relentlessly without end
Some days you are tired
Maybe you are tired of all the time
That you never have enough of
Of all the deadlines and targets
That you never meet but should&rsquo;ve
Some days you are tired
Maybe you are tired of the world

Estimation is hard. Estimation has long been the bane of many software developers and software development projects. But there are two secret ways to be able to produce perfect estimates for software development work all the time! One is dependent on talent, and the other is dependent on technology
 Psychic precognition, i.e. be able to predict the future Have a time machine, so you can go back in time and tell yourself how long the work would have taken  Such precognition is necessary to have perfect estimates because of all the unknowns present at the start of a software project.

When you&rsquo;re young and in school memorizing math formulas or history dates or whatnot, all of it seems so silly and you wonder if you&rsquo;re really going to be using all of this knowledge in real life. However, the intent of a general education program isn&rsquo;t specifically to give you knowledge that will be useful to you in the future (although it may turn out to be so)
The stuff school teaches you &ndash; literature, mathematics, art, history, science, and so on &ndash; are intended to give you a broad enough base from which you can freely choose the direction you want to go in life.

If you follow me on Facebook or Twitter, you&rsquo;ll know I have a tendency to be pretty vocal about any problems I have with our country&rsquo;s erstwhile leadership. But for the most part I&rsquo;ve restricted it to those channels and have tried to avoid posting about current events in the country on this blog (outside of my personal choices for the election), but I feel that now more than ever those of us who can speak out have a responsibility to do so whenever we can, for several reasons

Hyperion by Dan Simmons My rating: 4 of 5 stars
I randomly decided to start reading a new book the other day and picked up Hyperion completely blind. I knew it was sci-fi, but that was about it
And it turned out to be some really good sci-fi too. Simmons introduces new concepts and the history of his universe and human society quickly and unapologetically. Even the prologue bandies around the terms Hegemony and Ouster with little explanation save what we can glean from context.

I like to say that software development is a challenging career because no two projects are ever the same and there are always new challenges to face and new concepts to learn, but the truth of the matter is a bit more complex.
Writing software is about breaking down large problems into a series of very small technical problems for which we already have solutions. Examples of small enough technical problems include list sorting, comparison, arithmetic operations, path traversal, string concatenation, returning a string as an HTTP response, rendering text to the screen, retrieving submitted parameters from an HTTP request, and so on.

No, not that kind of history, don&rsquo;t worry.
Twenty-five years ago this month, the first website went up on the world wide web. That was 1991. It took a few years for the Philippines to catch on, the first internet connection in the country was only set up in 1994.
My personal experience with the internet came a bit later, during our freshman year in University, sometime in the schoolyear 1995-1996.

So, Stranger Things
It&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;s great. I thought it might be overhyped, but it&rsquo;s not. And I can see why people find it hard to explain without spoiling things.
It&rsquo;s about strange things happening in a small town. Creepy things. It&rsquo;s a mystery. It&rsquo;s suspense. It&rsquo;s not a jump-scare sort of thing if you&rsquo;re not into that. Well, there&rsquo;s maybe a little bit of jump scares. The best description I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s about as scary as an X-Files or Doctor Who episode.

<div class="content p-summary">
I was originally going to write a post about the problems development teams face as they get larger, but the section on development standards was long enough by itself so here we are.
Having some sort of development standard in a project development team becomes a lot more important as project size goes up (for obvious reasons). There are different kinds of standards to consider, but generally I break them down into design standards and coding standards.

Equal Rites by Terry Pratchett My rating: 4 of 5 stars
I bought a used copy of this book a while back and finally decided to read it, it wasn&rsquo;t particularly long. I&rsquo;d found however, that I&rsquo;d already read it before lol. Anyway, I still managed to read through it a second time, it was pretty good. I like the Discworld books, they&rsquo;re ridiculous, popcorn fantasy reads, and this one was no exception.

<div class="content p-summary">
Thirty eight lessons I&rsquo;ve learned through the years, in no particular order:
 Do not be beguiled by pretty things; not all that glitters is gold Remain true to yourself in the face of adversity You can&rsquo;t help people who aren&rsquo;t willing to change People will believe what they want to believe You don&rsquo;t have to do what everybody else does Happiness often comes from small things Be thankful for what you have and appreciate the people who are there for you Other people think about you a lot less than you think Time you enjoy wasting isn&rsquo;t wasted time Spend some time alone with your thoughts regularly; solitude has its benefits In most situations, a balanced approach will serve you well.

The Trading Code by Jason Cam My rating: 4 of 5 stars
Pretty informative and helpful stuff for beginners to stock trading, although I reckon it will still take time and experience to get the hang of stock trading. I was interested in the math so I&rsquo;m happy that the book discussed the formulas for most of the indicators used (with the exception of the ADX)  View all my reviews

Motivation is a fickle mistress. It comes and it goes. It&rsquo;s easily distracted. It can vanish in a blink of an eye. When it&rsquo;s there, it&rsquo;s great, but when it&rsquo;s not you don&rsquo;t get anything done and you don&rsquo;t feel terrible. Motivation is based on the principle that you need a certain emotion or state of mind to get things done. Motivation is burst damage, you can get a lot done but you don&rsquo;t know when it&rsquo;s gonna come out.

Evaluation of programmer performance is notoriously hard. You want to be accurate and at the same time fair such that all programmers on your staff are evaluated in the same matter. However, there are no good, objective, universally accepted standard metrics.
It follows from the fact that there are no good, objective, universally accepted standard metrics for program size. Typically each programmer in a team will not be doing the same task or even the same type of task, so in order to produce fair evaluations you will need some standard metric of program size to normalize any evaluation.

When blogging and social media started to explode in popularity, it held a great promise: it would give a voice to the masses. Where previously there were gatekeepers in traditional media channels who controlled whose opinions could be published or broadcast, the internet meant that anyone with an internet connection could publish and voice out their thoughts and people would be all smart and there would be lots of intelligent discussion and it would be great.

****Since I wasn’t a graduate of computer science, there were many concepts of software development I really only got exposed to when I started working. One of those was the concept of a relational database, and hence SQL. The company I worked at gave all new hires a training regimen that started with about a week of SQL. Despite not knowing anything about it beforehand, I took to it like a mouse takes to cheese.

I found this draft blog post that I had written back in 2010. I&rsquo;m not sure why I never published it, though it does end on a dire note and seems a bit incomplete. Perhaps I had some further thoughts percolating in my brain back then that never came forward. I am also not sure if I wrote this before reading about The Great Filter. I figured I&rsquo;d just publish it now without further comment:

<div class="content p-summary">
I never really put much stock in certifications. I felt that they were no guarantee of knowledge or expertise, and that many people who did have knowledge or expertise wouldn’t necessarily have a certification to say so. Add to that it often seem overpriced to even apply for the certifications, so I didn’t have a high opinion of them. That being said, I have had the opportunity to take professional certification exams twice in my life (both luckily paid for by my employer at that time).

<div class="content p-summary">
During my the first semester of my second year in University, I failed four out of five classes I was taking due to slacking off a lot. Those same classes were only available during the first semester of each year, which meant I could not retake them during the second semester or over the summer to catch up. So effectively, I had fallen one year behind everyone I knew.
When I got the news, it was devastating.

A friend of mine had an informal consultation with me the other day (read: asked me questions over FB messenger) about what their IT staff was telling them about a file upload vulnerability that had been recently exploited in one of their applications. Obviously it was difficult for me to judge given that I didn&rsquo;t know all the details, but for me it was most likely a vulnerability introduced in the application code itself.

During my adult life, I&rsquo;ve tried to learn or at least expose myself to one new skill or programming language every year. For example, over the past year or so I&rsquo;ve been studying, dabbling, or trying out the following: game development using Unity, technical analysis of stocks, Spanish, driving a car, and even some simple cooking! I&rsquo;ve also been regularly practicing to improve my skills in writing and sketching. I probably even forgot a few things I&rsquo;ve tried to learn.

Some time ago, one of my many intrepid followers pointed out that this blog tested poorly on web page performance according to this Speed Testing Tool. Now, I&rsquo;m of the opinion that for a personal blog such as this, web performance isn&rsquo;t really a mission-critical sort of thing, but as a software developer who has often had to work hard to optimize the web applications we delivered to our clients, it kind of became a matter of pride :p

Fragile Things: Short Fictions and Wonders by Neil Gaiman My rating: 5 of 5 stars
Some good stuff by Gaiman. Generally what you&rsquo;d expect: ghosts and aliens and magic creatures and strange stories and such. There&rsquo;s an American Gods-related novella at the end.  View all my reviews

I read an article recently about how we should encourage entrepreneurial spirit in kids from a very young age. It made think of a time when we were kids and we tried running a business
It was a summer from years ago. Perhaps 1988 or 1989, or maybe a year or two earlier, I can&rsquo;t be sure. I was young, my brother was younger by a few years, my female cousin older by a few years.

I had my first taste with working with software testers during my first project where I was involved with porting an old system to a new version of the software. My first task involved porting reports which were to be generated by the users then printed out. The task wasn’t too difficult: basically you took the source code of the report (it was some weird binary format recognized only by the particular reporting tool &ndash; that was how it was done back in the day) and open it using the newer version of the tool, and the tool did some sort of migration magic to adapt it to the new format, then you just save it back again.

Grammar note: &ldquo;Biased&rdquo; is an adjective. &ldquo;Bias&rdquo; is a noun. It is not appropriate to say that a person or an entity &ldquo;is bias&rdquo;. Unless you are talking to like a prejudice elemental or something (takes note of that for hypothetical hipster RPG)
In a (long-winded) discussion during the recent election period, someone told me that I &ldquo;obviously had a bias&rdquo; and my answer was &ldquo;Of course I do! Everyone does!

More stories from the early days. Evaluating someone&rsquo;s programming ability is hard, especially someone fresh out of college. A student&rsquo;s grades is in no way indicative of how well he can program after all. So most nontrivial programming jobs have some sort of complicated application process involved.

&ldquo;Do you know what&rsquo;s there, waiting beyond that beach? Immortality! Take it! It&rsquo;s yours!&rdquo; &ndash; Achilles, Troy
 Each person has a different view of what their life&rsquo;s purpose is, but I&rsquo;ve found more often than not it relates to some form of immortality. Usually that means leaving something behind, some trace of yourself so that the world remembers you, something that says &ldquo;I was here, I existed.&rdquo; For many people that means offspring, for others it may mean some other legacy: children taught, people helped, ideas expounded, inventions created, companies founded, and so on

I once had to advise someone who found himself irritated at receiving lots of comments during code review. I think my response was good enough to quote verbatim:
 Remember: You are not your code. You are not the hundred or so lines of C or Java or JavaScript or whatever that you wrote today. This problem arises because you are too attached to your code. Your ego is associated with the code you write and you feel that any comments or defects found reflect upon you as a person.

31 May 2016 7:49amClose   I am of course a long-time Magic the Gathering player. Over the past year or so I&rsquo;ve also been playing Blizzard&rsquo;s digital CCG Hearthstone (limiting myself to free to play since who has money to spend on two CCGs?) and I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the design parallels and differences between the two.

A while back I answered a question over on Quora about how I got started down the path of programming. It&rsquo;s not a particularly interesting story, but I still thought I&rsquo;d record it here for posterity.
Sometime when I was much younger, maybe somewhere between twelve to fourteen years old, I remember having some sort of QBasic programming learning book at home. I forget how we got it, I think my uncle brought it home for me sometime for some reason.

The Making of Karateka by Jordan Mechner My rating: 4 of 5 stars
The book is literally a collection of journal entries detailing young Jordan Mechner&rsquo;s days as a university student at Yale at the same time working on what would be his first published game. I found it both inspiring (though some might consider me the wrong age to be inspired by it) and amusing as a look into the life of a young man in the early 80s.

Relevant XKCD:

Sometimes I have this inexplicable urge to argue with people. With recent events I&rsquo;ve found myself getting into more discussions, debates and otherwise friendly arguments online. The quality of these interactions hasn&rsquo;t always been the best, and many times I feel like I should have stopped engaging sooner or maybe not participated at all. I&rsquo;ve considered some points to help me decide in the future whether to bother engaging other people online.

Mindfire: Big Ideas for Curious Minds by Scott Berkun My rating: 4 of 5 stars
I&rsquo;ve been following and reading Scott Berkun&rsquo;s blog on and off for the past 5 years or so, so I already have a passing familiarity with this work. Mindfire collects some of the best essays from his blog into an easy-to-read format that you can digest in one-to-two sittings. Berkun writes about a number of diverse topics such as how to think critically and how to interact with other people and how to spend your attention.

"Everyone knows the third movie is always the worst" -- Jean      still too much focus on Jennifer Lawrence/Mystique some great soundtrack choices Quicksilver scene maybe just a tiny bit too long. Tradition of defying the rules of physics continues (I hope someone does the math on how fast he was probably moving) nice 80s wardrobe lol not particularly faithful to the source material plot is all over the place, a lot of WTF moments here and there.
