The popular adage is that on your deathbed, you would not be regretting not having worked more. I think about this often, especially when there are people trying to convince me that I should do this work or that, because they have no one else to turn to or something or the work desperately needs to be done.
It seems that there&rsquo;s always work that desperately needs to be done, but if you look at it closely the consequences are rarely that life-altering.

Some things I&rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:
I watched Alita: Battle Angel, with the friend who introduced me to the series in the first place. The movie looked fantastic and the fight scenes were great. Plot was supercondensed, several books&rsquo; worth of story combined into one. Ended in a weird place, kinda? Easily the best western live action anime adaptation by far.
On 7 Feb 2019 2:06pm I wrote:  Watched Alita: Battle Angel earlier today.

<div class="content p-summary">
I have my share of sleeping problems, but it gets slightly worse when I&rsquo;m sleeping on a new, strange, unfamiliar bed. It always takes me some time to adjust to any new trappings, and I almost always expect on my first few nights at a new place that I won&rsquo;t get the correct amount of sleep or be awake at the proper times.
I wonder if there is some primordial instinct that causes us to be wary of unfamiliar sleeping arrangements, granting (against our will) heightened awareness in case of predators.

The EDSA revolution was a promise. &ldquo;Never again.&rdquo; They cried. But the scope was never clear. Never again to a dictator? Okay, but if not that, then what? What of corruption, of patronage, of poverty, of oligarchy, of ignorance? We thought the job finished and patted ourselves on the back and assumed everything would go back to normal, without regard to what &ldquo;normal&rdquo; needed to be. The same evils took different guises, and today the forces of darkness and dictatorship are almost close to fulfilling their return.

― John Greenleaf Whittier, Maud Muller - Pamphlet
 It is human nature perhaps, to think about those alternate realities that might have come from different decisions or different dispositions.
If only I was braver.
If only I was more decisive.
If only I didn&rsquo;t have something holding me back.
If only I knew what I knew now.

For my first few years in elementary school, I didn&rsquo;t get any pocket money. Instead I&rsquo;d have a couple of sandwiches and a thermos of water. So I wasn&rsquo;t used to handling money. One time while waiting for the school bus, I was a bit thirsty but my thermos was already out. For some reason, I decided to borrow five pesos from a classmate to buy a coke from the canteen.

It is said an Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a sentence, to be ever in view, and which should be true and appropriate in all times and situations. They presented him the words: And this, too, shall pass away. How much it expresses! How chastening in the hour of pride!how consoling in the depth of affliction!
 Abraham Lincoln   More quotes! I like ones that have a level of ambiguity, a meaning that changes depending on situation.

I had some free time the other day so I randomly decided to post in the PH subreddit&rsquo;s regular afternoon random discussion thread, asking for questions about software development. I ended up typing some longish answers, I thought I&rsquo;d copy them over to the blog in case anyone was interested. TBH I meant more like StackOverflow type questions with specific technical problems, but I ended up answering mostly career-related questions, which is fine, but disclaimer: I don&rsquo;t claim to be an expert, these are just my opinions on things.

There&rsquo;s a significant risk of information overload nowadays. For someone like me who spends a lot of time on the internet, there&rsquo;s a lot of feeds I follow. Not just social media like Facebook and Twitter, I also follow a set of RSS Feeds via Inoreader, I&rsquo;ve signed up for a few newsletters, and on weekends I read through several Flipboard categories. Just another symptom of my tendency to want everything I guess.

18 Feb 2019 5:56amClose   The quote is from the 1980s cult classic Bill and Ted&rsquo;s Excellent Adventure. I didn&rsquo;t include this movie in my top 10 movies post, but it and the sequel Bill and Ted&rsquo;s Bogus Journey are still among my childhood faves. These wise words are give by the Wyld Stallyns band composed of the epnoymous Bill and Ted, and form the philosophical basis of the future utopian civilization inspired by their music.

<div class="content p-summary">
Back in 2017 during a Steam Sale, I was trying to choose a Metroidvania to play. My choices came down to either Ori and the Blind Forest or Hollow Knight. My impression that was that Ori had the more challenging platforming, while Hollow Knight had the more challenging combat. I chose Ori at that time, and I enjoyed that game. Last October, Hollow Knight was in a Humble Monthly, and I decided to go for it.

<div class="content p-summary">
According to Wikipedia, Speaking truth to power is a non-violent political tactic, employed by dissidents against the received wisdom or propaganda of governments they regard as oppressive, authoritarian or an ideocracy. I always had the general sense of it before, but not that it was specifically for use against oppressive or authoritarian governments. It is believed the phrase has origins in a Quaker pamphlet published in 1955.
I was reminded of this phrase today and looked it up because it seems relevant again recently, at least in the Philippines.

Last October I participated in #Hacktoberfest, sponsored by DigitalOcean and Github. It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;celebration&rdquo; to promote open source activity, and basically you just need to submit 5 pull requests to any github repository, and they give away swag to anyone who completes the activity. Microsoft held a [counterpart celebration] where they only require you to submit 1 pull request to any Microsoft repository.
I&rsquo;ve always wanted to start participating in Open Source, but it&rsquo;s a bit difficult to find a good place to contribute (other than logging issues of course).

In late 2017, the US moved to ban Kaspersky antivirus from use by federal agencies, because of suspected influence from the Russian government.
In late 2018, the US and other countries have either banned or are considering banning the Chinese tech giant Huawei and its telecoms products, for security reasons.
Both companies are under scrutiny for their perceived ties to their governments, both of which happen to have authoritarian leanings. From a certain POV, the bannings may be unfair, as they are &ldquo;preventive&rdquo; in nature, i.

Interesting article on closed captioning, or as I like to call them, subtitles. My first exposure to subtitles was anime of course, but these days I vastly prefer having subtitles on any show, even if it&rsquo;s dubbed in a language I do understand. From the article:

“It helps me with my ADHD: I can focus on the words, I catch things I missed, and I never have to go back,&rdquo; she replied.

I love sleeping. And taking naps. But I&rsquo;m not very good at doing it at night. Insomnia is a common problem for me. I often find it difficult to go to sleep at night, taking upwards of 1-2 hours in bed before I can manage to fall asleep. Of course all that time lying there feels unproductive, so I&rsquo;ll often be tempted to to grab a nearby screen and read something online or such, which makes it even harder to get to sleep.

Just a fun little throwback: some years back me and some friends played an app called Draw Something for a while, where you draw stuff and send the drawings to your friends and they try to guess it. I had some screenshots stored in a Facebook post for a while and it showed up in the &ldquo;Memories&rdquo; thing, I thought I&rsquo;d post them here on the blog too. We had a lot of fun with the app back then!

I thought I had a post scheduled yesterday, but I didn&rsquo;t. That broke a continuous streak of 124 days of daily blogging. I thought about writing a post and publishing it retroactively, but that seems like the kind of BS Type A behavior I kind of want to avoid these days. At least I did a lot better than the last time I tried daily blogging in October 2006, when I only managed 23 posts for the month.

I&rsquo;m not much for public performance. But sometimes I think about doing some stuff that involves some level of public performance. My examples for this post are:
 game streaming public speaking standup comedy  Public speaking and standup comedy are basically the same, and might be interesting to do (standup seems more fun). Like many people, I used to have a mild fear of speaking in front of a bunch of people/strangers, but as I&rsquo;ve gotten older and cared less about what other people think, this kind of faded away.

I used to be super easy to goad into a debate. It&rsquo;s a clear weakness to my projected DGAF attitude actually. Well, the main thing is that I enjoy lively discussion, even though it can often lead into chaos.
I soured a bit on online debate during the 2016 election season though. Too many people I knew getting butthurt or reacting poorly. Someone I knew since high school unfriended me over some imagined slight even.

Today is Chinese New Year. It&rsquo;s something my family celebrates.
I am of course, ethnically Chinese, but I don&rsquo;t talk about it much. When asked, I will often reply that I identify as a Filipino, not as Chinese (maybe slightly more relevant these days given our disagreement with our largely populated neighboring country). I don&rsquo;t reject the heritage or anything - but I&rsquo;m not particularly steeped in it either.
I don&rsquo;t speak the language (beyond a few token phrases).

I saw the following question on Twitter:
 &ldquo;People who write a lot of blogposts&hellip; How do you know when a post is done?&rdquo;
 Having written daily posts since October, I feel like I already qualify for &ldquo;People who write a lot of blogposts&rdquo;, but I realized I don&rsquo;t have a straight answer aside from &ldquo;When I run out of things to say&rdquo;.
I do worry sometimes that my posts don&rsquo;t often reach a logical conclusion.

I picked up Slay the Spire during the last (Winter) Steam Sale, not really knowing what I was getting into. I had heard some good things, but I didn&rsquo;t really know much other than it was a roguelite where I had to go through a dungeon. But it was cheap so I took the dive.
I was pleasantly surprised to find that not only was it a roguelite, it was also a deckbuilding game!

Sometimes I stop and think and I&rsquo;m amazed at how much trust we place in our fellow human beings, many of them strangers, enough so that society is able to function. Some examples of what I mean:
 My mom pays for thousands of pesos worth of groceries and doesn&rsquo;t bother going through the receipt to make sure the cashier punched in the right items We order food in restaurants that is cooked and prepared outside of our view and trust that they are prepared appropriately and with proper regard for health standards I take naps in a taxi cab assuming the driver won&rsquo;t take me to a secluded location and try to rob me We cross the street trusting that drivers are sensible people who won&rsquo;t blow past traffic lights and suddenly careen towards us We go to work and trust that our coworkers will do their thing and our work will get done and the company is going to pay us We order stuff online and assume that the order will be fulfilled  All of this, in spite of the fact that we know there are humans who exist who are incompetent, unreliable, or even downright malicious or sociopathic.

Some Youtube channels I&rsquo;ve been enjoying recently:
ComicTropes is a weekly show that does deep dives into various mainstream comics titles, and often includes the background history of characters and creators, so very interesting stuff for comic book nerds.
GameMaker&rsquo;s ToolKit talks about video game level design topics. His series &ldquo;Boss Keys&rdquo; does a deep dive into Zelda dungeons and analyzes them based on criteria like linearity. His level design analyses are strongly based on systems and gameplay and how they affect the player experience.

Between the ages of 10-12, my reading diet consisted almost exclusively of the teenage-targetted detective series The Hardy Boys. For me, the term invokes the names Frank and Joe before the Matt and Jeff of WWE fame. We had a fairly wide collection of the blue-hardcovered books of those days. And I believe I made the effort to read every single book in that particular series, through borrowing and such. I think I was successful, but I can&rsquo;t be sure.

When a friend recently posted a screenshot from his discord to one of our group chats, most of us jokingly chastised him for having the default light-colored theme, asking if it didn&rsquo;t blind him when opening up the app at night.

Some things I&rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:
Bumblebee only came out over here in January (thanks to the usual MMFF shenanigans), and I decided to watch it on a whim. Pretty decent soft reboot, read my spoiler-free review over on the Tumblr
The first half of Young Justice Outsiders is out, and it&rsquo;s pretty good. Focus is back on a smaller group after the larger team in YJ season 2.

I always wish I had kept screenshots of what my blog looked like back during each of the myriad theme changes I&rsquo;ve done over the years, as a kind of timeline of how my website aesthetic has evolved (or gotten worse, whatever). I recently found the stylesheets and such for my old django-powered blog from circa 2008-2009, and recently there&rsquo;s been this &ldquo;10-year challenge&rdquo; meme where people show how they&rsquo;ve changed over the past 10 years.

 Quote 2:
 &ldquo;If you expect the world to be fair with you because you&rsquo;re fair to them, its like asking a lion not to eat you because you don&rsquo;t eat lions.&rdquo;
(Unknown source)
 We accept that the natural order of the world is inherently unfair.

25 Jan 2019 5:56amClose   and I can&rsquo;t help but feel like it&rsquo;s at least a little bit applicable to me. And I start to wonder whether maybe I&rsquo;m suffering depression? Or maybe just a little depressed?
The question only lasts in my head for a moment. Despite my sometimes bleak outlook for humanity, I still consider myself a largely optimistic person and I understand life is generally good for me at least (at the moment).

The first trailer for Spider-Man Far From Home dropped last week. I used to pretty hyped for superhero movie trailers, but I haven&rsquo;t bother watching this one yet. MCU still has two more movies coming out before this one, and I&rsquo;m already hyped enough for those, I don&rsquo;t think I have hype to spare for a third one.
My brother was complaining to me about the trailer, saying he was spoiled about some elements.

<div class="content p-summary">
In a recent episode of The Orville, captain Ed Mercer of the Union is stuck debating with a member of the Krill, a fanatic and xenophobic race in conflict with Earth&rsquo;s multi-species Planetary Union. He says:
 &ldquo;Look, from what we&rsquo;ve seen, when planets first achieve space travel and they venture out into the galaxy and discover that they&rsquo;re just one single species among a vast diversity of lifeforms, they usually react in one of two ways: they embrace and adapt to the fact that they&rsquo;re no longer the center of the universe, or they ratchet up their xenophobia.

One of my pet peeves is people coming up to me cold/unsolicited and trying to sell me things:
On 16 Jan 2019 6:49am I wrote:  People who try to grab your attention or hand you fliers in a mall are the popup ads of real life
 Like my tweet above says, it&rsquo;s like advertising spam in real life. I&rsquo;m sure it bothers other people too, but it annoys me a bit disproportionately.

I pass by the Quezon City Hall every so often, and I&rsquo;ve always been curious about the QC public library they have there. It got a bit of press a while back about how it was a nice place to hang out (for a government institution at least), so I had a todo list item about checking it out.
Well, last week I did! I passed by on a weekday afternoon about 4pm after running some errands.

 When watching TV/movies, I was always fascinated by those scenes where people are in the park playing chess and I wanted to play chess in the park with strangers too.

A friend was worried and jittery about an event he&rsquo;d been preparing for a while now. He just wanted it to be over and things to not go wrong. I told him not to worry, that he&rsquo;s already done the best preparation he could and that no matter what things will surely work out.
It&rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of anxiety, overthinking things that might go wrong, or things that might not go according to plan, and so on.

I was at the mall last week and I decided to watch the new Bumblebee movie (it came out late over here because reasons). Here&rsquo;s my spoiler-free review.
As the link says, I&rsquo;ve been a big fan of Transformers since I was a kid, so I thought I&rsquo;d talk about that for a bit. The 1980s cartoon obviously, though I think only the first two seasons of that aired on local TV.

Last week while helping another developer debug a problem, I had to Google how to check if an element exists in a Javascript array, something superbasic, that one would expect most newbies to know. I&rsquo;m sure I Google some superbasic thing at least once a week. It&rsquo;s not embarassing or anything, it&rsquo;s a common occurrence. I&rsquo;m surely not alone.

I don&rsquo;t know much about this Konmari thing. I think it&rsquo;s been around for a while, but got a boost recently due to a Netflix special. I think I agree with it in principle, or at least what I know of it from secondary social media commentary.

Someone responded to my post on things to learn in 2019 by asking how one finds the inspiration to learn all of the things. Well, my first answer was that those are just things I find interesting and may look into, but that&rsquo;s not really an answer for the inspiration part.
Software development is a very wide field, one where the amount of things you can learn increases daily, so it&rsquo;s almost impossible to keep up with everything.

I had been eyeing Lucas Pope&rsquo;s acclaimed indie hit Papers Please on Steam for a while, but finally bit the bullet on it during the last sale. The story of the game itself is interesting, as Pope was more or less a one-man team, doing the design, code, music and art for the game himself.
If you&rsquo;re not familiar, the game places you in the role of a border inspector in a fictional 1980s totalitarian state called Arstotzka, a thinly-veiled parallel to communist East Germany and similar nations.

A while back we were tasked with helping a client&rsquo;s internal dev team to migrate their repositories from Subversion to Git. The distributed VCS seemed ideal for their situation - they had a very small in-house dev team managing contributions from external subcontractors. The main rationale was that their process of merging contributions from the external developers was extremely complicated and often resulted in conflicts that were challenging to merge. Before this, I hadn&rsquo;t actually used Git too deeply myself (aside from cloning stuff from Github), and especially not in a team setting, so the training one of our other engineers gave them was a good opportunity for me to become familiar with Git as well.

Sipunin, from the root word &ldquo;sipon&rdquo;, referring to the common cold. It refers to someone who is susceptible to and often has the common cold.
Certainly applicable to me. For as long as I can remember I&rsquo;ve always had the cold all the time, especially during the earlier and later months of the year. (I&rsquo;m sure selective memory lets me forget all those days that my nose was actually not clogged&hellip;)

I think that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why it&rsquo;s difficult to keep up a blog. Blogs feel a bit like they have to be long-form, highly profound, useful or informative pieces or prose that a wide audience can appreciate. We don&rsquo;t have this same pressure when posting to other social media like Twitter or Facebook.
I like to think of a blog (or this blog at least, at this moment) as a living, evolving thing, with each post capturing a single moment in a timeline, building upon previous thoughts, helping us see how the author&rsquo;s thinking changes with time.
