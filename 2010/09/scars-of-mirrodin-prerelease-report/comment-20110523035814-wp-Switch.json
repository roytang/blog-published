  "text": "Re: extra discussion, the prereleases here are usually pretty friendly affairs, friendly enough to get my girlfriend to play.  The prize scheme is a little different, with 1 pack for less than a win and a draw, 2 packs for 4-8 points, 4 packs for 9-10 points and 6 for 11-12 points (if i remember correctly).  I think in general you should loosen up at these things, but geography and relative costs are a factor here, as well, since there's probably ten venues with events, usually both days, and a large event at Suntec.",
