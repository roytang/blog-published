  "text": "Aba aba sir roy, bumili ka na din! Haha. Personally, gusto ko hintayin ang version na may facetime (sans any external hardware).\n\nRegarding the slow (and misleading) USB charging, I think that happens when you try to charge with a mobile device (e.g. a laptop). By standard, USB connectors on desktops provide a more \"stable\" power output as compared to mobile devices due to their (more often) lack of a \"fixed\" power source.\n\nHTH :)",
