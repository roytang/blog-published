  "text": "Of course this is the wise approach to this situation - but I've been in more than one workgroup where managers penalized you based on numbers of CR comments - without ever reading any of them, of course. Ideally we'd all improve over time and get less feedback and the system would work - and maybe outside of Redmond that's what the culture supports - but when everyone reviewing your code is in direct competition with you for raises, people tend to ramp up the feedback to take their competitors/coworkers down. (In my decade of experience in MS Office, Developer Division, and Windows, anyway) In that case, it's more than just ego attachment fueling the frustration, it's your career viability, your family's medical insurance, maybe your work visa status. Sometimes there's nothing wrong with your code, and a workplace is just hostile. That's not a problem you solve through detachment.",
