<div class="e-content">

<p>The building had a nondescript white exterior, with a single grey metal door on the facade and no other hint of what lie within. I tried the knob and a metallic rattle told me it was locked. I frowned, then remembered, then pulled out the mysterious envelope I had found under my door yesterday. I mean, 93 years from now. Well, not 93 years from now for me. Yesterday for me. God, I need to figure out how to think of time again.</p>
<p>I opened the envelope, equally nondescript as the building exterior, and shook it a bit. The small key fell out of it and I almost miss catching it. Harold would have sneered derisively if he was here. &ldquo;World&rsquo;s clumsiest time traveller!&rdquo; he would have said.</p>
<p>Harold. Harry. Good old Harry. The argument had been gone sour last night. Will have gone sour? &ldquo;Why should we go? We have no idea what this is. No idea!&rdquo; he had exclaimed, gesturing wildly as he was wont to do.</p>
<p>I inserted the small key into the lock on the doorknob, and sure enough it clicked into place. I turned the knob and stepped inside.</p>
<p>Harry was always the smart one. The prudent one. He had all these rules. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t risk collapsing the universe!&rdquo; or some such theoretical physics bullshit. He&rsquo;d be hopping mad if he knew I&rsquo;d actually gone. Well, he doesn&rsquo;t need to know, it&rsquo;s a fucking time machine isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ll be back before he knows it.</p>
<p>Behind the door was a long and dimly lit corridor. The only sound was the subtle whirring of a large ceiling fan overhead. Well, that and the creaking of the metal door as I shut it back into place.</p>
<p>A desk. There was a desk. And behind it, a person. A stocky woman, her hair tied in a bun, wearing spectacles. She looked up from what looked like a sudoku puzzle as I stepped closer. Did they even have sudoku in 1923? I reached into my pocket for the envelope again.</p>
<p>I needn&rsquo;t have bothered. &ldquo;Mr. Reyes, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; She nodded towards the far end of the hallway. &ldquo;Take the elevator at the end. There&rsquo;s only one stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er, I was hoping to ask&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please hurry. It will all be explained to you when you get off the elevator,&rdquo; she cut me off a bit rudely as she penciled a 9 into the lower-right segment of her sudoku, &ldquo;sir.&rdquo; She ended the sentence with a slight hint of boredom, as if she shouldn&rsquo;t have to be the one to be entertaining weirdly-dressed men coming into the building at this hour of night.</p>
<p>I nodded, sensing that she didn&rsquo;t expect any further argument, and headed down the hallway. I stepped into the elevator and pressed the single button I found inside. Strangely, I couldn&rsquo;t tell whether it brought me up or down.</p>
<p>I had to squint a bit as I stepped out into a corridor a bit more brightly lit than the last one. This corridor was shorter, and the walls tapered with red velvet, the carpet a burgundy affair. The light was coming from a large open door at the end of the hallway. Looked like some sort of banquet? Well, the mysterious invitation had said it was a dinner after all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nineteen twenty three? What the hell happens in 1923? A bloody invite? Who would even send this to us?&rdquo; Harry said when I read the letter out loud to him. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell anyone did you? I told you we can&rsquo;t go public yet, we need to do more tests!&rdquo; Harry was always so angry for some reason. And secretive about the project. We could never tell anyone about the machine. Not even my family. They thought I was consulting with the government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Mr Reyes,&rdquo; another woman, blond this time, stepped out of seemingly nowhere as my eyes adjusted to the brighter lights. She looked strikingly similar to the one I met earlier. Perhaps they were sisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my grandmother actually, long story,&rdquo; she said, cutting me off before I could ask, &ldquo;sorry sir, we can&rsquo;t waste too much time, please step into the hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inside the hall, there were a number of men milling about. Perhaps ten or a dozen? They were all wearing some sort of cocktail mask. I would have thought it some sort of masquerade ball, except they weren&rsquo;t wearing very formal clothes. Most of them had on simple shirts and slacks or jeans. Nothing to indicate they were out of place in this era though.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; an older man came towards me and lowered his mask. His visage was strikingly familiar, but I could not place it. &ldquo;It is almost time, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time, time for what?&rdquo; I said, confused. &ldquo;Who are you? The lady upstairs,&rdquo; Or was it downstairs? &ldquo;She said someone would explain all this to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, yet there is little time for introduction, so let us keep this brief. My name is Alexander Reyes, age 61.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did a double-take. &ldquo;Wait, what? We have the same name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re clever so you&rsquo;ll have figured it out before I finish this sentence,&rdquo; future me (my future self? myself? I?) said, &ldquo;So let us not dally any further. Harold is coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harold? Harry?&rdquo; I shook my head, still trying to wrap my head around everything as the rest of the men in the banquet hall started to approach mill around us. &ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s not. He doesn&rsquo;t know I came&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will,&rdquo; another one of the men took down his mask. My own face stared back at me, easily recognizable this time, if only slightly older. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it, there&rsquo;s nothing you could have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could go back,&rdquo; I stammer out. I reach into my pocket, looking for the wayback beacon. A terrible name for such a device, Harry had said. Harry. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, why is Harry coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows. Well, he will know. That we mean to stop him.&rdquo; Another version of me spoke. Glad to know I never will get the hang of the verbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t follow me here,&rdquo; I reasoned out. &ldquo;I have the only beacon. And he doesn&rsquo;t know how to operate the machine without me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll teach him,&rdquo; a grim version of my face said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t resist, it&rsquo;s a waste of time. He was meant to come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry it took this long, all of you,&rdquo; it was sixty-one again who spoke. &ldquo;To arrange this meeting, but then again, you all already know it will.&rdquo; He nodded towards me. &ldquo;You were the first, so you had to be last to arrive. So that he doesn&rsquo;t know we are all here, waiting for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To kill him of course.&rdquo; The grim one spoke again. &ldquo;And yes, we will need this many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The building shook, as if some powerful force was shaking its foundation. Everyone around me started murmuring in anticipation.</p>
<p>Sixty-one reached out and put his hand on my shoulder. &ldquo;You must go. You cannot fight him, you are not ready. There is but one more thing you must remember,&rdquo; he looked around at the gathered future versions of me. &ldquo;When you are in great peril, recall this gathering and remember that you will surely survive.&rdquo; With that, he reached into my pocket. Is it an invasion of personal space if it&rsquo;s your own future self? That was the last thought on my mind as he activated the wayback beacon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, I&ndash;&rdquo; The familiar vertigo overcame me again and I knew it was too late. I was going back.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m new; be gentle~)</p>
