<div class="e-content">

<p>A while back I answered a question over on Quora about how I got started down the path of programming. It&rsquo;s not a particularly interesting story, but I still thought I&rsquo;d record it here for posterity.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometime when I was much younger, maybe somewhere between twelve to fourteen years old, I remember having some sort of QBasic programming learning book at home. I forget how we got it, I think my uncle brought it home for me sometime for some reason. I don’t know why he would have such a thing, we didn’t even have a personal computer at home (we had a Nintendo Entertainment System, but that wasn’t really the same thing)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spite of that, I took to the book easily. In fact, I kind of devoured it with a passion. Not that it had a lot of information. It was maybe 20-30 pages long, and I remember the font being a bit too large so I guess it was really meant for a younger audience. (It was the early 90s though, what kids learned QBasic in those days? Very few families even had computers in the Philippines then) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was extremely basic (pun intended), with pages dedicated to line numbers and print statements and if statements. I remember that most of the control flow discussion centered around the use of GOTO which I would later learn was very bad. But I was fascinated with the idea of programmable machines. That you could give this machine a set of instructions and it would do what you asked. For the first time, I had a glimpse of the mechanisms behind those video games I loved to play. I read that book cover to cover again and again. It seemed like the possibilities were endless. My imagination was set afire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some time later, and for some reason I don’t remember anymore, my parents signed up me and my younger brother for some sort of computer usage basics class at the nearby mall. I think it was like 2 weeks of daily classes during one summer. The guy taught us stuff like how to use the command line (Windows wasn’t really a thing yet at that time). It’s kind of silly, but I don’t really know what else we were taught. The main thing I remember from those sessions was that my brother and I figured out how to render &ldquo;art&rdquo; to the screen by printing out extended ASCII characters using batch files. Whatever it was the guy was teaching us, we quickly devoured and went through, which gave us a lot of extra time. We used that time to simulate video game screens using the extended ascii characters. I remember we made something that looked like a Nintendo game title screen, with options to choose &ldquo;1 PLAYER&rdquo; or &ldquo;2 PLAYER&rdquo;. Of course, we didn’t really get anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward a bit more. I was in fourth-year high school when I had my first computer programming class. We had a new computer lab on the top floor of the school, where we learned the basics of using Turbo Pascal. By this time, we already had a personal computer at home, a 386 (slightly dated) whose main use at that time was playing games like </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sid Meier’s Civilization, Romance of the Three Kingdoms,</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">.and </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">Day of the Tentacle</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">. I remember installing a copy of Turbo Pascal and teaching my brother how to use it. We may have had a book as reference, I’m not sure. (I assume we had a textbook for the class at school)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not soon after, he had already written some simple programs simulating the &ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure&rdquo; type of stories, what we would later know to be called Text Adventures. I remember his first &ldquo;game&rdquo; being something about a kid visiting a haunted mansion. Of course, it was mostly unfinished and you would not be able to get more than a few decisions in. I remember taking a look at his code and it was a complicated mess of print statements and conditionals and hardcoded decision checks. We had no concept of how to write good code then, although I do remember telling him that it wasn’t a good idea to have variables named like &ldquo;v&rdquo;, &ldquo;vv&rdquo;, &ldquo;vvv&rdquo;, &ldquo;vvvv&rdquo;, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jump ahead again a few years. I’m doing my thesis, soon to graduate as an Electronics and Communications Engineer. I had thought about taking up Computer Science, but in my youthful arrogance I felt like I already had a pretty good idea of programming and would find the actual course boring, based on my previous experiences. Despite that I had spent some time during the intervening years reading programming books and game development books I found in the Engineering library, and doing quite well in the data structures and algorithms class I had to take. For our thesis, we had to do a hardware part and a software part, and my thesismate easily agreed to let me do the software part; he knew how twitchy my hands were when working with hardware.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow, we managed to actually finish the thesis and graduate (quite delayed I might add), and I took a year off to &ldquo;study for the board exam.&rdquo; During that time, I sent out various job applications. I wasn’t yet sure where I would end up working, A few weeks after passing the board exams, I received a call from a software company based in Ortigas. They had received my application and asked me to come in for an exam. Um ok. I didn’t even remember sending an application in, I think it was one of many I sent out using Jobstreet. They were the only software company who contacted me. I believe at that time I was considering applying for a job at a small electronics company of the north side of the metro, closer to home (other opportunities for ECE graduates were more on the south side). I had no idea then what the local software industry looked like or whether it paid well or whatever, but I decided to try it out anyway. I ended up working at that company for more than ten years.</span></p>
