I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are people a lot more cluttered than me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTowards the start of the year, I told myself I should throw out/get rid of/dispose of at least one thing a day. It\u0026rsquo;s one of those relatively easy things to do I haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to maintain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do we keep around all this old stuff we don\u0026rsquo;t need?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of it may be from a mentality of scarcity \u0026ndash; we don\u0026rsquo;t want to throw away stuff for fear of finding out that we may need it later. But reasonably, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t used a thing in years, maybe you\u0026rsquo;ll never use it and even if you had need of one, how difficult would it be to find one again? Some kind of pack rat mentality. I know a few of my friends who would be very familiar with this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther things we keep around for some sort of nostalgia or as keepsakes of other people and faraway places. That\u0026rsquo;s fine I suppose, but maybe one shouldn\u0026rsquo;t put too much value in things that don\u0026rsquo;t actually have them. Case in point: I have a bunch of rocks here from different countries I visited in Europe, haha. Pictures, letters, and other personal keepsakes one might consider digitizing and storing in the cloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving a cluttered space has a cost, one that\u0026rsquo;s difficult to ascertain or quantify. Not only do things look messy, but things are harder to find when you need them most. There\u0026rsquo;s also a strange satisfaction that comes from achieving a fine, organized space (before it all falls back into chaos of course.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "title": "Learning a New Programming Language",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eRelated: \u003ca href=\"/2016/12/learning-new-skills/\"\u003eLearning new skills\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile many people working as programmers/software developers are happy enough specializing in a single programming language or platform, I generally consider it a better idea to have a wider toolset and the ability to easily pick up new programming languages as needed. The benefits should be obvious: when you have a wide variety of tools under your belt and are able to quickly learn to use a new tool, the number of work options you have increases greatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHappily, programming languages share a lot of similar constructs. Only your first programming language (when you first learn programming) should provide you with any difficulty \u0026ndash; once you\u0026rsquo;ve cleared that hurdle, learning additional programming languages shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too much of a concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou typically start with syntax, variable declarations, function declarations and program flow (loops, conditionals and so on). Some languages may have a strange syntax that don\u0026rsquo;t share much in common with other programming languages, but that\u0026rsquo;s pretty much not a concern as long as you have access to a modern-day compiler that will tell you when you stray from the desired syntax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find that learning a programming language is best done the same way you actually program \u0026ndash; iteratively. Learn something new, try it out, modify it a bit, try it out, and so on. I once had to help someone prepare for a programming interview where he would be expected to know C++. He had learned it before in college, but hadn\u0026rsquo;t used it for a few years, but for some reason he stuck to reading up on it instead of taking my suggestion to install a compiler and actually try out all the suggestions. (He ended up passing the interview, but that was luckily because they didn\u0026rsquo;t ask too much about syntax.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt also helps a lot to learn about theory and terms and whatnot. Like for object-oriented  programming, it helps to know and understand the concepts behind polymorphism, inheritance, abstract classes and so on. When studying different programming languages, you can then easily compare how they are done in one language vs another, making it easier for you to carry over design concepts to the new language you are learning. Being familiar with the terms and vocabulary also helps you communicate better with mentors, teachers, and fellow learners studying the same language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding small toy applications with the new programming language is a great way to learn too. Or maybe if you had a certain project in mind that you wanted to do, you could use the new language with it. Slightly related: When I was consulting with a startup on developing a new product, I asked the CTO whether he preferred to use a technology stack that the developers were more familiar with (to reduce learning costs) or whether he wanted to try this different language that neither of us had tried before, and he told me that one of the great things about being in a startup was that he could choose to do new projects with new technologies to expand their horizons and not have to listen to higher-ups shut it down for fear of increased costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the longest time, I tried to learn at least one new programming language/platform a year. For 2016, it was Unity/C#, although I\u0026rsquo;ve also started studying Node.js in the past month or so. I hope it\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;m able to keep up, even as I\u0026rsquo;m trying to explore new skills other than programming.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eWhen Hanamichi Sakuragi from the manga \u003cem\u003eSlam Dunk\u003c/em\u003e tries to get into the basketball club, he insists he\u0026rsquo;s a genius who doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to practice the basics and instead wants to go immediately to doing spectacular things like Slam Dunks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadly, the vast majority of us cannot claim to be geniuses at anything, and we are forced to undergo a bit of hard work if we want to learn a new skill. Malcolm Gladwell says one needs 10,000 hours of work at something to become proficient, but that probably only holds true if you\u0026rsquo;re using those hours \u0026ldquo;smartly\u0026rdquo; and not just trying to brute force your way to expertise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to always keep myself on a learning path, trying to pick up new skills on a regular basis. Here are some things I\u0026rsquo;ve noted down about how to work smartly towards self-improvement in any given skill:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStart with the basics, and keep up with the basics\u003c/strong\u003e. When Sakuragi joined the club, they first made him practice dribbling in the corner, and despite his complaints it paid off when he actually got to play because he had really smooth dribbling. It can suck and be boring to be stuck doing simple things or studying theory or background first when you want to skip ahead to the fun, complicated, show-off stuff, but having a solid foundation to work on will help you get a lot further later on.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e**Have a target. **What\u0026rsquo;s your goal when studying this skill? Do you want to become the best in the world in a competitive sport? Do you want to be able to converse in a foreign language? How much time and effort are you willing to spend? Knowing the answers to these questions lets you understand when you are pushing yourself too hard or not putting in enough effort.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePractice, practice, practice.\u003c/strong\u003e I sometimes answer questions on \u003ca href=\"https://www.quora.com/\"\u003eQuora\u003c/a\u003e, and one of the common questions I see there is of the form \u0026ldquo;How can I get better at X\u0026rdquo;? And my response is inevitably some form of \u0026ldquo;There is no substitute for regular practice, good old time and effort.\u0026rdquo; followed by specific suggestions for the particular X. I used to play competitive Magic the Gathering a lot, and used to place decently in local tournaments on a regular basis. But that was when I had a larger playgroup that I spent a lot of time with and when I was still playing a lot. These days I will only pop in for a tournament every so often, and predictably I seldom do so well anymore. Even if you\u0026rsquo;ve been doing something for a long time, regular practice makes a hell of a lot of difference.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e**Try to improve at least a little bit every time. **Every practice session, every time. Even if you improve only 0.1% every time, the magic of compound interest means those gains will scale up quickly.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e**Study how other people do things and overcome challenges. **I love fighting games like \u003cem\u003eStreet Fighter\u003c/em\u003e, and one of the great things about the modern age is that fighting game enthusiasts have access to a whole lot of replays of top-level competitive fighting that they can watch and study to help improve their own fighting games. (Sadly I do not yet have the execution skills necessary to become competitively good at it \u0026ndash; not enough practice probably, see above.) Studying other people\u0026rsquo;s work gives you insight into different ways of doing things and can unlock different pathways in your brain, allowing you more opportunities to think outside your own box and find more chances for improvement.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e**Keep pushing the difficulty. **Try not to settle for the same level of skill so you can keep improving. Take small steps to improve your game. Handicap yourself in different ways and see how you can compensate. Compete against people who are better than you, and study how they fight you.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e**Study different approaches. **Try out new strategies or new ideas; even if you just discard them later you will have learned something. You might find that the most common approach to learning a skill is not necessarily the best one for you.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKnow your weaknesses and shore them up.\u003c/strong\u003e If you have a certain style or technique you have a hard time with, practice that more or study it more intensely. While studying Spanish on Duolingo, I know that I always have trouble constructing sentences that use object pronouns so I try to special attention when such sentences come up, and I try to review them more often.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e**Keep track of your progress. **While not always practical or doable, being able to track your progress, even as a high-level estimate, allows you to measure the rate at which you improve. It gives you a good idea of when you are doing well and when you are having difficulty and helps you compensate accordingly.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e**Reward yourself when you do well, and take a break every so often. **As with all things, balance is something to consider.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",
