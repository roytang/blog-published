They have some ongoing series currently, namely Ultimate Comics Spider-Man (6 issues in, this Spider-Man is not Peter Parker), Ultimate Comics X-Men (6 issues) and Ultimate Comics The Ultimates (6 issues). If you want to go back farther, I suggest picking up trades of Ultimate Spider-Man (this was the first Ultimate book, and it ended last year) and Ultimate X-Men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want some Avengers, they have several series ongoing.
