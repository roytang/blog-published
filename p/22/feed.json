Game is pretty good, and sufficiently challenging. I finished a couple of other scenarios during the week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also tried a couple of other multiplayer games this week: one was the multiplayer Bannerlord beta, I got an invite middle of the week. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of meh, mostly just people spawning, running around maybe killing 1-2 other people, then dying and respawning. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really into Mount and Blade for this kind of combat anyway, more for the simulation side. The other game was Orcs Must Die 2, which I already had in my library but hadn\u0026rsquo;t played yet, but a friend suggested it when we were looking for games to coop. Fun game, fairly similar to the first one, I think coop is the only major addition, but haven\u0026rsquo;t explored it too much so I could be wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been holding off on starting any longer games since I\u0026rsquo;m anticipating \u003ca href=\"/2020/03/upcoming-gaming-things/\"\u003ethe release of Final Fantasay VII Remake in early April\u003c/a\u003e, but now the release date is going to be near the tail-end of the Metro Manila lockdown (and with some uncertainty as to what happens after), I\u0026rsquo;m wondering if I should reconsider\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLinks:\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0026rsquo;m maintaining \u003ca href=\"/page/blogroll/\"\u003ea blogroll\u003c/a\u003e now, and I try to update it every so often, but I thought I\u0026rsquo;d highlight some of the sites listed there and why I chose to follow them and have them there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://paulcapewell.com\"\u003ePaul Capewell\u003c/a\u003e tagged me in a couple of posts last month (thanks webmentions!) so I checked out his blog.

The reason it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to write about is that events are unfolding and changing rapidly, and a lot of things are still unclear. On top of that, there is anxiety to contend with, and all the news can make it difficult to think. And so we write, both as a record of events and to help clear my thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was originally going to write about the recent COVID-19 virus happenings during this week\u0026rsquo;s weeknotes, but I ended up writing so many words about it, so I decided to make a separate type of post.

And only 1 confirmed death. The president had previously addressed the country in some kind of incoherent drunken rant that didn\u0026rsquo;t say much but was easily repurposed by internet memers into some kind of spoken word poetry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a shortage of face masks.

As of Saturday (the 14th) night, we were up to 111 confirmed cases and I think 8 deaths, with 40+ reported during that day alone. That fatality rate of around 7%, is way higher than the global 1-3%, which is a good indicator of how many unreported cases we probably have locally, due to the severe lack of testing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"thursday-march-the-12th-lockdown-announced\"\u003eThursday, March the 12th: Lockdown announced\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe explosive growth in cases finally made the government take drastic action; around Thursday lunchtime, rumors started circulating in online circles that the authorities were planning a lockdown of the National Capital Region. This included a leaked memo listing the recommendations that the president would have to decide on. Many details were not known, like what exactly would happen in such a lockdown. What we did know was that the lockdown would start reportedly start on Sunday, the 15th and would last for 30 days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe markets did not take the rumors well. Shortly before closing, the Philippine Stock Exchange circuit breaker was triggered after the index had dropped more than 10% on the day. The index recovered slightly before closing at around -9.x%. It was a bloodbath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring my late afternoon walk I decided to pass by the nearby grocery because there had already been reports of large crowds. Sure enough there were way more people than usual. I really only wanted to get Tostitos dip, but they were out of stock of that. Why were people hoarding it? Alcohol and hand sanitizer were out of stock as well, as expected. From the chatter I overheard, people were well aware of the rumored announcement later that day. My parents weren\u0026rsquo;t planning to do our weekly grocery run until Friday night, but I decided to pick up a few essentials (bread, eggs, canned goods, etc) early since I was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA press conference was announced for around 6-630pm. True to form, the conference only started around a couple of hours late. Most of it consisted of the president telling the people to listen to the health authorities, reading out the details of the memo (exactly the one that was leaked, leaving many questions), in his usual annoying rambling style. (To his benefit, he seemed way more lucid than his last public speech.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lockdown covered Metro Manila, banning domestic travel over land, sea, and air. International travel was still around. The press conference did not provide any details of how the lockdown would be enforced or any plan for increased testing or support for health care front-liners or new health care supplies. No details of how people who live outside the NCR but work there during the day would be handled. No word on support programs for people who will lose paying work because of the arrangements. The president did not acknowledge the efforts of public health care workers, but instead for some reason, decided to thank China for supposedly supporting us. (Even though the virus came from them.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of my group chats are abuzz, discussing the turn of events and the lack of details, with the general consensus being: \u003cem\u003eANG LABO!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA doctor friend reports that she has been in quarantine and is awaiting results of the COVID19 test because she was in contact with possible carriers. We wish her good luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people I knew had flown out of the NCR to the provinces for some R\u0026amp;R and their flight back would be from Saturday night to Sunday early morning, so they would be caught by the lockdown. I jokingly said that since international flights weren\u0026rsquo;t banned, they could just fly out to Malaysia or such, then fly back in to NAIA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI note that on this day, 16 new confirmed cases were reported, while 9 and 4 cases were reported the two days prior. This implies to me that we\u0026rsquo;re looking at 25 cases the next day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy opinion: I general accept that the lockdown is probably necessary, but not with the implied threat of police/military action. Focus should be on improving testing and healthcare resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"friday-march-the-13th\"\u003eFriday, March the 13th\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s Friday the 13th!

This results in very long lines outside the stations, kind of negating the social distancing anyway. I\u0026rsquo;m glad I\u0026rsquo;m no longer a regular commuter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recommend to my parents to do the regular grocery run earlier, and as a result I have to accompany my mom on the trip, just after lunch. Even then, the nearby grocery was packed, with maybe 200% more people than the usual peak. Sanitation items like hand sanitizer and alcohol were out of stock. Eggs were too for some reason (luckily I had already bought some the day before). Common canned goods were still on shelves, but the more popular ones were in short supply. The \u0026ldquo;panic buying\u0026rdquo; isn\u0026rsquo;t as much as we see reported in other countries where many shelves are bare. Friends who go to larger groceries like SNR report 2-hr wait times at the checkout line. Ours takes around 30 mins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpokespersons for different government agencies have begun issuing statements clarifying how things will actually work during the lockdown \u0026ndash; excuse me, \u0026ldquo;community quarantine\u0026rdquo;. The air and sea restrictions are pretty clear, but the land restrictions seem impossible to implement without massive traffic. The intent is to have checkpoints at roads in and out of the metro, and to inspect passengers one by one to make sure their trips are essential. There is still no plan on how to support people who cannot work due to the lockdown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocal churches announce suspension of mass services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGroup chats are abuzz all day with discussions such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehow their companies are preparing for WFH.

I am privileged enough that I can largely follow this advice, and many of my friends work in industries where WFH is viable. The ones who will be disproportionally affected are the poor - the ones who can\u0026rsquo;t afford not to work or have no way to work remotely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mayor of Quezon City has declared a state of calamity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the trading day, the PSE has managed to recover a bit, closing at +1.x% up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly 3 new confirmed cases are reported today, defying my pattern recognition skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"saturday-march-the-14th\"\u003eSaturday, March the 14th\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s Pi day!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have a small extended family lunch gathering today, mostly as a send-off to some \u003cem\u003ebalikbayan\u003c/em\u003e relatives who are flying back to the US in a couple of weeks. The gathering was originally scheduled for Sunday, but because of the announcement we rescheduled to Saturday to avoid complications. Fewer people are able to attend, and we just have takeout instead of going to a restaurant as originally planned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the afternoon, there is a presscon where the MMDA/PNP/some mayors are talking about a one month curfew from 8PM-5AM. The interior secretary threatens arrest for those who refuse to go home during the curfew. This causes a mix of reactions on social media and in the group chats. During the time I was still a regular commuter, by 8PM I would not have been able to get on a bus yet. The authorities are also requesting that malls close except for essential services such as supermarkets, banks and pharmacies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrain in the healthcare system is starting to show.

The exodus is worse than Christmas or Holy Week holidays. Airline ticketing offices are also swamped with people looking for refunds and rebookings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly in the evening, they start rolling back the curfew announcement, saying it was just recommendations, and that the MMDA has no authority to impose a curfew, unless the LGUs pass ordinances to enable such. PCOO\u0026rsquo;s Andanar calls such reports \u0026ldquo;fake news\u0026rdquo;. (Never mind that the government people were live on TV talking about it.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the end of the day, 47 new confirmed cases had been reported, for a total of 111. (If my pattern recognition had held, today would have seen 36 new cases. Not too far off.) Some posts from healthcare workers suggest that some of the new cases are from the poorer Payatas and BASECO areas. An outbreak in those areas would be really bad, as the spread would be very difficult to control. And the tests are delayed by about two days - by now many people may have been infected in those areas. The DOH is yet to release details of the new cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLate in the evening, the \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ANCALERTS/status/1238843668485685248\"\u003eNCRPO announces\u003c/a\u003e that instead of checkpoints, they will just implement increased police visibility at the metro exit points.

For future runs, we may try some online grocery sites such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.metromart.com/welcome/cities\"\u003eMetromart\u003c/a\u003e, or I\u0026rsquo;ll do the run myself (and we just live with whatever terrible choices I make LOL.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday we are up to 202 confirmed cases (15 new cases) with 3 additional deaths (total 17).

AFAIK there has been no announcement from either the national government or the LGU, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s just the barangays being creative in implementation.

I had volunteered to go do it alone, but the problem was I can\u0026rsquo;t drive, and the 30-40 minute walk back might be problematic with the amount of stuff to buy. And it turned out if I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a senior citizen with me, I\u0026rsquo;d have had to wait in a long queue. It\u0026rsquo;s a tradeoff and a risk to be sure, but we tried to manage it. I did the main grocery shopping, he mostly just went to the pharmacy to buy meds. Hopefully that mitigates things.

His results came back while they were at the hospital and he had to leave and the whole delivery ward had to be decontaminated and HCWs put into quarantine.

The journalist was asking why we had tested so few people compared to other nearby countries of similar economic standing, but the doctor insisted the official numbers were much higher - except he was actually talking about number of tests conducted, not number of people tested, which was the comparison being made. This particular doctor had over the past few days established a reputation for being quite arrogant and self-centered, and dismissive of people who aren\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;experts\u0026rdquo;. Probably not the best person to be talking for the DOH (but he isn\u0026rsquo;t actually an officially spokesperson - a DOH usec later confirmed the journalist\u0026rsquo;s numbers were the official one).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of the more science-y folk in my monkeysphere are not very happy with this particular doctor and how he handles himself on social media, and one of my friends (with a background in molecular biology) even got blocked trying to ask him about the technicalities. Regardless, I try to avoid delving into his conversations too much anyway, as he is only a DOH consultant and not an official spokesperson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of the things he are saying are counterproductive or non sequitur anyway.

This helps us see that they know what went wrong and can adjust accordingly. Transparency begets trust, and the more trust we can have in our leadership, the easier it will be for the citizenry to bear the harsh burdens that the following weeks and/or months may entail. I want to believe they are capable of handling this situation. Give me hope!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of tonight, we are at 1075 cases (+272) and 68 deaths (+14), both the biggest daily jumps so far.

These are urban poor-type people. Law-enforcement types came in to disperse them for violating quarantine, and violence broke out when people refused and complained. Multiple people were arrested.

The QC govt later issued a statement denying that relief goods had not been distributed to those areas and blamed instigators for causing trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, the NBI summoned a popular city mayor for questioning about an alleged violation of the Bayanihan Heal As One Act (aka the emergency powers bill aka the BaHO Act), because he violated the natgov order not to allow tricycles to ply the roads. The thing is, that happened way before the BaHO Act was passed, and the mayor appealed to the natgov to let them use tricycles and when that appeal was denied, the mayor complied with the directives. Targeting a very popular local gov official turned out to be a very unpopular move, unsurprisingly, and many just assumed the president was being insecure because this particular mayor was serving his city well and was making him look bad. This is such an idiotic move, not even particularly corrupt or evil or sinister as it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really gain them anything; what purpose does it serve other than to make the people angry? An unforced error in a long line of unforced errors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people suggested it might be a sleight of hand - to distract us with things they are doing with the emergency funds prescribed by the BaHO act. Supposedly the 1.8B pesos worth of PPE sets being ordered by the DOH are overpriced, but they of course denied that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was this directive that all donations to the DOH and to govt hospitals need to be coursed through the OCD, and hospitals have to make their requests in writing. Many questioned this added layer of centralized bureaucracy and some openly speculated that this was so that the donations could be \u0026ldquo;repackaged\u0026rdquo; and distribution controlled by a particularly influential senator through his \u0026ldquo;Malasakit centers\u0026rdquo;. If the idea is just to make sure all hospitals get served appropriately, perhaps a more prudent approach would have been for the DOH to continuously publish a priority list of hospitals with the most dire need of donations? The whole reason people are donating directly to the hospitals and hcws is the poor trust in the national government. Some have also suggested that this may be a way to exert some control over the OVP, which has been working hard to solicit donations and get supplies and support to hcws and other frontliners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe icing on the cake: at around 10pm, an unannounced live press conference by the president was aired where he warned the people to just obey, even if relief goods are delayed, promising they will not die of hunger. And for those who would violate quarantine or cause trouble, he implied that the law enforcement types should just shoot to kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWTF. Think about that. People are anxious, worried, fearful, and most of all hungry and staving and you think the best move is to threaten them with violence and death?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, pictures came out of donated PPEs and face masks supposedly repackaged and branded as being from a certain senator. Unverified rumors also started to spread that certain private hospitals were raided to get their donations, so that they can be repackaged by the senator. These are yet unverified reports, the only evidence being screenshots of text convos between people who allegedly have first-hand knowledge. If it were true, one would think there would be images or video footage somewhere maybe? Someone I know asked her medical friends and they have no knowledge of such raids on the private hospitals. So maybe let\u0026rsquo;s leave that for now. But I think it\u0026rsquo;s a serious indictment of the trust in the natgov and that senator in particular that many people easily believe he could be behind such acts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, we are up to 2311 (+227) cases and 96 (+8) deaths. The slope is around the same as the past few days (slightly less), which seems to imply that the limiting factor is how many tests are being conducted?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"thursday-april-the-2nd\"\u003eThursday, April the 2nd\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m writing this at a bit past 4pm. Ever since Duterte\u0026rsquo;s surprise address last night, #OUSTDUTERTENOW has been trending on Twitter, first locally to the Philippines, then worldwide at #1 (currently at 489k tweets). I took the liberty of taking a look of a few of the profiles using the hashtag, and as far as I can tell the traffic is organic; the accounts don\u0026rsquo;t look like bots, they tweet about a lot of other things (honestly most of it seems to be korean fandom, so maybe they\u0026rsquo;re young people), and aren\u0026rsquo;t recently created egg accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, obviously I don\u0026rsquo;t like Duterte as a president and think he\u0026rsquo;s doing a terrible job. But I wish the Filipino people had chosen a better time to wisen up to his shortcomings than when we\u0026rsquo;re in the middle of a pandemic. Even if somehow there were an orderly transition (not bloody likely), the discontinuity in administration is bound to cause friction and hiccups in our pandemic response. Unfortunately, the administration is pretty bad in their crisis control and have made multiple unforced errors (see yesterday\u0026rsquo;s entry) that only increase the likelihood of social unrest and/or chaos. I would prefer we get past the current crisis first, then we exact accountability, but that may be wishful thinking\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, the rest of the day was relatively saner compared to yesterday. As of 7pm, I am slightly more optimistic about the country again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/inquirerdotnet/status/1245614612751331328\"\u003eRelief goods were finally distributed to the residents of Sitio San Roque.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffcanoy/status/1245616090719195138\"\u003eThe DILG Sec Ano has some sane words about the NBI\u0026rsquo;s investigation of a popular mayor.\u003c/a\u003e He also says they will crack down on other chief executives not following the IATF guidelines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA member of the Presidential Anti-Crime Competition floated the idea that the NBI should also investigate the OVP for \u0026ldquo;competing\u0026rdquo; against other government services. WTF? Later, the head of the PACC issued a statement saying that was not an official recommendation and the member was just expressing a personal opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e#OUSTDUTERTE vanished from the twitter trending lists by the time I woke up around lunch time, to be replace by typos like #OUSTDUTERE. Some are speculating it may be counter-ops by troll farms wishing to split the original hashtag. The funny thing is even the typo\u0026rsquo;d hashtag trended for a while!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the lockdown started, we haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten our regular newspaper delivery, so I\u0026rsquo;ve missed the opinion columns of some columnists I like such as Boo Chanco. I recently read a post of his on FB where he shared some thoughts from someone complaining how the government officials in charge had practically no knowledge of supply chain logistics, which made managing the quarantine much more difficult. Unfortunately when I checked his FB profile for the post, it could no longer be found! Either he set it to private due to being bashed by trolls or the person who shared the info asked him to take it down, maybe?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of 7pm tonight, we are at 2633 (+322) cases and 107 (11) deaths. Still roughly the same curve. It\u0026rsquo;s actually possible we do have this thing under control, given our death count so far hasn\u0026rsquo;t been spiraling out of control like the US (who got their first cases much later than us). But we probably don\u0026rsquo;t have an accurate count - there might be a lot of deaths going unreported as covid19-related due to not being tested, or poor people not even bothering to go to the hospitals, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI miss being able to go out. Not for hanging out with people, but just being able to take long walks and also to eat outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"friday-april-the-3rd\"\u003eFriday, April the 3rd\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOvernight, the worldwide tally of cases broke past the 1,000,000 mark (doubling in around 5 days) and 50,000 deaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bit of good news: Late last night it was announced that mass testing of PUIs and PUMs is planned to start on April 14, so it\u0026rsquo;s a solid step towards the mass testing everyone had been clamoring for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mayor of QC issued a statement apologizing for her past statements on social media and for relief bags bearing her name. She still has a long way to go, but wow the ability to admit mistakes and apologize is super rare among politicians, and improves my trust rating of her and makes me see her more as someone just trying her best in a bad situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had another surprise episode of Late Night with Duterte tonight. Most of it was the usual seemingly drunken rant (a friend of ours showed the stream to a UK colleague and the comment was \u0026ldquo;he looks so wasted!\u0026quot;), including an appeal/threat to obey the police and trying to justify his earlier violent statements, etc. He also spent quite a lot of time picking on former senatorial candidate Chel Diokno, in a manner that made him look like a shallow playground bully, including commentary on appearance. A bit of a plot twist at the end when he castigated the PACC official who suggested to investigate the OVP for helping the people and announced he would be fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of tonight, we are at 3018 (+385) cases and 136 (29) deaths. Are deaths starting to accelerate?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"saturday-april-the-4th\"\u003eSaturday, April the 4th\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday was relatively uneventful, thankfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of tonight, we are at 3094 (+76) cases and 144 (+8) deaths.

The original target end date for the lockdown was Apr 12th, but it seems highly probable that we will have an extension, at least until the end of April.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenerally uneventful, though I would like to note that anecdotally I have been reading more stories about people who criticize the government accused of being communists/leftists rebels (as if complaining is exclusively the domain of the left!). There\u0026rsquo;s even an infamous PCOO undersecretary accusing teachers at my high school alma mater of being CPP-NPA-NDF! I would guess the president\u0026rsquo;s threats against the \u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo; has galvanized his base into painting critics with a common brush, giving them an enemy to hate in this crisis; convenient since the true enemy is invisible and cares not about your red-tagging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn better news, a number of politicians, including some mayors and congressmen and even the president himself, have committed to donating part or all of their salaries to the relief operations. It may not be much, but it\u0026rsquo;s something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of tonight, we are at 3246 (+152) cases and 152 (+8) deaths.

Even Chief Impelementer Galvez (of the  National Task Force Against COVID-19) is implying that\u0026rsquo;s where the task force is leaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of the task force, they have \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ntfcovid19ph\"\u003ea twitter\u003c/a\u003e!

Galvez is one of the bright spots in the govt fight against the virus, so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis afternoon I went out to the nearby drugstore (around a 10-minute walk) to buy meds for my mom and maybe a tiny bit of groceries (the drugstore has a small grocery section). The drugstore had 3 short queues outside: one for regular transactions, one for senior/PWD transactions (this was the shortest line), and one for groceries (only 3 grocery people allowed inside at the same time). I was transacting for a senior, so I got to use the shortest line. Inside, what used to be the open counter of the pharmacy had a barrier of plastic wrap to separate the customers from the staff, with only a tiny hole to slide prescriptions and money and medicines across. Entire trip (including back and forth walk) took around an hour and a half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s Monday, so we have a new episode of Late Night with Duterte.

He went to the bank while I did the grocery shopping. There\u0026rsquo;s still a decent number of people in the grocery, despite them limiting entry. Proper social distancing is probably impossible. I mean, if implemented properly, each aisle of the grocery is only wide enough for one person, so that means waiting patiently while the lady in front of you slowly goes through the items on the shelves. I tried to minimize getting too close unnecessarily of course, but it\u0026rsquo;s a challenge. For me, that means I\u0026rsquo;ll be anxious for the next week or so in case any symptoms appear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe small Pizza Hut in the grocery building was open and doing takeout, but I only noticed when I was done, and there was a 30-45 minute wait.

The hospital came out with a statement denying they are running out of body bags, but later admitted that their morgue is over capacity because of an unusually high number of unclaimed body bags. Apparently there was an order to hospitals to report deaths first to the DOH before anyone else, so maybe that order was misinterpreted which led to the underreporting deaths rumor. In any case, if one hospital is struggling with deaths, it\u0026rsquo;s likely other hospitals are too, which is worrying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents haven\u0026rsquo;t seen their grandkids all together since February, so today we set up a zoom call with everyone so we can enjoy their company. It was expectedly a lot of chaos, but the kids had a lot of energy and we had fun and the grandparents enjoyed the quality time, so that\u0026rsquo;s something. It\u0026rsquo;s highly unlikely we\u0026rsquo;ll get to see each other until late May at the earliest, so this was the next best thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of tonight, we are at 4648 (+220 today, +572 since Thursday) cases and 297 (+50 today, +94 since Thursday) deaths. This is now the record for most deaths/day, but it\u0026rsquo;s possible that some death reporting may have been delayed due to the holiday weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorldwide, cases are now at 1.8 million and deaths more than 100,000.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kind of enjoyed the short break, so I think future updates to this diary will be sparse, instead of the daily it was before. Maybe only when significant things happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"wednesday-april-the-15th\"\u003eWednesday, April the 15th\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree days since the last entry. Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve gone out three times, the most for any week since the quarantine began. Twice was for medicine runs for the parental units (one would think they could just combine them into one request, but apparently extenuating circumstances etc), and another was for a grocery run. I still failed to get pizza at the grocery store though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had thought about having food delivered last Easter Sunday, but apparently we decided on it too late, by 4:30pm most of the open restos were no longer delivering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot much to report on the government side. Not that things aren\u0026rsquo;t happening, but it\u0026rsquo;s more of the same, mostly. Although the good news is that some LGUs are adding their own testing programs, so hopefully we get a better idea of where we are in the days to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of tonight, we are at 5453 (+230 today, +805 since Sunday) cases and 349 (+14 today, +52 since Sunday) deaths. The rate of new cases has more or less held steady over the past few days, with about a thousand being added every 3-4 days. The good news is the recovery count has caught up to the death count, today it\u0026rsquo;s at 353. This is excellent because it was probably only a week or so ago that the there were about twice as many deaths as recoveries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"friday-april-the-17th\"\u003eFriday, April the 17th\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYesterday, a resolution by majority of senators asking the health secretary to resign came out. The signatories were mostly pro-admin senators too! Duterte quickly rejected the requested. Today, the socioeconomic planning secretary and \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/rapplerdotcom/status/1251045773443166208?s=21\"\u003eNEDA head offered his resignation\u003c/a\u003e, partly due to personal reasons and partly due to \u0026ldquo;differences in philosophy with a few fellow cabinet members\u0026rdquo;. The timing is weird and makes me think that he resigned due to Duque not resigning, but that\u0026rsquo;s pure speculation lol. The more probable reason is that the other cabinet members don\u0026rsquo;t agree with his recommendation to try to end the lockdown quickly? We can only speculate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn \u003ca href=\"https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1852785\"\u003eentire sitio in Cebu is now considered infected\u003c/a\u003e after mass testing found a large number of asymptomatic cases. Out of 53 confirmed positives, 51 were asymptomatic. That\u0026rsquo;s a troubling rate, it may mean our actual number of confirmed cases may be up to 25 times more than previously thought. (Don\u0026rsquo;t quote me on that, this is a single data point.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of tonight, we are at 5878 (+218 today, +425 since Wednesday) cases, 387 (+25 today, +38 since Wednesday) deaths and 487 (+52) recoveries. Recoveries increasing faster than deaths, so that\u0026rsquo;s promising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"sunday-april-the-19th\"\u003eSunday, April the 19th\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard 6am mass via the TV. ABS-CBN broadcasts one, I think it\u0026rsquo;s held in their studio. The celebrant was Fr. Jerry Orbos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo more weeks of this, at least. Some people are hoping for partial lifting of the ECQ in May, but there\u0026rsquo;s also the possibility of tighter restrictions, as the president has threatened. Rumors and feelers point in either direction being possible. We\u0026rsquo;ll see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of tonight, we are at 6259 (+172 today, +381 since Friday) cases, 409 (+12 today, +22 since Friday) deaths and 572 (+56 today, +85 since Friday) recoveries. Recoveries growing faster than deaths for the past 3 days, and confirmed cases seemingly tapering off? Seems a bit too good to be true? Again, we\u0026rsquo;ll see!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"friday-april-the-24th\"\u003eFriday, April the 24th\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis morning, the government officially extended the ECQ in Metro Manila (and some other areas with high Covid19 incidence) up to May 15th. Not surprising, especially given the rumors and the trends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of days ago, there was this altercation at a quezon city checkpoint where cops ended up shooting and killing a mentally unstable ex-military person after a short standoff. Supposedly because he made a motion as if to draw something from his bag. The police claim he had a gun, but the witnesses and relatives say otherwise. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of different videos of the encounter too. The PNP initially cleared the officer in the encounter, but today it was announced that homicide charges would be filed. It\u0026rsquo;s a good step towards accountability, but I\u0026rsquo;m skeptical it would lead anywhere. But more importantly - cops really need to get over this mentality of preferring the use of lethal force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of tonight, we are at 7192 cases (+211 today, +933 since Sunday), 477 deaths (+15 today, +68 since Sunday), and 762 (+40 today, +190 since Sunday) recoveries. It\u0026rsquo;s great that recoveries are still outpacing deaths, but I\u0026rsquo;m worried about the number of still unresolved active cases. Around two weeks ago, there were a bit 4000 cases, but as of today, we only have around 1200 deaths+recoveries, so there\u0026rsquo;s around 2800 cases that are serious enough to still be unresolved after 2 weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"sunday-april-the-26th\"\u003eSunday, April the 26th\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree more weeks of this. It\u0026rsquo;s not that I mind staying at home. But I miss being able to go out and walk around and eat outside freely, even alone. Also, I could use a haircut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly went out once this week, for groceries. We tried to buy a bit more than usual, hoping to reduce the number of times we need to go out. We also celebrated a couple of birthdays in the family, through a zoom call, complete with the grandkids blowing on a candle from across the internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of tonight, we are at 7579 cases (+285 today, +487 since Friday), 501 deaths (+7 today, +24 since Friday), and 862 (+70 today, +100 since Friday) recoveries. Worldwide, we are nearing 3M cases and have passed 200,000 deaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"sunday-may-the-3rd\"\u003eSunday, May the 3rd\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfficially, this is the 3rd calendar month of quarantine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCouple of days ago we got a second tranche of relief goods from the LGU, mostly canned fish things and some rice. I haven\u0026rsquo;t been out all week, but word is that they are being a bit more strict and there are more cops policing places like the wet market etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of tonight, we are at 9223 cases (+295 today, +1644 for the week), 607 deaths (+4 today, +106 for the week), and 1214 (+90 today, +352 for the week) recoveries. Recoveries vastly outpacing deaths is good news, but the number of cases continues to rise linearly without any slowdown in sight, probably due to testing limits I guess?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;ll see if NCR manages to leave ECQ after the 15th, but even then we\u0026rsquo;re still only going into General Community Quarantine (GCQ) which is definitely not a \u0026ldquo;back to normal\u0026rdquo; scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorldwide, there have been an additional 500k cases and 45k deaths over the past week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"sunday-may-the-10th\"\u003eSunday, May the 10th\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis post was mostly an experiment in making a single continuous post that would be updated periodically. At this point (well over 10,000 words in this single post), I\u0026rsquo;m ready to admit this has been an unwieldy experiment. I will still continue the covid19 updates and thoughts, but probably as separate notes and posts.

It\u0026rsquo;s actually a bit difficult to write about, but I figure it\u0026rsquo;s something I would like to be able to look back on in the future, so let\u0026rsquo;s give it a shot. The reason it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to write about is that events are unfolding and changing rapidly, and a lot of things are still unclear.",

I\u0026rsquo;ve played Mount and Blade Warband for a nontrivial amount of time, and I really enjoyed the simulation and overworld stuff, but was really bad at the combat, especially mounted combat.

But when I looked it up, the game actually came out Sep 1997, so we actually played it in summer of 98! Memory, how does it work? I lent out my PS4 recently and won\u0026rsquo;t get it back before April so I don\u0026rsquo;t get to try the demo, but I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to the remake and already have it preordered for PS4!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(I was originally planning to include this in the \u003ca href=\"/2020/03/weeknotes-2020-03-08/\"\u003elast weeknotes\u003c/a\u003e, but I thought to separate it so it\u0026rsquo;s purely a gaming post.)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eSince I stopped being a full-time employee at the end of 2015, I\u0026rsquo;ve missed around four years of monthly SSS payments. This isn\u0026rsquo;t really that big a deal, since I\u0026rsquo;ve already paid more than 10 years of premiums, I\u0026rsquo;m already guaranteed to get a pension from SSS when I reach retirement age. However, this past January I decided to resume making SSS premium payments on a voluntary basis. I had to research a bit and ask some friends about the whole process, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d document it here both for my own recollection and in case someone finds it useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe SSS pension isn\u0026rsquo;t a lot, which is why I\u0026rsquo;ve never really prioritized making the payments, but making voluntary payments will slightly increase the actual pension I can get from SSS in my old age. The computation for SSS pension amounts is outside the scope of this post (it\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab\u0026amp;q=sss+pension+computation\"\u003eeasy to search for\u003c/a\u003e) but AFAIK each additional year of payments I make (with the maximum contribution amount) will increase my monthly pension by around 320 pesos, and this is the maximum possible bracket. A pitiful amount really; whether it\u0026rsquo;s worth it or not depends on how long you intend to live past retirement age. By my computation if you live around 8 years past retirement age, you come out ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst step: Create an account\u003c/strong\u003e. If you want to transition from monthly payments made by your employer to voluntary payments, the first thing you need is an account on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.sss.gov.ph/\"\u003eSSS online website\u003c/a\u003e. There are several methods to register an account, but all of them will require your SSS No. plus a secondary set of information to verify your identity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe secondary info can be something a mobile number or savings account number already registered with SSS, or a Payment Reference Number (PRN) previously used (more on PRNs later). If you\u0026rsquo;re like me and you\u0026rsquo;ve had zero interactions with SSS in the past, the easiest way is to get the SSS Employer number for your last employer. (If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a previous employer, I suspect you have to go to the SSS office and ask for advice there.) Hopefully you haven\u0026rsquo;t burned your bridges and can just ask them for this information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#44f5afa62540b9f947dad54259f2337b-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2020/03/how-to-make-voluntary-sss-payments/sss-registration_huf3e6c771291eb65c97c6bff49990b5cb_40807_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"44f5afa62540b9f947dad54259f2337b-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2020/03/how-to-make-voluntary-sss-payments/sss-registration.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"9 Mar 2020 12:00am\"\u003e9 Mar 2020 12:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOk, so I signed up by providing this information, so now I have an account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNext step: Generate a PRN.\u003c/strong\u003e A PRN is a Payment Reference Number, basically a record of the payment you want to make. after you log in to the SSS web application, click the \u0026ldquo;Payment Reference Number (PRN)\u0026rdquo; tab and click \u0026ldquo;Generate PRN\u0026rdquo;.

You fill up the form, including the PRN number you want to pay, and make the payment. It\u0026rsquo;s relatively painless, aside from the having to go to the Bayad Center in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout a week after making the payment, I suggested logging in to the SSS website again and checking your account details to see if the payment was recognized, just to make sure everything went fine. IDK how it could go wrong, but this is the government, so better safe than sorry!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: I was using the old SSS webapp for this (and the screenshots above). They also have a publicly-accessible beta of their \u003ca href=\"https://portal.sss.gov.ph/member/\"\u003enew member portal\u003c/a\u003e. It uses the same account as the old webapp, and it looks \u003cem\u003eslightly\u003c/em\u003e less dated. However, I could not find a screen in the beta member portal for generating the PRNs, so you might be stuck using the old webapp.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Since I stopped being a full-time employee at the end of 2015, I\u0026rsquo;ve missed around four years of monthly SSS payments. This isn\u0026rsquo;t really that big a deal, since I\u0026rsquo;ve already paid more than 10 years of premiums, I\u0026rsquo;m already guaranteed to get a pension from SSS when I reach retirement age. However, this past January I decided to resume making SSS premium payments on a voluntary basis. I had to research a bit and ask some friends about the whole process, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d document it here both for my own recollection and in case someone finds it useful.",

The Trump administration seems to be handling things poorly, which would be typical to expect of an administration not used to transparency or integrity. For all our sakes they need to get their act together. The PH government appears to be doing slightly better (assuming no hidden epidemic), although their messaging still seems to be all over the place. Some local governments have started suspending classes and private business are now requiring self-quarantines, and rumor has it the Greenhills business district was a ghost town the last few days after a confirmed case identified in that area. Bill Gates famously warned a few years ago that a global pandemic may be the most predictable threat to the world in modern times, but let\u0026rsquo;s hope our governments can get their act together and get this thing under control. Otherwise, the future may look like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n    On \n    \u003ca href=\"/2020/03/1236252441600872449/\"\u003e\u003ctime datetime=\"2020-03-07 11:28:45\"\u003e7 Mar 2020 11:28am\u003c/time\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n    I wrote:\n    \u003cblockquote\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eThe year is 2034. Everybody has COVID19, toilet paper is but a distant memory. A young woman claims to be immune. Crowds flock around to watch her touch her own face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like how the weeknotes give me space to do a little commentary on world events without needing to do a full blog post about them. So let\u0026rsquo;s talk US politics for a bit. I\u0026rsquo;m not an American so my opinion isn\u0026rsquo;t worth much, but US politics disproportionately affects the rest of the world, so I think we get to comment too. Besides, a vast majority of the Americans I follow on Twitter are either liberal or quiet on politics, so I\u0026rsquo;m kind of accidentally exposed to the Democrats\u0026rsquo; POV a lot of the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, the Democratic Primaries: More or less down to Biden or Sanders. I think Biden is the favorite at the moment; my opinion on him is largely summarized by a meme I say (but can no longer find again) where his image was given the treatment similar to the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_%22Hope%22_poster\"\u003eObama hope poster\u003c/a\u003e, except with the caption \u0026ldquo;MEDIOCRE FOR ALL\u0026rdquo;. He seems like the type of candidate you get when the base is largely divided and people have to settle on a \u0026ldquo;least common denominator\u0026rdquo; kind of candidate. I like Sanders, but his electability is a real issue (because Americans are so indoctrinated against anything that could remotely be-called \u0026ldquo;socialism\u0026rdquo;) and so are his \u0026ldquo;Bernie bros\u0026rdquo;. If he\u0026rsquo;s able to move the needle towards the left even a little for the Democrat base/establishment, that would be great. It\u0026rsquo;s too bad the race is down to two old white guys. I liked Warren as a candidate more than Sanders, but her being a woman was also a downside in misogynist America. None of Sanders\u0026rsquo; or Warren\u0026rsquo;s progressive programs are going to mean anything if they can\u0026rsquo;t retake the Senate though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, the outcome of the US political process may very well affect the future of liberal democracy worldwide, as they have been slipping further and further away from that ideal during the past couple of decades, emboldening populists and strongmen in other countries, including my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a personal level, my week was exhausting. Mostly due to social events necessitating travel to far-flung parts of the Metro and also filial duties requiring me to spend inordinate amounts of time in hospital waiting rooms. Nothing serious, just accompanying some loved ones for regular tests and checkups, but am severely annoyed by the obvious lack of doctors causing severe waiting times for patients. One of the arguments against universal health care is that it would increase waiting times and such, I wonder if that\u0026rsquo;s something that\u0026rsquo;s happening here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaming: I got \u003ca href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription/february-2020\"\u003elast month\u0026rsquo;s Humble Choice\u003c/a\u003e, mostly by default. The main draw for me was \u003cstrong\u003eFrostpunk\u003c/strong\u003e which some friends had been recommending. And I also promised someone that I would stream a survival game blind, so I \u003ca href=\"/2020/03/1235920529233776640/\"\u003edid that for Frostpunk last week\u003c/a\u003e. Otherwise, we\u0026rsquo;re kind of in a holding pattern until the FF7R release next month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonal projects: Not much progress the past week.

Same old, same old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe did two quizzes last week. The first was for fun, and I missed probably my only chance to win first place by enumerating Street Fighter II characters; the game mechanic was such that we needed to bid on how many we could enumerate (max 15 out of 20), and I initially wanted to bid 15 but I was talked down and made to doubt myself and we instead bid 10. I actually got 16 (forgot about the extra evil fighters in succeeding remakes), but since we only bid 10, that\u0026rsquo;s what we got and we ended up losing by 1 point. This decision may haunt me forever lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond quiz was for the Geekfight League we\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this year. We only finished second place, but that was enough to give us the solo lead in the league rankings, so that was a better outcome than the previous quiz. (And this loss was more \u0026ldquo;we really didn\u0026rsquo;t know the answers\u0026rdquo; vs \u0026ldquo;we did know the answers but we screwed up\u0026rdquo; so it was less feels-bad)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSite changes this week:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMinor theme updates\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSome older posts have been receiving a lot of spam via the comment form.

            "summary": "The Week That Was: The COVID19 pandemic is starting to pick up steam, both internationally (including the US) and here in the Philippines. The Trump administration seems to be handling things poorly, which would be typical to expect of an administration not used to transparency or integrity. For all our sakes they need to get their act together. The PH government appears to be doing slightly better (assuming no hidden epidemic), although their messaging still seems to be all over the place.",
