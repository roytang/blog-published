I had the draft of the first part of this post for a while, but after revisiting it, I realized how much it applied to one of my own decisions I\u0026rsquo;m faced with right now.

Recently though I\u0026rsquo;ve started following more sources and blogs that are focused on more\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;cultural\u0026rdquo; affairs. When I started doing \u003ca href=\"/2016/03/sketching-daily/\"\u003e#sketchdaily\u003c/a\u003e a couple of years ago, I started following more artists. During the past few months, as a sort of counterbalance to the prevalently negative current events and tech industry news, I\u0026rsquo;ve also begun following a few more people who are focused more on things like philosophy, history, poetry, literature, creativity, and so on. A lot of it goes over my head - I don\u0026rsquo;t really have any formal background in the humanities - but many times I come upon posts I appreciate and that help expand my horizons and point me down new avenues of thinking. And I can still enjoy good art and good poetry and good prose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have also purposely cut back a bit on the more political follows, especially on Twitter. Following current events feels a lot like being a spectator at a car crash; everything is terrible, but you can\u0026rsquo;t help but be fascinated by what\u0026rsquo;s going on. Even much of the tech industry news tends to be negative - Facebook has done something horrible; there\u0026rsquo;s a new data breach; people are spending too much time on their computers; big tech is helping fascist countries do censorship; and so on. It\u0026rsquo;s too easy to lose yourself in current events and be angry all the time about the state of the world or the country or our leadership. I\u0026rsquo;m not planning to disconnect completely from the news, like some people do, and I\u0026rsquo;m still always open to discussion about any topic (though I have decided to be more restrained in my urge to debate people and respond to every possible outrage).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still believe that good citizens have a responsibility to stay abreast of what\u0026rsquo;s going on in the world and to be informed so that we can make good decisions. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it has to be outrage 24/7. We\u0026rsquo;re not going to run out of bad news any time soon. We have to find the space as well for appreciating what\u0026rsquo;s good in life and for broadening our horizons.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Humility disclaimer: I\u0026rsquo;m not claiming to be the best software developer by any stretch, it was probably more of a big fish in a small pond scenario.

Many times she would be putting in extra hours for days at a time and I would say to her \u0026ldquo;Put that off until tomorrow, it\u0026rsquo;s time to go home.\u0026rdquo; and she would reply along the lines of \u0026ldquo;But I still have so much work to do.\u0026rdquo; and my usual rejoinder would be \u0026ldquo;Are you expecting to finish all of that work tonight?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe modern working world is full of problems, issues, tasks and other work that needs to be resolved, and it can be overwhelming at times. It can seem like the list of to-dos is endless. Software development in particular can seem like never-ending crises and issues and tickets to be resolved, especially for larger teams and larger projects. But that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t mean we sacrifice all our time in pursuit of emptying that to-do list. We put in our hours and pare down that list the best we can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne learns this quickly when faced with any nontrivial project with an issue tracker. Often the list will seem to keep growing with no signs of slowing down. You might have a tendency to say \u0026ldquo;but we can\u0026rsquo;t release software with this many issues!\u0026rdquo; But deadlines are real, and you learn that you have to triage and make trade-offs with the time you have available. Real-world software is released with issues still pending, simply because there isn\u0026rsquo;t enough time to do everything. So you prioritize and choose the most important things, the most critical bugs, and fix what you can in the available time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne has to apply this to one\u0026rsquo;s personal workload as well. No matter how many things you have to do, you don\u0026rsquo;t have infinite time. You have to figure out what\u0026rsquo;s important for you and that\u0026rsquo;s where you focus your time and effort. Pushing yourself beyond what your time and health allow will do no good. That way lies madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven for personal goals this is an issue for me. I want to do a lot of things. There are so many things I want to read, write, create, draw, learn, watch, and try out. I want to do everything. There are so many things I want to have mastery over. Mastery implies regularly spending hours on practice and effort. But there are only so many hours in the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Maybe mild, unmarked spoilers somewhere in this review, be warned!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOverall: the game was amazing and spectacular and fun, especially for a big comic book fan like me, well worth the buy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMechanics: Combat felt a bit weird to me at first, mainly because I was expecting it to be closer to Arkham-style combat, and I kept trying to use Spider-Man\u0026rsquo;s Circle Dodge the same way I use Batman\u0026rsquo;s Triangle counter, and that got me clocked by the first boss of the game (Kingpin) a few times. Spider-man\u0026rsquo;s Dodge doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow you to cancel out of existing animations like Batman\u0026rsquo;s counter, so I really needed to unlearn that instinct. Once you get a hang of it, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty good, but feels a lot more chaotic than Arkham style combat. Arkham combat felt a lot more rhythmic where you just tap commands out and point at the baddie you want to hit. Here it feels like you have to be jumping all the time and swinging across the air and moving the camera around to look for objects to throw at enemies.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMechanics: Web-swinging around Manhattan also felt weird at first. Sometimes the command to web swing would be unresponsive, which I would later realize would be because I was at a height that was too high to find surfaces to swing from. Once you get the hang of it, it feels very smooth and fun and you\u0026rsquo;re zipping around Manhattan like a boss.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStory: Peter Parker in this universe is reminiscent of old-school Peter Parker who\u0026rsquo;s always late to things and always behind on his rent. The early parts have him getting evicted from his apartment (classic Parker!) and looking for a place to crash. (Although after that point, it\u0026rsquo;s never mentioned where he\u0026rsquo;s sleeping, if he is at all.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStory: Spider-man here is however, a well-known public figure, a veteran of super-heroing who even gets some assistance from law enforcement primarily in the form of Captain Yuri Watanabe. He\u0026rsquo;s been webslinging around long enough to build a stable of villains who are constantly referenced about being held in the Raft.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMechanics: There\u0026rsquo;s actually a lot to do around the city. Not really collectibles, but more like different kinds of challenges and missions. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of crimes to stop that you\u0026rsquo;ll hear on police bands as you\u0026rsquo;re web-swinging around. More difficult crimes and missions unlock as the story progresses, and they all come with optional objectives (such as perform X type of special move, etc) that give you bonus rewards. There\u0026rsquo;s also stealth missions reminiscent of Arkham\u0026rsquo;s predator modes, pigeon chasing, research missions that have you doing all sorts of weird tasks, and so on. Missions typically reward you with some form of tokens, which are used to unlock suits, gadgets and upgrades. This Spider-Man has a lot of gadgets, making him closer to a Batman figure in this universe.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStory: In this universe, J. Jonah Jameson is retired from his days at the Daily Bugle and instead hosts an internet radio show where as can be expected, he\u0026rsquo;s always castigating Spider-Man. His broadcasts come in as you\u0026rsquo;re swinging around the city, and Jonah will often comment on things you\u0026rsquo;ve recently done or missions recently accomplished. I especially like it when one of the missions had you doing something ridiculous like intentionally swinging through smog and Jonah makes wild speculations about what the hell you were smoking.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMechanics: The suit selection in the game is fairly good, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of suits available and you unlock more as you level up (you need to purchase them with tokens). You can change costumes at any time, and most cutscenes will show Spider-Man wearing whatever suit you have on at the time, which can be sometimes hilarious. I\u0026rsquo;m severaly disappointed at the lack of the \u003ca href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/spiderman/images/6/69/F0ab528486904cef1297397514b73ef9.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120721011355\"\u003eFantastic Four Amazing Bag-Man costume\u003c/a\u003e though. My favorite costume from this game is the classic comic book costume (screenshots below), I really like how well it\u0026rsquo;s animated so smoothly and gives such a cartoony vibe. I would totally play an entire game rendered in this fashion. It\u0026rsquo;s also hilarious when this costume is used in cutscenes!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/KcHOHTc.png\" alt=\"My favorite costume!\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/4KOBWj0.jpg\" alt=\"Why won\u0026rsquo;t you take me seriously MJ?!?\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://imgur.com/XyiqRIW.jpg\" alt=\"Those guns won\u0026rsquo;t work on me, I\u0026rsquo;m a cartoon!\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMystery: I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why, but the distance scaling in this game is super-off. In-game measurements tell me Manhattan island is about 4 km from top to bottom, which feels really small. The \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan\"\u003eWikipedia entry\u003c/a\u003e says Manhattan is almost 60 sq km, but in-game it can\u0026rsquo;t be more than 10 sq km. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why it would be like this.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStory/Mechanics: You don\u0026rsquo;t get to play as Peter Parker/Spider-Man all the time, there\u0026rsquo;s also a few missions you have to play out as one of two side characters. One of them is the lovable spunky red-headed Mary Jane Watson, who in this universe is not a supermodel actress, but rather has a more Lois-Lane like role as an investigative reported for the Daily Bugle. That means she gets herself into all sorts of troublesome situations where she has to sneak around enemies in order to escape. She\u0026rsquo;s no damsel in distress here, I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure if Peter ever rescues her directly. I like this MJ iteration, she has a lot more spunk. The other side character you get to play at is young Miles Morales, who enter\u0026rsquo;s Peter\u0026rsquo;s life somewhere in the 2nd act of the story. Miles parts consist of sneaking around as well, although he has a different toolset than MJ, mainly consisting of a hacking app that lets him create distractions to bypass guards.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStory: One of the best things in this game\u0026rsquo;s story is the mentorship relationship between Peter Parker and Otto Octavius, although if you know comics, you have a pretty good idea of where this is headed. Unlike the \u003ca href=\"/2004/07/movies-spiderman-2/\"\u003e2nd Tobey movie\u003c/a\u003e, the game gives their relationship sufficient time to develop before you start to see signs of trouble. The fall itself is well-executed and heavily foreshadowed and Peter has only himself to blame when he finds out he helped turn his mentor into an insane mechanical octopus.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStory: The overall story had some twists and some surprises in the ending itself. At the heart of all the problems facing Spider-Man this time around is the incumbent Mayor Norman Osborn, but who never actually turns into a green villain himself. The game\u0026rsquo;s ending heavily hints at a 2nd outing, so they\u0026rsquo;re probably saving Norman for later. Wise decision as well, Spider-Man has a deep bench of villains to pull from, and many of the classic ones haven\u0026rsquo;t been hinted at yet in this game. Aside from the Goblin, the 2nd game could very well introduce us to the Lizard, Sandman, Mysterio, and maybe even Venom among others!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAfter getting the platinum, I was tempted to purchase the \u0026ldquo;City That Never Sleeps\u0026rdquo; DLCs as well for additional content, but I decided to hold off for now. My experience already feels \u0026ldquo;complete\u0026rdquo; and just right anyway, and adding more missions might be too repetitive. Maybe if it goes on sale sometime.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStan Lee (RIP) also had a small cameo in this game. For me it\u0026rsquo;s bittersweet that I got the platinum a couple of days after his death; I consider the game to be a fitting tribute to his life\u0026rsquo;s work.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs is tradition, here\u0026rsquo;s a screendump, awash with in-game spoilers! (Mainly because I chose to include the automatic screenshots that came with each Trophy unlock). You can see during the later parts I was using the comic costume almost exclusively!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/GXG9Qb5\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"//imgur.com/GXG9Qb5\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cscript async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e",

I ran into this one called \u003ca href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/sparketypes/\"\u003eSparketypes\u003c/a\u003e recently. Here\u0026rsquo;s my result:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour Primary Sparketype reveals the essential nature or \u0026ldquo;driver\u0026rdquo; of the work you\u0026rsquo;re here to do (whether it\u0026rsquo;s the work you get paid to do, or not). When you do the work of your Primary Sparketype, you come alive with purpose and, fully-expressed in a healthy way, deepen into meaning, flow, connection and joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a Maven, fascination is your call. You latch onto a topic, field or industry and devour everything you can know about it. Staying \u0026ldquo;surface level\u0026rdquo; just isn\u0026rsquo;t an option for you. It\u0026rsquo;s no fun. You are driven to learn, to discover, to ferret out information, wisdom, knowledge for no other purpose than the joy of learning and knowing something as fully and deeply as you can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour Maven\u0026rsquo;s fascination and yearning to learn might be expressed more generally, as a perpetual curiosity about everything and everyone. Or, it may be more focused on highly-specific topics or fields of interest that evolve over time, often because your ceaseless yearning to learn has largely exhausted what the topic has to offer. So, you find the next area of fascination to move on to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Maven\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s not necessarily about what you \u0026ldquo;do\u0026rdquo; with your rapidly-accumulating reservoir of wisdom. What you learn may be useful to the others, or not. When it is, you enjoy sharing it. It is a beautiful potential \u0026ldquo;by-product\u0026rdquo; that also is essential if you want to turn your Maven-ness into your living. But, when you\u0026rsquo;re really being honest, it\u0026rsquo;s not the essential reason you do it. The fact that is has value to others is more a measuring stick of the depth of your knowledge and ability to fully-express what you\u0026rsquo;ve learned than a true expression of your reason for being. Either way, the deeper driver is the quest to learn, to satisfy your perpetual, insatiable fascination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, there\u0026rsquo;s two results! I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I understand what the difference is. Here\u0026rsquo;s the second one:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember, your Primary Sparketype (above) represents the essential nature of the work you\u0026rsquo;re here to do. Your core driver of purpose, passion, expression and flow in work and life. Your Shadow Sparketype, on the other hand, is also a big part of you. Some may feel its call nearly as strongly. Your Shadow Sparketype most often reveals the work that you may well enjoy and have developed a high level of skill around, BUT it is also largely taken up in service of doing the work of your Primary Sparketype better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour Shadow Sparketype is The Scientist, which means you are driven by, and find a deep sense of satisfaction in the pursuit of an answer to a burning question, or the solution to a significant problem. But, for you, when you\u0026rsquo;re really being honest, that drive is almost always in service of doing the work of your Primary Sparketype at the higher possible level. It\u0026rsquo;s more a means than an end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMany times quizzes like these are eerily accurate - which shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a surprise since you\u0026rsquo;re the one providing the input, so the results will tend to reinforce what your own views are about yourself. I\u0026rsquo;m especially fond of the assessment of the Maven\u0026rsquo;s tendency to latch onto anything that fascinates him, since that happened to me just recently with \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/site-migration-from-wordpress-to-hugo/\"\u003elearning Hugo and the site migration from Wordpress\u003c/a\u003e which I lost sleep over. I think this is one of things that makes me feel most alive - when I find a topic of interest and dive into it and lose sleep over it. Unfortunately, that happens fairly rarely nowadays and rarely lasts very long.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m slightly amused by how I\u0026rsquo;ve read so much about strategies for monetizing content on the internet that by now I can easily recognize when someone else is doing it. After sending me my Sparketype, there was also a link to a page upselling me on their \u0026ldquo;Mastery Program\u0026rdquo; which would allow me to make the most of this knowledge for $29.99. I guess it was a book or video of some sort. Exactly 24 hours after the initial results email, I got a 2nd email which was following-up and encouraging me to take a look at the program. I unsubscribed at this point, but I find it safe to assume I\u0026rsquo;m still in their database. I don\u0026rsquo;t even think I ever signed up. I\u0026rsquo;m not really the type of person who would pay for these things, so as long as I know what I\u0026rsquo;m getting into, I don\u0026rsquo;t mind tolerating the sleazy marketing for a bit.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n",

I have a few issues with Wordpress, none of them a major dealbreaker, but collectively enough to make me consider something else:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe new \u003ca href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/\"\u003eGutenberg editor\u003c/a\u003e set to become standard in 5.0 was in my experience, very clunky and kinda annoying\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe code structure of Wordpress is very deep and complex, sometimes making it difficult for me to make changes I want. I can usually figure it out, but it feels like things are unnecessarily more complicated than they need to be\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWordpress\u0026rsquo;s rich plugin library is a plus, but it also means having to figure out how to have multiple plugins interoperate with each other. An easy example is that I was using a queueing plugin that didn\u0026rsquo;t work great with the Gutenberg editor\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWordpress requires a lot of maintenance, including needing to regularly update plugins for security purposes, and comment moderation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"static-site-generators\"\u003eStatic Site Generators\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, while reading across some blogs over the past few months, I had ran into the idea of static site generators, which intrigued me as a Wordpress alternative. SSGs offered several advantages:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI could compose my posts offline and using any \u003ca href=\"https://roytang.net/2018/11/my-history-in-text-editors/\"\u003etext editor\u003c/a\u003e I wanted, using a simple format like Markdown\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePage load performance is better since Apache will simply serve up the static files, no processing or database hits of any kind\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStatic sites don\u0026rsquo;t require security updates of any sort - there\u0026rsquo;s no database or admin backend to be hacked\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEasy backups. In WP I was using a custom plugin for backups. With an SSG, I can simply have the raw content stored in Github, then the static content \u0026ldquo;built\u0026rdquo; from there. The content always exists in at least three places - the actual site, Github, and my local computer I use for posting.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"why-hugo\"\u003eWhy Hugo\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s quite a lot of static site generators available right now actually. The most popular one seems to be \u003ca href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\"\u003eJekyll\u003c/a\u003e which is ruby-based. I first decided to try \u003ca href=\"https://blog.getpelican.com/\"\u003ePelican\u003c/a\u003e because I preferred Python over Ruby. However, it turned out problematic on my Windows machine, I encountered some interoperability problems with pandoc for the WP migration. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to have too many dependencies and issues with dependencies because I would later want to deploy the generator itself to my hosting on Webfaction for automated deployments, so I wanted the setup to be as easy as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I stumbled upon \u003ca href=\"https://gohugo.io/\"\u003eHugo\u003c/a\u003e, which offered two main advantages:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe MSP was performance. I wanted to migrate over the entire history of the blog, which was almost 900 posts at this point.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eno external dependencies - all I needed was to download the hugo executable\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter reading up and testing a bit of Hugo, I had a fit of \u0026ldquo;I couldn\u0026rsquo;t sleep, I\u0026rsquo;ll just go ahead and do the site migration now\u0026rdquo; that I would later regret since it completely screwed up my sleep schedule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"wordpress-export\"\u003eWordpress Export\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter\"\u003eWordpress to Hugo plugin\u003c/a\u003e to convert my Wordpress content for Hugo. Many posts had reported problems with this plugin, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any issues with its basic operation. I had a two problems with it:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewhen exporting existing Wordpress comments, it didn\u0026rsquo;t include the commenter\u0026rsquo;s URL, which I felt I should include\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eall the posts were exported into a single \u003ccode\u003eposts\u003c/code\u003e folder. While this didn\u0026rsquo;t create any permalinks issues due to each post having the \u003ccode\u003eurl\u003c/code\u003e attribute in the frontmatter, it made the entire folder look very unorganized since I had almost 900+ posts. I preferred that the posts be grouped by year and month, matching the \u003ccode\u003e/yyyy/mm/slug/\u003c/code\u003e format of the permalink\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I had the source for the plugin, it was straightforward to fix both issues myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter getting the export from the plugin, I still had a bit of post-processing and cleaning up of the posts to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one thing, all the single-quotes in the exported posts seem to have been converted to HTML entities for that smart quote thing, so I had to reverse that. Luckily, it was a simple find and replace across text files. The format for embedding posts such as Twitter, Youtube, etc was different as well, I had to correct those files one by one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"cleaning-up-the-taxonomies\"\u003eCleaning up the taxonomies\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had always wanted to clean up the categories in the blog, but I never got around to it with Wordpress because I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like figuring out the SQL I would have needed to do it. (I\u0026rsquo;ve never liked Wordpress\u0026rsquo;s table structure.). With Hugo, all I had to do was update a bunch of text files, which I was much more comfortable with. This involved simply importing a Python library to \u003ca href=\"https://elbauldelprogramador.com/en/how-to-parse-frontmatter-with-python/\"\u003eparse frontmatter\u003c/a\u003e, and a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/roytang/blog/blob/master/utils/clean_categories.py\"\u003escript\u003c/a\u003e to do the conversion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"generating-the-archive-pages\"\u003eGenerating the archive pages\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t have built-in support for archive pages, so I had to create them myself. I followed the setup described in \u003ca href=\"https://blog.atj.me/2017/10/generate-yearly-and-monthly-archive-pages-with-hugo-sections/\"\u003ethis blog post\u003c/a\u003e and wrote a python \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/roytang/blog/blob/master/utils/create-archives.py\"\u003escript\u003c/a\u003e to generate the individual year/month archive pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bigger problem was the archive listing (the page that would link to the individual archive pages). Because the blog has been running for 15 years, there\u0026rsquo;s a whole lot, so I preferred to organize them in a table like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#bc6ffeab2c0e919e9cfc9edeb1084a63-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/site-migration-from-wordpress-to-hugo/archive-grid_hue4b4a2fae19a0f11e617fa08057e7adf_25861_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"bc6ffeab2c0e919e9cfc9edeb1084a63-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/site-migration-from-wordpress-to-hugo/archive-grid.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"14 Nov 2018 3:06am\"\u003e14 Nov 2018 3:06am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI actually couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a decent Wordpress plugin that did this for me exactly, so I wrote my \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/roytang/wp_grid_archive/\"\u003eown plugin\u003c/a\u003e for this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Hugo, I struggled with this a while and was close to figure out when I finally got the approach right. CHeck \u003ca href=\"/archives\"\u003emy archives page\u003c/a\u003e for how it turned out. The upside is I got to become a bit familiar with \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/,\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/,\u003c/a\u003e particularly the way content is parsed and processed in Hugo templates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"custom-shortcodes\"\u003eCustom shortcodes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had some custom-formatted code in Wordpress that wasn\u0026rsquo;t exported properly by the plugin. This required I create some new shortcodes for Hugo and replace the corresponding calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSpoilers. I had only recently added this WP plugin, and only one post was using it so this was straightforward. I created the spoiler shortcode and added some simple jQuery-backed code to toggle the spoiler content. I would have preferred doing this with vanilla JS so as to avoid the jQuery dependency, but I decided to put off learning how to do that for another day.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/categories/magic-the-gathering\"\u003eMTG\u003c/a\u003e Decklists and card links. Individual card links wasn\u0026rsquo;t an issue - I just generated an anchor as needed, and had to clean up some of the pages that used it. The decklist part was more challenging, as it involved a lot of text parsing. I managed to get it working to a point where the decklists were formatted correctly, but individual cards weren\u0026rsquo;t linked, before deciding to give up. The main issue is I haven\u0026rsquo;t figured out how to parse each line to split the card count and the card name, if the card count exists, i.e. \u0026ldquo;3 Lightning Bolt\u0026rdquo;. I considered just adding JavaScript to format the contents post-load, but the current behavior will do for now. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll even revisit the Hugo parsing issue later.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"redirects\"\u003eRedirects\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to minimize changes in the URLs of older content, so the permalinks for the old posts were kept in place. Another issue was the RSS feed, generated at \u003ccode\u003e/index.xml\u003c/code\u003e by Hugo, which I wanted at \u003ccode\u003e/feed/\u003c/code\u003e so that feed readers don\u0026rsquo;t need to be updated. A simple redirect in .htaccess was enough to get this done. I\u0026rsquo;m not much good at regexes, so I had to reference another \u003ca href=\"https://blog.philipphauer.de/moving-wordpress-hugo/\"\u003eblog post\u003c/a\u003e for this one. The RSS feeds for categories/tags has changed, I think that\u0026rsquo;s fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"automatic-deployment\"\u003eAutomatic Deployment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI referenced another \u003ca href=\"https://gomakethings.com/automating-the-deployment-of-your-static-site-with-hugo-and-github/\"\u003eblog post\u003c/a\u003e for setting up automatic deployment. The main difference was my host was Webfaction while his was Digital Ocean, which did cause me a bit of trouble when I was trying to set up a Github webhook to automatically deploy on every push. It turns out Webfaction doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow me to set an env variable in .htaccess to be read by the PHP script (as was in the blog post linked above). It took me a while to figure out this was the issue, so I just gave up on the Github webhook for now and just set a cron job to periodically pull and redeploy the site. I needed the cron job anyway, if I wanted to support future publishing and possibly some form of queueing later on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"comments\"\u003eComments\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLegacy comments from WP are imported directly into the markdown of each page. Future comments are now handled using Disqus. I already had a Disqus account before, I forgot why I stopped using it. That being said, outsourcing the comments makes a lot of sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"limitations\"\u003eLimitations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewe lose the site search for now. There are some workarounds, including Google SiteSearch (I believe it has ads) or building a JSON index and searching on the client-side (seems impractical given the number of posts). I believe I\u0026rsquo;m the only one using the site search anyway, I\u0026rsquo;ll revisit this at another time.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe markdown engine allows raw HTML in the content, but if you have any line breaks in between, your structure breaks, so that required some cleanup\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"theme\"\u003eTheme\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not much of a CSS/site design guy, I\u0026rsquo;m more a \u0026ldquo;find an existing theme and tweak it to your liking\u0026rdquo; guy, so I browsed Hugo\u0026rsquo;s available themes for a while and settled on \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/enten/hyde-y\"\u003eHyde-Y\u003c/a\u003e, which I proceeded to modify a bit, adding a picture to the sidebar and so on. It\u0026rsquo;s simple and clean and straightforward, nothing too fancy.

I\u0026rsquo;ll probably be cleaning up the exported older posts every so often because I\u0026rsquo;m OC that well. The theming/templating turned out to be a bit more complicated than I expected, but I think it was easier to manage than Wordpress. The last time I tried to use a custom blog engine, I got tired of maintaining and upating it so I switched back to Wordpress, hopefully that doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen here. Not having to maintain a web interface is a pretty good indicator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the effort, the great thing is that I did learn a few things, so at the minimum it\u0026rsquo;s already a win:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea bit of GoLang\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehow to create Github Webhooks\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emore .htaccess stuff\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eusage of pathlib.Path in Python3 (no more os.glob for me!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",
