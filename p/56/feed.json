            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI recently found a stash of old DOS games we used to play, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d write about the early days of PC gaming. My PC gaming career (such as it is) started way back in the MS-DOS era. It was an interesting time to be a gamer, to say the least. It was a time when you had to make bootdisks and fiddle around with files like \u003ccode\u003eautoexec.bat\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003ehimem.sys\u003c/code\u003e to make sure your PC booted with the correct configuration required to run your game. I got to become familiar with things like VGA drivers and sound drivers and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think we had our first PC in the household around \u0026lsquo;92 or \u0026lsquo;93, while I was in high school. I have this vague recollection of using some text from the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(video_game)\"\u003efirst \u003cstrong\u003eCivilization\u003c/strong\u003e game\u003c/a\u003e in one of my Social Science reports. Pretty sure Civ 1, as I\u0026rsquo;m still playing the series to this day. I played a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e of the first Civ game, enough to be able to master the highest difficulty level and (with sufficient save scumming), conquer the world with Chariots before Christ is born. The first Civ game was also my first experience at \u0026ldquo;hacking\u0026rdquo; a game so to speak, since many of the configuration options were read from plain text files on the disk. Even the Civilopedia entries came from text files, so I was able to copy them out to use in my report as mentioned above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother mainstay of my early PC gaming years was LucasArts-style adventure games. I think my first exposure to these games was during a high school party back in maybe \u0026lsquo;93 or \u0026lsquo;94. The host had a copy of \u003cstrong\u003eManiac Mansion\u003c/strong\u003e on his PC, and I spent some time playing that before getting stuck at the big door at the top of the stairs because the host had lost the copy protection disk. Within the next year, I had played the sequel game \u003cstrong\u003eDay of the Tentacle\u003c/strong\u003e (to this day I am unsure if I ever finished the first Maniac Mansion though) and the similar Monkey Island games. I must admit that I had a lot more patience then, as these days I haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten far with the current crop of Telltale-led adventure games and the endless trial and error that inevitably arises when you get stuck. (I\u0026rsquo;ve been stuck on Broken Age on PS4 for maybe a year now, I should get that done).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the earlist dungeon crawlers my brother and I played was \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waxworks_(1992_video_game)\"\u003ethe horror game \u003cstrong\u003eWaxworks\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. This was a single player game, but I say \u0026ldquo;my brother and I\u0026rdquo; because we were often too scared to play the game alone. The sharp 90 degree turns meant enemies could jump out of nowhere. I\u0026rsquo;m sure if I played it now I would feel silly, but back then I remember we had tried playing the game at night while the parentals were out, and some baddie jumped out at us in the pyramid level and we went afk at the jump scare and ran out to the nearby sari-sari store. After typing this paragraph, I decided to try running the old copy of Waxworks I still had (you can run old games using \u003ca href=\"https://www.dosbox.com/\"\u003eDOSBox\u003c/a\u003e) and it reminded me that the game had very creepy midi music! Probably contributed a lot to the atmosphere. I don\u0026rsquo;t play horror games anymore nowadays lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#49520fc5ad2d4c8ed479cc83eb6e37e8-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/ancient-pc-gaming/waxworks_hufa0f7d0295fe0441123f40579799f0de_56604_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"Waxworks: The pyramid level was the one we were most familiar with, since it was the first one available.\" title=\"Waxworks: The pyramid level was the one we were most familiar with, since it was the first one available.\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eWaxworks: The pyramid level was the one we were most familiar with, since it was the first one available.

I remember playing RTK2 a little bit, but it was RTK3 that we generally spent a lot of time in (we = me and my brothers and some HS friends). I spent so much time on this game, I could finish the game from a single province in the final scenario (where your opponents were 3 large empires). One of our favorite features in RTK3 was the fact that there was a custom character creator. We had a copy of the game that we passed around with a whole bunch of custom characters named after our HS friends. My brother was a big fan of this feature too, he added a bunch of high-stat custom characters named after himself. Sadly, my only remaining copy of this game only has my brother\u0026rsquo;s custom characters and not the ones me and my HS friends made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#d67f359f83486dfd410f8d65d9de5ea1-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/ancient-pc-gaming/rtk3kerwins_hua9d2390344281f4b0116187418d79546_81263_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"RTK3: He really liked naming characters after himself.

My impression then of the site is that it encouraged insightful, well-written, story-like answers. This was opposed to other Q\u0026amp;A sites like Stackoverflow which encourared concise and clinical answers. This impression was amplified by the 2013 release of a Best of Quora EBook which I thoroughly enjoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2016, during a work hiatus, I started trying to write on Quora as well. \u003ca href=\"https://www.quora.com/profile/Roy-Tang\"\u003eYou can follow me there if you like.\u003c/a\u003e. I found writing on Quora useful as an exercise, it helped me improve on my own writing and to expound my thoughts. I often sought out more open-ended questions so that I could write more, although I wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly successful in that regard. I managed to post quite a few answers back in 2016, and my Quora stats page tells me my answers have collectively gotten 168k views and 608 upvotes as of this writing. Not sure if that\u0026rsquo;s anything to brag about, but I guess it\u0026rsquo;s something?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was tempted to write about Quora because of two things:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThey\u0026rsquo;ve recently \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18124849/quora-100-million-user-hack-name-email-messages\"\u003ebeen hacked\u003c/a\u003e.

There are still a lot of well-written answers, and I still find my Quora Daily Digest emails useful, but given the above two points I will have to re-evaluate how I use Quora in the future. The first thing will probably be to look for a way to export my content!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI must admit being a bit unconcerned with online privacy tracking by the large vendoers (Google, Facebook, etc). I mean, I do tend to use \u003ca href=\"/2008/09/i-claim-my-name/\"\u003emy real name as username\u003c/a\u003e after all, so most everything I do online can be traced back to me. I assume that anything I do on the internet can be figured out by other parties, so if something is important enough to me that it should be kept private, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t go on the internet at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the services provided by Facebook and Google, I accept that they require tracking my data in order to provide those services. For example, a few months ago I made a Protonmail account so I\u0026rsquo;d have a secure email that I can use in place of GMail. But it turns out, I haven\u0026rsquo;t found a good use case for it yet. I use Gmail\u0026rsquo;s search a lot, and ProtonMail is nowhere that robust. Maybe if I were a spy or something, I would consider using ProtonMail, but for now I think for everyday usage the GMail features are an acceptable tradeoff for the fact that they are reading your email data and using it for targetted advertising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also tried using the alternative, privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo, but I was not too happy with the search results I was getting, and I occasionally find it useful to be able to check my search history for stuff I remember finding but could no longer find. Having my search results tailored for me turned out kind of useful too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReading some forum discussions, there are a lot of people who are vehemently against being tracked for the purposes of targetted advertising. I can understand the sentiment, but personally I don\u0026rsquo;t mind targetted advertising because (a) it\u0026rsquo;s marginally better than being bombarded with ads for things you don\u0026rsquo;t actually care about; and (b) I am not easily susceptible to impulse purchases, at least not due to internet ads. I grew up with the free internet, so even if I wasn\u0026rsquo;t using adblock, my brain automatically ignores ads on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be honest, I accept that these companies are tracking my data because I would track my own data if I could. I find it useful to have my own history. An example is location history; I have my phone GPS on all the time, so Google Maps is able to keep a history of where I\u0026rsquo;ve gone everyday. I reference this every so often, because I\u0026rsquo;m forgetful. \u0026ldquo;Where did I go last Wednesday?\u0026rdquo; is a trivial question to answer when the cloud has the data. As a software developer, I could build my own systems to track this myself, but why bother? I use the cloud as an extension of my own memory, which is often fallible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have been starting \u003ca href=\"/2018/03/rethinking-facebook/\"\u003eto wean myself off Facebook\u003c/a\u003e, though that proves difficult due to network effects. But it would probably be more difficult for me to cease usage of my Google account, since I use it for a bunch of cloud stuff. Well, I did get it started by making Firefox my main browser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do understand the use case for privacy. If you\u0026rsquo;re handling any sort of sensitive information or anything dangerous, say as an investigative journalist in a fascist regime, then maybe an extra level of protection is required. So I appreciate the existence of secure alternatives. I recently found \u003ca href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/8sffn7/pc_users_guide_to_privacy/\"\u003ea reddit thread\u003c/a\u003e that had a good summary of the modern online privacy options available. If you want or need online privacy, you have to understand that there\u0026rsquo;s a tradeoff in terms of convenience. You can give up Google or Facebook services or use Tor and VPNs and all those other stuff, but you lose some features too. And maybe that\u0026rsquo;s fine, it\u0026rsquo;s up to you to determine that\u0026rsquo;s acceptable for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Some examples are UI/design, or promo work/sales/marketing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI might also be overwhelmed by how much work there is that needs to be done. I understand making breaking down the work into a list and then just choosing one task at a time until you get something done. Hmm, I guess sometimes doing the work breakdown is one of the things that falls under the first bullet\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esometimes I might also be frustrated by a lack of technical skill in implementation. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking this applies mostly to stuff like writing or drawing, where I feel like my execution or creativity isn\u0026rsquo;t good enough. This frustration can be overcome by practice, but practice risks the first bullet again\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esometimes I\u0026rsquo;ll also lose motivation if the project turns out too difficult or too time-consuming, as if it\u0026rsquo;s not worth the effort. This can be a legitimate reason for dropping a project, as long as I make sure my assessment is rational.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOne of my main problems seems to be that I\u0026rsquo;m easily distracted by new, shiny ideas that come along. That\u0026rsquo;s why reading this comic felt a bit like a personal attack:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.redd.it/48lvp1vv4p121.jpg\" alt=\"\"\u003e via \u003ca href=\"https://reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor\"\u003e/r/ProgrammerHumor\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do have the ability to go into hyperfocus and gain the flow, enough to immerse myself in what I\u0026rsquo;m doing, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t always last, and it\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a double-edged sword, because if something else grabs my attention, there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance I\u0026rsquo;ll hyperfocus on that. (Another edge being of course, I can be so hyperfocused in burns me out).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Slight tangent: When I\u0026rsquo;m in a team project, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty good at getting things done, because (a) there\u0026rsquo;s usually someone else holding me to account and making sure stuff gets done; and (b) there\u0026rsquo;s usually team mates to help take up those parts that I find uninteresting.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t list plain old laziness among the reasons above, though I\u0026rsquo;m surely guilty of that. But I think usually laziness is a symptom of one of these other reasons and me making excuses for not getting stuff done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of these are some demons I need to tame if I really want to become more independent; I guess at least recognizing them is key and compensating for them where necessary, and making sure I only drop projects if I\u0026rsquo;m convinced they\u0026rsquo;re not worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoincidentally relevant webcomic:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003einspiration strikes \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/qihgd0Q8to\"\u003epic.twitter.com/qihgd0Q8to\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u0026mdash; the Awkward Yeti (Nick Seluk) (@theawkwardyeti) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/theawkwardyeti/status/1070082567402110977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eDecember 4, 2018\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e \u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e ",

Instead of people you interact with regularly rating you, it\u0026rsquo;s now some faceless bureaucrat who might have an agenda.

In a system administered by the state and applied universally, you have no choice. Well, I guess you can still be all \u0026ldquo;meh, I don\u0026rsquo;t care\u0026rdquo; and just don\u0026rsquo;t avail of the benefits unlocked by higher ratings, but since it\u0026rsquo;s the state promoting this, it\u0026rsquo;s likely the scope where the ratings matter will only become larger with time\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy is the idea of a rating system inherently creepy? People judge other people all the time. We judge other people by how they look, the clothes they wear, how they behave, where they went to school, what job they have, what kind of car they drive, and so on. And people often do change their own behavior to influence how others judge them. In certain countries, they already have financial rating systems that allow companies to judge you based on your credit history. It\u0026rsquo;s simply a factor in how human societies work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think having a numeric rating system for social behavior feels so off because it attempts to quantify something that we understand to be inherently subjective, and attempts to impose that standard rating system indiscriminately. And a rating attached to each person universally feels like it would be very difficult to shake off. If someone judges you based on your looks or your clothes you can always change them. If all the people in your neighborhood dislike you, you can always move to a new area. But if there\u0026rsquo;s a quantitative rating attached to you in some centralized database somewhere? People who don\u0026rsquo;t know you can judge you instantly, even if they\u0026rsquo;ve never heard of your past indiscretions. The rating would follow you around where ever you go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least financial credit systems are there to promote good financial decisions (since they are used to judge your credit risk). China\u0026rsquo;s social credit system looks like it\u0026rsquo;s designed to promote obedience to the state or adherence to state-preferred behavior, which means reduced freedoms. One can only hope such an experiment fails and does not propagate to other more democratic-leaning countries, but given the recent worldwide trends, I am not too hopeful.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "China is setting up some kind of large-scale \u0026ldquo;social credit system\u0026rdquo; to rank and monitor the behavior of their citizens. Citizens with low scores can get penalized in various ways like being denied travel or access to top-tier schools and so on. It\u0026rsquo;s quite creepy, and the mere idea evokes the dystopian Black Mirror episode \u0026ldquo;Nosedive\u0026rdquo; where people use an app to rate other people.\nChina\u0026rsquo;s social credit system might be even worse than the Black Mirror one because:",

Starting 2010, my blogging activity started to taper off, with less than 60 posts until 2015. I tried to revive the habit around mid-2016, posting at least once a week, but the writing slowed down again around April this year (coinciding with one of the more busy periods for me work-wise). Starting in October I had a bit more free time so I decided to fire on all cylinders again. Instead of the previous 1-2 posts per week I was going for in 2016, this time I would go for posting every day. Not even every weekday, but seven days a week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried this, as an experiment, back in \u003ca href=\"/2006/10/i-will-blog-every-day/\"\u003eOctober of 2006\u003c/a\u003e, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t last the month with the habit (though I did continue to post regularly for the next few years).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is kind of secondhand-blog-linking, but the post [Seth Godin Explains Why You Should Blog Daily] (\u003ca href=\"https://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/seth-godin-explains-why-you-should-blog-daily\"\u003ehttps://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/seth-godin-explains-why-you-should-blog-daily\u003c/a\u003e) explains well the advantages of posting daily:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Everyone should write a blog, every day, even if no one reads it. There’s countless reasons why it’s a good idea and I can’t think of one reason it’s a bad idea.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;If you know you have to write a blog post tomorrow, something in writing, something that will be around 6 months from now, about something in the world, you will start looking for something in the world to to write about. You will seek to notice something interesting and to say something creative about it. Well, isn’t that all we’re looking for? The best practice of generously sharing what you notice about the world is exactly the antidote for your fear.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSeth Godin\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first fear of course, is: do I actually have enough material, enough stuff to write about on a daily basis? The article above mentions that the mere act of committing to daily writing means you will naturally tend towards notcing more things and having more opinions and thus more things to write about. But I was skeptical, since I had tried the regular writing before and it didn\u0026rsquo;t really stick. One thing that helped however was that since 2016 I\u0026rsquo;ve been regularly listing down blog post ideas. I got this idea from \u003ca href=\"https://jamesaltucher.com/2014/05/the-ultimate-guide-for-becoming-an-idea-machine/\"\u003eJames Altucher\u0026rsquo;s post about becoming an idea machine\u003c/a\u003e where he recommend\u0026rsquo;s thinking of 10 ideas daily. I did start out writing 10 blog post ideas every day, but that tapered off after a while because I was only posting a couple of times I week, I had far too many ideas!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot all of those ideas would be good enough to be posts of course. I wrote up a few posts first, creating a buffer of posts that could be scheduled in advance. I started posting daily on the second week of October, and have kept it up since, I\u0026rsquo;m at more than 60 posts now, so the habit has already stuck longer than the last attempt. I find that between the long list of post ideas I already had (some 600+ in total), \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/benefits-of-walking/\"\u003emy daily walks\u003c/a\u003e and the fact that \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/expanding-horizons/\"\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m a voracious internet reader\u003c/a\u003e, it was actually quite easy to maintain a continuous stream of posts to write.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t spend too much time on each post, maybe 30 minutes at most, sometimes much less. On a good day I can knock off up to five posts. I find that most of my recent posts clock in under 1,000 words, which I think is perfectly reasonable. I think my increased participation in internet debates back during the 2016 election period also made me more willing to post opinions online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re writing to become a \u0026ldquo;professional blogger\u0026rdquo; of some sort, or otherwise trying to optimize for engagement or such, \u003ca href=\"https://smartblogger.com/posting-every-day/\"\u003edaily posting might not be such a good idea\u003c/a\u003e. The front page of this blog changes every day, and I don\u0026rsquo;t have a search function at the moment, so it\u0026rsquo;s not straightforward to find something you miss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI of course write mostly for myself, though I do appreciate it when I find out people are reading the blog. I prefer posts that I can look back to in a few years to remember what was going on with me at the time. I try to write about things I\u0026rsquo;m doing, shows I\u0026rsquo;m watching, projects I\u0026rsquo;m trying out, games I\u0026rsquo;m playing, opinions on current events, and generally random thoughts going through my head and so on. I find that the daily writing, like the daily walking, helps improve my thinking processes. And it often encourages me to be a bit more experimental - I can try things out and even if I fail, the floor is that I have a story for a blog post. There is also less pressure for new posts to be super deep or meaningful or otherwise with my daily blogging, there is no room for perfectionism to get in the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t know how long I can keep this up on a daily basis. I\u0026rsquo;ll try to revisit this after a year maybe to see how far I\u0026rsquo;ve gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThe other day \u003ca href=\"/2019/11/daily-walks/\"\u003eI wrote about how I\u0026rsquo;ve been walking on a regular basis recently\u003c/a\u003e. While the regularity and the tracking are fairly recent, I\u0026rsquo;m actually not that much of a stranger to walking as an activity. Even back when I was in high school I would often walk all the way home instead of taking the bus-and-jeep commute route I was supposed to take. It didn\u0026rsquo;t take that much longer, and I often enjoyed the solace (and I got to save a bit of money, even as a child I was quite frugal~). In college, I would regularly walk the couple of kilometers between classes, or from the campus itself to Philcoa. Sometimes, when it was especially hard to commute, I would walk through UP/Teacher\u0026rsquo;s/Sikatuna Village all the way back to our old home in Kamias. I remember doing this once during the aftermath of a terrible storm when there were no jeeps around to take me home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven back then, walking for me was kinda therapeutic. Like I said, I enjoyed the solace. I would often stop at some places and just be at peace for a while. I wrote about this once in an \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/10155666240078912/posts/10152788551883912\"\u003eold facebook post\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a place at the corner of East Avenue and BIR Road in Quezon City. When I was young I would walk to that intersection and wait there to catch a jeepney ride that would take me home. It was often easy to get a ride, no more than a couple of minutes wait. But sometimes I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t flag down a jeep immediately. I would sit there at the base of the lamp post at the corner of East Avenue and BIR Road, and let the noise of the world wash over me for some time. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember contemplating anything specific while I was there or whether I had worries or was sad. I would just sit there and be peaceful and the world would move around me and I would watch the people and the cars pass by and wonder who they were or where they were going. After a while the trance would break, and I would fall back into the real world and tell myself I had to get home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, a side note, checking Google Maps now, that route\u0026rsquo;s distance was a measly 3.7km, a couple of km shorter than my average walking routes these days. Back then it felt like I was walking a lot!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I started working in Ortigas, there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much opportunity for regular walking. I almost always walked the short distance from the office to Megamall, unless it was raining or insanely hot. When traffic was really bad and it was difficult to get a bus ride or a taxi, I sometimes took the opportunity to walk from Ortigas to Cubao, or vice versa (Distance: somewhere around 5-6km). I often said to myself that someday I would walk the whole 13 or so km home, but I never did get that chance. Occasionally I would get deployed to another country for work, and when I did one of the things I would do during my nights there would be \u003ca href=\"/2009/03/sometimes-you-just-go-where-your-feet-take-you/\"\u003eto walk around a lot\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days, as I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned in the other post, I intentionally try to find the time to walk. I don\u0026rsquo;t always find it, but I do most of the time. It\u0026rsquo;s an additional way to burn off stress. When I\u0026rsquo;m feeling angry or frustrated or sad (usually about work-related things), I say to myself, it\u0026rsquo;s time for a walk. And it helps me think. My mind wanders as I walk, coming up with ideas or solutions to problems or unlocking new thoughts or awakening slumbering areas of my brain or just overall improving my creativity. Walking is also a way of being in the present, leaving behind your worries and anxieties and simply taking in the world. I intentionally don\u0026rsquo;t pace myself too quickly lest the walk end too soon, although I am often impatient to get back home. I find walking is quite good for developing patience as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe philosopher Henry David Thoreau said of walking:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think that I cannot preserve my health and spirits, unless I spend four hours a day at least—and it is commonly more than that—sauntering through the woods and over the hills and fields, absolutely free from all worldly engagements. You may safely say, A penny for your thoughts, or a thousand pounds. When sometimes I am reminded that the mechanics and shopkeepers stay in their shops not only all the forenoon, but all the afternoon too, sitting with crossed legs, so many of them—as if the legs were made to sit upon, and not to stand or walk upon—I think that they deserve some credit for not having all committed suicide long ago.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour hours a day seems excessive of course. I have other things to do. And unlike Thoreau, I don\u0026rsquo;t have the benefit of having nearby woods or hills or fields to saunter through. Mine is more of an urban jungle. But I\u0026rsquo;m not much of a naturalist anyway (biology was always my weakest science), and I find there is still much to see as I walk through Metro Manila\u0026rsquo;s uneven streets. People rushing by. Small businesses I hadn\u0026rsquo;t noticed before. A large franchise restaurant that\u0026rsquo;s often empty. A couple quietly holding hands in the dusk. Too many politicians\u0026rsquo; posters. The endless traffic. One time a biker almost got run over by a car. He managed to jump off the bike and landed right beside me on the sidewalk. Sometimes I feel I\u0026rsquo;m not observant enough, I should take more opportunity during these walks to observe more things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSide note: another extra benefit of all this walking is that my sense of distance has improved. I now generally have a sense of roughly how far a kilometer is. This is why I was able to recognize that Manhattan can\u0026rsquo;t be 4km from top to bottom in \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/game-review-marvels-spider-man-for-ps4/\"\u003emy Spider-Man PS4 review\u003c/a\u003e. I walk more than that distance daily!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can see, there are many benefits to walking. So, what are you waiting for? Go take a walk!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "The other day I wrote about how I\u0026rsquo;ve been walking on a regular basis recently. While the regularity and the tracking are fairly recent, I\u0026rsquo;m actually not that much of a stranger to walking as an activity. Even back when I was in high school I would often walk all the way home instead of taking the bus-and-jeep commute route I was supposed to take. It didn\u0026rsquo;t take that much longer, and I often enjoyed the solace (and I got to save a bit of money, even as a child I was quite frugal~).",

My dad used to do this a lot when we were kids (this might explain a lot!). He would say something like \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to go to Taco Beach!\u0026rdquo; because Taco Beach sounds like \u0026ldquo;takubets\u0026rdquo; which is 80s style slang for \u0026ldquo;kubeta\u0026rdquo;, meaning the toilet. (I have never heard anyone else refer to the toilet this way!) Another pun that I got from him was \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the Tagalog for \u0026lsquo;tweeter\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;? Back then, the word tweeter didn\u0026rsquo;t actually get used a lot, but in modern times, I changed it to this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n    On \n    \u003ca href=\"/2009/05/1872502526/\"\u003e\u003ctime datetime=\"2009-05-21 16:21:37\"\u003e21 May 2009 4:21pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n    I wrote:\n    \u003cblockquote\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eRT \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/roytang/\"\u003e@roytang\u003c/a\u003e: ano sa tagalog ang twitter? -\u0026gt; A: \u0026ldquo;Mat matamit\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI wish I had more puns to share here right now, but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to remember them. When I release a pun, it passes from my brain to the world and it belongs to the universe now. In hindsight, maybe whenever I posted a pun, I should have included some kind of hashtag. In my opinion, puns are a gift to the world. They inspire you to think creatively, and being used to making puns developer your wit. Because they are a gift to the world, whenever you think of a pun, it is your responsibility to unleash it upon the world, no matter how terrible you think it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#10a797a99cc4b5ca9bf95cd0b1724bf2-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/no-puns-left-unsaid/no_pun_intended_hubfc0760e5e49ef1b4a3653cef51ec6ab_97946_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"10a797a99cc4b5ca9bf95cd0b1724bf2-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/no-puns-left-unsaid/no_pun_intended.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"1 Dec 2018 1:59am\"\u003e1 Dec 2018 1:59am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll play Fire Emblem Fates just to see this dialogue lol)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePun with intention!
