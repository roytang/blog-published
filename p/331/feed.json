However, thanks to his Drowner of Secrets and 4 other ‘folk, I\u0026rsquo;m down to 8 cards in the library, just enough to survive one more turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe draws his card for the turn and quickly says done with two cards in hand. He\u0026rsquo;s practically dead, so I wonder what he has up his sleeve; I fear removal and I\u0026rsquo;m sure to lose if I don\u0026rsquo;t kill him next turn so I decide to ensure the victory. End of turn, I play Mistbind Clique (planning to champion Turtleshell Changeling).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy opponent perks up, \u0026ldquo;wow, I might actually win this thing.\u0026rdquo; He taps all his lands and plays Broken Ambitions for some large amount I could not possibly play. I\u0026rsquo;m shocked at his play until I remember that Broken Ambitions actually has a clash ability that matters in this matchup. I frown as I flip Island, and my opponent flips Silvergill Douser. I never get past my next draw phase. :/\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1-2 loss vs UW merfolk\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: 2-0 win vs RB\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5: 2-0 win vs RB\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had some fun clashes in that last round.

One more win and I can draw into top eight\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6 I get smashed in the face. 0-2 loss vs I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember what. The guy I fought here is well known as one of the better players around, he often top 8\u0026rsquo;s local tourneys, etc. I have played him maybe 4-5 times and I have never won against him. And it always seems to be a blowout too. Of course it\u0026rsquo;s all superstition, as I have on occasion been able to play evenly with other players who are also very good. I need to learn to improve my mental game so I don\u0026rsquo;t get rattled by specific players. Someday, I will beat him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStandings are up before round 7.

I had the Profane Command in hand and used it up early to take out a blocker so a random 1/1 and 2/2 could attack. I ended up regretting it later as I did not draw any other removal to handle his Aethersnipe and Oaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBah, 4-3. At least it\u0026rsquo;s better than the last PTQ.

I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any good deck ideas this time around (some would argue I never do!), so I played a netdeck. I played the Mannequin deck that originally appeared in US States, as reported by BDM \u003ca href=\"http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/bd304\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. I had to change the board around a bit, I went with:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e4 Nameless Inversion (to help kill black/artifact critters)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e3 Vesuvan Shapeshifter (get random tricks off pickles, and kill legends)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e3 extirpate\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e3 bottle gnomes\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2 damnation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had very minimal testing, but I was fairly sure aggro decks were a cakewalk, and control decks are winnable headaches. The tournament report follows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI register for the tourney, and on the spot I name the deck \u0026ldquo;Manny\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLorywn Inaugurals Tournament Report\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 1 : vs Black/Green Tarmorack\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis matchup is heavily in Manny\u0026rsquo;s favor due to the card advantage. He has a not so good draw and I win game one easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI board +4 Nameless Inversion, -2 Grim Harvest and -2 random guys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two, he attacks third turn with a Treetop Village, I hit it with a nameless inversion and he\u0026rsquo;s down a land. On my turn I play the Shadowmage Infiltrator and it\u0026rsquo;s all uphill from there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2-0 win. Good start!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 2: vs Monoblack\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deck is not monoblack aggro, more of disruption + midsize creatures (Shriekmaw, Crovax the black, Korlash). The matchup seems bad for Manny since I have 8 dead cards (Shadowmage Infiltrator and Shriekmaw) I lose game one to Crovax the black, I didn\u0026rsquo;t even notice that my Epochrasite was dead on arrival. (I pretended that I did that on purpose to suspend it)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI board -4 Shadowmage Infiltrator -4 Shriekmaw -1 Grim Harvest +4 Nameless Inversion +2 Damnation +3 Vesuvan Shapeshifter (to kill Korlash and Crovax)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two goes my way, as he has no creature drops at all for the first six turns or so. He has a warhammer, so any creature that comes out I immediately hit with removal. My offense consists almost entirely of two epochrasites and a faerie conclave. An interesting board position came during this game:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy side: Faerie Conclave, Epochrasite, other lands. No removal in hand, and I\u0026rsquo;m at 17 life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis side: Warhammer, no creatures. Urza\u0026rsquo;s Factory, Mouth of Ronom + 6-7 other lands. He\u0026rsquo;s at five life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swing with Faerie Conclave and Epochrasite, then immediately realize the mistake. I had assumed he would just Ronom the Faerie, but if instead he makes a Factory worker and blocks the Epochrasite I\u0026rsquo;m screwed since I have no removal and he can equip the warhammer next turn to climb back in life. Luckily, he assumes that I do have removal and does not risk taking the two damage from the faerie. I win game 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame 3, we had less than ten minutes left, so I play quickly. However, since I had boarded in removal, my side was now control. He had sided back in most of his creatures so he got the aggro draw. We trade hits for a while, but eventually he gets out a 9/6 Korlash with lifelink (warhammer) and there\u0026rsquo;s no way I can catch up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1-2 loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 3 \u0026ndash; B/R Goblins\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorry to my opponent but this matchup was really easy. Manny\u0026rsquo;s removal and card advantage is more than enough to keep the Goblins in check, and Phyrexian Ironfoot + Epochrasite is really bad for their deck. 2-0 win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 4 \u0026ndash; UGw Shifters\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUG shifters. With the Shapeshifter, Thelonite Hermit and all, + white for blink. I win game 1, he seems to have a bad draw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bring in Shapeshifters of my own to take advantage of his hermits. I lose game two to a Mystic Snake that was blinked 4 times (including flashback).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame three I take a midgame advantage, he has 2 morphs down but is obviously waiting for a second forest to turn the hermit face up. He plays a Birds of Paradise. And I pass my turn without doing anything to it. (Mistake no. 1)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course I attempt to bounce it during his turn (Mistake no. 2). He of course flips the hermit, creates saprolings etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stall off the saps coz I have a lot of ironfoot blockers. I swing with a Shriekmaw. (Mistake no. 3) He of course turns the other morph face up, revealing shapeshifter, copying one of the ironfoot guys. :(\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lost obviously, with those kinds of mistakes it\u0026rsquo;s a wonder I held out so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1-2 loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo 2-2 now. But it\u0026rsquo;s an 8-round tourney, so \u003cstrong\u003emaybe\u003c/strong\u003e I can still make top 8.

I lost to Barbs (he also had a Wisent but that\u0026rsquo;s a blank against me)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame three he gets the Barbs down while we\u0026rsquo;re still at a high enough life. I play Venser to send it back, going down to 4, and on my turn I drop 3 creatures to discourage him from playing it again. It works, he instead drops creatures of his own. I play Profane Command for the win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2-1 win\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 7 \u0026ndash; U/W control\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seems to be permission light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame one, I bring him down to 14 and he plays Akroma off charge lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the first hit (down to 14 life).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy turn I play Infiltrator and Epochrasite comes out of suspend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the next hit (down to 8 life)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swing with Infiltrator, then play two ironfoots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the next hit (down to 2 life)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy turn, Profane Command for 5, opponent loses 5 and all my guys get fear. Nice game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI board in Shapeshifters to deal with Crovax the White and Akroma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two he got out an early Crovax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI play Shapeshifter to kill Crovax. He plays Akroma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI play Mannequin on Shapeshifter. (Opponent: \u0026ldquo;Ano ba yan!\u0026quot;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get out fear guys. He gets out Triskelavus, we start racing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI play Mannequin again, targetting shapeshifter, copying Triskelavus (a Shapeshifter with 3 +1/+1 counters is pretty good)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe plays Disenchant on the Shapeshifter! (Opponent: \u0026ldquo;Ang squatter naman\u0026rdquo;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eventually manage to bounce his triskelavus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe race some more, I win with 3 life remaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2-0 win\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, one more win and possibily top 8! But I look at the standings and I\u0026rsquo;m last among the 5-2s :( Boo! 21th place, too far away. If I win the last round I make top 16 and win three packs. Lose, and I probably still get one pack. Then, it\u0026rsquo;s practically \u0026ldquo;no bearning\u0026rdquo; for me now, I get at least one pack either way. (Yes, this story does not end in a top eight finish, I apologize.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I slack off in round 8. In a matchup where I need to slack off the least \u0026ndash; pickles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 8 \u0026ndash; UB pickles\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0026rsquo;s playing pickles with black instead of the usual white for momentary blink. He has an aggro mode with Ironfoots and Shadowmages, Cryptic Command for permission, Ancestral Visions for card draw. This is the first round I\u0026rsquo;m playing the pickles combo, so I\u0026rsquo;m sorta still stupid (or slacking off, as I said.) What I understand about the pickles matchup is that you have to be careful not to tap out if your opponent has 10-11 mana already \u0026ndash; since he can lock you down at any time (even less for the white version which has blink).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame one I lost to pickles lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI side in +4 Nameless Inversion (Mistake\u0026hellip; should have also brought in +3 Extirpate)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two I lost to pickles lock. Okay, a bit longer story. I lost to pickles lock after making the misplay of bouncing the Brine Elemental so he could delay me one more turn. He had Liliana Vess out \u0026ndash; he was going to get the other half of the combo no matter what. If I had an Extirpate then the bounce was the correct play, as there was already a Brine Elemental in the yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I finish 5-3 with the Mannequin deck, a crappy 32nd place, winning a single booster! In fairness, I got an Auntie\u0026rsquo;s Hovel from that booster, so it\u0026rsquo;s all good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the tournament some people were asking me whether it was difficult to play. I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. Two of the losses I attribute to bad plays on my part, and the monoblack matchup was just bad. After boarding it was probably 50-50 or 60-40 at best. The weakness I can see is the lack of instant speed removal (unless you have a Shriekmaw in the graveyard), so Treetop Villages cause problems. I always board in the Nameless Inversions for decks with Treetops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManabarbs is also very bad for the deck, as you have no permission to stop it, only bounce. At the minimum you will take 4 damage (or 2 damage and wait 3 turns) to bounce the Barbs, then have one turn to try to get back in the game before they cast it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, the Mannequin tricks are awesome and will lead to some devastating draws and plays. But every so often you draw something like 3 Mannequins and a Grim Harvest, with your only creatures being Epochrasite, Phyrexian Ironfoot or Shadowmage, all of which are not that good with the reanimation. Next time I will probably cut 2 Grim Harvest entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext: PTQ KL #2.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Tournament was on Saturday, November 10. Format was Standard. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any good deck ideas this time around (some would argue I never do!), so I played a netdeck. I played the Mannequin deck that originally appeared in US States, as reported by BDM here. I had to change the board around a bit, I went with:\n 4 Nameless Inversion (to help kill black/artifact critters) 3 Vesuvan Shapeshifter (get random tricks off pickles, and kill legends) 3 extirpate 3 bottle gnomes 2 damnation  I had very minimal testing, but I was fairly sure aggro decks were a cakewalk, and control decks are winnable headaches.",

I managed to cast the Horde of Notions only to have it take a Glimmerdust Nap. Of course, I forgot  that I could still activate the Horde of Notions ability to recast Consuming Bonfire on the opposing Mirror Entity. (Yes, I was losing to a mirror entity again.) Instead, I did something really stupid: He had three creatures on the board, I had a 1/1 merfolk, a 1/1 changeling that can give other creatures changeling, and a Thundercloud Shaman in my hand. I figured I could wipe all his creatures if I Thundercloud for 3, so I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etap the changeling to turn my merfolk into a giant and cast the Giant. After casting the Shaman, I immediately realized the problems:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea. One of his creatures was a changeling (wouldn\u0026rsquo;t die to Shaman)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eb. That creature was a Mirror Entity (can prevent all his creatures from dying to Shaman)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pretty much deserved the 17 damage that came my way the next turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, that makes me sad. I\u0026rsquo;m at 0-2 obviously I\u0026rsquo;m pretty much dead. I decided not to drop so I could salvage some wins and maybe learn to actually play better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3: 2-0 win vs R/G\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorst problem was an Epic Proportions\u0026hellip; no wait, that was the previous tournament. I count 58 cards in the opponent\u0026rsquo;s pile shuffle and mention to him that he\u0026rsquo;s over 40. He says \u0026ldquo;Yeah, probably should trim it.\u0026rdquo; and he\u0026rsquo;s right. He\u0026rsquo;s color screwed both games, so easy win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: 2-1 win vs (I forgot what the deck was)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy deck really performed here, giving me so much removal I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even remember what his creatures were. I hit Tarfire, Lash Out and Nameless Inversion and put him on fast clocks. I got him down to one and an evoked Cloudthresher did the job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5: 1-2 loss vs B/G\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe opponent jokes around about his bad deck and wonders how he even got two wins. I lose game 1 to 1/1s and 2/2s, all I had was the Stonybrook Angler.  Game 2 I mulligan to six and he keeps, but he misses the 3rd land drop. I have a Cloudgrown Oak carrying a Runed Stalactite, a five-turn clock. He gets the third land and tries to play Eyeblight\u0026rsquo;s Ending on it and I shake my head. \u0026ldquo;Elf.\u0026rdquo; He gets out a few blockers at 8 and trades two for one with the Oak. I cast the Treefolk Harbinger for Changeling Titan. When the Titan attacks, he tries the Eyeblight\u0026rsquo;s Ending again, and I shake my head again. Right, he scoops and we go to game three. Game three I mulligan to six again, only it\u0026rsquo;s a proper mana screw this time. I barely put up a fight and lose to random dorks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo 2-3 and drop. Quite disappointing, as it seems I\u0026rsquo;m not improving my limited game at all. I still made a suboptimal sealed deck build (was siding in the same six cards every round) and made several play mistakes. I would blame lack of sleep, but obviously I didn\u0026rsquo;t have my A-game this time around. Hopefully, the next few PTQs are better for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eOne of the qualities that I think make a really good software developer is the ability to solve difficult technical problems. Unless you\u0026rsquo;re the sort of software developer who just sells the same piece of software over and over again, at some point in time you\u0026rsquo;ll to need to find out how to implement some feature you\u0026rsquo;ve never tried before. Or you\u0026rsquo;ll hit a problem that\u0026rsquo;s not documented in any official docs and you need that critical functionality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypically, there are two approaches: Research and Experimentation. Today I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about Research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResearch means the internet of course, but what part of it exactly? At first of course you should search for the information yourself, using Google usually. But often if the technology is new or the problem is esoteric enough, you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to find what you need (or you would need very precise keywords). The second step is to ask for expert help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an example, some recent postings of mine on a Microsoft-related forum (I was trying to figure out how to do an addin for Microsoft Office) elicited a mail from someone with the subject \u0026ldquo;Hello, I need ur help\u0026rdquo;. I was feeling a bit helpful, so I gave him a reply. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it was smarmy or anything, but I also gave him some additional advice, and I quote:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Also I have some additional free advice for you:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour email looks like SPAM. I was about to mark it as spam when I happened to spot the phrase \u0026ldquo;MSWord Addins\u0026rdquo; in the body. Learn to write better email subjects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSending personal emails to people asking for help isn\u0026rsquo;t a very good way to solve technical issues. Most people are likely to ignore such requests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou might want to read this: \u003ca href=\"http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html%22\"\u003ehttp://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html\u0026quot;\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not trying to deride him or anything, god knows I\u0026rsquo;ve sent my own share of personal email requests for help before. And it\u0026rsquo;s correct that they are often ignored, so it\u0026rsquo;s not very effective. I think the most effective way, as mentioned in the ESR link above, is to use forums. Specifically, don\u0026rsquo;t look for forums where newbies like us ask questions; use forums where experts congregate. By forum, I\u0026rsquo;m not strictly referring to bulletin boards, it also includes mailing-lists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow to find the best forums? It depends on what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best thing is if your subject matter of choice has an active community of developers interested or passionate about the product. Google about the subject matter and see what forums or mailing lists are popular. An example would be \u003ca href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/\"\u003eAdobe Flex\u003c/a\u003e, which I started reading up on a while back for a work-related issue. Finding help on Adobe Flex is really easy. There\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/flexcoders/\"\u003ea very active mailing-list\u003c/a\u003e, where you can even expect replies from some of the guys who actually made Flex. If you visit some of the active blogs about Flex (there are a lot), many of them will reference the flexcoders mailing list so you know you can get a lot of good help there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNon-official forums are better because people are more likely to be passionate than paid reps. One problem I often encounter when researching is Microsoft. Whenever I search for Microsoft-related stuff inevitably sources dry up \u0026ndash; there are literally hundreds of unofficial forums where many newbies ask questions. Now, what to recognize about Microsoft is that they have hundreds (maybe thousands?) of experts called MVPs in every different Microsoft technology. These MVPs are recognized by Microsoft for providing unofficial support to the community. So, the trick is to figure out where you can post such that a good number of MVPs will see your question and possibly respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what the best place would be, but the one that I have gotten the most results from would be \u003ca href=\"http://groups.google.com/\"\u003eGoogle Groups\u003c/a\u003e. Any of the microsoft.public.* ones. I guess Google Groups would be pretty good for non-MS topics as well, but I find that inevitably my MS searches lead me here. For Office-related questions at least there are often one or two MVPs who reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother resource I have used on occasion: the forums at \u003ca href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/\"\u003eJoel on Software\u003c/a\u003e. A lot of very good developers frequent those forums, so even if no one can answer your questions, they might be able to point you in the right direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond forums, well good luck. At this point you might need to resort to personal emails, although I have personally never gotten any success from such a method. Or you probably have to resort to detailed experimentation or even \u0026ndash; god forbid \u0026ndash; giving up.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Seriously, I should\u0026rsquo;ve probably at least splashed for the Tarfire and the Consuming Bonfire. That would\u0026rsquo;ve been a better choice than Rootgrapple. (To be fair, the Treefolk Instant actually took out Garuk for me. I still lost that game though.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing blinded by shiny stuff. I saw the 2 Goldmeadow Stalwarts and the Thoughtweft Trio and just had to go Kithkin. I saw the Timber Protector and just forced my treefolk in there. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if my second choice (UBR Faerie/Goblin) would have been better, but I definitely didn\u0026rsquo;t give enough consideration to the other cards. I forced the Kithkin/Treefolk build too much, trying to put in a lot of Kithkin to maximize the Stalwarts I ended up with too many 2/x dorks that didn\u0026rsquo;t do anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot having a good plan.Yeah. Evasion guys would have been a good plan. A bunch of small Kithkin guys? Not so much. Even though I could get the awesome double Stalwart opening (I never did), it\u0026rsquo;s not consistent enough. Trying to win in Sealed by rushing small dudes isn\u0026rsquo;t a very reliable since it\u0026rsquo;s more likely for them to have midrange guys as well. I had a few fatties yeah, but in n environment with 2 common tappers, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t very effective. Which reminds me\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot having a way to kill tappers!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot paying attention to game state. In one game, I had a creature with a Stalactite equipped and I attacked into Protection from Elf guy. I had several misplays in round 3 where we stalled with like 15 creatures on each side of the board. My opponent put down a Mulldrifter and equipped a Runed Stalactite, while he had an Imperious Perfect in play. I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize until too late that it got +1/+1 from the Perfect.  My opponent wanted to create an elf token and he was searching for a good item to use. I gave him one of my dice to use and only later realized that I was actually using it to track my own Kithkin tokens! By then it was too late as I would\u0026rsquo;ve lost anyway on the next alpha strike, but maybe having those tokens on my side could have convinced me to make my own alpha strike as it was a close game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpatience.In round 3 again, I was facing a creature stall on game one and I made a massive mistake, attacking with two Treefolk and two Springjacks hoping I could get at least one double-strike off the clash. Obviously I got none, and I lost two Springjacks for nothing. I should\u0026rsquo;ve just waited out the stall instead of being impatient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make so many mistakes like this which make me question why some people think I\u0026rsquo;m a good limited player. I\u0026rsquo;m not — I just had a good streak for a while that brought my rating up to 1800 but it will surely drop down now. I\u0026rsquo;m glad I decided not to even consider going to GP:Bangkok as I\u0026rsquo;m obviously not yet ready. Luckily there are 4 Kuala Lumpur PTQs scheduled for the Philippines, all of them Lorwyn Sealed of course, giving me a chance to learn from my mistakes and make a comeback.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass for a few days now; the controls are purely-stylus driven so my wrist aches a bit after a few hours of play.

This post is about the original Legend of Zelda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first time I played the game, I was able to borrow some sort of faulty and/or bootleg copy that wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to save games. Stupid right? Well, it could save as long as the console wasn\u0026rsquo;t powered off, so you could still progress a bit. So in theory, with a single marathon gaming session, I could\u0026rsquo;ve finished the game. The thing is, during those days my dad didn\u0026rsquo;t like having us play too much video games. At most he\u0026rsquo;d let us play maybe 1-2 hours at a time. On weekends. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there\u0026rsquo;s some sort of speed run where some hardcore dude finished the Legend of Zelda in like fifteen minutes, but no way I would\u0026rsquo;ve been able to do that as a kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, that limitation became a sort of challenge. We tried getting as far ahead in the game as we could within what time we had. As kids that day were wont to do, my brother and I memorized the heck out of the Zelda world map. Up to this day, from muscle memory alone, looking at a random overworld Zelda screen I could point if any trees or cliff walls could be burned or blasted to reveal a secret. (The dungeons were another matter, since 90% of the game time was spent in the overworld, I was far more familiar with it.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, we were able to borrow a decent (read: able to save!) copy, and the quest to beat the game began in earnest. Of course, given our previous time-limited trials, we were well familiar with the game, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know how long it took us to defeat the mad sorcerer Gannon and free Princess Zelda, but I have no memory of it being particularly difficult, so I suppose it was not a long period. Besides, we would have needed to return the cartridge eventually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite beating the game, we didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to grow tired of it. Sometimes I felt like we craved the dungeon-crawling even more. Through friends who actually had money to buy gaming magazines, we found out about the second quest. We would borrow the cartridge again, and eventually beat the second quest as well. Bored but still immersed in the game, we would then proceed to try various challenges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I wonder if we can beat the game without getting the sword?\u0026rdquo; Well, no. The fourth dungeon boss (two-headed dragon) requires a sword to defeat. Of course we just did the next best thing \u0026ndash; we beat the first three dungeons without getting the wooden sword; Boomerangs, Bombs and Candles were enough for us!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I wonder if we can beat the game without getting additional Heart Containers?\u0026rdquo; This one was far more difficult than the other one, as staying at three hearts meant instant death if you took a hit in the later dungeons. Eventually we realized it was theoretically possible to finish the game with less than three hearts, given that there were rooms that could take away a Heart Container. My memories are fuzzy on this one, so I don\u0026rsquo;t know if we actually fulfilled this challenge. I\u0026rsquo;m sure we whiled away a few hours trying it out though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure when we eventually grew tired of the game and stopped borrowing it. But the Zelda overworld theme music was pretty much burned into our memories. The music is familiar even to my second youngest brother, who could not have been more than three years old at the time we were playing the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the original Zelda, I eventually finished Link to the Past on the SNES, then skipping out on the N64/Gamecube/Game Boy generation of Zelda games since I didn\u0026rsquo;t have those consoles. Of course I could play those games on an emulator, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t really the same thing. An emulator\u0026rsquo;s save/load game state was far too powerful for one to enjoy the game. Holding the NDS in my hands and playing the Phantom Hourglass brings back childhood memories of walking through unforgiving dungeons and defeating vicious bosses with just enough life to stay alive; a single misstep or badly timed sword thrust would destroy hours of progress \n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnotebase-1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e\n.

with this sealed deck, a bit disappointed too coz I thought the pool was really good (I had a Wrath!

One turn from losing to two black creatures with me having only one non-black blocker, I said, \u0026ldquo;I have so much removal in this deck, surely I will draw one now.\u0026rdquo; And I did, I got Shriekmaw. :/ I\u0026rsquo;m always disappointed when I get my loss in a Pre-release, I haven\u0026rsquo;t won a pre-release shirt since Time Spiral!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, the set is fun, the tribal implementation seems really good. (Not sure how it compares to Onslaught, I have no memory of Onslaught limited, although I\u0026rsquo;m sure we played it a bit back then as I have the cards to prove it). The Changelings are great; the more you have in your sealed pool, the stronger the pool becomes as you have more options. I was sad that I only got two shapeshifters. Clash is stupidly fun. You seldom win, but it\u0026rsquo;s exciting! Surely Spikes won\u0026rsquo;t like the mechanic, I guess it\u0026rsquo;s more of a Timmy thing. Well, I guess it wasn\u0026rsquo;t fun for that guy I fought who drew something like 12 or 14 cards of Hoarder\u0026rsquo;s Greed. I just kept a land on top to keep him going. Yeah, I won that one\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to play again today, but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have gotten there in time I think. I hope we get more limited Lorwyn events.

More likely, it\u0026rsquo;s going to die to a common like Oblivion Ring. However, Ajani is still pretty good in limited, due to that very nice special move: you play her on turn 4 with 2-3 creatures on the board, pump them once, then swing. Next turn, play another creature or so, pump, swing. Sooner or later, all your guys are bigger than his guys. Also, if you\u0026rsquo;re dying to some stupid 1/1 evasion guy, just gain 2 life a turn.

The other two abilities require you to build your deck around them \u0026ndash; you\u0026rsquo;re not going to use that finisher unless you\u0026rsquo;re actually a mill deck, and the normal ability smells of Owling Mine to me. In limited, just build a defensive deck around him and keep pumping up loyalty. Resolving the finishing move will surely win you the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLiliana Vess\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3BB\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlaneswalker \u0026ndash; Liliana\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e+1: Target player discards a card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-2: Search your library for a card, then shuffle your library and put that card on top of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-8: Put all creature cards in all graveyards into play under your control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoyalty: 5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy take:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, Liliana, first among equals. Well, first to be previewed anyway. The finisher will win you games in Limited \u0026ndash; but only after much blood has already been spilled. The special move on the other hand, pulls out all your other bombs from your deck (hope you had a few!) The normal move is meh in both Limited and Constructed \u0026ndash; paying 5 for a repeating single discard effect isn\u0026rsquo;t really that good. For Constructed, her finisher has a strange synergy with Jace Beleren\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip; populate the graveyards, then animate \u0026lsquo;em all under my control. Well, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty good with Damnation as well. A bit of a \u0026ldquo;win more\u0026rdquo; card, if you live long enough to get Liliana online, you\u0026rsquo;re probably a control deck and you\u0026rsquo;re already winning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChandra Nalaar\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3RR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlaneswalker \u0026ndash; Chandra\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e+1: Chandra Nalaar deals 1 damage to target player.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-X: Chandra Nalaar deals X damage to target creature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-8: Chandra Nalaar deals 10 damage to target player and each creature he or she controls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoyalty: 6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy take:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChandra\u0026rsquo;s card looks awesome, let me get that out of the way. People will collect her just for that. That 6 loyalty there is really good as well. Slam this down in limited and make sure you can defend her for two turns = you win the game. Or, in more dire times, just take down a 6/6 guy for five mana. In Constructed, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what deck would take her, as burn doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be very strong in Lorwyn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGarruk Wildspeaker\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2GG\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlaneswalker \u0026ndash; Garruk\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e+1: Untap two target lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-1: Put a 3/3 green Beast creature token into play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-4: Creatures you control get +3/+3 and trample until end of turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoyalty: 3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy take:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy favorite is the green one of course. Garruk compares favorably with Call of the Herd. Play him, and immediately make a 3/3 to defend him. If he takes an Incinerate, that\u0026rsquo;s fine, you still have the token you made. If not\u0026hellip; wow, more free Beasts! I\u0026rsquo;d use him this way in either Limited or Constructed. In fact, I can build a green deck just starting with 4 Call of the Herd 4 Garruk Wildspeaker\u0026hellip; that\u0026rsquo;s at least 20 creatures right there. Another application would be to use the normal move to accelerate into early 6-7 casting cost threats, butI like 3/3s better. The finisher is decent, and pretty good in Limited. It has a disadvantage over an actual Overrun in that your opponent can see it coming, but if you\u0026rsquo;re planning to use it then you\u0026rsquo;re probably winning anyway; in a defensive board the 3/3 beast is a better idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The later books branch from the original, with the Speaker for the Dead arc leaning towards philosophical meanings of life in outer space, while the Shadow series of books focus more on political and strategic stuff on Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Speaker for the Dead branch (Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, Children of the Mind), Card\u0026rsquo;s characters are usually placed in a series of moral and ethical dilemmas presented by the various sci-fi elements presented: metaphysical discoveries, sentient alien races, etc. The reader is really drawn in to the character\u0026rsquo;s situations, making the books quite the page turner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Shadow branch (Ender\u0026rsquo;s Shadow, Shadow of the Hegemon, Shadow Puppets, and I have yet to read Shadow Giants) focuses less on the moral decisions, but more of political or military-related issues in a world divided after the defeat of the alien invaders. The story focuses on what happens to Ender\u0026rsquo;s companions after they return to Earth, and seem to be leading up to how Ender\u0026rsquo;s brother Peter eventually became the leader of the world. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit disappointing that Peter is so stupid in Shadow Puppets though, I hope he\u0026rsquo;s better in the next book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe series is awesome overall, and I look forward to the continuation; supposedly Card is writing a sequel that will tie both branches together.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Obviously, the black was too strong to be just a small splash as I wanted. Maybe green should have been the splash? I often ended up boarding +2 swamp +1 sudden death +1 dark withering -2 forest -1 citanul woodreaders -1 thallid germinator. I really like that sliver linear I had going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst round was against a guy playing UGR, he had Call of the Herd which was annoying. He had in both games one and three, and I practically lost to it. Game two I won the back of turn two Gemhide, turn three Bonesplitter and he missed the third land drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1: 1-2 loss vs UGR Call of the Herd\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond round was against a famous local player who won a very big tourney recently (yeah, I try to avoid mentioning names). We were playing the same colors, but I had more removal (obviously). I even had to kill a clockwork hydra twice in two turns. I won in two. This guy eventually made top eight though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2: 2-0 win vs BGR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird round was against a teachings deck. He had a lot of fun instants to teach for \u0026ndash; Dead / Gone, Piracy Charm, Cancel. And Mystic Speculation gave him a way to find the cards he really needed. He stabilized early in game one and won. In game two, I was at 5, he had three creatures (Bogardan Rager, the blue Harrow spellshaper and Firefright Mage) on the board, and had cast Mystic Speculation three times during his turn, so there was a good chance he had what he needed to take me down. He was at 15, I took something like 5-10 minutes with two-headed sliver, sedge sliver, a morph (Gathan Raiders, I have 1 card in hand) and 4 kobolds, computing if I had enough to kill him with Tromp. I knew he had a dead/gone in hand (he tutored for it) and had 3 mana open. I cast Tromp. It resolves. He\u0026rsquo;ll probably bounce the Sedge, that leaves me with a total of 22 damage versus 7 toughness on the board \u0026ndash; just enough to kill. I swing. He blocks. I unmorph the raiders. He counts, then counts again, then shuffles up for game 3. Game three was a heartbreaker \u0026ndash; I had aggro\u0026rsquo;d him down to 2 before he stabilized, and I had around three turns to draw the Orcish Cannonade that would end the game, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t. I tried playing the Scourge to finish him, but he had the Cancel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3: 1-2 loss vs RU Teachings\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a good start in a six-round tournament. :/\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound four was against a guy I was sitting with during deck construction. I knew his deck had a ton of removal, but I also knew he had a vulnerable land mix. So I just had to aggro early to win. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the details, but I lost game 1 and my game 2 notes show I took him down from seventeen in one swing O_o\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: 2-1 win vs RB control\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound five against green/red. Game one I\u0026rsquo;m about to win so I try to Death Rattle a Baloth. I realize it won\u0026rsquo;t work though, and hold off. But my opponent calls a judge on me. The judge rules that I need to choose another legal target, the only one being my own Sedge Sliver. I believe that this is an incorrect ruling and to avoid it, I will always declare my targets first before paying costs next time. I shrug and set it aside, and he stabilizes and I lose the game. I\u0026rsquo;m a bit ticked off of course, and he loses the next two games to my merciless aggro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5: 2-1 win vs RG\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m number ten! A win brings me into the top eight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound six vs an old-time Magic player. He\u0026rsquo;s always around at tournaments and generally a nice guy. His deck is black/red and chock-full of removal, creatures basically don\u0026rsquo;t stay long on our board. I lose game one, no obvious misplays. Game two, I\u0026rsquo;m ahead on racing, but then he drops a Kaervek the Merciless! All I have in hand is a Dark Withering\u0026hellip; but that can\u0026rsquo;t touch Kaervek. I draw a Dustwasp and take the five damage, going down to four, hoping the flyer will be enough to raise him. Next turn he Dread Returns an Emberwilde Augur and plays another creature. I can\u0026rsquo;t race those guys, so I just pass the turn. During his upkeep, he tosses the Goblin at me and shows the Ghostfire. GG.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake his hand and wish him luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6: 2-0 loss vs BR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finish 16th, winning 3 PLC packs, of course with nothing spectacular in them.

I tried preparing a deck for block but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t come up with anything consistent enough. Lazily, I just picked up the Standard Rakdos deck the day before the tourney, tweaked the sideboard for the inevitable TarmoRack decks (-4 Bottle Gnomes +4 Dodecapod). I lacked a 15th sideboard card, so I toss in a random Seize the Soul. (I need to go to the office really early in order to be able to play)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound one was a guy I never met before (it happens). I can tell from his sleeves and the Akroma life counter that he\u0026rsquo;s no newbie though, so I set aside any assumptions and sit down to play. He wins the roll and leads with a plains. Turns out he\u0026rsquo;s some sort of B/W midrange deck. I remember he had Necrotic Slivers, I forget what else. He has land problems and I burn him out quickly game one, and while sideboarding for game two his comments are all \u0026ldquo;Grabe, keso deck!\u0026rdquo; I haven\u0026rsquo;t actually heard anyone refer to burn as \u0026ldquo;keso\u0026rdquo; for a while now, and I guess he\u0026rsquo;s not familiar with the current metagame where Rakdos is popular. We start game two and I hit an early Cyroclasm, giving him further land troubles, and I burn him out again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1: 2-0 win vs B/W midrange\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound two is against one of the local judge/players, so I expect a tough match. He\u0026rsquo;s playing GWb, some sort of beach house variant. The Loxodon Hierarchs are annoying and lost game one to a Troll with a Hammer. I don\u0026rsquo;t have Rain of Gores, so my board is just Cryoclasms and Slaughter Pacts. Game two I keep him on the ropes, but he starts to gain control. Eventually he thinks he\u0026rsquo;s stabilized at 9 and goes for the aggro, dropping a Watchwolf and a Troll on the same turn. End of his turn, I calmly put the fourth charge counter on my Molten Slagheap. Untap. Draw. Play a land. Demonfire for 9. Game three he mulligans to five, but opens with the annoying Llanowar Reborn into 4/4 Watchwolf, all I have is a random 2/2 dork. He takes me down to 8 before laying a Hierarch. End of turn: Hit, he sacrifices the Watchwolf. I play a Solifuge and have it standby to block. He declines to attack with his Hierarch. My turn, I char it and swing for six. He draws and has nothing. I draw a second Solifuge and win the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2: 2-1 win vs GWb midrange\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound three was vs Red/Green Greater Goyf. I figured it to be a bad matchup, I was right. I lost 2-0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3: 2-0 loss vs R/G Greater Goyf\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound four was U/B Teachings. I had playtested with this guy during the Philippine Open, where we both had the exact same decks. I won that time, and I won this time too, despite getting hit by a Haunting Hymn for four. U/B control is a dog to Rakdos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: 2-0 win vs UB Teachings Control\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finished my round quickly so I took a look at the top tables. The guy who beat me last round was beating up another Rakdos player. The Rakdos guy lost, and I found myself paired against him in round five. I brought up the Greater Goyf matchup. We agree that it\u0026rsquo;s really bad, as even the common Mogg War Marshall is already a disadvantage for Rakdos. We shuffle up and get going. The Rakdos mirror is mainly luck-based, it depends on whose deck decides to be more consistent. I\u0026rsquo;m glad I\u0026rsquo;m lucky, topdecking Solifuges in both games to get the win. His Solifuges never made an appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5: 2-0 win vs BR Rakdos\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound six we sit at the table and pass our decks for the cut when one of the judges stops us. \u0026ldquo;Table 24? Deck check.\u0026rdquo; Wow, my first deck check. We get our decks back without incident and get a five minute time extension. Not that we\u0026rsquo;d need it. Turns out my opponent is playing BG TarmoRack. I get beat up in game one and we proceed to sideboarding. I smile knowing that I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to use those Dodecapods I boarded in at the last minute. I control the second game on the back of the awesome Seize the Soul and a Withered Wretch keeping his Goyf down. He tries to stabilize with a Smallpox when I only have a Rakdos Guildmage, but I show him the Dodecapod. Game three he mulligans down to five but has the Rack + Goyf start. We trade creatures and eventually get into a state where we\u0026rsquo;re both low on life and on topdeck mode. Again, glad I\u0026rsquo;m lucky as I draw the Demonfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6: 2-1 win vs BG TarmoRack\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound seven, I\u0026rsquo;m 3rd in the rankings. No point playing as the prize is the same for first to fourth place (Lorwyn Prerelease Pass), so I offer the ID. He declines, says he hopes to get his friend into the top four. I shrug and start shuffling up. He starts with Island. I cheer inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 7: 2-0 win vs UB Pickles\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal record: 6-1, and I finish first. Yeah, feels good to be winning, even if there were only around forty players in the Standard portion hehe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get to play in the Prerelease for free 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "This weekend was the first of three \u0026ldquo;Pre-Lorwyn Triple Treats\u0026rdquo; at Neutral Ground, featuring Saturdays with three tournaments: one each of Standard, Block Constructed and Legacy. I tried preparing a deck for block but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t come up with anything consistent enough. Lazily, I just picked up the Standard Rakdos deck the day before the tourney, tweaked the sideboard for the inevitable TarmoRack decks (-4 Bottle Gnomes +4 Dodecapod). I lacked a 15th sideboard card, so I toss in a random Seize the Soul.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eYeah, I actually did play at the Standard Open at Trinoma Mall a couple of weekends ago, but my performance was so piss-poor I didn\u0026rsquo;t bother writing a report. Long and short of it, I played Rakdos, but didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to look for Rain of Gores for the board. They would have really helped against the two Angelfire losses I got in rounds 3 and 5, including the one where the opponent drew all four Lightning Helixes :/ The decks record against Angelfire decks is something 1-3 I believe. Good ol\u0026rsquo; Dark Confidant even dealt me 20 damage in one game. I think I had the Hit/Run + Dark Confidant thing happen to me twice. Anyway, after an additional rounds 6 loss to MGA, I just packed it in and went home to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this report is not about that disaster at the Philippine Open, this is about a tournament I actually believed I was better suited for. GPT Bangkok \u0026ndash; the format is Time Spiral block Sealed Deck. Since Invasion Block, I\u0026rsquo;ve always been more of a casual limited player (isn\u0026rsquo;t that weird?), opening boxes and playing drafts with some friends in a casual atmosphere usually punctuated by random late-night trips to Wendy\u0026rsquo;s. And I\u0026rsquo;ve always loved Sealed Deck, because it\u0026rsquo;s a lot more \u0026ldquo;casual\u0026rdquo; than draft where in addition to the usual skill-testers of deck construction and actual gameplay, there\u0026rsquo;s the added pressure of having to choose what cards will be in your pool! Sealed deck is nice and easy. I heard one player remark that Sealed Deck is more luck than skill, since how well you perform largely depends on what bombs you open. That\u0026rsquo;s more or less true, but I\u0026rsquo;ve developed a special ability I like to call \u0026ldquo;the ability to win without bombs.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI came to the tournament with my usual lack of sleep and a bit of a cold, which would only get worse as the day worsened.

instead of the main, but what can I say? I missed it, and I really should have gone eighteen lands, as I knew well and good that missing the 3rd land drop was akin to death in this format. Every game, I boarded in +1 Sudden Shock +1 Swamp for -1 Merfolk Thaumaturgist, -1 Dunerider Outlaw. I was so used to it that in one game where my opponent was at one life, I cast Teachings hoping to finish him off with the Sudden Shock, only to realize it was still game one and the burn spell was still in the board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound one I\u0026rsquo;m paired with one of the few female players in the local Magic community, sporting a black/red deck. Game one, she only has a Keldon Halberdier suspended on turn 2 and nothing else. I hit my drops, use the Midnight Charm on the Halberdier and take the game easily. She dominates a long game two with a Sengir Nosferatu. I decide to save the Sudden Shock for that bat. Time is called for game 3, but by then I\u0026rsquo;ve already stripped her hand with a backbreaking Haunting Hymn for four and I have dominating fliers on the board, and I win on turn 3 of extra time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1: 2-1 win vs BR Sengir Nosferatu (yeah, I name decks by their bombs)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2, my opponent was red/white and his bomb was Angel of Salvation (everyone has a bomb except me). Game 1 is me going \u0026ldquo;Haunting Hymn for the win!\u0026rdquo; Game 2 I see his bomb for the first time and proceed to get squashed by it. Game 3, I manage to off the Angel, having just enough swamps to Tendrils for five (including a Swamp created by the Cyclopean Giant) I squeak off a win in game 3 after we were both in topdeck mode and I drew a flier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2: 2-1 win vs RW Angel of Salvation\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3 is versus a guy with what appears to be a four color deck. His deck is solid, but he played a friend of mine in the previous round, so I know what his bomb is \u0026ndash; Oros the Avenger. I win game one on the back of Haunting Hymn again, and game 2Oros makes his first appearance. I was prepared though, and immediately locked him down with Second Wind. I\u0026rsquo;m on the defensive end for a bit, but I pull out the win eventually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3: 2-0 win vs BRUw Oros the Avenger\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy this time, my cold is starting to get really bad and I seriously need to get more tissues. The airconditioned mall is also badly affecting my health despite the large crowd. My round 4 opponent is one of the higher-ranked limted players in the country. I\u0026rsquo;ve played against him several times before and have never won. Game one we got into some confusion as to who actually played or drew. He said he\u0026rsquo;d draw, but proceeded to lay a Plains before my first turn. I shrugged and just let it go, which was a mistake. Now that I think about, he probably effectively played and drew in that game. By game two, I\u0026rsquo;m wondering if he thinks all my nose-wiping with my hand towel is really icky. Anyway, I lost to his bomb in two games \u0026ndash; Sacred Mesa. I have no answer in my colors, but I listed the Saltcrusted Steppes and the Molder in my sideboard because I wonder if I should have just boarder an off-color answer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: 0-2 loss vs GW Sacred Mesa\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finished early so I wander around for a while. One of the local judges, apparently bored, has been trying to figure out how to make an origami paper crane, to no avail. We laugh a bit as his badly-mangled piece of paper. Another player tries to help but frankly, I think his attempts are closer to making a Vampire Bat than a crane, lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound five and I\u0026rsquo;m at 3-1. Need two more wins for shot at top eight. I play against a red-green deck, and my Infiltrator goes the distance in both games, carrying me to victory. Wheneverhe finally draws an answer to the Infiltrator (usually an Assassinate) he smacks it down hard in annoyance. Sorry man, them\u0026rsquo;s the breaks. I knew from watching previous rounds that his bomb was Sprout Swarm, but it never came up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5: 2-0 win vs RGB Sprout Swarm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the match, I notice the judge who was previously doing the paper crane on our table, this time trying to build a card castle from basic lands. He must be really bored. Apparently the head judge challenged him to do it. Out of frustration, he gets some scotch tape and starts using it while the head judge isn\u0026rsquo;t looking. Sadly, he can\u0026rsquo;t get a tall enough castle stable even while cheating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore round six, standings are posted, which means the tournament is actually only six rounds instead of the seven I assumed. The standings put me at #4, and I\u0026rsquo;m paired with the #2 guy. We ID into the top 8.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYay! My first GPT top 8. Top eight draft starts and it\u0026rsquo;s my first time drafting TPF irl. And now my weakness is revealed to the Magic community: I completely suck at physically opening boosters. I need to borrow a pair of scissors from the judges table. Obviously, I\u0026rsquo;m stupid at drafting, and the guy to my left doesn\u0026rsquo;t have time to play so he\u0026rsquo;s just rare drafting. Despite my newbness (and trying hard not to be a Nosy Goblin), I manage to scrounge together a servicable G/R draft deck (Too lazy to list it here)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound seven starts and I\u0026rsquo;m paired against a local player/judge. Game one, I start off slow, but a Herd Gnarr powered by some Cyclical Evolution eventually drops him to six. He goes all in with his creatures next turn, dropping me to five and leaving only a Watcher Sliver to block. I topdeck into my third forest and play the Groundbreaker in my hand, going in for ten points of damage, six of it trample. He has no outs, so we shuffle up for game two. At this point, one of the judges stops the match and informs my opponent that his registered deck is only 35 cards. That\u0026rsquo;s a game loss, so I immediately win the round. I feel really bad about this win \u0026ndash; the reason my opponent had misregistered is that the judge saw that I had finished registering early (I always finish early) and was rushing my opponent so the match could be started. I guess it wasn\u0026rsquo;t my fault but still, not a fun way to win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTop four, everyone agrees to split the prize packs. That would give me half a box of Future Sight \u0026ndash; not bad for a day\u0026rsquo;s work\u0026hellip; er, play. The remaining matches need to be played out to see who gets the 3 byes to GP Bangkok. Since (a) I\u0026rsquo;m a nice guy and (b) I\u0026rsquo;m not likely to go to Bangkok just to scrub out and (c) I really wasn\u0026rsquo;t feeling very well at that point and wanted to go home, I just accepted the half a box and scooped to my top four opponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is still my best finish ever, and it follows the historical trend \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;ve still never won more than five matches in a tournament. Still, it felt good to place well, especially after my recent string of bad Constructed performances. There are more GPTs this month, but they\u0026rsquo;re on Sundays, and I don\u0026rsquo;t like playing on Sundays, so probably I will try my luck again in Constructed until Lorwyn prereleases roll around.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Yeah, I actually did play at the Standard Open at Trinoma Mall a couple of weekends ago, but my performance was so piss-poor I didn\u0026rsquo;t bother writing a report. Long and short of it, I played Rakdos, but didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to look for Rain of Gores for the board. They would have really helped against the two Angelfire losses I got in rounds 3 and 5, including the one where the opponent drew all four Lightning Helixes :/ The decks record against Angelfire decks is something 1-3 I believe.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eMost of the time, my work involves mostly run-of-the-mill information management systems. Lately however, I\u0026rsquo;ve been asked to look into some new tech, and that got me interested in what\u0026rsquo;s called Rich Internet Applications (RIAs for short). The primary platform for RIAs is Flash, which apparently is already owned by Adobe and Macromedia is no more. Yeah, I never really paid attention to Flash, like most people I assumed it was only for making amusing movies and annoying ads. Also, Flash has always been a tool oriented towards people who are more design-oriented, not engineers or programmers like me. I mean, I load up Flash 8 and I have no idea how to do anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLately however, Adobe has released a product called Flex, which is basically a programming API for generating SWF files using XML and the Flash scripting language, ActionScript. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty cool, and I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a few really nice demos of web applications done using Flash, some of which I highlighted in \u003ca href=\"http://roytang.net/blog/2007/07/links-for-2007-07-28/\"\u003erecent links\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried out Flex for a few days, and really it is SO AWESOME. There are some UI stuff that you can do that would be ridiculously difficult with traditional HTML/Javascript and those things are so easy using Flex. (Just one caveat: some of the demos I\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far are quite the resource hogs\u0026hellip; )\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe real power of Flex is the fact that it generates files that run on Flash Player, one of the most ubiquitous platforms on the web. I\u0026rsquo;m betting that Flash Player has a larger install base than Internet Explorer. So it\u0026rsquo;s really hard to compete with Flash as a web platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop people from trying however. Lately, Microsoft announced \u003ca href=\"http://silverlight.net\"\u003eSilverlight\u003c/a\u003e, a .NET-based RIA SDK of some sort. The screenshots seem to denote that it can do really cool things as well. Gee, it would be nice if I could experience it directly, but here\u0026rsquo;s what I got when I tried to install the runtime:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#686eed3e2f219a4486e95157ebe664a8-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2007/07/rich-internet-applications/screenshot_hu41cf75f6e18db1b222206f4c6b61dff3_20498_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"686eed3e2f219a4486e95157ebe664a8-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2007/07/rich-internet-applications/screenshot.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"28 Jul 2007 8:50pm\"\u003e28 Jul 2007 8:50pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGee, way to challenge Flash: make it difficult to install the runtime. I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure if I really don\u0026rsquo;t have Admin privileges on this machine, and you know what? I don\u0026rsquo;t care about Silverlight enough to find out. With Flash Player, sometimes people don\u0026rsquo;t even \u003cem\u003eknow\u003c/em\u003e it\u0026rsquo;s being installed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Flex existed, the ability to create Flash-based webapps was mostly limited to developers who were patient enough to understand the Flash authoring tool. Flex opens up that platform to any developer with decent programming knowledge. Will this change the face of the internets? We\u0026rsquo;ll see\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Most of the time, my work involves mostly run-of-the-mill information management systems. Lately however, I\u0026rsquo;ve been asked to look into some new tech, and that got me interested in what\u0026rsquo;s called Rich Internet Applications (RIAs for short). The primary platform for RIAs is Flash, which apparently is already owned by Adobe and Macromedia is no more. Yeah, I never really paid attention to Flash, like most people I assumed it was only for making amusing movies and annoying ads.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA friend of mine, let\u0026rsquo;s call her \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo;, was waiting for a taxi near her home. There were several other people there waiting for taxis but she had been there first. She finally managed to hail a cab and had already gotten in the back seat when an MMDA traffic guy \n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnotebase-1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e\n stopped her and told her that he had hailed that taxi for two women nearby that he pointed to. C said she was the one who had hailed the taxi, but the traffic guy politely but firmly insisted that she get out of the car. Indignant, C took note of the traffic guy\u0026rsquo;s name plate and went on her way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as she got to the office, C composed a letter of complaint to the MMDA director and faxed it to their office as soon as she was able. Having coursed her complaint through several different offices, it was promptly handled and a hearing with the traffic guy was scheduled during the next week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC and I talked about it several times during the week before her hearing. She had asked me before sending the complaint whether it was a good idea or not, or if she should just let the incident go. I said no, she should proceed with her complaint. The traffic guy was clearly in the wrong, and she at least deserved an explanation regarding whether or not MMDA traffic guys are allowed to hassle people who are getting into taxis. Some people were worried that the traffic guy might be vindictive and might try to get back at her in some way. C is a pretty strong and brave woman though, and she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t back down even if that was a likely possibility. What did concern her was whether her complaint might cause someone to lose their job. I told her not to worry, at worst he\u0026rsquo;ll be asked to apologize and explain, and that will be that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day of the hearing arrived, I wanted to go with her to the MMDA office since I was curious how things would proceed, but I had a meeting an hour or so afterwards and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to risk being late, and besides she already had her boyfriend with her for support. I\u0026rsquo;m told that the traffic guy made some lame excuse that there was some sort of emergency and that\u0026rsquo;s why the two women needed the taxi. But he apologized to C anyway and promised to be more circumspect in the future. C got a written apology and came away satisfied, having fought city hall and won, sort of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe asked me if I think she wasted her time. I told her that what she did was a good thing; every so often someone has to complain against people who may or may not be abusing their position, if only to keep such people honest. And she got to witness firsthand how the government handles things, if ever she gets into a more serious situation with the government later on, she has this experience to draw upon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy take? I\u0026rsquo;m guessing the two women were friends/acquaintances of the traffic guy and they were impatient to get a cab. In true macho Filipino fashion, traffic guy offers to help them out. And that would have been fine, really. That is, until he started harassing another commuter to get it done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m glad I wasn\u0026rsquo;t there at the hearing though. If I had heard that lame excuse I might have done my best Phoenix Wright impression and shout \u0026ldquo;Objection!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The first one with the Mishra deck (Flores\u0026rsquo; Legends of Team CMU) to a disappointing 4-3 finish in a sea of Angelfire, Solar Flare and Gruul. Disappointed with the decks performance, I took a look at the result of Australian Nationals that same weekend, and decided to play the Rakdos \u0026ldquo;Satanic Sligh\u0026rdquo; build that had won that event in today\u0026rsquo;s qualifier, which was incidentally the last one I could play given my schedule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I wasn\u0026rsquo;t the only one thinking that, as of course I failed to predict how th metagame would shift. There were a lot more burn decks this time around, and my first two matches were among them. I split the first two for a disappointing start, then lost rounds four and five in quick succession. Frustrated at my inability to play the format and the terrible 2-3 record, I ticked \u0026ldquo;Drop\u0026rdquo; in the Result Slip and went home quite a bit sleepy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo ends this year\u0026rsquo;s quest for Nationals.

Sadly, my best constructed finish this year was actually \u003ca href=\"/2007/07/ptq-valencia-2007-06-30-ng-galleria/\"\u003ein Block\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, I need a break. Ravnica block is pretty much dead to me now, I will probably take a hiatus until it rotates out.
