The one time I came in late to work during the month of February was because of Street Fighter IV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStreet Fighter IV came in with ridiculously high reviews for both the XBox 360 and PS3 versions, the PS3 version garnering a \u003ca href=\"http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ps3/streetfighter4?q=street%20fighter%20iv\"\u003e94 (universal acclaim) on Metacritic\u003c/a\u003e It can\u0026rsquo;t be denied that it\u0026rsquo;s an awesome game, although \u003ca href=\"http://www.sirlin.net/blog/2009/2/22/a-few-things-about-street-fighter-4.html\"\u003enot everyone agrees\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to discuss all the details of the game, you can click through the links above to read more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing we always judge our fighting games on is the \u0026ldquo;random fighter selection\u0026rdquo; feature. SF3: Third Strike didn\u0026rsquo;t have it, but CvS2 and we played that a lot more than SF3 (and we would have never played SF3 had our PS2 not given up on our CvS2 disk). SF4 has a random fighter selection feature, but it\u0026rsquo;s a bit substandard since (a) You can cancel out of whatever selection it randomly gave you and (b) I got six Dhalsims out of seven randoms today! That\u0026rsquo;s insane. Also, in versus mode you have to move the selection cursor back to the random slot when choosing the next fighter (mildly annoying)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother neat feature: during versus matches, the game keeps tracks of continuous wins! Street Fighter sessions at home are generally won in a \u0026ldquo;five-in-a-row\u0026rdquo; basis, i.e. the first player to win five bouts in a row is considered the winner and the session ends. So this feature is pretty useful for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;ve tried playing online, although as usual connection is crap between BayanDSL and PLDT players, and the majority of Pinoy players seem to be on PLDT. Surprisingly, my brother was getting good connection ratings for opponents from Japan! The matching features are okay, despite not having double-blind character selection (this more accurately reflects the arcade experience though!) One thing that seems neat although we haven\u0026rsquo;t tried it yet \u0026ndash; when playing in arcade mode you can allow other online players to challenge you at any time, just like a real arcade game!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne last thing: Cammy\u0026rsquo;s ultra is pretty sw33t.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Unlike constructed where there\u0026rsquo;s a lot less variation in the number of interactions, in Limited basically anything can happen so you need to learn to react to a lot more situations. Maybe I should focus more on Limited again (if only it weren\u0026rsquo;t so expensive!)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

After installation I found out that Conflux release events were this weekend so I might as well play, since I was not able to play IRL at this time. I was hoping MTGO3 had improved by now, and that they had sufficient server loading, etc. to handle the number of players without the servers being crashy and laggy and whatnot.",

Now comes the PSP enhanced remake, featuring a brand new retranslation, anime cutscenes, new VAs, an additional character, et cetera. The works! I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing it during off times for about two weeks, and pretty much had Claude overlevelled most of the time since I never removed him from the party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the PS1 version I never managed to complete the optional stuff like the Cave of Trials bonus dungeon and the harder difficulty levels due to lack of time. Hopefully the handheld version will allow me to do those things; I will probably play the Rena story on one of the higher difficulty levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe PSP version is spot-on awesome, and makes me want to play Star Ocean: Til the End of Time again. I\u0026rsquo;m glad that there are still some good games coming out on the PSP despite the high level of piracy on the platform (not that I\u0026rsquo;m helping =/) Hopefully Sony comes out with a handheld that can support the PS2 generation of games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar Ocean: Second Evolution is a very deep game with a decent story and great battle system plus lots of extra stuff to do, so it\u0026rsquo;s highly recommended, especially for fans of the PS1 version.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSide Note: Luckily, I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried Star Ocean: First Departure. I say luckily because it\u0026rsquo;s supposedly quite bad. It was a generation ahead of Second Story so I guess they weren\u0026rsquo;t very good then.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

People at nearby tables were exclaiming how they got so many bombs they were using 5 out of 6 rares. Well, whatever, that\u0026rsquo;s how sealed deck goes. For my build, I was trying to go for early starts with 2- and 3-drops and just use the removal to take them out of the way and go aggro before any of my opponent\u0026rsquo;s bombs could come online. I wish I could\u0026rsquo;ve fitted in the 2nd \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Armillary%20Sphere\"\u003eArmillary Sphere\u003c/a\u003e and the 2 \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Gleam%20of%20Resistance\"\u003eGleam of Resistance\u003c/a\u003e, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to have to cut more creatures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won rounds one and two. The last game in round two was a real squeaker, where I managed to pull through despite my opponent\u0026rsquo;s pool having \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Volcanic%20Fallout\"\u003eVolcanic Fallout\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Martial%20Coup\"\u003eMartial Coup\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Banefire\"\u003eBanefire\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings went downhill from there. I lost both games of round 3 with my opponent having Nicol Bolas in play with the requisite loyalty to go postal on me. In round four I played really sloppily making a few miscounts of power/toughness and wasting some \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Drag%20Down\"\u003eDrag Down\u003c/a\u003es in the process. However, I had really bad draws in both games of round four; even I had played tightly I probably would still have lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to blame the deck, but there were so many issues during deck construction that I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure a much better build exists. I don\u0026rsquo;t know whether I should have maindecked the 2 \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Scattershot%20Archers\"\u003eScattershot Archers\u003c/a\u003e, they would have been pretty bad in rounds 1-3 but awesome in round 4. Looking at my pool now it might be possible to work in blue, losing green in the process. Blue gives me fliers, card draw and protection from red, but I guess it would have been more of a late game deck and I didn\u0026rsquo;t really want my games to go long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at the upcoming NG events, most are for extended so I guess I will still not be playing much Magic in February. Gives me time to think of a deck I want to play.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The code was workable and already being used by several programs, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t see any major functional flaws. But design-wise I felt that it could stand for some improvements/refactoring to be \u0026ldquo;better object-oriented code\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;easier to maintain\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe current design required a lot of inheritance \u0026ndash; the usual way of doing things in older Java code at work. I was thinking of a more dynamic, declarative design that would require a config file instead of more subclasses but eventually I decided against asking for it. It would have taken maybe a day or two to implement, and the client programs using the framework would need to be rewritten, et cetera. I felt that the improvement in maintainability didn\u0026rsquo;t justify the delay it would introduce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered this after reading \u003ca href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/01/31.html\" title=\"From Podcast 38\"\u003eJoel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood\u0026rsquo;s discussion on unit tests and code quality\u003c/a\u003e.

He asked me whether it was worth the effort for me to be doing these reviews. How many critical problems did I find on average? How many would have been caught by QA anyway? His point wasn\u0026rsquo;t to diss on code reviews, but was that although we want to have quality, sometimes we put too much effort into it, and the costs don\u0026rsquo;t always justify it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess part of working smart is knowing exactly how much quality your customers need. As developers, we feel a certain sense of \u0026ldquo;pride\u0026rdquo; that we want our code to be the best, optimized, et cetera.

You have to do exactly what the manual says, and you\u0026rsquo;ve got someone looking over your shoulder,\u0026rdquo; says Keller. \u0026ldquo;The answer is, yes, the process does stifle creativity.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand that it\u0026rsquo;s the level of quality required for space shuttle software \u0026ndash; literally perfect \u0026ndash; and it makes me glad \u003cem\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not\u003c/em\u003e writing space shuttle software because stifling creativity doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound fun to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack to the code review I was doing: I eventually shipped it back with a few minor comments to improve efficiency, but no major changes.

href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Wall%20of%20Reverence\"\u003eWall of Reverence\u003c/a\u003e to survive midrange before I let loose with huge 5-power and up fatties. Oh, and hitting a turn 3 Woolly Thoctar is pretty good too \u0026ndash; which I managed to do in all of the rounds I won. I \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e wanted to use the \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Maelstrom%20Archangel\"\u003eMaelstrom Archangel\u003c/a\u003e but sadly there was not enough support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 1\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame one we play draw-go for a while and trade creatures unless I go with \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Spearbreaker%20Behemoth\"\u003eSpearbreaker Behemoth\u003c/a\u003e into \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Godsire\"\u003eGodsire\u003c/a\u003e which earned the concession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two I keep a hand with six lands and a \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Woolly%20Thoctar\"\u003eWoolly Thoctar\u003c/a\u003e.

This round is no exception to the trend, as my deck fails to perform. I sandbag an \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Oblivion%20Ring\"\u003eOblivion Ring\u003c/a\u003e for too long instead of using it to take out his \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Scepter%20of%20Dominance\"\u003eScepter of Dominance\u003c/a\u003e.

While my wall is holding him back, he gums up the board with \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Vithian%20Stinger\"\u003eVithian Stinger\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Scattershot%20Archers\"\u003eScattershot Archers\u003c/a\u003e, preventing me from playing my hapless 1/1 exalted dudes that just hang around in my hand. Eventually, he shows me \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Malfegor\"\u003eMalfegor\u003c/a\u003e from his hand and discards four lands, wiping my board. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t manage to kill me, but between cyclers and card drawers I ran out of cards in my library before I could push through the last few points to win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated having the stupid 1/1s stuck in my hand so I sideboarded with: -2 \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Aven%20Squire\"\u003eAven Squire\u003c/a\u003e, -1 \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sighted-Caste%20Sorcerer\"\u003eSighted-Caste Sorcerer\u003c/a\u003e, -1 \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Akrasan%20Squire\"\u003eAkrasan Squire\u003c/a\u003e, +2 \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Celestial%20Purge\"\u003eCelestial Purge\u003c/a\u003e, +1 \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Savage%20Hunger\"\u003eSavage Hunger\u003c/a\u003e, +1 \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Dark%20Temper\"\u003eDark Temper\u003c/a\u003e, going into a more controllish build.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two, I have a forest and a plains and a \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Woolly%20Thoctar\"\u003eWoolly Thoctar\u003c/a\u003e in my opener, and I dutifully play plains and forest on the first two turns. On the third turn, I announce \u0026ldquo;Mountain\u0026rdquo; before ripping it off the top and playing the third turn Thoctar. He eventually manages to wipe me with \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Malfegor\"\u003eMalfegor\u003c/a\u003e again, but I was too far ahead and managed to eke out the win anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame three, I know we\u0026rsquo;re short on time so I try to play quickly. We\u0026rsquo;re trading creatures again, but I manage to stabilize with \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Wall%20of%20Reverence\"\u003eWall of Reverence\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Exuberant%20Firestoker\"\u003eExuberant Firestoker\u003c/a\u003e in play. I need to make a crucial decision when he plays out \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Fleshbag%20Marauder\"\u003eFleshbag Marauder\u003c/a\u003e with around two minutes left on the clock (the flight judge was sitting beside us showing us the timer). Keeping the wall helps me live longer, but I had \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Godsire\"\u003eGodsire\u003c/a\u003e in hand and the Exuberant meant I just needed to wait for two more lands, so I sac the wall, playing to win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure enough, with barely seven seconds left on the clock, I rip the seventh land, play the \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Godsire\"\u003eGodsire\u003c/a\u003e and say \u0026ldquo;End of turn, you take two from Exuberant, go!\u0026rdquo;. That drops him to 15 and gives me three extra turns to end it with the Godsire. He thinks real hard on his turn, then lays down \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Spearbreaker%20Behemoth\"\u003eSpearbreaker Behemoth\u003c/a\u003e to stand in the way. I untap in the first extra turn and show him the last card in my hand \u0026ndash; \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Oblivion%20Ring\"\u003eOblivion Ring\u003c/a\u003e. His Behemoth goes bye-bye and I deal nine damage in the red zone, plus two damage from the Exuberant, dropping him to four. He untaps, draws his card, shakes his head and offers the handshake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat game was a rush\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2-1 matches, 4-3 games\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 4\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame one he leads with \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Rip-clan%20Crasher\"\u003eRip-clan Crasher\u003c/a\u003e into \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Dragon%20Fodder\"\u003eDragon Fodder\u003c/a\u003e, but I stabilize with third-turn Thoctar (again) and take control of the game from there, despite getting wiped by \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Volcanic%20Fallout\"\u003eVolcanic Fallout\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI board the same way I did in round two. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to give too much card advantage to \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Volcanic%20Fallout\"\u003eVolcanic Fallout\u003c/a\u003e!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two goes by quickly in his favor, as he starts with Rip-clan and Goblin tokens again but this time I don\u0026rsquo;t draw the needed lands to stabilize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I\u0026rsquo;ve been choosing to draw instead of play all this time, and I stick to that decision in game three, despite the mad aggro rush I got hit with in the second game. We both mulligan to six, and he keeps his hand. But I see only one land in my six-carder so I send it back. Five cards yields no lands at all, and finally I keep 2 plains, \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Oblivion%20Ring\"\u003eOblivion Ring\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Savage%20Hunger\"\u003eSavage Hunger\u003c/a\u003e. This was not a good way for me to end the day!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, he had kept a subpar six, drawing his red mana only on turn three, giving me time to cycle into more lands and business spells. I eventually manage to hit \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Woolly%20Thoctar\"\u003eWoolly Thoctar\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Wall%20of%20Reverence\"\u003eWall of Reverence\u003c/a\u003e together, stabilizing the board with an extra five life gained per turn and eventually manage to eke out the win. Winning from a mulligan to four is always nice!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3-1 matches, 6-4 games\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWrap-up\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a bad prerelease, and Conflux looks fun, but I\u0026rsquo;m not too sure how good the five-color cards will be once Alara Reborn comes out. \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Celestial%20Purge\"\u003eCelestial Purge\u003c/a\u003e is pretty awesome and I think it\u0026rsquo;s even better than \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Path%20to%20Exile\"\u003ePath to Exile\u003c/a\u003e which is really bad in the early turns.
