Any serious gamer worth his salt knows about it \u0026ndash; whether he plays turn-based strategy games or not. And the fourth installment was eagerly awaited in our home \u0026ndash; two out of four brothers were eager to play the latest update.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Civ4 is in many ways the same game all over again. The basic premise is still there \u0026ndash; explore, build cities, research technologies, kick other civivlizations while they\u0026rsquo;re down, race to space, etc. But several other new features have kicked in, many of them adding a new layer of management complexity to the already complex strategy game. Great Persons, National Wonders, cultural expansion, luxury resources\u0026hellip; well, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if some of these are new since Civ3 \u0026ndash; I didn\u0026rsquo;t play that one much. The most important change has to be the streamlining of the interface such that it becomes easy to tell at a glance what a city is building and how long it takes for it to grow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, as expected, the game is still incredibly engrossing. I sat down yesterday morning to \u0026ldquo;just give it a try\u0026rdquo;, and after what seemed like a few short turns found myself contemplating whether to nuke the Arabians in the early 17th century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo yeah, awesome Civ4 gameplay, as expected. I finished two games in short order, one took me 4 hours because the silly Germans and Spanish kept trying to declare war on me, and I had to be satisfied with a Time Victory. The second took less than two hours \u0026ndash; full peace/diplomacy, science/culture all the way, never entered a state of war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I\u0026rsquo;m not playing it again. Why? Because the game\u0026rsquo;s performance is crap-tastic! You can play smoothly found maybe 5-10 minutes before the game starts slowing to a crawl. Going to the lowest possible settings and quitting all running programs doesn\u0026rsquo;t help at all. Apparently I\u0026rsquo;m not alone, as I\u0026rsquo;ve seen numerous message board posts lambasting Firaxis for the terrible performance of the game regardlesss of the system running it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a testament to both the addictiveness of the gameplay and how much patience I\u0026rsquo;ve gained recently that I was able to finish two games at all. But as it is, I\u0026rsquo;m not playing it again until some radical performance improvment happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I can still find a copy of Civ3\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Paolo Santos carried Magasin surprisingly well, and Superproxy was just the right track for Francis M. Radioactive Sago\u0026rsquo;s Alcohol is hilarious, and I like the way Orange and Lemons mixed a little bit of Julie Tearjerky and Tikman in Huwag Kang Matakot. I also think I actually like Cueshé\u0026rsquo;s version of Hard To Believe better than the original. My least favorite track on the album is Kitchie Nadal\u0026rsquo;s Ligaya, (cute laugh on the \u0026ldquo;inaahit\u0026rdquo; bit notwithstanding) as I really prefer the more upbeat original.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish more bands had contributed to the effort though, as the ‘heads probably deserve it. According to my brother, the participating artists were all from the same recording studio (I don\u0026rsquo;t really pay attention to studios, so yeah I\u0026rsquo;ll just agree here.) Still, it would\u0026rsquo;ve been nice to hear some renditions from ‘heads contemporaries like Rivermaya and Parokya ni Edgar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, awesome album. If you have listened to the Eraserheads music at one time or another, go find a way to get it.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I\u0026rsquo;m in a pretty good place right now I guess, compared to a majority of people in this country.

Slaving away as some company\u0026rsquo;s employee, getting promotions and raises, then retiring to watch your kids grow up? Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, I love my job and the company I work for is great, very responsive to its employees. And I\u0026rsquo;m sure retiring and raising kids is a worthy goal for some people. But I highly doubt I\u0026rsquo;m that sort of person.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI get antsy sometimes, I often tell some people at work that I think of resigning at least once a week. The thing is, I don\u0026rsquo;t really know where to go or what to do if I resigned. All I know is at some point I would like to be doing something else with my life, something other than a regular nine-to-five (well in my case more of eight-to-seven) job, something that leaves a mark on the world. \u003cspan style=\"font-style:italic;\"\u003eStand tall and shake the heavens\u003c/span\u003e, I always like to say to myself.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMy biggest problem right now is fear - fear of burning bridges. There was this awesome article somewhere by this shareware guy about how to start your own indie business (I\u0026rsquo;ll credit him sometime when I remember), and I remember one of the things he said that struck me the most: Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to burn bridges.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut I am afraid, and with good reason. Like I said, I\u0026rsquo;ve got a good job, it\u0026rsquo;s decent pay and I even enjoy the work a good percentage of the time. And of course, I\u0026rsquo;m also providing \u003ca href=\"http://clair.pinoyweb.net/?p=467\"\u003efinancial support for the rest of the family\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt becomes more frightening when I take into consideration what my passions are. The main ones right now are: gaming and web development. Taken together, it points in one direction: I should work on a web-based game. But the size of this task at this point is too huge for me to imagine, and the risks far too obvious. It would be very hard and it may take years to turn a profit, I would need some considerable financial base before doing this. And I would also need an idea of what game to do\u0026hellip;\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe second problem is focus. I lack focus. This I\u0026rsquo;ve known for a long time. Even if I decide on one course of action, I\u0026rsquo;m never sure that I would have the will to carry it on until the end. I can have focus and determination in the short term, i.e. a task that takes a week or so I can easily focus on. But the sort of life-changing ambitions I\u0026rsquo;m considering right now can\u0026rsquo;t be done in a week, and I fear that I will run out of steam half-way through and all will be for naught.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI need to overcome these problems.

Part-time therapy, part-time boredom, part-time egotism perhaps?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhy then am I hesitant to let a coworker (who is also a friend) know the url? Like I said, I don't have anything to hide (and I'm pretty sure I haven't said anything stupid about my work, mostly because, hey I like my work!). If I had anything to hide, why blog in public at all? You could always hide behind Livejournal's protected system (they have one of those right?) or use an anonymous name.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI don't have an answer. But if she (or anyone else) asks again, I will give the url. :D",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIn my line of work, which is to say \u0026ldquo;large-scale database systems\u0026rdquo;, there\u0026rsquo;s always the idea of \u0026ldquo;journalling\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;audit trail.\u0026rdquo; Basically, it means that for every transaction of significance, a record is kept of that transaction, stored in a log somewhere, so that should something malefic happen, the logs can be parsed and the trail can be followed, blame can be assigned and countermeasures can be taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, that\u0026rsquo;s not really limited to large-scale database systems. Any nontrivial software system should have some sort of journalling scheme involved, as printlogging is usually part and parcel of the development process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, I would wish that life too had a journalling system, one more reliable and less arcane than that gift humans call memory. I sometimes have trouble remembering what I had for breakfast this morning. Okay, that\u0026rsquo;s a lie, I seldom forget about meals less than a week old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I do have a tendency to forget other things. Tasks to do, people I\u0026rsquo;ve met, appointments I\u0026rsquo;ve set. A Saturday or so (I forget when), I had set a training meeting at 10am. Of course, my job does not require me to be in the office before noon on Saturdays, so I conveniently forgot about the meeting while playing \u003ca href=\"http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/\"\u003eWorld of Warcraft\u003c/a\u003e, recalling such appointment only while taking a bath at 10:30am. (Luckily they didn\u0026rsquo;t mide me re-scheding to 11:30)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, frail as our memories are, we resort to other things to keep us on track. Paper, notebooks, to-do-lists, organizers, calendars, cellphones, PDAs, sticky notes and every so often, the proverbial rubber-band-around-the-finger. (Yes, I have done that, and yes I did forget what the rubber band stood for.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlogging, is of course, one of those outlets, one of those forms of introspection so commonplace on the web nowadays. I started quite some time ago, on another server, and have kept up, a bit sporadically if I might add. I\u0026rsquo;ve never been entirely too sure of my own reasons for blogging. Some parts ego, some parts experimentation, some parts therapy, perhaps some part exhibitionism? In any case, though I have considered several times to abandon this practice, especially when I have been too lazy to pursue it for months on end, I find myself giving it another go eventually.
