In fact I think for most of the first two months of my hiatus, this was what I did. Now there\u0026rsquo;s a lot less of that \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;ve caught up with all the series I wanted to catch up with, and I don\u0026rsquo;t have any significant video games I want to finish. (That may change next week with the release of Starcraft 2 :p). I don\u0026rsquo;t actually watch stuff on television unless I\u0026rsquo;m having a meal though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI read a lot. Mostly online reading (so having an IPad would be nice, hah!). A lot of articles about a variety of topics such as entrepreneurship, new technologies, mobile application development, casual gaming development. \u003ca href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/\"\u003eHacker News\u003c/a\u003e is a fair approximation of my usual reading material. I probably spend 2-3 hours each day on reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m working on some small projects. Not work stuff, not freelancing or anything like that. Just some tools/apps, many of them for my own usage (‘to scratch an itch\u0026rdquo;, as the saying goes). Often I will start building an app just to try out a certain API or technology. In the past 2 weeks I\u0026rsquo;ve looked at: Scala, Ruby, the Android SDK, Google App Engine, the Facebook Graph API, the Twitter API, the Plurk API, Git and Mercurial. It\u0026rsquo;s only recently that I\u0026rsquo;m getting back into the swing of coding (and seeing my own terrible bugs :p), and I hope to scale that up in the coming months. I want to write more apps that I can release for public consumption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething people who\u0026rsquo;ve been employed all the time don\u0026rsquo;t realize: even if I have a lot of free time, I\u0026rsquo;m still lazy. :p So there are a lot of backlog tasks I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to do since forever that I need to get around to. Mostly involves organizing stuff, getting rid of unneeded stuff, returning stuff. Stuff has a maintenance cost, so we should have a lot less of it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m currently not earning any money and am still considering future plans. It\u0026rsquo;s fine, I can still survive for a while. There are a lot of options, and getting back into a regular employment scenario is only one of them. The more conventional options are getting a job again and/or working abroad (probably Singapore). My brothers and I talk constantly about starting our own company: consulting/software dev (need to find clients), or product development (IPhone/Android\u0026hellip; but we\u0026rsquo;re still balking on the high price of entry to the IPhone market, i.e. need a macbook!). A friend of mine keeps telling me we should start working on a casual game, our own Plants vs Zombies as it were. I\u0026rsquo;m inclined to look into some sort of product development myself, in fact I already have a few design ideas for a casual/social MMO (similar to Castle Age\u0026hellip; I like to claim I\u0026rsquo;m doing research when I play it).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that\u0026rsquo;s the current status. I\u0026rsquo;m still not sure exactly the direction I should be going \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s always been one of my weaknesses that when there are a lot of options available I have difficulty making a decision promptly. Getting a job again is the safe yet boring choice; at the same time I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if I\u0026rsquo;m equipped with the necessary discipline to handle the more challenging options such as starting my own company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case I\u0026rsquo;m not really in a hurry. The whole point of the hiatus was figuring out what I want to be doing. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure yet, so hiatus is not yet over. 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I pretty much got to try all of the relevant services: cron jobs, tasks, memcache, GQL, etc. Everything was well-documented and easy to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFacebook on the other hand\u0026hellip; this whole thing with their Graph API that they want to release the old REST API with makes things a bit confusing when searching for tutorials, as most of them will be referring to the old REST API, including the python facebook wrapper libraries available. It took me a while to get the authentication and setting up permissions thing going. The great thing is I don\u0026rsquo;t need to go through that again for future facebook apps!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project also gave me a chance to create a \u003ca href=\"http://bitbucket.org\"\u003ebitbucket\u003c/a\u003e account and use a DVCS.

My app comes in late to the game and there was already a facebook app listed there before but it\u0026rsquo;s not ranked too high.
