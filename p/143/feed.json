You will not write perfect software, and that's fine. It's not a flaw, it's just the way software is.

Good software goes through multiple iterations and many eyes looking at it.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"qtext_para\"\u003e\n  It is also important to treat it as a learning experience -- learn what you can from each code review comment and try to apply what you learn to future code you write. This also helps you minimize review comments in the future.

Yes, even the veterans, the rock stars, the elite, they have all written terrible code at some point in their careers and they will probably write more terrible code in the future. The key is to recognize those instances -- either through introspection or being open to criticism -- and learning from them and trying to minimize them in the future.

Over the past year or so I\u0026rsquo;ve also been playing Blizzard\u0026rsquo;s digital CCG \u003ca href=\"http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/?-\"\u003eHearthstone\u003c/a\u003e (limiting myself to free to play since who has money to spend on two CCGs?) and I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about the design parallels and differences between the two. If you\u0026rsquo;re a Hearthstone player, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably read a lot of these things before, since many well-known pros play both MTG and HS. This is written more towards the Magic player in mind to get to know Hearthstone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMana system and Mulligans\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike most modern successors to MTG, HS does away with the concept of \u0026ldquo;mana screw\u0026rdquo; by automatically providing one generic mana to each player per turn. It\u0026rsquo;s really MTG\u0026rsquo;s big weakness and what turns off many players. MTG Head Designer MaRo tries to justify the existence of mana screw \u003ca href=\"http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mana-action-2011-05-23\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. HS\u0026rsquo;s mana system is much simpler, and has no concept of colors or mana screw or color screw. One disadvantage of this is that all costs are the same, and they have to restrict deck access to cards via another method \u0026ndash; class-specific cards. This makes it impossible to have the equivalent of a \u0026ldquo;multicolor deck\u0026rdquo; like in Magic, which means there are theoretically fewer possible deck archetypes in HS for a comparable set of cards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m a fan of Hearthstone\u0026rsquo;s mulligan system \u0026ndash; selectively sending back particular cards from your opening hand \u0026ndash; as opposed to Magic\u0026rsquo;s sending back the entire hand. Unfortunately, Magic is already balanced around the current mulligan system, and it will probably have issues if you only have one chance to mulligan and still draw no lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHearthstone Limitations\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearthstone is definitely a more limited game than Magic because it follows one important rule: you can\u0026rsquo;t interact during your opponent\u0026rsquo;s turn. This has the benefit of streamlining matches and making them go faster (no need for concepts like the stack and priority from MTG) , which is important for a game played online. The disadvantage is a greatly reduced design space which HS has to compensate with in other areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are some other limitations to streamline/simplify gameplay:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNo graveyard (well, HS has a concept of \u0026ldquo;minions that died this turn\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;minions that died this game\u0026rdquo;, but there is no visible graveyard zone). This means Magic\u0026rsquo;s graveyard-based mechanics such as \u003cstrong\u003eFlashback\u003c/strong\u003e or \u003cstrong\u003eUnearth\u003c/strong\u003e can\u0026rsquo;t be translated to Hearthstone\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNo manual searching through the deck. When an effect pulls something out of the deck, it\u0026rsquo;s always random\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAt most 7 minions (creatures) on the board on each side\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStrengths of the Digital Format\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the above limitation, HS does earn some additional design space since it takes advantage of the exclusively digital format in a number of ways not available to Magic, such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDamage to minions not healed at EOT\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; in Magic, this would not have been practical since it\u0026rsquo;s a lot of effort for players to track the damage to individual creatures. For a digital game it\u0026rsquo;s easy since it can be done automatically. This also provides some mechanics that can\u0026rsquo;t usefully translate to MTG: the \u003cstrong\u003eEnrage\u003c/strong\u003e mechanic and effects like \u0026ldquo;Draw a card for each damanged minion\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEffects can generate new cards\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; both spells and minions. Magic can do this too, through the use of \u0026ldquo;tokens\u0026rdquo; (but only for permanents, not spells). Magic\u0026rsquo;s tokens however are \u0026ldquo;second-class\u0026rdquo; permanents since they are not real cards. In HS, the generated cards are real cards that can be returned to hand, shuffled into your deck, etc. Furthermore, the generated cards can be either existing cards (whether you have them in your deck or not \u0026ndash; \u003cstrong\u003eDiscover\u003c/strong\u003e mechanic or effects like Piloted Shredder) or cards that are not even available for deckbuilding such as the Spare Parts generated by some mechs\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore randomly generated elements\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; Magic has some RNG too, but not nearly as much as HS. I believe that in both games, serious competitive players don\u0026rsquo;t like too much RNG.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEffects can permanently boost cards not in play\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; this includes effects like \u0026ldquo;all cards in your deck get +1/+1\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;reduce the cost of this card for each turn it is in your hand\u0026rdquo;. This is possible since we can trust the game engine to correctly process and track hidden information\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e**Board position matters **\u0026ndash; minions can grant bonuses to adjacent minions, or effects can target the leftmost minion, etc. Actually, Magic can do this too, but given that they\u0026rsquo;ve moved away from \u0026ldquo;graveyard order matters\u0026rdquo; because it places too much effort on the player, I suspect they are not likely to do this for similar reasons\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e**Easily balance existing cards **\u0026ndash; Blizzard hasn\u0026rsquo;t done it too often, but they do issue nerfs to cards that are too powerful. Before the introduction of the Standard format they even nerfed some core cards to free up future design space. In Magic they try to avoid functional errata because they have no way of ensuring the ifnromation is propagated to all owners of previous printings of the same card\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHearthstone Mechanics\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**Hero Power \u0026ndash; **each hero has a power that costs 2 mana. The great thing about this it reduces the effect of \u0026ldquo;cost screw\u0026rdquo;, i.e. drawing high cost cards early, since your hero will always have a low-cost play available no matter what. There\u0026rsquo;s also some design space there they started using in earnest with The Grand Tournament expansion, such as the \u003cstrong\u003eInspire\u003c/strong\u003e mechanic or effects that modify hero powers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSecrets\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; to compensate for not being able to interact during the opponent\u0026rsquo;s turn, some classes have access to secrets \u0026ndash; these are spells that generate effects during your opponent\u0026rsquo;s turn, based on particular triggers. The opposing player wouldn\u0026rsquo;t know\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**Taunt **\u0026ndash; the equivalent of Taunt in MTG is \u0026ldquo;Blocking\u0026rdquo;. Since you cannot do anything on your opponent\u0026rsquo;s turns, blocking the same way as MTG is impossible, so they have this mechanic to replace it. Currently, HS has no way for minions to bypass Taunt without removing the Taunt minion itself \u0026ndash; there are no evasion mechanics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**Charge **\u0026ndash; the equivalent of MTG\u0026rsquo;s \u003cstrong\u003eHaste\u003c/strong\u003e. However, it is stronger here in HS since your opponent cannot interact during your turn. This means Charge creatures essentially get a free attack unopposed and can throw off your opponent\u0026rsquo;s combat math. This makes effects that grant Charge particularly strong. An example was the infamous \u003ca href=\"http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/forum/topic/19288409377\"\u003enerf to Warsong Commander\u003c/a\u003e because granting Charge to other creatures enabled one-turn kills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDivine Shield\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; no equivalent in MTG, but I think something can be worked out if needed. Something like:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDivine Shield (This creature enters the battlefield with a divinity counter on it. Whenever it takes damage and has a divinity counter instead remove a divinity counter.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m actually a big fan of Divine Shield as a mechanic, it\u0026rsquo;s more interesting and a lot simpler than Magic\u0026rsquo;s defensive mechanics \u003cstrong\u003eProtection\u003c/strong\u003e or \u003cstrong\u003eRegeneration\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**Windfury **\u0026ndash; this is basically the same as Magic\u0026rsquo;s \u003cstrong\u003eDouble Strike\u003c/strong\u003e, except Magic is limited by the rules to two strikes, while HS has one card that has \u003cstrong\u003eMega-Windfury\u003c/strong\u003e, allowing four strikes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**Overload **\u0026ndash; this is HS putting its\u0026rsquo; simpler mana system to good use. Overload allows you to \u0026ldquo;borrow\u0026rdquo; mana from the future to reduce the costs of your cards. The downside is you have less mana available next turn. The closest equivalent is probably Magic\u0026rsquo;s \u003cstrong\u003eEcho\u003c/strong\u003e mechanic or the \u0026ldquo;Pact\u0026rdquo; mechanic from the \u003ca href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=130701\"\u003ePact of Negation\u003c/a\u003e cycle, although neither are exactly the same\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**Combo **\u0026ndash; this is the Rogue mechanic in HS, it grants an additional effect if at least one other card has been played in the same turn. This is easily implementable in Magic:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEviscerate 1R Sorcery Eviscerate deals 2 damage to target creature or player. Combo \u0026ndash; Eviscerate deals 4 damage instead\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s no different than Magic\u0026rsquo;s other \u0026ldquo;enhancing\u0026rdquo; ability words like \u003cstrong\u003eMorbid\u003c/strong\u003e or \u003cstrong\u003eKicker\u003c/strong\u003e which grant additional effects depending on certain conditions\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStealth\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; this is the same as Magic\u0026rsquo;s \u003cstrong\u003eHexproof\u003c/strong\u003e, except Stealth wears off once the minion attacks, and stealthed minions can\u0026rsquo;t be attacked. The usage is generally the same \u0026ndash; to protect your minion until it can actually gain you some value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**Battlecry and Deathrattle **\u0026ndash; in Magic, these are simply triggered abilities \u0026ldquo;when the creature enters the battlefield\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;when the creature dies\u0026rdquo;. If these were named keywords in MTG, it would open up some additional design space that HS already uses. MTG does use this design space sometimes, but the templating is difficult, see \u003ca href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233069\"\u003eTorpor Orb\u003c/a\u003e. More complicated abilities like \u0026ldquo;Battlecry: Trigger another minion\u0026rsquo;s Deathrattle effect\u0026rdquo; would not be worth the effort to implement in MTG unless similar keywords are defined to make templating easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpell Damage\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; this mechanic increases the damage dealt by burn spells. In Magic, such spells are almost exclusively red spells, so I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how likely it would be to keyworded in Magic. This design space has been used in MTG on occasion, but it\u0026rsquo;s mostly damage doubling instead of incrementing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**Choose One **\u0026ndash; I actually wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware this was a named mechanic until they took advantage of it with \u003ca href=\"http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Fandral_Staghelm\"\u003eFandral Staghelm\u003c/a\u003e. Magic\u0026rsquo;s modal mechanic has never been used in such a way, but imagine an effect like \u0026ldquo;Whenever you make a choice for a modal ability, you may choose one additional mode\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; makes your Cryptic Commands way more awesome!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSilence\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; this is basically \u0026ldquo;remove all abilities\u0026rdquo; in Magic. To be truly equivalent, it should also remove power/toughness boosts and auras attached to the creature. Seems perfectly doable in Magic, although it might have memory issues, unless it\u0026rsquo;s as an aura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFreeze\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026ndash; frozen minions can\u0026rsquo;t attack the next turn. It\u0026rsquo;s mechanically and thematically similar to tapping effects often found in blue and white cards. Freeze effects in HS can easily be replicated in Magic. The main difference is that frozen Taunts in HS can still \u0026ldquo;block\u0026rdquo; so Freeze can\u0026rsquo;t be used offensively to get rid of the \u0026ldquo;blockers\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearthstone is a pretty young game compared to Magic, but as far as I can tell it\u0026rsquo;s doing pretty well. It provides a fun, streamlined experience and takes advantage of the strengths of the digital format to overcome the weaknesses brought about by the streamlining. The monetization model is friendly enough that even cheap f2p players like me can appreciate it. So far Magic hasn\u0026rsquo;t had a real competitor in the paper space, but HS is a serious competitor in the digital space since it makes MTG\u0026rsquo;s digital offerings look terrible by comparison. Hopefully both games can learn more from each other and grow more in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Discuss also the difference in the activities you prefer. Maybe you can agree to go out at most X times a month or a week, and he can agree to spend Y days a week at home with you, and maybe even have some days for the two of you to do things separately. Compromise on the activities you both can do together: “Okay, we’ll go out this often, but can we also spend some nights staying in and doing [activity you like]?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\"\u003eGood luck!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",
