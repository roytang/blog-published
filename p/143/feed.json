It is not appropriate to say that a person or an entity \u0026ldquo;is bias\u0026rdquo;. Unless you are talking to like a prejudice elemental or something (takes note of that for hypothetical hipster RPG)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a (long-winded) discussion during the recent election period, someone told me that I \u0026ldquo;obviously had a bias\u0026rdquo; and my answer was \u0026ldquo;Of course I do! Everyone does!\u0026rdquo; People have different histories and backgrounds which means for any given topic they are likely to start from different points. These biases are perfectly okay and healthy and they\u0026rsquo;re called opinions. (Cue quote about opinions being like assholes). Example: I\u0026rsquo;m not in favor of the death penalty therefore I\u0026rsquo;m biased against candidates that want to promote it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough we are all entitled to our own opinions, many times we are called upon to make objective judgments. Common examples are jury trials, elections, or when you\u0026rsquo;re a judge in some contest. During these instances we have to be careful to weigh our own biases and opinions objectively to make sure we are giving a fair judgment\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat you do need to note is when you become subject to \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias\"\u003ecognitive biases\u003c/a\u003e \u0026ndash; unconscious, automatic influences on human judgment and decision making that reliably produce reasoning errors. \u003cstrong\u003eBe wary of your own cognitive biases\u003c/strong\u003e and try to mitigate or compensate for them in your reasoning\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResearch has also shown that \u003ca href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2015/june/bias-blind-spot.html\"\u003epeople have a bias blind spot\u003c/a\u003e. This means \u003cstrong\u003ewe think we are less biased than other people\u003c/strong\u003e. This is why it is important to \u003cstrong\u003eexamine your own arguments\u003c/strong\u003e from time to time to see whether you are subject to any of the known cognitive biases. When there is a need to be objective, we need to be extra critical of our own arguments\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften, it is simply a matter of shifting your perspective: think about how a situation looks to people with an opposing point of view to balance out your own views. A sure sign of bias is that you are only aware of the positives of your own point of view and the negatives in others\u0026rsquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"\u003e\n  \u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\n    Common Evidence of Bias: Your candidate is the best, and you can find absolutely nothing good to say about other candidates.\n  \u003c/p\u003e\u0026mdash; Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) \n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/741361923061653504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eJune 10, 2016\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eChastising Duterte is not mutually exclusive with supporting De Lima.

This traps you in an echo chamber of people constantly reinforcing the same ideas. A friend and I recently were discussing how certain people react poorly to differing opinions and theorized that maybe that person grew up surrounded by people who enabled his biases\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead,** seek out different opinions. **Continuing from the death penalty example above, I don\u0026rsquo;t shut out discussion from friends who I know to be pro-death penalty. I still read their threads and try to understand their point of view. Listening to a wide variety of different opinions will tend to cancel out your biases with time and will lead towards more objective thinking. For example, when conducting a performance assessment of a team member (something I\u0026rsquo;ve done often for the past decade or so!), I tend to get other people\u0026rsquo;s opinions first to contrast with my own, and will often ask someone else whether I might be biased in certain situations. The risk of personal bias is mitigated by sourcing different opinions\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the day, we probably can\u0026rsquo;t completely eliminate our own biases, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we stop trying to be more objective in our thoughts and discussions and decisions\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It would be sufficient to simply have an understanding of how programs execute step-by-step instructions and algorithms. If you’re interviewing programmers, you can simply give them a moderately complex problem and ask them to verbally walk through / explain to you how they would approach the problem (you yourself would need to understand how the problem is typically solved).

Even for people who do know how to code! The best way to identify a good programmer is actually to work with them on a project, but of course that option is unlikely during an interview. In general look for high-level skills: ability to step through the solution to a problem (and explain it well), ability to spot possible problems in a given solution (you might try describing a problem you encountered in a previous project and ask how he would address it), ability to work well with others, etc\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Obviously we can’t send out signals in English or such as this would be meaningless to them. One possibility is to use a universally recognizable language - mathematics. We can transmit recognizable mathematical patterns or sequences to establish that we are an intelligent species capable of communication. If we are lucky enough that the alien species can understand visual signals we can show them images to try to explain what we mean, then use a secondary medium such as sound to try to establish our language.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\"\u003eIn effect we would have to spend effort to learn how to communicate with each other, largely through trial and error until a reasonable approach can be found.
