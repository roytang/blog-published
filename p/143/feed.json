What exactly did Steve know? Did he know that Howard and wife were assassinated, but did not know that Bucky was the assassin? If so, how does he know that? These events happened while he was in the ice. My brother thought it meant that Steve knew that Bucky assassinated someone (since Bucky told him about the incident he discussed with Zemo during the blackout), but that Steve did not know it was Howard. But then it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make sense to reply to Tony that way?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandom: the endings for both Civil War and BvS were both about someone\u0026rsquo;s mother. Okay, not really haha\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Raft: Didn\u0026rsquo;t they also have a Raft in Agents of SHIELD?

I don\u0026rsquo;t think he does anything significant until Giant-Man, which is weird given he\u0026rsquo;s the most powerful guy there. Also, at some point Falcon and Bucky ge\u003c/p\u003e\n",
