            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eShould I still write tournament reports even though I did poorly? Spoilers, but the answer is that has never stopped me before!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn today\u0026rsquo;s installment of \u0026ldquo;I thought you were quitting paper Magic?\u0026rdquo;, I attended an MCQ yesterday for MC Richmond. The format was Modern constructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI initially wasn\u0026rsquo;t planning to play because (a) the entrance fee was kind of ridiculous; (b) modern is a bit of an unbalanced debacle right now because of Hogaak; and (c ) my one assembled Modern deck (Grixis Death Shadow) hasn\u0026rsquo;t been used since 2017, and was completely absent in the meta for the recent MC Barcelona. That being said, I was still considering it because in my head there\u0026rsquo;s always the fantasy of \u0026ldquo;Oh, I won the MCQ now I went to the MC and somehow I won too and now I\u0026rsquo;m on the gravy train.\u0026rdquo; Oh, and the Death\u0026rsquo;s Shadow discord convinced me this deck is still legit. (There\u0026rsquo;s a discord!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat helped in my decision to play was bringing the GDS deck to a Modern FNM a couple of weeks prior to the MCQ. Only three people joined up (including me) due to the heavy rains, but that was enough for a couple of matches and enough to remind me why I enjoy playing this style of deck so much. GDS plays out like a puzzle every turn, where you\u0026rsquo;re trying to find the right sequence of moves for your turn to optimize for your Death Shadows and also to stay alive. Granted that\u0026rsquo;s not unique to this deck, as that\u0026rsquo;s typical of Modern; that\u0026rsquo;s why I enjoy this format much more than Standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I decided to play the MCQ. With only an FNM as practice. Good luck to me, although I kind of already spoiled the outcome with the first line of this post.

For most other people, they will often have a pet modern deck and will prefer to stick with it rather than spend a ton of money to move to a different deck (which may even not exist in a couple of weeks!). That being said, my general plan for Hogaak decks was to avoid them (and I did that successfully!). This being Manila, I expect the metagame to lean a bit more towards aggro, burn and control.

Apparently Vengevine is an Elemental. Who knew! His deck also had Lightning Skelemental! I won game 1, then mulled to 5 in game 2 looking for the Leyline, promptly losing to his super aggro hand. Game 3 I mulled to 6, keeping a one-lander with no Leyline because I was unhappy with my mull to 5 in g2, and that didn\u0026rsquo;t turn out well either.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR2 2-1 WIN vs rg burn. Game one I kept a one-lander again and opened with double Street Wraith to look for a land (and failing to find one), before going fetch into shock into Thoughtseize into sadness at seeing Monastery Swiftspears in his hand. I quickly lost game 1 and boarded out many of my lifeloss cards. I stayed in control games 2 and 3 and won easily.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR3 1-2 LOSS vs uw control. Game one vs UW control is tough since I have so many dead cards (although Fatal Push on Colonnade is always fun), and I lose to a JTMS that has brainstormed too many times. Game two I hit him with four hand disruption spells before quick aggro with a Shadow and an Angler to win. Game three I do turn one Serum Visions drawing Thoughtseize, and he goes turn two Rest in Peace and I curse that Thoughtseize for being one turn too late. The game goes long and he throws a lot of removal at my creatures and manages to take out both of Lilianas that I snuck under his permission. I eventually run out of gas at six life just as he draws a Restoration Angel and I lose in the air.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR4 2-0 WIN vs whir. I got an early Shadow in game 1 and use Dismember to stop his Engineer from building an Ensnaring Bridge, then just protect the Shadow with Stubs for the win. Game two he\u0026rsquo;s stuck on two lands and a Mox Opal which I disable by using Inquisition and Kolaghan\u0026rsquo;s Command to get rid of his other artifacts.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR5 1-2 LOSS vs burn. The burn matchup is completely manageable despite how I joke all the time about helping the opponent out. The key is to keeping creatures off the enemy board, which is why we board in more removal. His build however had Bedlam Revelers, which was problematic for me as few of my spells could cleanly answer it (aside from Dismember, which I board out in the matchup). Game three went long and I managed to stablize at around 7 life, but he drew a Reveler before I could draw a threat to close the game.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR6 0-2 LOSS vs tron. Okay, this one was against my teammate so we both knew what we were facing. We played seriously though (more or less), and I lost to his optimal Tron draws despite the disruption.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt X-4 there\u0026rsquo;s no chance of prizes so I dropped. My teammate winning round 6 was probably better anyway, since his deck had a better matchup against the field. He later went on to win the last 2 rounds, so our pool won some packs for the event despite how poorly I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the occasional imbalance, I love Modern as a constructed format. The power level is high, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of deck diversity, and most matchups are very skillful. It would be super easy to quit (paper) Magic if Standard was the only format you played - the yearly rotation times are natural quitting points after all. But Modern makes it more likely for me to keep playing constructed, even if only occasionally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSide note: someone called me out at the tournament yesterday with \u0026ldquo;Roy Tang! You\u0026rsquo;re still playing?\u0026rdquo; which is indicative of both how active I used to be (since people still recognize me) and also how inactive I am these days. I half-jokingly replied that I only play about once a year these days, but that\u0026rsquo;s not too far from the truth. A few weeks back, popular player Sam Black tweeted about \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SamuelHBlack/status/1154986279047696384\"\u003ehow he much he valued the in-person aspect and community of playing paper MTG and not so much the eSports/online/Arena/streaming side\u003c/a\u003e. For me it\u0026rsquo;s kind of the opposite; I don\u0026rsquo;t have any ill will towards the local community, a lot of them are fun to hang out with, but I believe that if I could play Magic 100% online for an affordable rate (i.e. on Arena, and if it had Modern), I would gladly do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing to tournaments is a pain and a hassle, given conditions in Metro Manila, and they take up far too much time. Then there\u0026rsquo;s all the logistic of putting together decks, trading and buying and selling individual cards, having to shuffle with my sweaty hands, having to be aware of whether your opponent is doing something shifty, etc, all of these things that I dislike about paper Magic go away if I\u0026rsquo;m playing Arena. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying I\u0026rsquo;m quitting paper Magic, I know better than to assume I can do that, especially given that Wizards just announced their new plans for profession play going forward, but I am looking forward to the day that Arena and paper have parity in the formats and opportunities they afford players.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Should I still write tournament reports even though I did poorly? Spoilers, but the answer is that has never stopped me before!\nIn today\u0026rsquo;s installment of \u0026ldquo;I thought you were quitting paper Magic?\u0026rdquo;, I attended an MCQ yesterday for MC Richmond. The format was Modern constructed.\nI initially wasn\u0026rsquo;t planning to play because (a) the entrance fee was kind of ridiculous; (b) modern is a bit of an unbalanced debacle right now because of Hogaak; and (c ) my one assembled Modern deck (Grixis Death Shadow) hasn\u0026rsquo;t been used since 2017, and was completely absent in the meta for the recent MC Barcelona.",

So everything is everywhere and not consolidated in the same place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo tackle the problem, first I consider what are my use cases and requirements:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSay I think of something that I need to do while I\u0026rsquo;m away from my computer and want to jot it down quickly before I forget about it. It needs to be quick and easy to note something down. Such things can include:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea work todo\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ean idea I want to investigate later\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea blog post idea\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esomething that I need to tell somebody\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea project that I could work on\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea game or book that looks interesting\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esomething I want to read later\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eand so on\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI need to note something that I will need for reference at some future point(s). For these pieces of information, I need to be able to pull them up quickly as needed. Examples:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea wifi password\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAPI keys\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe url for the production server\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eaccount numbers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI need to record something on a regular basis (for example, blood pressure) and need a place to store that information for future reference\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn mobile, the main way I capture information now is via Google Keep since it\u0026rsquo;s quick and easy. This means my Google Keep is full of many random cards with lists, some of which I can\u0026rsquo;t even recall the context of later. For longer-term inputs, I will typically use either a text file stored in Dropbox or StandardNotes or Google Docs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe solution came to me when I realized that I was capturing all these inputs and leaving them in the same place: so all the free-floating ideas I captured stay in Google Keep, unorganized and chaotic. I figured I needed to have two separate phases:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCapture ideas/todo items into an \u0026ldquo;inbox\u0026rdquo; (in this case, Google Keep)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePeriodically review the \u0026ldquo;inbox\u0026rdquo; and move items to the appropriate locations, for example:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eimmediately actionable items can be done immediately\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003etodo lists for actionable items\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ereference folders for reference material\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mostly didn\u0026rsquo;t have step 2 before. This is largely similar to the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;Getting Things Done\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e workflow that became popular for productivity nerds a while back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn additional step for me to have more well-defined \u0026ldquo;buckets\u0026rdquo; or locations, where different types of items need to be sent. Having them be well-defined makes the review step easier. For now my initial schema is:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGoogle Keep\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003einbox for capturing new items, should be reviewed and cleaned regularly\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eshort reference notes can be kept here for quick access\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTrello\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efor lists, such as todo lists, ideas lists, project lists\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStandardNotes\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efor reference material that can be stored plaintext\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGoogle Docs\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efor reference material that requires formatted documents or spreadsheets\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efor document drafts that will later be published elsewhere\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: I have largely abandoned Evernote because of free account limitations. I also want to reduce Dropbox usage for the same reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully this scheme lets me be a bit more organized than I have in the past! I would also love to hear about how other people organize their notes and lists!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

If I had stayed in the US another month maybe I could have gone to Vegas to attend and lose badly. Instead, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d write about fighting games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI consider fighting games one of my weaknesses, in the sense that (a) I easily succumb to the temptation to spend money on them; and (b) I\u0026rsquo;m not very good at them. Example of (a): I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I\u0026rsquo;ve purchased Street Fighter IV on at least 4 different platforms, including all DLC. Example of (b): I have yet to advance past bronze rank in online Street Fighter V, despite having purchased the game at launch back in 2016.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike many in my generation, I got my introduction to fighting games with the arcade release of \u003cstrong\u003eStreet Fighter II\u003c/strong\u003e in the arcades in the early 90s. Prior to that, my arcade experience had been mostly side-scrolling beat-em ups like the old \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgF_VMQ19aA\"\u003eX-Men arcade game\u003c/a\u003e. I remember my brother and I literally playing the SF2 arcade release like \u0026ldquo;scrubs\u0026rdquo;, i.e., often times scrubbing our palms over the buttons trying to get moves going. Back then arcade machines didn\u0026rsquo;t come with instructions and you had to figure out how the character moves worked by experimentation. I remember he preferred playing Ryu/Ken, while I liked Guile. We didn\u0026rsquo;t really do combos, most of the time we just did Flash Kicks (which we called the \u0026ldquo;Slice\u0026rdquo;), Sonic Booms, Fireballs, and Dragon Punches most of the time. We also found it hard to understand what the Japanese characters were saying; we called Ryu\u0026rsquo;s hurricane kick the \u0026ldquo;Kat-kat-nougat\u0026rdquo; because that\u0026rsquo;s what it sounded like he was shouting! The other characters were mysteries! We didn\u0026rsquo;t know how Zangief worked for example. And I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure we never finished the arcade mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStreet Fighter II eventually got a home release, I remember playing it for the first time at a friend\u0026rsquo;s house when he got his copy first. We would be playing SF2 on the SNES a lot. I remember the annoyance when playing SF2 at another person\u0026rsquo;s house, I\u0026rsquo;d have to configure my controller because I didn\u0026rsquo;t use the default button layout. I used a layout called \u0026ldquo;YXLBAR\u0026rdquo; (with the heavy attacks on the SNES shoulder buttons) instead of the default \u0026ldquo;YLXBRA\u0026rdquo;. Rumor has it someone used an insane layout like \u0026ldquo;YBAXLR\u0026rdquo;. I also remember seeing the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY0KBMkvDyo\"\u003earcade intro for the updated \u003cstrong\u003eSuper Street Fighter II\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and being so amazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#9255053aacc428b06549560c2419f614-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2019/08/fighting-games/ssf2shinkuhadouken_huf0b9fa7f4cb0977fcabeeae76d376d02_338304_300x0_resize_box.gif\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"9255053aacc428b06549560c2419f614-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2019/08/fighting-games/ssf2shinkuhadouken.gif\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"7 Aug 2019 12:00am\"\u003e7 Aug 2019 12:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe tried out some other fighting game franchises on SNES too, like the Japanese \u003cstrong\u003eDragonball Butoden\u003c/strong\u003e series, a TMNT fighting game, and the \u003cstrong\u003eJustice League Task Force\u003c/strong\u003e fighting game. On the PC, we also had a copy of \u003cstrong\u003eMortal Kombat\u003c/strong\u003e 1. I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure our PC could handle color back then, we may have been playing Mortal Kombat in black and white! We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have controllers for the PC back then, so we had to play with two players to one keyboard, and if you held down four buttons or more on your side, the keyboard couldn\u0026rsquo;t register any more additional inputs so your opponent couldn\u0026rsquo;t move!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from playing with my brothers, me and some HS friends often got together at a friend\u0026rsquo;s house and would be playing fighting games \u0026lsquo;til the early morning hours. We got to try a lot more fighting games in the PS1 era, since games were cheaper in the PH then. A lot of it was still capcom stuff: \u003cstrong\u003eStreet Fighter Alpha 3\u003c/strong\u003e, the \u003cstrong\u003eStreet Fighter EX\u003c/strong\u003e series, \u003cstrong\u003eRival Schools\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eDarkstalkers\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eXmen vs Street Fighter\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eMarvel vs Capcom\u003c/strong\u003e 1. There were also the games that were similar in command style like the King of Fighters series and Guilty Gear. We would also sometimes try the 3d games like \u003cstrong\u003eTekken\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eSoul Edge\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eVirtua Fighter\u003c/strong\u003e, or \u003cstrong\u003eBattle Arena\u003c/strong\u003e Toshinden but those played a lot differently than SF-style games and they never really caught on with our group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe PS2 era brought with it one of our most played games of all time: the legendary \u003cstrong\u003eCapcom vs SNK 2\u003c/strong\u003e. With a ridiculous 48 characters and six different \u0026ldquo;grooves\u0026rdquo; or playstyles to choose from, there was a lot of variety in the game and we rarely got tired of it. The \u003cstrong\u003eStreet Fighter III\u003c/strong\u003e series also came out at around the same time, but we never got too much into it because \u003cstrong\u003eNew Generation\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eSecond Impact\u003c/strong\u003e only had home releases on Dreamcast; I remember we did play \u003cstrong\u003eThird Strike\u003c/strong\u003e for a while, but that was quickly overshadowed when CvS2 came out. There were a lot of other Capcom/SNK/other fighting game releases we tried out at this time too, but CvS2 was the main one I remember from this era.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the PS3 era came \u003cstrong\u003eStreet Fighter IV\u003c/strong\u003e and a new dimension: online play! This is where I got my first indication that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t very good at fighting games, despite enjoying them so much. I was fine when playing on the couch casually with my friends, but online was another matter entirely. I remember being so frustrated at the \u0026ldquo;ten wins in a row\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;get C rank for all characters\u0026rdquo; achievements in SF4 because of how difficult they were. Around this time, my brother and I also tried attending a local tournament or two, but we did poorly. During this era, I also tried out games like \u003cstrong\u003eBlazblue\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eInjustice\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003ePersona 4 Arena\u003c/strong\u003e, and so on. (ArcSys really got it\u0026rsquo;s groove in this era as far as I\u0026rsquo;m concerned.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was during this era that I started preferring fight sticks as well. I bought my first fight stick for the PS3, and I found I liked it a lot more than playing with a controller. My play group still prefers controllers, so when I meet up with them I have to suck it up, but at home and for online play I\u0026rsquo;m usually on a fight stick. This generation also marked the first time for me to play the \u003cstrong\u003eSmash Brothers\u003c/strong\u003e series via the Wii U installment, but I never could get the hang of that game either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally that brings us to the PS4 era and of course \u003cstrong\u003eStreet Fighter V\u003c/strong\u003e. SF5 isn\u0026rsquo;t too popular these days, mainly due to some balancing issues and lack of innovation,making the game feel stale, but it\u0026rsquo;s still very hype at EVO. My old play group doesn\u0026rsquo;t get to play much anymore, mostly because the one who usually brought the console has moved abroad, but we still manage to meet up at least once a year or so and put up our fighting dukes. I still play SF5 online, though not as often as I did with SF4. Matchmaking is a lot tougher, probably because I\u0026rsquo;ve been stuck at bronze level all this time. I still get hyped for fighting games when EVO rolls around, and I\u0026rsquo;m always tempted to buy these flashy new fighting games that come out. Just this weekend I purchased \u003cstrong\u003eDragonball Fighter Z\u003c/strong\u003e on Steam after trying it out for the free weekend and enjoying it. It helps that it has a lot of nice single-player content so I can justify the cost even if I don\u0026rsquo;t win/play online too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy am I so bad at fighting games? I\u0026rsquo;m sure part of it is old age - these days my reaction time isn\u0026rsquo;t as good as I\u0026rsquo;d want it to be (maybe it never was?!?). A large part of it is due to laziness - fighting games take a lot of practice, and you need a lot of experience to do well online. You also need to put in the time in training to be able to pull off execution of more complicated moves like \u003ca href=\"https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Focus_Attack#Dash_Cancelling\"\u003eSF4\u0026rsquo;s famous FADC\u003c/a\u003e. I don\u0026rsquo;t have time to really play fighting games all the much anymore. I was doing slightly better online during the PS3 era because my play group and me and my brothers were still playing regularly, but with SF5, I don\u0026rsquo;t really have anyone to practice offline with on a regular basis, and just spending a lot of time in training bores me, so here we are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do I still enjoy playing fighting games so much even though I\u0026rsquo;m bad at them? I\u0026rsquo;ve thought about this a lot, and I think the main reason other than general competitiveness, is that I enjoy the spectacle (these days at least). It\u0026rsquo;s one of the few genres where I can truly appreciate the over-the-top graphics and cool moves and supers and so on. When I get a new fighting game and try out a new character one of the first things I do is try to get a super off to see how cool it is. I also enjoy the variance in game play - which is why I prefer fighting games with larger rosters like CvS2, and I especially like it when there is a random character select option. When my play group meets up, we always do random character selection where possible, it exposes us to all the characters and everything the game has to offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn recent years it has become easier to enjoy fighting games even if you\u0026rsquo;re not good at them or you don\u0026rsquo;t have much time to play, since there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more tournaments these days and many of them are live-streamed and available to watch on demand online. I still want to play the games, but when I can\u0026rsquo;t find a match, watching tournament play is a good alternative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy reflexes can only get worse as the years pass, but I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;ll still be playing fighting games for years to come, and I\u0026rsquo;ll probably buy Street Fighter VI day one when it comes out for the PS5 or whatever. I may not have the skills to be the world champion in fighting games, but I\u0026rsquo;ll always be a street fighter at heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
