            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI love sleeping. And taking naps. But I\u0026rsquo;m not very good at doing it at night. Insomnia is a common problem for me. I often find it difficult to go to sleep at night, taking upwards of 1-2 hours in bed before I can manage to fall asleep. Of course all that time lying there feels unproductive, so I\u0026rsquo;ll often be tempted to to grab a nearby screen and read something online or such, which makes it even harder to get to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t blame the electronics devices completely, though. I remember even when I was a kid I would sometimes have trouble sleeping at night due to a hyperactive brain having too many trains of thoughts to resolve. Something I still carry to this day, though I like to imagine my ability to compartmentalize thoughts has improved since then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember when Warcraft III came out, one of the hero characters had an ability to send other units to sleep and I always chose that ability because I wanted to have it IRL. Not to use on other people, but on myself so I could sleep on demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting a continuous block of eight hours of sleep (or even six or seven hours) is pretty rare for me as well. Usually I\u0026rsquo;ll wake up after 1-2 hours, then if I\u0026rsquo;m lucky I manage to go to sleep again. If not, sometimes I\u0026rsquo;ll give up and work on stuff until it\u0026rsquo;s breakfast time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes I try to force-reset my sleep cycle by going like 36 hours without sleep so I can\u0026rsquo;t help but be real tired and sleep continuously for a while. But it usually doesn\u0026rsquo;t last. And I\u0026rsquo;m at that age where going 36 hours without sleep isn\u0026rsquo;t really that easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that since I quit working full-time I usually have a highly irregular daily schedule. Combined with a tendency to take naps during the day, it leads to the irregular sleep cycle. I also like having breakfast early so I often wake up at like 5 to 6 in the AM, no matter how late I went to sleep, then just recover sleep with naps during the day, making it harder to go to sleep early in the night, and so on. A bit of a vicious cycle. Also, it makes me a weird kind of cross between a morning person and a night owl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the problems with sleep is that even though it feels great, when you sleep so much it feels unproductive, like you could\u0026rsquo;ve put that time to better use. I remember maybe a decade or so ago, I was reading about the idea of polyphasic sleep. I liked the idea because it meant fewer sleep hours overall during the day, which meant more time for doing stuff. Sadly, I never got it to work. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit challenging to do it with a nine-to-five job, but even without that, I don\u0026rsquo;t really have the discipline to keep it up. And also, I like sleeping a lot sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ll end this post with this tweet:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eGOD: You have probably 70-80 years at most before you die, ideally.\u003cbr\u003eMAN: oh. well, i\u0026#39;ll make the most of-\u003cbr\u003eGOD: You\u0026#39;ll be unconscious for 1/3 of the time. \u003cbr\u003eMAN: ..uh\u003cbr\u003eGOD: *leans in* That\u0026#39;ll be your favorite part.\u003c/p\u003e\u0026mdash; Ray ðŸ¦” (@SirEviscerate) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SirEviscerate/status/943137889977819138?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eDecember 19, 2017\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e \u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026hellip;then I\u0026rsquo;ll go take a nap.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Like many people, I used to have a mild fear of speaking in front of a bunch of people/strangers, but as I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten older and cared less about what other people think, this kind of faded away. But the main issue with these two items is that they require a lot of prep, and that\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;m generally bad at (chalk it up to lack of discipline etc). I generally tend to prefer to \u0026ldquo;wing it\u0026rdquo;, even back in the college days, not that I\u0026rsquo;m particularly good at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame streaming seems like it could be good. Not much prep needed aside from some general familiarity with the game I\u0026rsquo;m playing. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;ve already set up \u003ca href=\"https://twitch.tv/twitchyroy\"\u003ea twitch channel\u003c/a\u003e before and did a few test broadcasts. My main problem with game streaming is that there\u0026rsquo;s a need to be talking all the time - avoiding dead air. And it can feel weird doing that with nobody around. I guess it\u0026rsquo;s more of a beginning streamer problem? If there were people in the twitch chat it would probably be easier. Or if there was someone else in the room with me while I\u0026rsquo;m streaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA friend also sometimes suggests I make a webcomic, that also seems like a viable option. My problem with that one is the prep again. You need to be able to come up with material on a regular basis, and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I can do that. As I say to my friend, I\u0026rsquo;m a generally witty guy, but my wit is more of \u0026ldquo;in the moment\u0026rdquo; insted of something I can summon on command. But then again, maybe the fact that I\u0026rsquo;m now able to make daily blog posts means a regular (weekly?) webcomic would now be viable?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn issue I have with trying to pick up new hobbies is the climb you have as a beginner, where everything you try sucks at first. I really dislike that initial learning period. But as Jake the Dog says \u0026ldquo;Dude, sucking at something is the first step towards being sort of good at something.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

When we were kids my dad had a few Chinese language learning books laying around the house, but they were mostly inscrutable, too difficult for a kid to pick up without instruction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t go to Chinese school.

I was exposed to a bit more Chinese culture at my first job, where there were special activites during the Mooncake festival and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, I do think it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to acknowledge and celebrate one\u0026rsquo;s cultural heritage even when one doesn\u0026rsquo;t particularly enjoy it.

There is also definitely an element of subjectivity as to which answers should be accepted. One time a player complained that his answer \u003ccode\u003e\u0026quot;Batman vs Superman Dawn of Justice\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e should count for \u003ccode\u003e\u0026quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e, but for this particular question I had chosen not to allow \u0026ldquo;vs\u0026rdquo; for \u0026ldquo;v\u0026rdquo; because that was the actual movie title, which might be unreasonable now that I think about it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do know that I need to implement a better \u0026ldquo;synonym\u0026rdquo; handling, i.e. mapping of \u003ccode\u003e\u0026quot;v\u0026quot;\u0026lt;-\u0026gt;\u0026quot;vs\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e and other terms like \u003ccode\u003e\u0026quot;mr\u0026quot;\u0026lt;-\u0026gt;\u0026quot;mister\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003e\u0026quot;natl\u0026quot;\u0026lt;-\u0026gt;\u0026quot;national\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e. The problem with handling things like that is that is the possible combinations of phrases expands when multiple such terms are found in the same answer, so it can\u0026rsquo;t scale too well. I suppose I need to normalize the answer sets at the time the question is defined. What do you know, I figured out how to do something just by writing a blog post!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do have a bunch of other enhancements planned for the trivia bot, including support for slack and discord, and a longer time frame roadmap, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure when I can commit more time to it. Still, it\u0026rsquo;s turned out to be a pretty fun endeavor, I\u0026rsquo;m hoping it leads to something cool!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI picked up Slay the Spire during the last (Winter) Steam Sale, not really knowing what I was getting into. I had heard some good things, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t really know much other than it was a roguelite where I had to go through a dungeon. But it was cheap so I took the dive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was pleasantly surprised to find that not only was it a roguelite, it was also a deckbuilding game! I love deckbuilding games, they often generate a significant amount of variance that translates to fun, and pairing that mechanic with a roguelite meant each run would be pretty interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo in Slay the Spire, you choose a character from three choices, each of which have a different set of powers and cards. You go through the dungeons, one room at a time. Each room might have an enemy, a treasure or a random event. The map for the entire dungeon act is available ahead of time, so you can plot your route as needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#1c94092f8f4b7ae78ac2c2ef706b0caa-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2019/02/game-review-slay-the-spire/slaythespire_hu35bffa5482582b07d5d679f7c3d03273_358404_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"1c94092f8f4b7ae78ac2c2ef706b0caa-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2019/02/game-review-slay-the-spire/slaythespire.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"2 Feb 2019 5:56am\"\u003e2 Feb 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour character is equipped with a deck of cards that includes attacks and blocks and powers. Along the way you can add new cards to your deck by defeating enemies or opening chests or buying from merchants and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are three available characters to play (as of now), and they offer pretty different play styles. There\u0026rsquo;s the Ironclad, who\u0026rsquo;s kind of a straightforward attack and block kind of guy. There\u0026rsquo;s the Silent, a rogue who prefers chaining multiple attacks or using poison. And there\u0026rsquo;s the Defect, who summons persistent orbs that perform various functions. The dungeon proceeds the same way for each class, but they have different card sets to choose from so battles often play out differently, and each character has different builds you can lean towards to increase your odds of a successful run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBattles proceed in a turn-based manner. You draw some number of cards from your deck and each turn, and play as many as your energy allows. The unique thing about Slay the Spire is that during your turn, you can see each enemy\u0026rsquo;s intent. That is, you can see what the enemy will do next turn, more or less, via an icon over their head (see image).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#aafaacd2db44b2628a0dce0eb63cb6a4-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2019/02/game-review-slay-the-spire/slaythespireintent_hu4b75871302203df90c0b1fcd01f05aff_410558_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"aafaacd2db44b2628a0dce0eb63cb6a4-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2019/02/game-review-slay-the-spire/slaythespireintent.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"2 Feb 2019 5:56am\"\u003e2 Feb 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the enemy plans to attack, there\u0026rsquo;s an icon over their head indicating how much damage and how many attacks they\u0026rsquo;re going to do. If they\u0026rsquo;re going to block, there\u0026rsquo;s a shield icon. And there\u0026rsquo;s icon for if they are going to do buffs or debuffs. In a sense the game gives you perfect information about what the enemies are going to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis means every turn is sort of a mini-puzzle: what are the cards I need to play to minimize the amount of damage I take (always your priority, since taking too much damage endangers your run) or should I try to avoid debuffs or can I maybe already beat the enemy this turn?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt all plays out in the framework of the spire, the dungeon you\u0026rsquo;re trying to conquer, with the map being randomly generated rooms. Every room presents choices: which card to add to your deck? Which card to remove? Should I risk some HP to gain a relic? And so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s all very fun, and quite challenging. It can also be frustrating, but since the game gives you near perfect information (you even know at the start of a floor which among a set of bosses you are going to be facing at the end of the floor), any deaths are always at least partly your fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tend to wait until I\u0026rsquo;ve \u0026ldquo;completed\u0026rdquo; games before I review them, and for Slay the Spire I did manage to finish a run with each class at least once. But I\u0026rsquo;ve only scratched the surface, there\u0026rsquo;s a ton of content beyond that. I haven\u0026rsquo;t even gotten the \u0026ldquo;true ending\u0026rdquo; yet, which only becomes available after beating the game once with each class, as the \u0026ldquo;true ending\u0026rdquo; boss is quite difficult. And even beyond that there\u0026rsquo;s special cards to unlock, daily challenges with different parameters, and even an endless mode I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried yet. I also hear that the devs are very diligent and add content on a regular basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlay the Spire recently went \u0026ldquo;live\u0026rdquo; and left Early Access, just last month, and they\u0026rsquo;re planning for a Switch port too. The one disadvantage of the game for me is that each run takes a considerable amount of time (You can actually quit at any time during a run and resume it later, but I always feel compelled to finish each run in one sitting), and I have a lot of other games to play. I\u0026rsquo;ll still probably revisit the Spire from time to time, but frankly trying to \u0026ldquo;complete\u0026rdquo; the game, Steam achievements and all, seems like a huge task, given the large amount of variance in the game, but maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll get there someday.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I picked up Slay the Spire during the last (Winter) Steam Sale, not really knowing what I was getting into. I had heard some good things, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t really know much other than it was a roguelite where I had to go through a dungeon. But it was cheap so I took the dive.\nI was pleasantly surprised to find that not only was it a roguelite, it was also a deckbuilding game!",
