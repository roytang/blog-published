            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA friend of mine had an informal consultation with me the other day (read: asked me questions over FB messenger) about what their IT staff was telling them about a file upload vulnerability that had been recently exploited in one of their applications. Obviously it was difficult for me to judge given that I didn\u0026rsquo;t know all the details, but for me it was most likely a vulnerability introduced in the application code itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with file upload vulnerability, the simplest type of attack goes something like this: the user (or attacker in this case) uploads a file using a file upload function on the system (a common functionality), and the system allows the user to execute that file as if it were code. This can happen if the application saves the uploaded file directly into the web application path, such that it can be executed directly from the client. This is a common vulnerability listed on the OWASP page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, your application provides a function to upload an image to use as the user\u0026rsquo;s profile picture, then the applications stores the uploaded image in the file system directly in the application path such that it is served to the user as something like /images/uploadedfile.png. However, if the user uploads instead a file that can be executed directly by the web server, such as a .PHP file for PHP webservers or a .JSP file for Java containers, the user can now execute any code that was in his uploaded file simply by invoking /images/uploadedfile.php! And this access would be absolute, everything your system has access to will be fair game: file system, network, database, etc., and provides the attacker with more information for succeeding attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key to protecting yourself from file upload vulnerabilities is one of the basic tenets of web application security: \u003cstrong\u003eNever trust user submitted data\u003c/strong\u003e. This means that you should validate uploaded files \u0026ndash; maybe you only allow image files for example \u0026ndash; and your validation should be thorough. You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t validate only be checking the file extension or the content type in the HTTP header, as these can be faked. Use a server-side API call to verify the file type.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, \u003cstrong\u003edo not store or serve the uploaded files in a way that they will be executed by the web application\u003c/strong\u003e. For Java webapps I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on, often we will store uploaded files in the Oracle database, and when they need to be served they are dumped directly into the response OutputStream. If you \u003cem\u003emust\u003c/em\u003e store the uploads in the file system, do it in a location that is not accessible from the web server directly. For J2EE containers that can be inside /WEB-INF/ or outside the application path itself. For PHP, it should be outside the HTTP doc folder of the Apache server.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the PHP example above, you should also avoid serving the image files using a PHP include. If the URL to access the image is something like uploadedimage?image_id=1 and your code maps that image_id to a file on the file system and serves it using a PHP include, it will still be executed by the system as code. Instead the file should be dumped directly into the response. One way to do it is as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u0026lt;?php\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eheader(\u0026lsquo;Content-Type: [whatever your content type is]');\nheader(\u0026ldquo;Content-Disposition: inline; filename=\u0026quot;$file_name\u0026quot;\u0026quot;);\necho $file;\n?\u0026gt;\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is only the most basic attack. File upload functions can be exploited in a number of other ways. For example, the attacker could upload a number of large files to attempt to take down your server due to insufficient disk space (prevention: restrict file upload size, prevent user uploading too many files). So developers need to be carefully in how they allow file uploads in their system and be aware of possible vulnerabilities and exploits, the OWASP page linked above lists some more prevention measures.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Is this what life is? Is it just obligation?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"ui_qtext_rendered_qtext\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\"\u003eDuring the twelve years I worked at my previous company, I had never had a leave request denied. Not because my managers are particularly strict or lenient, but because I prefer to take into account the situation at work before applying for a leave. If we are in a critical period where we can scarcely afford a person taking a day off, I’m not going to ask for a leave. Or if I really have to, I’m going to try to arrange to make contingency plans, i.e. see if someone can cover my responsibilities while I’m away, or see if some targets or schedules can be adjusted to accommodate my leave. As an employee, it is part of your obligation to take non-emergency leaves responsibly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\"\u003eThat being said, life is not all obligation. You are not banned from just not going to work that day. Of course there may be consequences. You may lose a day’s pay. It may reflect poorly on your evaluation as an employee. It is up to you to weigh those consequences against your desire to attend your nephew’s birthday. If you decide that you can’t take those consequences even to attend your nephew’s birthday, then you have already made a decision as to how to prioritize obligation versus your personal desires. That is what life is - a series of decisions of prioritization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\"\u003eOf course, the above assumes that your employer is reasonable and is willing to let you take a day’s leave if the workload can accommodate it. If your employer is the sort that like to be unreasonable and keep you around just to squeeze more work from you, then you might have bigger problems than just leaves, and you might want to consider looking for employment elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\"\u003eOne other thing: if your employer is unreasonable about this sort of thing, but you decide to stay anyway, next time don’t bother giving him a detailed reason for your leave request. Just say you have personal matters to attend to. Or if you feel exceptionally sneaky, just pretend to be sick on that day, or pretend to have an emergency - weigh your personal ethics if it is acceptable to you to deceive your employer in this manner, if your employer is not particularly reasonable you may be able to justify it to yourself\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eDuring my adult life, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to learn or at least expose myself to one new skill or programming language every year. For example, over the past year or so I\u0026rsquo;ve been studying, dabbling, or trying out the following: game development using Unity, technical analysis of stocks, Spanish, driving a car, and even some simple cooking! I\u0026rsquo;ve also been regularly practicing to improve my skills in writing and sketching. I probably even forgot a few things I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to learn. I also have a backlog of programming languages and frameworks I\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting to learn and/or try out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere can be a tendency for some people, especially those tired of formal education, to fall into the trap of thinking that once they become adults they no longer need to learn new things or improve their skills, but an attitude towards continuous learning and improvement pushes us towards more fulfilling lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are even certain professions such as software development or medicine where you pretty much have to keep up with the latest trends or new technologies in order to maintain your skill set. But even outside of such professions, a lifetime of learning can be enriching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s literally too. Learning and exposing yourself to new things is a process of growth and discovery that can lead you to better career options and be more financially rewarding. Scott Adams (creator of Dilbert) gave some advice that \u003ca href=\"http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html\"\u003eyou can make yourself more valuable by combining two or more skills\u003c/a\u003e. The more skills you learn, the more likely you are to find a combination of skills that gives you the edge towards financial success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt work, I\u0026rsquo;ve always been happy to take on tasks that required me to learn new frameworks or programming languages. Without an attitude towards continuous learning, your skills will stagnate. You\u0026rsquo;ll be working on the same sort of tasks again and again, leading to boredom and unhappiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApart from the possible financial rewards, continuous learning has a few other soft benefits. It keeps you mentally sharp and healthy even as you grow older. It can help you meet new people. It can give you new conversation topics with your friends. It builds your confidence and leads to trying even more new things. It helps you look at things and situations with fresh eyes or different angles. And it means you\u0026rsquo;re almost never bored!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have kids, it sets an example for them that learning is a good thing and definitely you should be trying to instill the same example in them. Encourage their curiosity and facilitate their learning whenever they show interest in something, especially outside of school, to reinforce the idea that learning isn\u0026rsquo;t something that can only happen in the classroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can be exhausting sometimes to be trying to keep up with everything and learn new things all the time, but you owe it to yourself (and perhaps even to the world!) to continuously try to be a better person.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
