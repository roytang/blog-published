            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAs you might have heard, there was a helluva storm in the Philippines yesterday, and I was pretty much stuck at the \u003ca href=\"http://whatwouldjtdo.blogspot.com/\"\u003eTitan Hobby Shop\u003c/a\u003e for most of the day. Luckily, that meant I get to play in the Zendikar prerelease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy Zendikar prerelease record: 1-3 =/ I had a decent pool and went with a UW build, but I played too loosely and the stars just weren\u0026rsquo;t aligned. My pool was very bad value-wise as well, having mostly \u0026ldquo;nice\u0026rdquo; rares like \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Lullmage%20Mentor\"\u003eLullmage Mentor\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Lorthos,%20the%20Tidemaker\"\u003eLorthos, the Tidemaker\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy sealed pool had \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Blade%20of%20the%20Bloodchief\"\u003eBlade of the Bloodchief\u003c/a\u003e, which I was a bit skeptical about, but it\u0026rsquo;s pretty good in a situation where you\u0026rsquo;re always trading creatures or you have lots of removal. It would probably be lots better in a vampire deck though. The Legendary Octopus was pretty good if you got to untap with it, obviously. I also had \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sphinx%20of%20Lost%20Truths\"\u003eSphinx of Lost Truths\u003c/a\u003e but it was never able to save me in time. The \u0026ldquo;loot 3\u0026rdquo; ability isn\u0026rsquo;t very good when you only have one card in hand, so you better make sure you have a lot of guys to hold the fort while you wait for the seven mana to kick it. \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sphinx%20of%20Jwar%20Isle\"\u003eSphinx of Jwar Isle\u003c/a\u003e is a lot better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to face \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sorin%20Markov\"\u003eSorin Markov\u003c/a\u003e in one game, and although he costs six, that first ability is a game breaker, especially against my U/W sealed, which had tons of small guys that easily get eaten by his vampire abilities. I lost that game T_T\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won only one pack (actually I won off a BYE \u0026gt;.\u0026lt;), and the pool was so bad, I sold off the pool and the prize pack (contained \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Bloodghast\"\u003eBloodghast\u003c/a\u003e) so that I could join a booster draft. Nothing else to do anyway!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI first picked a \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Verdant%20Catacombs\"\u003eVerdant Catacombs\u003c/a\u003e, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t get heavily into black. I got some late pick \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Bladetusk%20Boar\"\u003eBladetusk Boar\u003c/a\u003e and found myself settled into RG. I won the draft on the back of my special ability to mana screw opponents, and thus managed to salvage some prize packs from nowhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Zendikar, I\u0026rsquo;m still not sure what to make of Zendikar limited. If you get enough cheap allies you can make a blazingly fast deck. The best common ally is in white (\u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Kazandu%20Blademaster\"\u003eKazandu Blademaster\u003c/a\u003e), but I think it\u0026rsquo;s possible to build good curves using any color combination of allies, except possibly black which has no 2 or 3-drop ally. I had the red Ally that makes all your guys FTKs, but he never became relevant, six mana may be too high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Spire%20Barrage\"\u003eSpire Barrage\u003c/a\u003e was a nice late game finisher, obviously way better than \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Lava%20Axe\"\u003eLava Axe\u003c/a\u003e. Red seems ok in Zen limited as there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of common removal \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Burst%20Lightning\"\u003eBurst Lightning\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Inferno%20Trap\"\u003eInferno Trap\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Torch%20Slinger\"\u003eTorch Slinger\u003c/a\u003e and of course the aforementioned \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Spire%20Barrage\"\u003eSpire Barrage\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSealed is a lot slower than draft as usual; I was watching one sealed game where one guy managed to kick \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Rite%20of%20Replication\"\u003eRite of Replication\u003c/a\u003e, but he targeted \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Shoal%20Serpent\"\u003eShoal Serpent\u003c/a\u003e and hoped for the land drop next turn rather than target \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Kor%20Hookmaster\"\u003eKor Hookmaster\u003c/a\u003e to win the game on the spot.

So this entry is backdated to the day after Ondoy, but is written from the perspective and imperfect recollection of 2020 me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a Saturday. Back then we still had half-day Saturday work, and the storm had yet to hit, so I was at the office in the morning. On Saturdays, I usually came in really early (like 7-ish), so I could leave by 10, especially if there was a Magic tournament to be attended. And there was!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter work, I went to a nearby Magic store to play in the Zendikar prerelease. The store was along Shaw Boulevard, it\u0026rsquo;s gone now in 2020. I believe the prerelease started after lunch, and by that time, the skies were already dark and the wind was picking up and light rains had started. By late afternoon, the rains were pouring hard. There were probably 24ish of us there in the small shop (typical prerelease pod size, plus some staff). I went \u003ca href=\"/2009/09/zendikar-prerelease-and-limited-impressions/\"\u003e1-3 at the prerelease\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I spent most of the day indoors playing Magic. By dinner time, I considered trying to go somewhere to eat, but when I went downstairs to survey the situation things were bleak. The winds and rains were very strong. I had an umbrella but waters were ankle-to-knee high outside the building, so going anywhere seemed unlikely. There was a Shakey\u0026rsquo;s and a ministop at the bottom of the building, I think I had dinner at the Shakey\u0026rsquo;s and got some snacks at the ministop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only around 8-9pm when the rains and winds settled down a bit and people started considering braving the weather to get home. I was a commuter then (still am), and getting a taxi at Shaw seemed impossible, so I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what to do. Luckily, one of the other players was driving to Katipunan, so I hitched a ride with him. He dropped me off at a gas station near what would in the future be the UP Town Center. I called home to let them know where I was, and then went about trying to find a taxi to get me the rest of the way. It took me around 30ish minutes to get one, I think, which was not unreasonable for that hour and that weather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI \u003ca href=\"/2009/09/4393887978/\"\u003efinally got home\u003c/a\u003e a bit past 10pm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn hindsight, I was really fortunate, compared to other people. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t affected too much and I was indoors for most of the day. In even more hindsight, it might have been foolish to still go to the prerelease at that time!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
