Which meant when I flew back home with them during the recent trip, we came back with an additional 3 fully-packed pieces of luggage full of shoes and clothes and such. As someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t really indulge in shopping, I can\u0026rsquo;t relate to this, and in fact it runs anathema to my philosophy of always packing as little as necessary when travelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there are people I know (mostly younger people) who seem to be travelling every weekend or every other weekend and they\u0026rsquo;re always at the beach or some tourist spot or exotic location. I find this difficult to relate to as well, not only because that seems like an unnecessarily expensive lifestyle, but if you\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;getting away\u0026rdquo; every weekend, won\u0026rsquo;t that sort of thing become routine?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, I don\u0026rsquo;t view travelling as a vacation or as a rest period. Travelling is expensive and stressful and \u003ca href=\"/2019/07/travel-anxiety-part-2/\"\u003ecan be anxiety-inducing\u003c/a\u003e. Not my idea of vacation or rest. For me travel is either purposeful (usually for me that means either work trips or playing \u003ca href=\"/tags/grand-prix/\"\u003eMagic Grand Prix\u003c/a\u003e), or as a tourist (something I\u0026rsquo;ve only started doing as recently as the last 5 years).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think the real value of travel is in getting a chance to step away from your daily routines. Stepping out from your usual environments and the familiar culture around you and immersing in something different. Experiencing something different lets you challenge your own culture and world view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when we come back from our travel, when we reacquaint ourselves with what we had before, we get to see our old rhythms and comfort zones with fresh eyes. What used to be routine may look different in light of recent experiences. When resuming old habits we get to ask a fresh set of \u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Do I really need this?\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;Could this be done better?\u0026rdquo;. We gain a newfound appreciation of things we missed. And hopefully, we are changed for the better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think that\u0026rsquo;s where the value is. We travel so we can be forever changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Programming heroes take on challenging assignments and write mountains of code. They work vast amounts of overtime. They become indispensable to their projects. Success, it seems, rests squarely on their shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProject managers both love and fear hero programmers because they are smart, temperamental, and sometimes a little self-righteous, and because the managers don\u0026rsquo;t see any way to complete the project without them. In a tight labor market, replacing them isn\u0026rsquo;t an option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, the reality is that for every programming hero who is capable of monumental coding achievements, there are other pathological programming disasters who just don\u0026rsquo;t know how to work well with others. They hoard design information and source code. They refuse to participate in technical reviews. They refuse to follow standards established by the team. The sum total of their actions is to prevent other team members from making potentially valuable contributions. A significant number of programming heroes don\u0026rsquo;t turn out to be heroes at all; they turn out to be prima donna programming ball hogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the negative feedback, I found myself relating to the list in the thread above because most if not all of these items could have been used to describe myself at some point or another in my career. Especially in my earlier years, I had a profound dislike for meetings and documentation and process. I think this sort of attitude stems from the transition from being a solo developer (which you largely are in school) who enjoys the act of coding to being part of a team tasked to deliver the software. The first-time team member may find it difficult to appreciate having to do all these non-coding things (meetings, mentoring, documentation) because he doesn\u0026rsquo;t yet have an appreciation of how they can make things smoother for the entire team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot all of the items in the list are bad habits. Luckily, I think I grew out of most of the bad ones as my career went on and I became part of different teams and filled different roles. Not all of these are bad habits though.

They tend to work when very few folks are around. If there is a crowd or all-hands meeting, they are not visible. Most of them are late-night coders and come late to the office.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think locally, people tend to come in later during the day instead of earlier, due to Metro Manila traffic. I knew that if I wanted some focused time, I could come in early and not much people would bother me. I think this is generally an ok practice, as long as you\u0026rsquo;re still available during core hours when your team needs you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e10x engineers laptop screen background color is typically black (they always change defaults). Their keyboard keys such as i, f, x are usually worn out than of a, s, and e (email senders).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one is just straight-up cargo-cult nonsense.

If a QA or support folks alert an issue, they know precisely where the fault (or bug) is and can fix the same in hours vs days\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have been in this kind of situation, although I guess it\u0026rsquo;s a bit of an exaggeration. Typically if you\u0026rsquo;re working in a team with a nontrivial codebase and you \u0026ldquo;know everything\u0026rdquo;, some of your knowledge may be shallow, and some other devs who spent more time with each module may have more in-depth knowledge of how a particular module works. Having one guy with good oversight into the codebase can be handy for the team - for the reason cited above, they may easily be identify the cause of an issue, but the team should make sure he\u0026rsquo;s not the only guy familiar with everything. Some redundancy is needed so that you aren\u0026rsquo;t always dependent on the same person everytime. It\u0026rsquo;s also bad for you as the developer who knows everything about the codebase, as it can be very hard to go on vacation, you\u0026rsquo;ll have a tendency to get calls such as \u0026ldquo;Hey, just a really quick question, do you know where is the code that does XYZ?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMost of the 10x engineers are full-stack engineers. For them code is code, they don\u0026rsquo;t care whether it is front-end, back-end, API, database, serverless, etc. I have rarely seen them doing UI work.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is still true for me. And just the other day during a call I had to give a disclaimer that my UI work isn\u0026rsquo;t the best lol. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is indicative of disdain for specialists, there should be room in a team for both \u003ca href=\"/2016/12/generalists-and-specialists-in-dev-teams/\"\u003egeneralists and specialists\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e10x engineers can convert \u0026ldquo;thought\u0026rdquo; into \u0026ldquo;code\u0026rdquo; in their mind and write it in an iterative fashion. Given a product feature, they can write that entire feature in one or two sittings of 4 to 6 hours with a caffeinated drink without distraction.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, this is just describing a developer who\u0026rsquo;s in the zone. It\u0026rsquo;s true that developers who can get into the zone on a regular basis are likely to be much more productive, that\u0026rsquo;s a tautology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e10x engineers rarely look at help documentation of classes or methods. They know it in memory and can recall from memory. They write code at the same ease as writing English. No breaks, no pauce, just type.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one is a bit of BS, especially in modern software development where we have the meme of developers coding by stackoverflow. It might have been true in the older days when there weren\u0026rsquo;t a billion and one APIs and frameworks to know and learn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e10x engineers are always learning new frameworks, languages ahead of everyone in the company. They are not afraid of anything new. If there is something new (e.g. blockchain) they gobble up, setup, experiment before anyone is getting started.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one is still true for me as of now. I still enjoy exploring new frameworks, languages and technologies, though I don\u0026rsquo;t always have the time for it. I think this is a good trait for a developer to have, but at the same time it may be dangerous to expect or require this of developers when putting together a team. Not everyone enjoys coding, and developers shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be penalized for not wanting to do software stuff outside of work hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e10x engineers are poor mentors as they can\u0026rsquo;t teach others on what to do OR parcel the work. They always think \u0026ldquo;It takes too long to teach or discuss with others, I would rather do it myself.\u0026rdquo; They are also poor interviewers.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m sure I have uttered some variation of that quote more than once in my career. The tendency to try to carry all the load yourself is not only a disservice to yourself, it\u0026rsquo;s a disservice to your team as you\u0026rsquo;re not helping them grow. I will admit my mentoring skills in the early years wasn\u0026rsquo;t very good - I\u0026rsquo;m the type of mentor who tends to throw you into the deep end so you can quickly learn to swim. This is because that\u0026rsquo;s my personal learning style as well, I learn more from trying stuff than from a lecture or a book. I understand that not everyone learns the same way, so I do actively try to spot opportunities for me to learn to explain things better (I like to think writing in a blog helps!) and for \u003ca href=\"/2018/10/mentoring-in-software-development/\"\u003ebetter mentoring\u003c/a\u003e.

They write quality code and know exactly how the code has to evolve, and have a mental model of overall code structure. They write at most one design document, and the rest is in the code.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of the most productive engineers not hacking things can only come from an idealist who hasn\u0026rsquo;t experienced schedule pressure. While of course quality code is an ideal, the best engineers know when it is necessary to make tradeoffs and workarounds to meet requirements and schedules. And they will write as many documents as needed to make sure things can be understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e10x engineers rarely job hunt or move out of the company. They move out because you make their life miserable with the process, meetings, training, and other non-value-added activities. If you come across them, hold on to them. Celebrate them.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was true for me for the longest time, I stayed with my first company for 15 years before deciding to move on. I would suspect this tends to be true for the type of engineer I described who enjoys the coding part and not so much the dealing with people part of the job. Moving companies means a lot more noncoding work: meeting new people, learning new processes and procedures, more meetings and trainings and interviews and what not. Laziness is probably also a factor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe items listed here remind me of the type of programmer stereotype where one programmer goes into his office, tells nobody not to bother him, then comes out after three days having written all the code and solved all the company\u0026rsquo;s problems. It\u0026rsquo;s a ridiculous, dangerous stereotype that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mesh well with how modern software development teams work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not claiming that 10x engineers don\u0026rsquo;t exist, I\u0026rsquo;m sure they do, and I know from experience many of the above stereotypes can be true. But stereotypes are just that - stereotypes. Every programmer has had a different path and there can be superproductive programmers who also know how to well work with teams and can be great mentors and write great documentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m also not necessarily claiming to be a 10x programmer even though I claim to relate to the items here (false humility?).

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eSince I was going to be staying in the US for more than a month, on my first day there, I went over to Best Buy and got myself a T-Mobile sim card and plan, and the staff there helpfully offered to install the sim into my phone, then the Asus Zenfone Max 4. Upon handling my phone, she commented \u0026ldquo;you know you\u0026rsquo;re battery\u0026rsquo;s expanding, right? That\u0026rsquo;s dangerous, it could explode or such\u0026rdquo;, but I shrugged it off. I\u0026rsquo;m no stranger to batteries expanding, it happened before to my old Samsung Galaxy phones and I had to buy replacement batteries then. Unfortunately, the Zenfone Max 4 did not have a replacement battery, so that was out of the question. I ignored it for a while, and just hoped the phone would last until the end of the trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the rest of the trip, I would notice it was starting to pop out of its case, and I had to push down on it to hold it together, and I accepted that I had to get a new phone as soon as I got home. Even performance-wise I had noticed in recent weeks that it was already quite sluggish. Literally during the flight back home while the phone was powered off in my pocket, I would bring it out and need to push it back together again, I was worried I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have a phone when I landed. I guess it\u0026rsquo;s fortunate that the phone made it all the way home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, I had a contract renewal available with Globe, which meant I could get a new handset. Even before the flight home I started looking at their website to see what handsets I could get; the choices were either an IPhone (way too expensive), a midrange Samsung Galaxy A-series phone, and a Chinese-manufactured phone (Huawei or Oppo). I\u0026rsquo;m not fond of the idea of Chinese telecom companies, so I decided to go with a Samsung again. I had used two Samsung phones before, both Galaxy S\u0026rsquo;s, so I was kind of coming home, I guess?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI settled on the Samsung Galaxy A50, as it was the best midrange phone there. My P999 plan meant I had to do a bit of a cashout, but that was fine. Specs-wise, it compared favorably to the Zenfone Max 4, except for the battery which was 20% less than the Zenfone. The high battery life was why I chose the Zenfone in the first place, so I figured the slight drop would be tolerable. Another minor concern was that the new phone would be USB-C, my first such device. It meant I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to reuse all my old MicroUSB cables, but I guess that\u0026rsquo;s not much of a loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about doing the contract renewal over the phone, but that meant having to wait a few days for delivery or pickup. I was worried the old phone might die soon (experience shows it\u0026rsquo;ll probably chug along for a while though), and I wanted an excuse to go to the mall, so I did the renewal at the Globe store instead. It was a pretty quick and painless process (fill up a few forms, wait in a queue, yada yada all done), and I had a new handset two days after I came back from the trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe handset itself looks pretty good and as expected it\u0026rsquo;s performing a lot better than the older phone, since this unit just came out early this year. It\u0026rsquo;s a lot thinner and slightly taller and has a cool reflective back frame. There\u0026rsquo;s a triple camera that reviews tell me are really good but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t know because I\u0026rsquo;m terrible at photography. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll take some comparison shots with the old phone if I feel like it. The battery life is reasonable, looks like it could last a full day if I do a full charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing I want to do differently this time to try to maximize the battery life is to avoid leaving the phone charging overnight, since that\u0026rsquo;s supposedly bad for battery life. Like many other things, I\u0026rsquo;m a bit obsessive-compulsive about my phone\u0026rsquo;s battery always being charged, so I like having the phone fully charged when I wake up in the mornings. (My friends will happily tell you that if they send me a phone screenshot where their battery is at like 13% my first comment would be that they need to charge.) This time I will try to wean myself off that habit, let\u0026rsquo;s see how that works out.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI had written about \u003ca href=\"/2015/11/travel-anxiety/\"\u003etravel anxiety\u003c/a\u003e before, but I\u0026rsquo;m revisiting the topic because the recent US trip reminded me how much of a problem it is for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe US trip was a new experience because I would be abroad for 40 days with multiple travel legs, it involved 4 international flights (back and forth) plus three domestic flights within the US, and on one leg and several flights I would be travelling alone. I had travelled abroad before for a longer period (3 months for London in 2015), but for those 3 months I was based in the same place and didn\u0026rsquo;t need anybody\u0026rsquo;s help to move around the city, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can get a bit crazy in planning for possible problems. Loss of passport is probably the worst-case scenario, followed by getting sick/injured while abroad (especially since I\u0026rsquo;m wary of the expensiveness of US health care), and of course there\u0026rsquo;s the possibility all your other stuff getting lost or stolen. In case of catastophe, I set up an online URL (known only to me) where I can access emergency info such as my passport details, contact number for relatives, and so on. Of course I also have paper printouts of needed info.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy my own count, I had ridden on an airplane 23 times now in my lifetime (19 international, 1 domestic PH, 3 domestic US), but I still worry a lot about any given flight. There are multiple possible points of failure for any one flight, some of them unique to the US, specifically:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eneed to arrive at the airport on time, without forgetting your travel documents\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eneed to pass security/immigration/customs. Added feature this time was the stricter TSA screening. And the customs form I needed to fill up as I entered the US gave me some worry as well, because I was carrying some foodstuffs meant to be given to relatives and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if I had to declare them or not (apparently the default answer is just don\u0026rsquo;t declare them? IDK). I had a similar issue on the way back into the PH, but even though I was given a customs form to fill up, no one actually asked for it?!? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eneed to pray that your checked luggage doesn\u0026rsquo;t get lost or stolen from. Additionally, in the US, the TSA may open your checked luggage outside of your presence, and if you\u0026rsquo;re using a non-TSA approved luggage lock, they will break your lock to do so. I had the misfortune of getting \u003ca href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/BMYFgcLnrtpwiEd66\"\u003ethis souvenir from the TSA\u003c/a\u003e because of this (I have since purchased TSA-approved locks)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eneed to make sure no one else claims your checked baggage at the carousel\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewill I even be able to sleep during the long haul flight? Undoubtably yes, but only in very short bursts that I presume are not healthy. Airplane economy seats are often very uncomfortable for me and and have very little leg room, and the seat backs are not conducive to me sleeping. I am so uncomfortable on airplanes that I\u0026rsquo;ve come to realize that me preparing movies/books/comics/games to entertain me during the flight is a waste of time, as I typically won\u0026rsquo;t indulge in those activities when I\u0026rsquo;m not very comfortable. Typically, a long haul flight goes like this for me:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTry to sleep\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWake up after 2-8 minutes due to some noise or due to my neck hurting\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCheck the flight status/time to see how much longer I have to tolerate this nonsense\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStare for a while into the void, doing nothing, hoping I can somehow make this flight go by faster\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e(Optional) Get up and go to the 0.5 square meter lavatory so I can stretch my legs\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMake tiny adjustment in neck or butt or leg position(s) and hope that helps me sleep better\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRepeat\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe start of my trip gave me some anxiety as well, when I went to the check-in counter at NAIA, the Asiana lady could not scan my machine-readable passport, presumably due to a fold on the relevant page. She said she would process me manually but warned me that there was a possibility that they would reject my passport at my US entry point since a machine-readable passport was a requirement. I even had to sign a waiver absolving Asiana of any liability in case I was not allowed to enter the US! Basically they gave me reason to be worried during the entire length of the 18-hour trip to SFO. Spoilers: there was no issue at the US border, and there was never any further issue scanning my passport at any point including at the e-Gate as I was re-entering the PH. (Props to NAIA for having e-Gates now.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother issue I encountered was because this was my first time actually visiting relatives during a trip, so I was not prepared for the Filipino culture thing of having your relatives give you stuff to bring back home. I always pack as lightly as possible and have a small luggage unit specifically because I don\u0026rsquo;t want to have to worry about lugging around a lot of weight. Because of this, on my way back to Seattle from Houston, and from Seattle to Sacramento, I had to handcarry a large paper back with stuff for my folks and siblings. I did not have a spare bag to carry the items, and on the trip to Sacramento, the bag was even slightly ripped, I did not have a contingency plan for if it fell apart. Luckily, things worked out lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mentioned in the previous post that I don\u0026rsquo;t really do much shopping, but my parents did, and we ended up having 3 additional checked luggage pieces ((all of them near the 50lbs limit), which meant I had to carry one myself during my flight. (We were flying back on the same day, but had separate flights). This added to bit about my anxiety, as what if some customs official asked me what I had in the large luggage and I had no idea? Luckily again, things worked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from the flights, I also had to arrange for lodging, as not all the places we were going to had friends or relatives we could crash at. I ended up using 3 different AirBNBs, one each in Anaheim, Los Angeles and Seattle. AirBNBs come with their own set of anxieties:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewill I be able to find the place?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewill there be an issue with the check in process?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ecan I trust the host not to steal my stuff or spy on my with a hidden camera or something? The thing about AirBNBs is you basically have to trust strangers; one of my issues this time is I was travelling with a laptop, so I was worried that it might not be secure to leave the laptop at the AirBNB when I went out.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eis the AirBNB area secure? Can I walk around the area at night?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHappily, I encountered no issues with the AirBNBs I rented and had pleasant stays all around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Luckily, things worked out\u0026rdquo; is generally the outcome to be expected for most of these overthinking-type anxieties I guess. I know it\u0026rsquo;s not rational to worry about all of these things a lot, and I understand the odds are low for any particular risk, but sometimes I can\u0026rsquo;t help myself. Often I can manage the happy-go-lucky \u0026ldquo;eh, I\u0026rsquo;m sure it\u0026rsquo;ll be fine\u0026rdquo; attitude for any single problem, but in this instance the fact that I had to worry about so many different flights (not to mention iteneraries like theme parks, meetups, etc) made it extra challenging. I guess I just need to remind myself not to worry too much. While there are certainly a lot of possible \u0026ldquo;things that can go wrong\u0026rdquo;, most of them are easily recoverable from, and the odds are very low anyway. I\u0026rsquo;ve survived this long in a harsh environment like Metro Manila, so I can probably survive something going wrong in more \u0026ldquo;civilized\u0026rdquo; (?) countries like the US anyway!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAfter the \u003ca href=\"/2019/07/us-2019-seattle/\"\u003eSeattle part of the trip\u003c/a\u003e, I reunited with family for the final leg of the trip where we all be hanging around the San Francisco bay area. We were based in my uncle\u0026rsquo;s place in Vacaville, which one of my friends kindly described as \u0026ldquo;in the sticks\u0026rdquo;, i.e. basically far away from everything. Like Houston, we had to rely on the kindness of relatives who were willing and available to drive us around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the laziest part of the trip by far: not much walking, most of it either just driving to places and taking pictures; or going to outlets for shopping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe spent a few days near Monterey, staying at a cousin\u0026rsquo;s house. This let us visit some nearby stuff like cannery row, the 17-mile drive and pebble beach. Climbed some rocks, saw some squirrels, walked by the wharf, that kind of stuff. After that, we also visited San Jose for a day to meet some other relatives, then the next day we drove over to San Francisco and visited the Golden Gate Bridge area, the Palace of Fine Arts (sadly closed on that day, but the exteriors were nice), and drove around the SF roads for a bit too. I was a bit underwhelmed by the Golden Gate bridge, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as long nor as wide as I imagined it would be, but from the exhibits there I can imagine what a big deal of an engineering feat it was at that time. The streets of SF were even steeper than Seattle\u0026rsquo;s were! I\u0026rsquo;m glad I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to walk them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the day was just hanging out the Vacaville area and visiting (and revisiting) the outlets for shopping. Apparently Vacaville is known for the outlets. I\u0026rsquo;m not much of a shopper myself - I don\u0026rsquo;t have the patience to sift through rows of clothes or shoes looking for bargains - it\u0026rsquo;s mostly my parents who bought a bunch of stuff. I just walked around mostly looking at things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did make a couple of electronics purchases, one was a cheap gaming mouse (not as cheap as the ones in the PH, but not like a $60 razer either), and the bigger purchase was a 2018 iPad from Best Buy. I wanted to get a new tablet because my current iPad Pro was falling apart (I literally had some tape at the seams to hold it together), and the battery was in horrible shape. I was hesitating because the iPad Pro was actually still perfectly usable - as long as it was plugged in and the tape held. At first I wanted to get a new iPad Pro, since I wanted the pencil support, but those were wildly expensive, and even the refurbished 9.7-inch ones would have cost as much as a new 2018 iPad. Luckily, I found out that the 2018 iPad did in fact support the Apple Pencil, so I ended up getting a new one of those instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had a fourth of July barbecue at my uncle\u0026rsquo;s house, and I stayed the night at a friend\u0026rsquo;s house in Hercules, then more lazy days of shopping to wind down our US trip. Some overall impressions of the US and random stories follow:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eeverything is so far apart. During our Houston and Vacaville legs we basically had to be driven everywhere. Probably basically impossible to live without a car (as I prefer) unless you\u0026rsquo;re willing to pay the higher rents in the downtown areas. There\u0026rsquo;s also so much idle land everywhere. Basically the opposite of congested Metro Manila. I have a better understanding now of why Americans are so obsessed with cars (and pickup trucks apparently) (Slight tangent: interesting article I read on \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/car-crashes-arent-always-unavoidable/592447/\"\u003ewhy Americans are basically forced into car dependency by laws, infrastructure and big oil\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eno bidets! This is why Japan is superior\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI suppose it\u0026rsquo;s only logical given how far apart things are, but this is the first country I\u0026rsquo;ve visited with wildly different climates in different zones. SF and LA were manageable hot - cool in the shade, but close to PH temps if you\u0026rsquo;re in the sun in the afternoons. Vegas and Houston were very, very hot. Seattle was cold in the mornings and never got too hot during the day.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAmericans are very chatty, even with strangers. I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect them to be as chatty as Filipinos since we allegedly have a reputation for being \u0026ldquo;warm and hospitable\u0026rdquo;, but Filipinos don\u0026rsquo;t randomly ask how my day is going the way random people on the street do in the US. In Las Vegas, a large black woman was trying to chat up me and my brother while we were on a food run and we were ignoring her and she asked us why we were being so antisocial\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eApparently Filipino expats in the US watch a lot of TFC and Telenovelas and Pinoy movies. Reminds them of home I guess. I actually sat through a couple of Pinoy movies myself, I\u0026rsquo;ll write about them in the next \u003ca href=\"/tags/watching-lately/\"\u003ewatching lately\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere are so many, um, shall we say, \u0026ldquo;large\u0026rdquo; Americans. Not in terms of height, but in terms of width! Not that I\u0026rsquo;m fat shaming or anything like that - I mean, I\u0026rsquo;m a huge guy myself, but seeing so many larger folk around made me feel a bit more comfortable with myself. Some of the stores we went to had shirt sizes that went as high as 6x! I think the larger Americans I saw were mostly in the theme parks and the city areas, not so much in the suburbs, not sure if that\u0026rsquo;s indicative of anything.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI used Southwest for all the domestic flights. SW is interesting because they don\u0026rsquo;t have reserved seatings for their flights - you\u0026rsquo;re assigned a boarding priority and when you board you just pick from whatever seat is available. Also apparently they let me bring free checked baggage whereas other airlines don\u0026rsquo;t so I guess I randomly made a good decision.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUS airports don\u0026rsquo;t seem very interesting, or maybe I\u0026rsquo;m just spoiled by airports like Singapore\u0026rsquo;s Changi or HKIA where I don\u0026rsquo;t mind spending a lot of time there\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t spend as much as I thought I would (mostly due to the hospitality of our hosts), but still the fact that food is so expensive here really tells me a lot about how Americans view things financially. A decent meal is typically $10-$15, maybe more. Compare that to the cost of things that would be considered luxuries in the Philippines: a new video game is $60, basically 4 or 5 meals worth; a month\u0026rsquo;s Netflix sub or a comic book are less than the cost of a meal; and so on. It basically makes it so easy to impulse buy say, a $1 chocolate bar or a $4 bag of chips since these are so inexpensive compared to normal meals, but over here I\u0026rsquo;d balk at P35 chocolate bars or P150 bag of chips. I guess I\u0026rsquo;m worried that having spent time in the US, I\u0026rsquo;d be more spendy when I get back lol.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ein summary, I was able to visit 4 states: California, Nevada, Texas, and Washington. (Arizona for a layover). Not bad! I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to visit the East Coast during this trip, so maybe that\u0026rsquo;s something to look forward to in the future. I am not yet sure if I even want to go back; maybe one trip is already plently, just enough to experience what life is like over there.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",

There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of \u0026ldquo;cute\u0026rdquo; Peter Parker high school moments she\u0026rsquo;d probably like, and the plot and action aren\u0026rsquo;t too hard to follow\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpoilery stuff follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehow could Midtown High afford to send their trivia team on a trip through Europe? Is this typical of American high schools?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAs mentioned above, anyone even remotely familiar with Spider-Man lore wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised at the reveal that Mysterio is actually a villain. This is one of those times where there would have been some advantage to not knowing stuff ahead of time, as you get to enjoy the reveal. That being said, Mysterio\u0026rsquo;s villain monologue after getting the EDITH glasses may be one of the best I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen. Since I already knew Mysterio was a bad guy, the only realy mystery was HOW he was doing these destructive elementals since they obviously weren\u0026rsquo;t the simple light-and-sound shows that comics Mysterio was known for. Tying the illusions to the BARF holograms and even re-using side characters from previous movies was an inspired choice.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe rest of the movie\u0026rsquo;s plot was fairly predictable, but the MCU continues to subvert the expectations of Spider-Man fans since both Peter Parker and the supporting cast are completely different from the comicbook incarnations, powers notwithstanding. I assume they planned as far back as Homecoming that Tony would be dying in Endgame and Peter would be pressured to take the mantle, setting Tony up as his father figure instead of the mythical Uncle Ben. Zendaya\u0026rsquo;s MJ is completely different from the comics\u0026rsquo; Mary Jane \u0026ldquo;Hey tiger\u0026rdquo; Watson; Flash is a nerd like Peter instead of a footballer; Ned isn\u0026rsquo;t even based on a Peter supporting character but on a Miles supporting character, and so on. This is basically a completely different version of Peter\u0026rsquo;s HS life and it\u0026rsquo;s great.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethat first Mysterio vs Spider-Man scene was great, evocative of the comic book version and even Arkham Asylum\u0026rsquo;s Scarecrow sequences\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe whole Peter/MJ/Brad Davis subplot gives the movie a bit of a \u0026ldquo;John Hughes\u0026rdquo; vibe and there are some cute moments and MJ really holds her own; I think this movie handles the whole \u0026ldquo;dual identity problems\u0026rdquo; aspect of Spider-man better than Homecoming did\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethat webswinging sequence at the end of the movie was great, has the same feel as the PS4 game\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe midcredits scene completely changes the tone of the ending of course. But first, we must acknowledge the awesome return of the one true J. Jonah Jameson, JK Simmons! The unmasking is a problem, and how will they handle it? Will Peter and May have to go into hiding at an Avengers facility? Will the bad guys come after them? WIll Peter have to make a deal with Mephisto to protect his secret in exchange for getting the worst prom ever with MJ? Or will they go some other route like have one of the Skrulls pose as Peter and appear together with Spider-man? The great thing about MCU Spider-Man is that because the setup is completely different, they\u0026rsquo;re not beholden to the comic book plots (neither Homecoming nor Far From Home are based on actual comic stories AFAIK). This ending also mirrors Homecoming\u0026rsquo;s unmasking in front of Aunt May, so my guess is that they\u0026rsquo;ll handle this cliffhanger the same way - completely off screen and we just see the repurcussions in the next movie.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe final postcredits scene will have fans speculating for a while, but it looks like Fury is busy setting up SWORD? Or could it be something else?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat movie, and I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to Marvel hopefully announcing their Phase 4 plans at SDCC later this month!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Didn\u0026rsquo;t bother going up, I felt like I\u0026rsquo;ve already climbed enough tall structures in my lifetime and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t really worth the cost\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI did take half a day to go through the Museum of Pop Culture near the Space Needle, which I enjoyed. They had exhibits on Washington state bands like Pearl Jam and Nirvana, fantasy and sci-fi exhibits, and even an independent gaming exhibit sponsored by Nintendo.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSupposedly, Seattle\u0026rsquo;s number one tourist attraction is Pike Place Market, which I found weird, because well, it\u0026rsquo;s a market. I did visit the market and wander the shop and had some of Beecher\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;World\u0026rsquo;s Best Mac and Cheese\u0026rdquo; (tastes great, but the cheese is very sharp, some people might not like it). There were some nice market shops - I enjoyed browsing a couple of the used bookstores there and there was a comic book store as well (was able to resist adding more to my reading backlog though). I think there was supposed to be some performance by the fishmongers in the market proper, and I did see some crowd gathered around one of the stalls and clapping, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t push through quick enough to see what was going on, and didn\u0026rsquo;t bother waiting for something to happen again.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing I did not enjoy was how steeply inclined Seattle\u0026rsquo;s streets were. Going from my Airbnb near Capitol Hill to the downtown area was easy enough as it was mostly downhill, but going back home at the end of the day was always a bit of a challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like Seattle as a city, especially the Capitol Hill district - it feels like it has a lot of character, compared to say, Los Angeles (although that might be an unfair comparison as I didn\u0026rsquo;t really get to wander LA much). The city has more of a west coast-artistic vibe going on, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of posters for events everywhere, art murals on a lot of walls, there\u0026rsquo;s more music shops and book shops, a lot of random small parks, and a lot of place are very LGBTQ-friendly, even some of the crosswalks are rainbow-colored. The bookstores I browsed were great, a couple had the staff leaving small notes on the shelves about various titles they recommend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn my last day in Seattle, due to some combination of poor planning and cheapness, I had to spend an inordinate amount of time at SEATAC airport, pre-security. I was basically at the airport 8 hours before my flight, a personal record. I thought Southwest would at least let me check my bags and go through security maybe 3-4 hours before the 5am flight, but their counter only opened an hour and a half before the flight. So I have no real opinions on whether SEATAC is a good airport or not lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I\u0026rsquo;ll leave you with some pictures!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeattle photo dump:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/Q6yBFyk\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"//imgur.com/a/Q6yBFyk\"\u003eSeattle\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cscript async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoPOP photo dump (part 1):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/45uzuCk\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"//imgur.com/a/45uzuCk\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cscript async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoPOP photo dump (part 2) - scfi and fantasy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/KgOUcEX\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"//imgur.com/a/KgOUcEX\"\u003eMoPOP part 2\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cscript async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e",
            "summary": "Seattle was the riskiest part of my trip, relatively speaking, because it was my solo leg - I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any friends or relatives in the city I could turn to in case of an emergency. I had also read online that while Seattle was very much a walkable city, there was a nontrivial homeless population, and some areas may be a bit sketchy after dark. As a friend of mine said though, \u0026ldquo;sketchy\u0026rdquo; in the US is probably a lot safer than \u0026ldquo;sketchy\u0026rdquo; in Metro Manila.",
