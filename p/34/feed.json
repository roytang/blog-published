The rocking was felt strongly in Metro Manila; I normally don\u0026rsquo;t feel any earthquakes and only learn of them after the fact via friends or social media. But this time I was on a bed and I could feel it physically shaking, which was impressive given I was only on a second story. Imagine what it must have been like to be in a high-rise condo. Many of my friends working in the business districts had to evacuate their high-rise offices via stairs, and I put off a planned trip that afternoon to Ortigas since it looked like I might have trouble getting home if I went ahead. Thankfully all my friends and family are safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy last real memory of actually feeling an earthquake was the one back in 1990 that collapsed the Hyatt in Baguio. I was still in grade school then and I distinctly remember that quake hitting while we were in the parking lot waiting around for the school bus to get going. I\u0026rsquo;m sure we\u0026rsquo;ve had strong earthquakes since then, but none made a lasting impression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarthquakes are not an uncommon occurrence here, but during recent years there has been talk of a devastating \u0026ldquo;Big One\u0026rdquo; which could theoretically do a lot of damage to Metro Manila, which meant a lot of people were worried, justifiably so. I\u0026rsquo;m disappointed that I didn\u0026rsquo;t instinctively find a table or door frame to position myself under and just sat there silently as the shaking happened. I guess we should also count ourselves luckly that there weren\u0026rsquo;t many casualties so far for this quake, unlike the 1990 one which was I think the second most lethal earthquake to hit the country ever. It\u0026rsquo;s also a pleasant surprise how the high-rise buildings in the business districts are holding up. I worry that because of the way business is done in the Philippines, there may have been shortcuts taken that weaken their structural integrity, but fortunately that has not been the case. So far. Hopefully, we will be able to fare as well if the hypothetical \u0026ldquo;big one\u0026rdquo; actually hits.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I\u0026rsquo;ve finished the game, but then there\u0026rsquo;s the post game and the New Game+ etc. So maybe not a review yet.

Not that I haven\u0026rsquo;t been productive at all. I did manage to dive into the rabbit hole of spring cleaning a bit, moving things around and dusting and throwing things into a garbage bag at 11:30 in the evening, and that satisfied my OC-ness for a bit.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eMy earliest memories of Holy Week are my grandmother telling us about how solemn the days off were supposed to be and that we kids were supposed to be quiet and not make so much noise and not be playing around so much. That, and the only thing being available on TV being \u003cem\u003eThe Ten Commandments\u003c/em\u003e starring Charlton Heston and Yul Brenner. In the early 2000s, what we often watched were the marathon episodes of \u003cem\u003eSeventh Heaven\u003c/em\u003e shown on Studio 23 (the actor for the dad/pastor in that show later on confessed to being involved in a child molestation scandal, ironically.) Back before cable TV you didn\u0026rsquo;t have much of a choice, you could only watch what the local channels gave you and all the malls were closed, so you often are forced into some form of quiet reflection. These days, well, the internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of people in the Metro skip town for the Holy Week, heading off to beaches or wherever to beat the summer heat or taking advantage of the holiday to visit their family in the provinces. Our family generally doesn\u0026rsquo;t do that, being practicing Catholics and all, we like to just stay at home and suffer the summer heat. The great thing about all these people leaving the city is that the normally super congested Metro Manila gets to breathe for a bit. From Maunday Thursday through Easter Sunday, traffic is the lightest it ever is for the entire year (culminating in the post-Easter traffic mess caused by all the people travelling back from the provinces). The power and water crises we\u0026rsquo;ve been going through for the past few weeks is temporarily alleviated as the demand from the city residents goes down - our water pressure has been pretty good since Thursday, though we did end up using more power to aircon our way through the summer afternoons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis summer seems hotter than it has ever been, not uncommon during the past few years. It\u0026rsquo;s a free \u003cem\u003epentitensya\u003c/em\u003e that comes with living in the Philippines that even non-Catholics have to suffer through (a joke I\u0026rsquo;ve made to three different chat groups now) Ignorant people who don\u0026rsquo;t believe in global warming need to live closer to the equator.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

In the early 2000s, what we often watched were the marathon episodes of Seventh Heaven shown on Studio 23 (the actor for the dad/pastor in that show later on confessed to being involved in a child molestation scandal, ironically.",

(I imagine that Android has a similar issue, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never purchased anything from the Play Store, so I won\u0026rsquo;t bother to check.)

Not for the ranked ladder - whenever I go into the competitive multiplayer mode I find myself stressing out and feel like my blood pressure is going up and I can\u0026rsquo;t manage more than one or two games at a time. I still am able to find ranked matches, but they always feels so intense, and you have to worry about being cheesed and yes I often do poorly. The mode I\u0026rsquo;m enjoying these days is Starcraft 2 Co-op, a mode which was released together with Legacy of the Void. Some friends of mine have been playing the coop mode recently and I got enticed to join in on the fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically there are mission maps similar to the campaign missions, except they require two players working together to accomplish objectives. You can choose between a few difficulty levels and play with friends, or queue up to be matched with anons. There are a number of different coop commanders available with different army compositions and special abilities. Completing missions gains you experience for the commander you chose, which lets you level them up to gain upgrades. A few come fully unlocked, some are unlocked because I had purchased all three campaigns. The ones that are locked you can still play up to level up, after that they need to be purchased for $4.99 per commander. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of content too even after you\u0026rsquo;ve maxed the levels, as there are mastery and ascencion levels to be climbed, and there are weekly \u0026ldquo;mutation\u0026rdquo; variants that are much more challenging than the normal missions. One thing I like about Starcraft 2 is that there are a lot of achievements, and that includes coop mode too so that adds a lot of replay value for me as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have been enjoying the mode, and due to various freebies, I initially had nine commanders unlocked. I enjoy playing a variety of styles so I levelled them all to max, and the mode is fun enough that I am considering purchasing a few of the locked commanders as well. (Maybe all of them!) It\u0026rsquo;s a lot less stressful than ranked, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about being cheesed (and sometimes you get to do the cheesing yourself!), and a lot less toxic, people are generally friendly and don\u0026rsquo;t blame you too much for screwing up. I\u0026rsquo;m a bit old so my reflexes probably aren\u0026rsquo;t good enough for ranked anymore, but I\u0026rsquo;m happy I can still play in real-time well enough for the highest difficulties of coop mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was some discussion in in-game chat about how the game was \u0026ldquo;dead\u0026rdquo;, but these sentiments seemed to come mostly from people who preferred competitive multiplayer modes, so maybe not many people are playing ranked anymore? But coop seems to be going strong - I never have trouble matching up even with anons. Apparently Coop mode has been profitable enough for Blizzard that they\u0026rsquo;ve still been releasing new content for it fairly recently, last year saw the release of the latest coop commander Zeratul, and there are more commanders rumored to be in development. So I guess somehow the business model is working for them which is great since it gives the game legs to go on for a few more years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSide note: I really dig the packaging for all 3 SC2 games and am glad I got them physical copies. There are some nice artworks on the boxes and some inserts with a bit of lore, and Legacy of the Void even came with some free codes for WoW and Hearthstone (I wonder if I can still claim this free pack lol)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#ca94d5dee527178ec49432151619b7c0-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2019/04/starcraft-2/starcraft2_packaging_hua0a6cb034bb25cf60534af269223a5b8_298612_300x0_resize_q75_box.JPG\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"ca94d5dee527178ec49432151619b7c0-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2019/04/starcraft-2/starcraft2_packaging.JPG\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"18 Apr 2019 5:56am\"\u003e18 Apr 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eMany of the manga series I used to follow from long ago have since ended, the only ones still running now are One Piece and Hajime no Ippo. So I thought I\u0026rsquo;d follow some newer ones. Here are some short reviews:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Promised Neverland\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up this one due to a strong recommendation from someone I follow on social media. The premise starts out with some super smart kids who grew up in an orphanage without any knowledge of an outside world. Suddenly they find out that not all is as it seems and that they are actually captives in some kind of human farm for strange \u0026ldquo;demons\u0026rdquo; to consume. The first arc consists of the oldest kids trying to figure out a way to outsmart their captors and escape and find out the truth of what is happening in the outside world. (The previous two sentences aren\u0026rsquo;t too spoiler-y, this setup is pretty much established in the first issue.) The 3 oldest kids are supersmart, so much of the tension lies in them trying to stay two steps ahead of their captors who suspect they know the secret, and at the same time trying to figure out a way to escape with more than 30 kids, some of them toddlers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome spoilers for the second arc follow:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails class=\"spoiler\"\u003e\n    \u003csummary\u003e(Spoilers)\u003c/summary\u003e\n    The second arc after they manage to escape involves them trying to survive in a world that they find to be mostly populated by demons, some of them cunning like humans, and some wild and savage, all of them much stronger than humans. Sometimes writers won\u0026rsquo;t know what to do after their initial premise, but \u003cem\u003eThe Promised Neverland\u003c/em\u003e handles it well; after the initial \u0026ldquo;Prison Break\u0026rdquo; story arc they successfully transitioned into a \u0026ldquo;Wilderness Survival\u0026rdquo; arc that reminds me a lot of Claymore. During the course of their journey to find a safe haven they learn the truth of why the world is like it is which eventually leads to a \u0026ldquo;Revolution\u0026rdquo; arc (currently ongoing) where the protagonists are trying to change the nature of this world. There were some fantastic battle scenes against overwhelming odds in the second arc as well, especially against Lewis and the other demons at Goldy Pond.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cp /\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Promised Neverland\u003c/em\u003e is currently at 130 issues and I enjoyed it a lot. The writing is good, the artwork is not too complicated yet dynamic and flowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr. Stone\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember reading about this one a couple of years ago about promising new series in \u003cem\u003eShonen Jump\u003c/em\u003e, but at that time I chose to start \u003cem\u003eRobot x Laserbeam\u003c/em\u003e instead, which didn\u0026rsquo;t last too long. I didn\u0026rsquo;t start this one back then because I honestly wasn\u0026rsquo;t a fan of the art style, but I gave it another shot last week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe premise is that sometime in 2015 (?), a mysterious petrification beam turned every human being (and swallow) on earth into stone. The protagonist Senku is a genius-level science nerd who manages to keep his consciousness alive for the 3,700 years that it takes until he is freed from his petrification by a mysterious liquid. By this time, human civilization has collapsed, and all that remains is the preserved stone statues of the humans (and swallows). A firm believer in science, Senku resolves to use his analytical skills to restore human civilization, his first task being to study the mysterious liquid that freed him and use it to free some other nearby humans - the first one being his friend Taiju, who has unnaturally high endurance making him suitable for doing the hard labor neded to support Senku\u0026rsquo;s science. While they are in the process of attempting to free a third human, they are beset upon by wild animals and have to run. They have no choice but to use their depetrification formula to free a nearby human who turns out to be a super-strong and athletic fighter who can defeat wild animals with his bare hands, Tsukasa. (All of this happens in the first three issues.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter things settle down, Senku finds out that Tsukasa hates the modern world and does not want to bring everyone back, and he starts smashing statues of older people. Fundamentally disagreeing on the way forward, this sets up the first major arc for the series, with Tsukasa taking control of the depetrification formula to establish his own empire, and Senku vowing to start a Kingdom of Science to advance human civilization and overcome Tsukasa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interesting thing about this series is how focused it is on science, detailing the steps needed to do complicated things like formulating chemicals or building complicated devices like a crossbow or a battery. The series is only 100 issues long so far, but thanks to Senku being ridiculously knowledgable, science advances quickly even in this \u0026ldquo;Stone\u0026rdquo; age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails class=\"spoiler\"\u003e\n    \u003csummary\u003e(Spoilers)\u003c/summary\u003e\n    By the 100th issue, Senku has advanced the cause of science enough to be able to create (with the help of a whole village of people) such advanced devices as mobile communicators, a steam engine-powered boat, and even a carbon-fiber tank.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cp /\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI must admit I can\u0026rsquo;t follow the science myself too closely (since I\u0026rsquo;m not that well-versed in chemistry), so I can\u0026rsquo;t vouch for its accuracy, but I enjoy how it is presented and how Senku explains things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of these series feature superoptimistic protagonists who are hypercompetent and very resolved to save everyone (sometimes even their enemies), no matter the ridiculous odds. A bit trope-y, but I enjoyed both series nonetheless, and both are still ongoing, so I have new manga to look forward to every week!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Initial load of the home page clocks in with 13 requests weighing around 140KB total. This is not bad, in fact it would be a significant improvmenet since \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/site-migration-from-wordpress-to-hugo/\"\u003eI migrated to a static site using Hugo\u003c/a\u003e. The homepage of the old Wordpress version of the blog comes with 44 requests totalling a bit over 500KB. And the new homepage lists way more posts too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe page for individual posts leaves some room for improvement however, coming at 62 requests totalling more than 2MB. The main culprit is Disqus which I use for commenting. At least Disqus uses delayed loading, so the content renders immediately, but that\u0026rsquo;s still a lot of bandwidth that could be saved. Leaving aside the question of \u0026ldquo;Do I really need comments?\u0026rdquo;, I did a quick search if there were pre-existing solutions for optimizing Disqus loading on static sites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best hit so far was \u003ca href=\"https://css-tricks.com/lazy-loading-disqus-comments/\"\u003edisqusLoader\u003c/a\u003e, which avoids loading Disqus until the comment area actually scrolls into view. It\u0026rsquo;s a neat idea, but I encountered some JS errors when I did a quick test with it. I\u0026rsquo;ll revisit this again later when I have more time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn alternative of course would be to write my own JS-based commenting engine to rival Disqus, which seems to have no competition in its particular niche. I like building things so this option naturally came to mind, but in all likelihood I don\u0026rsquo;t have time to do that, and there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance it may end up as heavy as Disqus anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeed to think about this some more.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

That\u0026rsquo;s why I like this blog, it means I can easily look through the past and figure out what I was doing, say, in 2011. In fact, I still have a lot of old files to dig through and organize and such. One of my goals is that any old material I find that can safely be made public would be made available through this blog/site.

I had written somewhere that I was on Geocities since 2000, but the only archive I have is from 2002 (and the wayback machine only goes back that far), and the 2002 archive is only a placeholder that links to other free hosting I had back then. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there was an older version of the site that was mostly a Final Fantasy and Rurouni Kenshin fansite that I probably got rid of because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too happy with it. It\u0026rsquo;s possible that the older version was on one of the \u0026ldquo;neighborhood\u0026rdquo;-style Geocities URLs, as my wayback machine search is only for the \u0026ldquo;username\u0026rdquo;-style URL. I can\u0026rsquo;t recall if I did have a neighborhood-style URL, but if I did, I don\u0026rsquo;t remember it anymore.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYahoo Messenger chat archives.

I visited the dentist Friday last week and warned her as such. I knew from a years-long ago check up that I had several teeth that would need to be pulled but never followed up. And last week\u0026rsquo;s checkup confirmed that. I scheduled a second visit today to get some of them pulled. I\u0026rsquo;m writing this post before the visit, so if I don\u0026rsquo;t write a post tomorrow, maybe I died from the procedure or something. Does that happen? Do people die from teeth pulling?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously I\u0026rsquo;m not looking forward to the visit, but it\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;ve put off for too long. I\u0026rsquo;m not fond of visiting the dentist (who is?) even though I should know better about how it\u0026rsquo;s necessary. I especially don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of getting my teeth pulled. I have a pretty low tolerance for pain, and there\u0026rsquo;s always the anxiety before the actual visit. There was one time I made a \u003ca href=\"/2004/12/i-get-bored-easily/\"\u003eblog post about an eternity of pain due to a toothache\u003c/a\u003e, and my dentist happened to read the post and jokingly (maybe?) complained to me about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot taking care of my teeth is probably one of my worst regrets in life. It often makes it difficult for me to chew! I know we have a lot of urgent world problems that science could help us with, but if I was allowed to selfishly genie-wish for one scientific innovation to suddenly occur it would be the ability for medical science to regrow human teeth PAINLESSLY. Sure, civilization would probably collapse due to climate change and resource scarcity, but at least I\u0026rsquo;d have my teeth back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpdate: I\u0026rsquo;m alive! The procedure was a lot less uncomfortable than I thought it would be. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m misremembering how bad previous extractions were? Or maybe dental anesthesia technology has advanced since then? In either case I am grateful, yet I have to go back again next week so that more of my teeth may die.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

And yet the very subject invites some to ask why we should even care about the feelings of rapists or murderers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s why we need to care. We need to care because our justice system demands it. Regardless of where we stand on the appropriateness of a death penalty, we must agree that the administration of any punishment must be done in the absence of passion or cruelty. Whether we\u0026rsquo;re putting someone to death, locking them up for shoplifting, interrogating them in a criminal case or holding them while we determine their legal residency status, we must be adamant in our commitment to do so in a way that\u0026rsquo;s free from resentment or rage… or amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy is this so important? It is important because when we allow anger and apathy to seep into our justice system we begin to do unjust things. We keep prisoners in tents whose temperatures reach 114 degrees. We lock them in solitary confinement and laugh as we watch them die of a seizure. We surround them at a traffic stop and kick them in the stomach and face while they lay handcuffed and helpless. We end up with a Supreme Court justice who erupts in a blind rage when his fitness is questioned. We end up with a president who admonishes police not to \u0026ldquo;go so easy\u0026rdquo; on suspects when apprehending them, a president who leads cheers of \u0026ldquo;lock them up\u0026rdquo; whenever he brings up a political opponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe lose our way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe very existence of a criminal justice system is an agreement where the public allows its government to suspend – or even eliminate – some of the rights outlined in our constitution. In doing so we expect our government to exercise this power with the utmost care and respect, even for those accused or convicted of the most serious offenses. Because to do otherwise invites vengeance into our system. Vengeance and justice cannot coexist; one will always replace the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m reminded of how in our country, there are politicians advocating for the death penalty in response to the supposed drug menace, when there has generally been \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/04/30/theres-still-no-evidence-that-executions-deter-criminals/?utm_term=.55ee4ef75738\"\u003eno evidence to show the death penalty deters crime\u003c/a\u003e. The last time we had the death penalty, only one convict was ever executed, the country did not have the stomach for it. I imagine (based only on the perceived behavior of our politicos) that those advocating for the death penalty do not really have deterrence in mind, but rather punishment - they wish to cruelly punish the offender to satisfy the bloodlust of the populace. i.e. Vengeance, not justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
