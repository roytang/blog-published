This is exactly what is wrong with the entire country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e44 years ago on September 23, 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos declared Proclamation 1081, placing the Philippines under Martial Law. My father was the very first lawyer to challenge the act before the Supreme Court and questioned its legality under the 1935 Philippine Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, the 1987 Constitution safeguards our institutions from a repeat of Marcos’ Martial Law regime. The Supreme Court is empowered to review all official acts to determine if there has been grave abuse of discretion. Congress cannot be padlocked. Martial Law is limited in duration and effects, even if contemplated by a president. (Source: Section 18 of Article VII)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you really love our country, regardless of political beliefs, invest in it.

Hold your head high when people tell you \u0026ldquo;masyado ka kasing honest\u0026rdquo;. Do good work, fall in love, live with honor. Be the best Filipino you can be. And above all, cherish the freedoms that were bought so dearly by so many. Do not abuse them. The Filipino is worth living for, and worth living here for. We are worth changing for, worth loving despite our many frailties. We are worth it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe many will someday stand bravely with the few, though we may have to re-learn our lessons because we always had aborted, personal, and unfinished revolutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are impatient as a people and as a culture, perhaps we need an evolution - the slow quiet unsung work of true development - more than a revolution.

More processes means even greater overhead when new team members join. And the cycle repeats\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs team size increases, mistakes become more costly too. When you\u0026rsquo;re a team of two or three developers all in the same room, you can barrel ahead quickly and when there\u0026rsquo;s a problem you can quickly figure out who broke the build. But when there\u0026rsquo;s like eighty of you split over two floors, it becomes a tedious exercise. And every broken build and every critical bug now costs a lot more man-hours because it affects a lot more people. So everybody needs to be even more careful, and yeap even more overhead. You end up introducing more coordinators, reviewers, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn so many words, the above is simply a restatement of the famous \u0026ldquo;Mythical man-month\u0026rdquo; quote:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdding more people to a late project makes it even later\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn practice though, I find that people who are aware of this quote find themselves falling into the trap of \u0026ldquo;this won\u0026rsquo;t happen to me\u0026rdquo;, so a more nuanced discussion of the problems of scale might need to be had. Management typically responds more to qualitative costs, so maybe there are some metrics that you team could find?
