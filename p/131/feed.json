            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eEstimation is hard. Estimation has long been the bane of many software developers and software development projects. But there are two secret ways to be able to produce perfect estimates for software development work all the time! One is dependent on talent, and the other is dependent on technology\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePsychic precognition, i.e. be able to predict the future\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHave a time machine, so you can go back in time and tell yourself how long the work would have taken\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch precognition is necessary to have perfect estimates because of all the unknowns present at the start of a software project. Unknowns include imperfect requirements or design, unknown user needs, future changes that may happen during the course of the project, unforeseen technical challenges, and so on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the absence of the ability to break the laws of causality however, the only time we can have perfect estimates is at the end of the project! Before that, we are sadly restricted to imperfect estimates. In reality, \u003cstrong\u003ethe best estimates will still always be an educated guess\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, for real now: there are two ways to handle the risks associated with poor estimates, and for most projects both will be necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first is **to plan around inaccurate estimates. **This means that your planning acknowledges that estimates will often be inaccurate and building a sufficient amount of loose or buffer time in your scheduling to accommodate any variance. Less enlightened managers and executives will hate this, especially anyone who comes from a world like manufacturing where the rate of production is extremely well-known and predictable. They will view any kind of schedule buffer as some sort of justification for slacking off. As a software developer, you will have to deal with these sorts of people throughout your career. It will be part of your job to work with them to manage the schedule, manage their expectations, and get them to understand that while the software development process is in many ways an engineering process, there are still numerous uncertainties that will not resolve themselves until you \u003ca href=\"/2016/08/programming-is-finding-the-right-arrangement-of-code/\"\u003efind the right arrangement of code\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second is \u003cstrong\u003eto learn how to make better estimates\u003c/strong\u003e. \u0026ldquo;Better\u0026rdquo; here doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean \u0026ldquo;more accurate\u0026rdquo;, but rather \u0026ldquo;less likely to be very far off\u0026rdquo;. There are numerous books already written on this subject (I recommend \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Software-Estimation-Demystifying-Developer-Practices-ebook/dp/8178531038/\"\u003eSteve McConnell\u0026rsquo;s Software Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art\u003c/a\u003e**_ _**if you can afford it), but basically the advice can always be summed up as: **use data from previous experiences to predict the likely effort needed for future tasks**.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s usually best if you are able to draw upon your own experiences since often the actual amount of work needed will be specific to the developer\u0026rsquo;s experience, for example: \u0026ldquo;It took me N days to do a similar task before, so I think I can do it in N+2 days. The other guy doesn\u0026rsquo;t have experience with this stack, so I guess that he can do it in N+7 days\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the absence of your own direct experience, you can look to either expert opinion (consult someone else who has more experience with the subject and ask him for an estimate, and compensate accordingly for any difference in skill/knowledge) or use some sort of numerical model. Such models will typically rely on some sort of metric to measure the size of the system being developed, then use historical data to predict how much effort a system of this size would require. An example of such models is \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_point\"\u003eFunction Point Analysis\u003c/a\u003e. Different models will tend to have their own advantages and disadvantages \u0026ndash; for example, I\u0026rsquo;ve found from personal experience that Function Point Analysis can be greatly inaccurate if there is a lot of technical risk in the proposed system \u0026ndash; so it would still be wise to make planning adjustments accordingly and not just follow the model blindly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne last thing that software developers need to note with regard to estimates: if you know that you have made a good estimate, that it is already as accurate as it could possibly be: \u003cstrong\u003edo not allow anyone to pressure you into providing a different estimate\u003c/strong\u003e. Giving in to such pressure does no one any good: it only puts the project at increased risk, and it puts your own credibility into question. Such pressure often comes from management or clients as a result of schedules or deadlines, something that I will talk about in a later post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end though, all the best practices will be for naught unless you understand the fundamental truth: \u003cstrong\u003ethere is always a chance for estimates to be inaccurate\u003c/strong\u003e. No amount of planning or best practices can completely mitigate that risk \u0026ndash; unless of course you have either a precognitive crystal ball or time machine!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

This means that as you specialize, many of these subjects may become \u0026ldquo;irrelevant\u0026rdquo; to you, but having this broad base of knowledge gives you a better foundation in life. Knowledge from unrelated fields can often give useful insight into your own specialized field\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, the most useful stuff you learn from school isn’t the stuff that’s in the lectures or in the textbooks. School is supposed to teach you about more than formulas and history dates too. But it\u0026rsquo;s a problem that most of the time, formal education doesn\u0026rsquo;t deliver the lessons well enough. Math shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be about memorizing formulas or equations, but about developing analytical and problem solving skills. History should be about appreciating how changes affect people and societies, not about memorizing dates. Science should be about appreciating how nature works and developing scientific curiosity. And so on. But because these things are difficult to teach and test for, formal education usually focuses on facts and figures and formulas and all these things that appear in exams. It\u0026rsquo;s up to the student (or his mentors encourage him) to apply himself further\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are still many more holes in formal education. There are memes about how you learn not so useful stuff like \u0026ldquo;mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell\u0026rdquo; instead of real-world useful things like how to manage your finance or how to do your taxes. And for sure we need more of those practical things taught to students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the most important things you learn from school are in the methods of learning and working well with others. School teaches how to apply yourself, how to study and pick up new material, how to listen to other people, how to determine which knowledge is useful to learn, how to discern truth from fiction, how to work within a set of rules, how to manage your time, how to deal with schedules and deadlines, how to work well with other people, how to deal with difficult people, and so on. In short, the most important lessons school teaches you are about how to deal with the real world\u003c/p\u003e\n",
