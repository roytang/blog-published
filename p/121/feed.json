Why is this to be considered aÂ great virtue for a programmer?Â Programming is at least partly an act of creation, which means there is an element of craftsmanship involved. A craftsman imbued with hubris is able to take pride in his work \u0026ndash; he is driven to create work that is the best quality he can provide. For a programmer, this quality reflects bothÂ externally (low number of defects) and internally (code that is easy to read and maintain)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also programmers who do not see themselves as craftsmen, but rather simply code-generating cogs in a machine. They are not imbued with hubris, and hence have no concern with the quality of their work. Their only concern is to be able to do the bare minimum to satisfy the requirements of their tasks. AndÂ if you that is the way you choose to live and work, that can be fine for many people\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn general however, I find that programmers who are able to take pride in their work are more able to go the extra mile. They will tend to be more productive, they will be more able to think outside the box, they will be more able to provide suggestions for improvement, they will be more willing and able to help and support other programmers, and so on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis ability to take pride in one\u0026rsquo;s work applies at the company level too. There are companies that don\u0026rsquo;t like to focus on quality or standards or doing things right. When your company decides that quality is not that important and sacrifices it at the altar of profits, it reflects poorly upon the craftsmen in your company and affects their happiness and morale. No craftsman will be happyÂ being pressured to do substantial work simply because the company is unwilling to manage schedules properly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are a leader in a company who has developedÂ a culture of quality and craftsmanship, think long and hard before pivoting to any direction thatÂ takes away from that culture. There are people who stay at a company simply because they enjoy being craftsmen able to do high-quality work. If you take that away, well, you can imagine the consequences\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003e(A bit of Philippine politics in this post, if that sort of thing bothers you)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecently as the whole world watched one of our political leaders display his expected lack of diplomatic finesse on the global stage, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but think about how in my younger days there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance I might have approved of hisÂ frank, straight-talking, shoot-from-the-hip brand of diplomacy. I have a bit of a reputation myself for preferring to speak frankly and directly instead of dancing around the issues, although these days I understand the wisdom of adapting to the situation as needed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my youthÂ I was the sort of person who disdained those who prioritized form over substance. For this reason I disliked protocol and ritual and dress codes and formalities and all that. I imagine that IT people are notorious for preferring casual dress and disliking suits. I proudly enjoyed games with dated graphics when other people would fawn over the latest Crysis or whatever. I felt that anyone who prioritized appearances was somehow shallow and that one should focus more on the functional and practical. This is somewhat related to my views on \u003ca href=\"/2016/09/lying-and-salesmanship/\"\u003elying and salesmanship\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I got older though, I began to appreciate that sometimes appearances can matter too. Formalities and rituals can have meaning, especially when other people value them. And sometimes you have to dress up, either to impress people, or to fit in with the situation.Â These are concessions one has to make in order to beÂ member of society. As Sheldon Cooper would say, \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s the social convention\u0026rdquo;. I guess I consider learning to navigate society\u0026rsquo;s social conventions is part of being a mature adult\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich is part of whyÂ the current leadership\u0026rsquo;s lack of diplomacy is so annoying for me personally. It smacks of immaturity. Reacting to criticism with cussing and swearing and dredging up century-old mistakes and calling other people gay, these are behaviors I\u0026rsquo;d (sadly) expect from a 10 year old on XBox Live, not the leader of a sovereign nation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd supporters will say at least he\u0026rsquo;s honest and direct and real. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I\u0026rsquo;m honest and direct and real (ask anyone!) and I don\u0026rsquo;t go around swearing at people just because they point out my faults. There\u0026rsquo;s no reason to antagonize people just because they don\u0026rsquo;t agree with you. It\u0026rsquo;s possible to disagree and still be diplomatic. Not even the leadership of North Korea talks like that.Â Well, I could talk my head off politics if given the chance, so I\u0026rsquo;ll just abruptly end this post here\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eÂ \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eÂ \u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "(A bit of Philippine politics in this post, if that sort of thing bothers you)\nRecently as the whole world watched one of our political leaders display his expected lack of diplomatic finesse on the global stage, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but think about how in my younger days there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance I might have approved of hisÂ frank, straight-talking, shoot-from-the-hip brand of diplomacy. I have a bit of a reputation myself for preferring to speak frankly and directly instead of dancing around the issues, although these days I understand the wisdom of adapting to the situation as needed",
