I have a bit of a reputation myself for preferring to speak frankly and directly instead of dancing around the issues, although these days I understand the wisdom of adapting to the situation as needed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my youth I was the sort of person who disdained those who prioritized form over substance. For this reason I disliked protocol and ritual and dress codes and formalities and all that. I imagine that IT people are notorious for preferring casual dress and disliking suits. I proudly enjoyed games with dated graphics when other people would fawn over the latest Crysis or whatever. I felt that anyone who prioritized appearances was somehow shallow and that one should focus more on the functional and practical. This is somewhat related to my views on \u003ca href=\"http://roytang.net/2016/09/lying-and-salesmanship/\"\u003elying and salesmanship\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I got older though, I began to appreciate that sometimes appearances can matter too. Formalities and rituals can have meaning, especially when other people value them. And sometimes you have to dress up, either to impress people, or to fit in with the situation. These are concessions one has to make in order to be member of society. As Sheldon Cooper would say, \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s the social convention\u0026rdquo;. I guess I consider learning to navigate society\u0026rsquo;s social conventions is part of being a mature adult\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich is part of why the current leadership\u0026rsquo;s lack of diplomacy is so annoying for me personally. It smacks of immaturity. Reacting to criticism with cussing and swearing and dredging up century-old mistakes and calling other people gay, these are behaviors I\u0026rsquo;d (sadly) expect from a 10 year old on XBox Live, not the leader of a sovereign nation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd supporters will say at least he\u0026rsquo;s honest and direct and real. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I\u0026rsquo;m honest and direct and real (ask anyone!) and I don\u0026rsquo;t go around swearing at people just because they point out my faults. There\u0026rsquo;s no reason to antagonize people just because they don\u0026rsquo;t agree with you. It\u0026rsquo;s possible to disagree and still be diplomatic. Not even the leadership of North Korea talks like that. Well, I could talk my head off politics if given the chance, so I\u0026rsquo;ll just abruptly end this post here\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",

The lie was so good, I got a follow-up question about it a year later and was so surprised I just blurted out that my rival died in accident before finally admitting to the fib\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I will intentionally lie often only for fun or mischief, or in the rare case, to protect someone or avoid some problem or injustice. Even for that last scenario I will try to avoid it as much as possible. I am more likely to stay quiet or avoid discussion or maybe even stretch the truth a bit to \u0026ldquo;technically correct\u0026rdquo;, but I try to avoid any outright falsehoods unless absolutely necessary\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this same reason, I kind of have the same aversion to any form of salesmanship, although I am occasionally told that I am good at writing copy. At work I was sometimes asked to write some response to questions in a tender that would be less than honest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t have this feature, how should I respond?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Just say we have it.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;But we don\u0026rsquo;t. How about I just write that this feature will be available?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can see the use of optimistic future tense to stretch the truth a bit. At one point a higher-up even told me that all the other suppliers do that to, as if that justifies it. Being asked to outright be dishonest was stressful for me at best so I later on learned to avoid such tasks altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand that not all salesmanship is dishonest and that not all salesmen are scammers looking to sell snake oil. But we basically live in a world that is caveat emptor don\u0026rsquo;t we? I feel like those salesmen who are honestly just extolling the virtues of their wares are the exception rather than the norm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recognize the need for salesmanship as a skill in everyday life, although younger me would have scoffed at that idea, believing that things should be judged solely on their merits. But merits aren\u0026rsquo;t always obvious, and you still need some level of presentation and good communication skills to push your ideas and merits forward.  I\u0026rsquo;m fine with that I guess, as long as we try to keep things honest.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

They\u0026rsquo;re not wrong. I once spun a tall tale about a childhood rival I had visited in the province who challenged me to a swimming contest to explain why I had lost my glasses to the sea.",
