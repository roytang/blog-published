But what if success for you is not what you expected, or you need to get there through a different route than you imagined? Working smart is much more valuable than working hard. And working smart means being willing to think outside the box and explore different options to achieve your goals. Instead of trying the same things or the same approaches again and again which are not bearing fruit, see if there are other alternatives for you. Maybe your classmates can give you some advice, or maybe your school offers some sort of counseling service to help you with your career goals\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m kind of a serial project starter. I\u0026rsquo;m sure it\u0026rsquo;s a very common thing. I\u0026rsquo;ll often have random ideas for projects I could do, big or small. I\u0026rsquo;d have a dozen of them percolating in my head at any one time. And somewhere between four to five dozen scattered down in various documents, notepads and what not, waiting to be explored. (I literally have two such small post-it notes with 5 such items in front of me right now)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese projects range from the small (programming: small scripts to automate some stuff I do regularly; sketches: quick sketches I want to do; writing: blog posts, short stories;) to the rather large and time-consuming (game development ideas, complicated data analysis ideas, novel ideas, some major reorganization/sorting of stuff, and so on). Unfortunately, starting new projects is rarely fruitful unless you actually finish those projects. And I rarely finish the larger projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about what it takes for me to get one of the largest projects to completion. At which stages do I typically falter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypically it starts with an idea. Something cool I could do. Or make. Or write. At this stage there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of optimism. I\u0026rsquo;m probably in love with the idea. If it\u0026rsquo;s a big enough idea, I might even think it\u0026rsquo;ll make me famous. Or earn me a lot of money. Or win me a nobel prize. Or all of those!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea enough to start on it immediately, I\u0026rsquo;ll add it to one of my lists that hopefully I manage to get back to sometime within the next century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I do like the idea enough, I\u0026rsquo;ll move on to some form of brainstorming. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll let the idea run around in my head for a couple of nights. Typically I\u0026rsquo;ll run the idea through some people I trust and would have a similar interest in the area. Then maybe draw up a short idea document outlining some of the details I\u0026rsquo;ve already imagined, to be expanded or reduced later as needed. If it\u0026rsquo;s a writing thing, I start to think in broad strokes: what the setting is, who the protag is, where I imagine him to be ending etc\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point I pretty much have an idea of what I want to do. The next step is to study what I need to execute. If it\u0026rsquo;s a programming or game development project, I look into what tools I\u0026rsquo;ll need or programming techniques I need to learn. I might need to access or scrape some sort of data source for analysis so I\u0026rsquo;ll start looking for sources\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I would try to get started. For programming stuff I might make a small prototype already. If it\u0026rsquo;s a writing thing, I might write a scene or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the first tranche of work, I\u0026rsquo;m going to assess how much farther I need to go. And typically this is where many of the projects will drop off. At this point I become aware of the size and scope of what I plan to do. I would look at the sheer amount of work needed to bring the project to conclusion, and it can be disheartening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start out optimistic, thinking about the exciting, cool stuff I get to try out, amazing scenes I want to write, interesting gameplay mechanics I thought of, and so on. But once I get past that I start to realize that finishing the job will require a lot of drudgework too. That means a lot of small, annoying, menial tasks that I\u0026rsquo;ll put off and won\u0026rsquo;t want to do\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI read a lot of self-improvement and \u0026ldquo;getting things done\u0026rdquo; sort of stuff, so I know all the usual advice: break down the big tasks into small tasks, take one step at a time, and so on. The problem is usually lack of focus. Since at this point there\u0026rsquo;s a lull in my interest towards the project, it\u0026rsquo;s an opportune time for some other idea to come along and distract me. Or maybe some shiny new video game or book starts taking up my time. Or some other random distraction that takes my time away. Then I\u0026rsquo;m too lazy to pick it up again, and the vicious cycle repeats with the next big project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmaller projects are fine \u0026ndash; the ones that only take me a few hours or a day to do. It\u0026rsquo;s the bigger ones that are the problem. I mostly know where I have to improve \u0026ndash; I have to be able to focus and commit my time. Eliminate distractions. Stay on track. And so on. Someday I\u0026rsquo;ll get it right\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",

Son, we live in a world that has drugs, and those drugs have to be defeated by men with guns. Who\u0026rsquo;s gonna do it? You? I have a greater responsibility than you could possibly fathom. You weep for the collateral damage and you curse the police. You have that luxury, you have the luxury of not knowing what I know. That the collateral deaths, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and impenetrable to you, saves lives. You don\u0026rsquo;t want the truth because deep down in places you don\u0026rsquo;t talk about at parties, you want me on that wall, you need me on that wall. We use words like slaughter, obosen, killings. We use them as a backbone of a life spent defending something. You use them as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very safety that I provide and then questions the manner in which I provide it. I would rather you just said thank you, and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon, and kill some druggies.

Why is this to be considered a great virtue for a programmer? Programming is at least partly an act of creation, which means there is an element of craftsmanship involved. A craftsman imbued with hubris is able to take pride in his work \u0026ndash; he is driven to create work that is the best quality he can provide. For a programmer, this quality reflects both externally (low number of defects) and internally (code that is easy to read and maintain)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also programmers who do not see themselves as craftsmen, but rather simply code-generating cogs in a machine. They are not imbued with hubris, and hence have no concern with the quality of their work. Their only concern is to be able to do the bare minimum to satisfy the requirements of their tasks. And if you that is the way you choose to live and work, that can be fine for many people\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn general however, I find that programmers who are able to take pride in their work are more able to go the extra mile. They will tend to be more productive, they will be more able to think outside the box, they will be more able to provide suggestions for improvement, they will be more willing and able to help and support other programmers, and so on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis ability to take pride in one\u0026rsquo;s work applies at the company level too. There are companies that don\u0026rsquo;t like to focus on quality or standards or doing things right. When your company decides that quality is not that important and sacrifices it at the altar of profits, it reflects poorly upon the craftsmen in your company and affects their happiness and morale. No craftsman will be happy being pressured to do substantial work simply because the company is unwilling to manage schedules properly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are a leader in a company who has developed a culture of quality and craftsmanship, think long and hard before pivoting to any direction that takes away from that culture. There are people who stay at a company simply because they enjoy being craftsmen able to do high-quality work. If you take that away, well, you can imagine the consequences\u003c/p\u003e\n",
