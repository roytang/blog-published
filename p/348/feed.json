With family. With relatives. With friends. With friends of family. With coworkers. With coworkers who are friends. It\u0026rsquo;s not that I don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy myself at these gatherings mind you. In fact, lately I\u0026rsquo;ve found myself enjoying the company of other people more. It\u0026rsquo;s just that I\u0026rsquo;m not yet an entirely social person, and too many social gatherings too soon somewhat stretches the limits of my comfort zone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristmas is stressful. Everyone is busy, busy, busy. Going from place to place apparently, as the traffic has been horrible lately, with jams stretching well into the early morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of early morning, I left work close to midnight last night. We\u0026rsquo;ve been in crunch mode for the past two weeks or so, what with multiple deadlines coming up in January. Not that I can\u0026rsquo;t handle of course. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that every other developer in one of my projects is going to be on vacation next week. Since I\u0026rsquo;ve had to run on pure genius these past few days, and as side effect, I was often more loud, sarcastic and smarmy than usual. To anyone who was annoyed by this, I apologize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the highlight of my last day of work before Christmas? Sometime before dinner I wrote a love letter and sent it by email to her. Nothing much, just telling her some things I wanted her to know, and greeting her for the holidays and stuff. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting anything back, but I guess I got lucky. A few minutes before I left the office, I got a jabber message from her. To paraphrase:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003eher: boo!\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher: thanks for the lovely letter :)\nme: I\u0026rsquo;m glad you liked it. my christmas is complete :)\n\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was more of course, a small exchange of pleasantries and even more holiday greetings. But I got that warm, fuzzy feeling again. Maybe Christmas this year wasn\u0026rsquo;t so bad after all. =)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHappy Holidays!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

One of my reports needs to show two tables side-by-side in Excel, but I have to generate the rows for each table independently (i.e. from separate SQL queries). My first thought was to use tables-within-a-table in the HTML source, but it seems that Excel loses the column widths (i.e., the column widths change from what I\u0026rsquo;ve set them to before) when I try to create a new table inside one of the existing s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to preserve the widths of the columns outside the inner table. Any idea how this can be done? Or maybe someone can point me to online resources that might help?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, this has been sort of a low-pri task for me, so I haven\u0026rsquo;t had much time to check it out; but the deadline is creeping up on me fast.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eEvil illegal loggers have been in the news lately, mainly due to their being blamed as scapegoats for the rash of flooding during the last two typhoons that left hundreds, maybe thousands, dead in their wake and strewing devastation upon this blighted land. I\u0026rsquo;m not here to talk about whether the loggers are indeed to blame, or how it\u0026rsquo;s silly for the government to try to implement a total log ban when they can\u0026rsquo;t even implement a selective log ban, or how chances are everyone important will forget about this in, say a month tops, while the victims continue their struggle to recover even a fraction of their once-normal lives. No, these topics have already been covered to death in serious newspaper editorials and columns. And possible internet discussions in Pinoy-bloggerland, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, I\u0026rsquo;m not particularly familiar with that scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, as always, I prefer to attack this from a more personal angle. And like some of my more interesting stories, this one is about a taxi driver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a bit old, and his first few attempts at conversation were annoying at best. Later, toward the end of the trip, we glimpsed one of the day\u0026rsquo;s headlines on some tabloid. Something about the government wanting to implement a total log ban. He goes on to say that\u0026rsquo;s an impossible thing, they\u0026rsquo;d never be able to implement it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurns out he worked for the Department of Environment and Natural Resources for some fifteen-odd years. As a forest ranger. Wow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow of course, as someone who indulges often in the fantasy genre, my idea of ‘Forest Rangers\u0026rsquo; is closely associated either Aragorn from Lord of the Rings, or someone who likes to stop bears from stealing picnic baskets. This guy leaned more towards the latter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on his stories, it seems like the news articles detailing the lack of manpower at the DENR are accurate. He says forest rangers were often assigned to guard or patrol some forty hectares of land. Or maybe it was four hectares, I forget — I had this conversation more than three days ago. In any case, I have no idea how large a hectare is anyway. But from his narratives it seemed like the area assigned to them was far too much for one man to cover. Add to that the fact that he and his co-rangers were often harassed by Communist rebels that are supposedly in bed with the illegal loggers, and life was really difficult for them back then. It was a much easier life to just while away your day slacking or goofing off, rather than risk your own life to try to catch some illegal loggers who would probably get off the hook easily anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe told about treestampers. Or something like that. Basically, people whose job it is to mark trees to indicate which ones are okay for cutting by which company. Or something. Forgive me; I\u0026rsquo;m really hazy on the details, maybe because I\u0026rsquo;m sleepy. Anyway, apparently a lot of these treestampers have lifestyles far beyond their income. When the bribe money comes in, it\u0026rsquo;s a race to mark trees, with no regard for the tree\u0026rsquo;s age or species or location or whatnot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what I have to say about this, I just thought the hearsay I got from him would be interesting to relate. I\u0026rsquo;m not exactly a radical environmentalist. As a friend of mine once said, \u0026ldquo;Trees? What have they ever done for me?\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m a city dude, born and bred, so I seldom worry about such things, it\u0026rsquo;s not really part of my thinking. And I don\u0026rsquo;t really think I can judge people who live on a small government subsidy and have to do what they can to get a decent living. Hey, we\u0026rsquo;re all just out to make some scratch, right? Except that the living some of these guys make may have cost countless lives and destruction of property. Sadly, I think this is just part of the general malaise that plagues our society. Resources are scarce, so the less fortunate among us are forged to scrounge around for whatever we can, the law and the environment be damned. Of course, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that the rest of the country only gives a damn shortly after a tragedy happens. Will we ever learn?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

There\u0026rsquo;s a service for him at Pisay tomorrow, Dec. 3, Friday. Since I doubt I can go, I\u0026rsquo;ll say my piece here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlix was a helluva guy. Friendly and gets well with the students. And he gave high grades. Seriously. He gave me flat 1.0s (highest possible grade) for all four quarters of fourth year math. Now, not to brag, when I was in high school, math was my thing. Seriously, I could breeze through my high school math classes in my sleep. And few of my batch mates will contradict me when I say I was one of the best, if not _the _best in math in our batch. (That last part is debatable, \u003ca href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/zukeeper/\"\u003esome people \u003c/a\u003emight contest it. :p) The point of this is not me bragging, since I do that often, it\u0026rsquo;s nothing special. No, the point is that I seldom took math period seriously. I often spent math class doodling something in my notebooks, at least on those occasions that I had a pen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn one such math class, Alix caught me and a classmate (you know who you are\u0026hellip; ) passing around a hand-drawn comic strip in class. (During my high school days, I often spent my free energy drawing such small strips about classroom happenings, particularly in the second year. Alas, none of the aforementioned high-school artworks have survived. But I digress.) I got a severe tongue-lashing for that one, something along the lines of \u0026ldquo;No matter how good you are at math, you can\u0026rsquo;t just goof off in class.\u0026rdquo; I felt quite bad about the incident, not only because I got to eat some humble pie in front of the class, but mostly because I felt like I had disappointed the guy. It\u0026rsquo;s not that I don\u0026rsquo;t goof off in other classes, I certainly do; but I felt that Alix expected more of me, since for some reason he believed me to be a good student. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the nerve to respond or apologize to him about this, I just took my tongue-lashing in silence. I wish I had told him I was sorry. I realize this is such a small, trivial matter, but God knows I like to obsess over small, trivial matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, cheers to you sir Alix, wherever you may be. I don\u0026rsquo;t spend much time with the other alumni, but over the past few days, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen the news of your passing spread through the online Pisay alumni community quickly, and many are planning to be there Friday. Rest well, sir Alix, and know that your students look back at you fondly.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

When I first got access to the Internet, I was overjoyed. \u0026ldquo;Wow! Lots of stuff to read!\u0026rdquo; And I read a lot online. I started mostly with anime fanfiction, but pretty soon I enjoyed reading discussions on mailing-lists, message boards, news sites, etc. The internet is a treasure trove for one who always strives for information. But I digress, this post is not about the wondrous internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s about the fact that I like to read. In particular, I like to read books. In fact, I thought about posting something like this because I was looking for a particular book. Specifically, \u003cem\u003ethe Wastelands\u003c/em\u003e, third book of Stephen King\u0026rsquo;s Dark Tower series. And I don\u0026rsquo;t want just any copy, I want a copy in the same series as the first two books I already have. I\u0026rsquo;ve looked through several National Bookstore branches already, but have yet to find one. I know they used to have a copy at the SM North Edsa branch, since that\u0026rsquo;s where I bought the second book \u003cem\u003eDrawing of the Three\u003c/em\u003e. However, I can\u0026rsquo;t find it there; it seems that branch is under renovation, maybe I\u0026rsquo;m just too confused at the change in layout. The salespeople don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be much help either. \u0026ldquo;Stephen King? Try the horror section.\u0026rdquo; That would be great except Dark Tower is not a horror series!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I digress again. Back to the topic. I like to read. I like to read books. The internet sort of changed that. After I first got internet access, I seldom read books for a period of time, meaning most of my college years. In fact, I think the only series of books I was able to follow during my college years was Robert Jordan\u0026rsquo;s Wheel of Time series. (Short review? Started out okay, then got silly, then got annoying. Serious milking cow.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I started working, I had a source of income. (Wow, what a deep and non-obvious statement!) Given this, I was able to start reading again, not only by borrowing from friends (Hi Dave, Mike!), but this time I was able to buy the occasional book myself. So I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to catch up. Sadly, I think the years of reading lots of stuff online has tarnished my reading skills. I still read far, far quicker than most people, but it takes me ages to finish a single book. nowadays. I\u0026rsquo;m currently reading Neil Gaiman\u0026rsquo;s American Gods; I started about a week agao, but I\u0026rsquo;m not even a fifth of the way in! It\u0026rsquo;s not that it\u0026rsquo;s a bad book, it\u0026rsquo;s okay, in Gaiman\u0026rsquo;s usual way, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s because there are a lot more distractions in my life nowadays (work, love or lack of it, video games, blogging); When I was young I was able to read a lot because whenever I had free time I would curl up with a good book. These days however, I find that whatever free time I have, I prefer to spend it in quiet \u003cem\u003emuni-muni\u003c/em\u003e instead of having to use my brainpower to go through a potentially difficult book (thanks, Cryptonomicon!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also want to read more non-fiction, autobiographies and stuff. But I find that such books are usually more expensive than normal paperback novels, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know who I can borrow such from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, what\u0026rsquo;s the point of this post? I like to read. And I want to read more. That is all.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
