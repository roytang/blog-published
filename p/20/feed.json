I guess people got tired of being cooped up, which is not unexpected. The government messaging has not been very tight about the reopening, they should have made much clearer that despite the loosening of restrictions we should still take precautions and not go out unless absolutely essential. I guess it\u0026rsquo;s an indicator that many people were not staying in because they wanted to avoid spreading the virus, but rather because they had nowhere to go. I jokingly told some friends that maybe we should require something like a P1000 entrance fee to the malls.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI mean, that\u0026rsquo;s true in general of course. But it certainly seems much more true in these \u003ca href=\"/2020/03/covid19/\"\u003epandemic times\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore all of this \u003cem\u003ewaves hands arounds frantically\u003c/em\u003e, people had a general sense of routine and predictability about their daily lives. It varied person by person of course, but many people had regular things like a steady job that kept them occupied for most of the week, a school where their kids could go off to most days, maybe a favorite bar or restaurant they visit every week or so, church on Sundays, friends you saw every other weekend or so, malls or stores they would pass by regularly, and so on and so forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though I had a generally looser schedule than most, I was still often able to plot out my coming days with relative accuracy. Oh, I have a client meeting on this day. Then the next day I have to run these errands. Then meeting up with friends (maybe for a quiz night) the evening after. On the weekend a visit with my brothers and the nieces. That kind of thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I would have had some fairly safe medium-term predictions too. If you had asked me at the \u003ca href=\"/2020/01/new-years-checklist/\"\u003estart of the year\u003c/a\u003e, I would have thought I\u0026rsquo;d have seen the Black Widow movies by now, played Final Fantasy VII Remake, and got together with the family in April to celebrate birthdays. But none of those came to pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNowadays, that kind of reasonable prediction seems like a distant memory. Weeks come and go and all the days seem to blend in together, each one indistinguishable from the last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve thought about writing something about what to expect down the road, or the \u0026ldquo;new normal\u0026rdquo; or what not, but (a) so many people (many of whom I\u0026rsquo;m sure are better qualified) are already writing things like that; and (b) I think a lot of it is largely pointless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have all these models and graphs and projections coming out, with varying degrees of reliability. They tell us things like, there will be M cases and N deaths by so-and-so date unless we do this or that. Each model is slightly different, depending on many factors like the country being studied or the data being analyzed and such. And maybe they\u0026rsquo;re right. Surely at least some of them are, right? But all of these are, to make a software development analogy, estimates. Some are certainly more accurate than others - it falls to our individual discernment whether we choose to believe experts and scientists or populist politicians or whatever - but in the end, all of them are still just estimates. Trend-spotting based on data that is probably largely incomplete (certainly so in the case of my own country). And just like estimates, there\u0026rsquo;s no way to know for certain which will turn out to be correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of all the models and trends and predictions, the future remains incredibly hazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many cases will we end up with? How many deaths? All as of yet unknown, but almost certainly far too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill we have a vaccine this year? Next year? In 2022? No one knows for sure. There are many vaccines and treatments in development, but we won\u0026rsquo;t know for a while which ones will turn out effective, if any. There may never be a permanent vaccine, the same way we don\u0026rsquo;t have one for the common cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill there be a second wave? Seems likely. Will it be under control? Who knows. Even countries we previously thought to be doing well are in danger of a possible resurgence, so what then? How much more countries like us that have done far worse in controlling the spread?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill the ECQ in Metro Manila be lifted after the 15th? Nobody knows, even up to now, a mere 5 days before the deadline. And if it is lifted, what happens then? There are people counting down to the ECQ lifting as if it would be \u0026ldquo;back to normal\u0026rdquo;, I can\u0026rsquo;t say it will be, but it almost certainly shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be. Maybe there will be an explosion of people, tired of being cooped up in their houses, and a corresponding explosion of cases, and we are forced to go back to a stricter lockdown. That\u0026rsquo;s my guess, but again, nothing is certain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen will people be able to go back to work? When will your favorite restaurant be open again? When will you get to meet up with friends again? When can I travel to other countries again? All of these, nobody knows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI joke with my parents and brothers that the next time we\u0026rsquo;ll be seeing each other in person again would probably be in August during my birthday month, but something that far off might not come to pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd people are talking about what the \u0026ldquo;new normal\u0026rdquo; is going to be like. That we might have to live with social distancing precautions in the medium-to-long term moving forward. We may be looking at months or maybe even years of social distancing measures. Or cycles of lockdown and loosening, until there is a widespread vaccine, or maybe forever? All distinct possibilities, but again, there\u0026rsquo;s no certainty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there are people that say humanity is going to learn our lesson from this crisis and realize that so many things we previously accepted in our daily life are BS that we can do without. Short list: overpopulation, inequality, low pay for essential workers, work commutes, dress codes, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies will see that work from home is effective, so it will be more common moving forward! The anecdotal reports of companies implementing draconian surveillance schemes to monitor their remote workers makes me doubt that one actually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t buy that this crisis will change society for the better (though I am more than willing to be surprised). Many humans are too set in their ways and can\u0026rsquo;t even be bothered to endure minor inconveniences like wearing a mask to costco or whatever. And there are many who can\u0026rsquo;t wait to be right back there sucking at the fresh teat of capitalism, instead of maybe looking for alternatives that promote and protect the commons instead of exploiting the vulnerable. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong - there are many positive and hopeful stories coming out of this pandemic, of people helping other people get by - that heighten my faith in humanity. My faith in humanity\u0026rsquo;s leadership and elite, however, is probably at an all-time low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the models and projections and predictions for the new normal, these things are useful at the policymaking levels. But for those of us just living our every day lives, it is difficult to look so far ahead. Right now, we are roiling about in a sea of uncertainty, unsure of what the future brings. All we can worry about will be what the next day looks like. Maybe the best we can do right now is just to take it one step at a time, and hope that we are making the right decisions to build towards a new normal that will actually be better than the last one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis post turned out more ranty than I thought it would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I mean, that\u0026rsquo;s true in general of course. But it certainly seems much more true in these pandemic times.\nBefore all of this waves hands arounds frantically, people had a general sense of routine and predictability about their daily lives. It varied person by person of course, but many people had regular things like a steady job that kept them occupied for most of the week, a school where their kids could go off to most days, maybe a favorite bar or restaurant they visit every week or so, church on Sundays, friends you saw every other weekend or so, malls or stores they would pass by regularly, and so on and so forth.",

Should be enough to last us for 2 weeksish. The grocery actually seemed less chaotic than usual.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEarly this morning (after the mass) I took a walk outside for the first time since the lockdown started. Previously I had only gone out for groceries and meds. Only for less than 30 mins, and only in our subdivision, walking up and down the street. It\u0026rsquo;s good to be walking again, although this short and limited route is quite boring and full of neighbor\u0026rsquo;s dogs barking at me, so I\u0026rsquo;m not too fond of it, but it\u0026rsquo;s better to get the habit started again since I\u0026rsquo;ve been feeling the fatness piling on due to the quarantine and the lack of exercise.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStill no word on what happens to Metro Manila after the ECQ \u0026ldquo;ends\u0026rdquo; on the 15th. The mayors gave a bunch of options to the IATF that basically amounted to \u0026ldquo;whatever, we can\u0026rsquo;t decide\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethere\u0026rsquo;s this great site showing the progress of different countries in battling the pandemic: \u003ca href=\"https://www.endcoronavirus.org/countries\"\u003eEnd Coronavirus .org\u003c/a\u003e. While some of our leadership are claiming we have already flattened the curve, comparing our data to other countries shows we still clearly need improvement.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe government is already preparing guidelines for when we shift to GCQ like only 150 passengers per MRT train (good luck with that!) and so on. This implies that they are leaning towards shifting from ECQ to the more lenient GCQ already.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe really have no data to indicate that the pandemic is under control in NCR, so lifting the ECQ would probably be dangerous, if not outright foolish. That being said, another question is how much longer people can take being under ECQ at all.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSocial distancing in some barangays in QC \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/PhilstarNews/status/1259388201950568449\"\u003ewent out the window today\u003c/a\u003e, as it\u0026rsquo;s the last day for distributing the social assistance funds to those in need. The QC government has had a lot of trouble distributing aid to their residents, which might be explained away by the sheer size of the city (and the fact that administrative support for a population does not scale linearly). I wonder what the statistics are re: number of government employees vs number of citizens per city in Metro Manila? In any case, large-scale logistics has never been the strong point of the Philippine government, at any level. This kind of chaos really holds us back as a society.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWord has it that there were a lot of cars outside today, presumably people buying food to celebrate Mother\u0026rsquo;s Day? For us, we just held a zoom call with the grandkids as usual.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAs of today, we are at 10793 cases (+184 from yesterday), 719 deaths (+15 from yesterday), 1924 recoveries (+82 from yesterday). We\u0026rsquo;re still gaining more than 1,500 active cases a week, although a lot of those are now in the provinces. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if there\u0026rsquo;s a data source I can use that shows the trends for NCR only? \u003ca href=\"https://covid19ph.com/\"\u003eReference.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorldwide, we are at 4 million cases and 280,000 deaths. A full 1/3rd of all worldwide cases and 2/7ths of all deaths are in the US, which is still raring to reopen for the sake of the economy.

Basically saying if there\u0026rsquo;s something you regret not being able to start earlier on, it would be a trap to think that you can\u0026rsquo;t just start it today. I say somewhat related to the first bullet because as I was reviewing some older blog entries during the past few weeks I was wondering if I could have made it as a \u0026ldquo;successful blogger\u0026rdquo; like the people mentioned above if I had only been more consistent with my content. Such regrets are ridiculous, as the post implies, because I could always just ramp up my linkblogging now if I wanted.

This is not exactly unexpected given the current situation and the bleak outlook for the travel industry in the near term, but what I found exceptional was \u003ca href=\"https://news.airbnb.com/a-message-from-co-founder-and-ceo-brian-chesky/\"\u003eCEO Brian Chesky\u0026rsquo;s message to their employees\u003c/a\u003e. Announcing layoffs is obviously a feel-bad, but this note was handled extremely well, walking through the rationales and the painful decision and giving their staff clear expectations on what will happen moving forward.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOne tech company that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been treating their employees too well however, has been Amazon. Last week, a \u003ca href=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/04/29/Leaving-Amazon\"\u003epost\u003c/a\u003e from Amazon VP, Senior Engineer, and XML spec-writer Tim Bray made the rounds as he publicly declared he was resigning from his position (costing him around a million dollars) because of how the company has fired whistleblowers who were complaining about Covid-19 safety concerns at their warehouses. Good for Bray, and boo for Amazon. One may also find the links he posted in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/05/06/Answers\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;Responses\u0026rdquo; post\u003c/a\u003e of interest as well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/magazine/closing-prune-restaurant-covid.html\"\u003eGreat article in the NY times\u003c/a\u003e (Annoying paywall warning!) about what it\u0026rsquo;s like owning and having to shutdown a restaurant in these times.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/\"\u003e68 bits of unsolicited advise\u003c/a\u003e from Kevin Kelly\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been enjoying Tom Scott\u0026rsquo;s Youtube channel recently (unsurprisingly, he\u0026rsquo;s a very popular Youtuber).

Only for less than 30 mins, and only in our subdivision, walking up and down the street. It\u0026rsquo;s good to be walking again, although this short and limited route is quite boring and full of neighbor\u0026rsquo;s dogs barking at me, so I\u0026rsquo;m not too fond of it, but it\u0026rsquo;s better to get the habit started again since I\u0026rsquo;ve been feeling the fatness piling on due to the quarantine and the lack of exercise.",

Strap yourselves in, this is going to be a long one!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-early-years\"\u003eThe Early Years\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started playing MTG in my fourth year of high school, so that\u0026rsquo;s around sometime 1994-1995. The most recent expansion releases at that time were The Dark and Fallen Empires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blame for this lifelong hobby/obsession lies solely at the feet of the older brother of one of my HS batchmates, who introduced me and a few friends to the game. (Said older brother would later go on to become one of the first few MTG Philippines national champions). Back then each of us only had a few cards and supply was tight. I remember there was only one nearby store in SM North that sold booster packs, and they only had a few come in every other week or so. The earliest card I remember opening from a booster pack was a \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=446206\"\u003eJuggernaut\u003c/a\u003e from Revised. (I remember being amazed because it can\u0026rsquo;t be blocked by walls!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur early decks in those times were super crude, with vanilla creatures all over. \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=189903\"\u003eCraw Wurm\u003c/a\u003e was a big deal! We called decks that opened with turn one Forest into \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=201404\"\u003eScryb Sprites\u003c/a\u003e as \u0026ldquo;fast decks!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe carried on playing the game into our college days of course. We hung out with a group of other Magic players and played a lot of random decks. Most of it was casual in-between classes games, and I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I missed at least one exam because I was too busy playing Magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround this time, we also started joining some tournaments, most of them held at a restaurant along Katipunan called \u0026ldquo;Chinoys\u0026rdquo;. These tournaments don\u0026rsquo;t appear in my DCI history, so either they weren\u0026rsquo;t official DCI tournaments or I have some other DCI number floating around in the ether with history I\u0026rsquo;ll never be able to recover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember running a red green deck with \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383122\"\u003eTaigas\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=442130\"\u003eLightning Bolts\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413679\"\u003eKird Apes\u003c/a\u003e and such. I also had the classic \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=438723\"\u003eChannel\u003c/a\u003e + \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=438694\"\u003eFireball\u003c/a\u003e combo in the deck, with cards like \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=184678\"\u003eTinder Wall\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383038\"\u003eOrcish Lumberjack\u003c/a\u003e for the random off chance of a turn 2 or 3 kill. (I couldn\u0026rsquo;t afford a \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382866\"\u003eBlack Lotus\u003c/a\u003e for the turn 1 kill!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a time before internet usage was widespread, so netdecks weren\u0026rsquo;t really a big thing yet. So there was a huge variation in the decks we\u0026rsquo;d face in these tournaments and casually elsewhere. Some of the decks I remember playing against during this era:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea blue red deck that killed me during a tournament with a \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=438631\"\u003eMana Drain\u003c/a\u003e into \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=106636\"\u003eDisintegrate\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethere was this guy who always went to tournaments with a Goblin deck, using cards like \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=159759\"\u003eGoblins of the Flarg\u003c/a\u003e combined with \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=442110\"\u003eBall Lightnings\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=201272\"\u003eBlood Lust\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=438485\"\u003eGoblin Grenades\u003c/a\u003e for quick wins.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI remember playing a discard deck with \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=190566\"\u003eHypnotic Spectres\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413634\"\u003eHymn to Tourach\u003c/a\u003e at a smaller tournament (not at Chinoy\u0026rsquo;s) somewhere where the opponent was using \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=83058\"\u003eDisrupting Sceptre\u003c/a\u003e on my draw step even though I later realized that ability can only be played during his turn. At that same tournament, some guy also used \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=201122\"\u003eBoomerang\u003c/a\u003e to pull his spell back off the stack into his hand for some reason.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI remember a white deck that used small creatures like \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=394374\"\u003eIcatian Javilineer\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2011\"\u003esac lands\u003c/a\u003e + \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413544\"\u003eBalance\u003c/a\u003e/\u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=441994\"\u003eArmageddon\u003c/a\u003e to seal the deal.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring this time, one of the main sources of MTG info was \u003cem\u003eInquest\u003c/em\u003e magazine. It included things like card lists, rumors and info on upcoming sets, MTG puzzles, trivia, interviews and other such fun stuff. I think I might even have a few copies lying around the house somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-competitive-years\"\u003eThe Competitive Years\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy earliest competitive tournament records under my DCI number were in 2001. One of them was this standard tournament held at the UP College of Science, I ran 5-3 and finished 7th place. I remember running a RGBw Invasion-era deck with \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209155\"\u003ebattlemages\u003c/a\u003e (because I loved the card advantage) and even had a mascot \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=469888\"\u003eShivan Dragon\u003c/a\u003e in the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of my favorite Limited tournaments was also in 2001, it was an Invasion block team limited trios tournament held in Makati. Our team finished the swiss in the top two teams, so we got to play Rochester draft in the finals. I believe this was the only time I ever played Rochester draft. We ended up finishing second and going home with a box of Apocalypse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy competitive play stepped up when I started working in Ortigas in 2003. In the upcoming years, many major tournaments would be held at the Robinson\u0026rsquo;s Galleria mall, only a 15 minute walk away from our office. A bunch of other office mates got into the hobby as well, which was really helpful for the purpose of playing competitively - we could borrow/trade cards easily and it also meant we had a pool of regularly accessible playtest partners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy peak competitive years were during 2006-2009, where I played 575 tournament matches over those four years. It\u0026rsquo;s not a lot compared to some of the more hardcore members of the local community, as I mostly didn\u0026rsquo;t play smaller tournaments like FNMs. I usually played larger events like regionals, nationals qualifiers, grand prix trials, and pro tour qualifiers. At that time there were enough that I could usually play a larger event weekly or every other week. I had a few top 8 finishes in regionals, ptqs and gpts, but never managed any big finishes or things like qualifying for nationals or worlds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe biggest tournaments I was able to play in during these years were Grand Prix Manila in 2006 and 2008. I enjoyed playing Grand Prixs so much I decided to play my first foreign tournament in Grand Prix Bangkok in 2009. I really enjoy Grand Prixs, they\u0026rsquo;re the highest-level events I\u0026rsquo;m able to play (since they\u0026rsquo;re open), so they\u0026rsquo;re super competitive, and it\u0026rsquo;s like an entire weekend devoted to Magic. Oh, and the venues are usually much better (more spacious, more food available, etc) than our usual weekend tournaments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"on-and-off-again\"\u003eOn and Off Again\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom 2010 to the present, my MTG activity started to taper off. Both of my play groups kind of fell apart - my HS magic group had mostly moved overseas and many of the ones in my work group had lost interest. I was still playing regularly, but at a much lower frequency. I tried not to miss new set prereleases, those are always chill and fun and easy. I also still played in GPTs and PTQs and larger events like that, whenever the opportunity arose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also took the opportunity to keep playing Grand Prixs. I took the opportunity to travel whenever there was a Grand Prix in Singapore, since some of my HS magic group live there now and it was always an opportunity to play with them. So far I\u0026rsquo;ve ended up playing 12 Grand Prixs lifetime, 5 in Manila, 4 in Singapore, and 1 each in Bangkok, London and Seattle. You can see my Grand Prix tournament reports \u003ca href=\"/tags/grand-prix/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;ve not had particularly awesome results for my GP runs either. Of 12 GPs, I\u0026rsquo;ve qualified for day 2 twice, both times finishing in the top 30-40.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from the Grand Prixs, I\u0026rsquo;ve also managed to play overseas for a few other opportunities. I\u0026rsquo;ve done a prerelease at Hareruya in Tokyo, one in Barcelona, and a couple of years ago I got to do an RPTQ in Kuala Lumpur. Playing overseas and with players of different cultures is always a great change of pace and a good experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem with playing so sporadically of course was that it was difficult to get a good grip on the Standard format. From 2014 forward, I started preferring the Modern format for constructed, since it\u0026rsquo;s an eternal format and in theory decks last much longer and you don\u0026rsquo;t need to spend much time/resources keeping up. (Tell that to my banned Splinter Twin deck!) In 2019 some friends also started to get me into Pauper, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how much I like it yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-online-era\"\u003eThe Online Era\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was for paper Magic. In 2009, I started playing Magic Online. By all accounts, Magic Online is a terrible platform and piece of software, but it was better than nothing! MTGO meant I could play Magic anytime at my convenience (subject to the whims of my internet connection). I ended up playing mostly limited of limited on MTGO, I think I only played constructed for one season with a cheap monored deck. The downside of course, was that MTGO was only slightly less expensive than paper Magic. Maybe someday I\u0026rsquo;ll gather stats on how much I spent on MTGO, but I suspect I won\u0026rsquo;t be too happy with the totals lol. My playing MTGO has been on and off though, similar to my paper magic run during the past decade or so. Typically I\u0026rsquo;ll favor one or the other during a particular season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of people will say they prefer playing in paper Magic over online, but I\u0026rsquo;m not one of those people. Paper has several distinct disadvantages for me over online:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehaving to go places to play, especially annoying given the poor traffic situation in Metro Manila. Most venues are also poorly ventilated and you spend a lot of time in uncomfortable chairs and unable to get food between rounds. Compare that to being able to play in the comforts of home.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehaving to shuffle. For longer tournaments, my being \u003ca href=\"/2008/04/pasmado/\"\u003epasmado\u003c/a\u003e has always been problematic.

Especially here in the PH where ordering singles online isn\u0026rsquo;t always viable or economically feasible.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehaving to watch out for cheating.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehaving to talk to people. I\u0026rsquo;m not as social as other players lol\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA more robust and interesting online platform was the introduction of \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/mtg-arena/\"\u003eMagic Arena\u003c/a\u003e in 2018. I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing it since the closed beta and I much prefer playing on Arena than on MTGO, mainly because on Arena I can get by with being completely free to play, and still be able to play top-tier constructed decks (and occasionally some limited runs as well). Arena still has a lot of limitations - it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have my favorite format Modern for one thing, and it will be a while before older card sets are available there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"stats-and-competitiveness\"\u003eStats and Competitiveness\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I\u0026rsquo;ve played a lot of Magic through the years (\u003ca href=\"/2020/04/1254830015717404674/\"\u003e230th overall\u003c/a\u003e in lifetime PWPs in the country), I don\u0026rsquo;t consider myself a particularly \u003cem\u003egood\u003c/em\u003e player. Maybe slightly above average at best. My \u003ca href=\"/page/stats/mtg/\"\u003epaper MTG stats\u003c/a\u003e bear that out, with my overall win rate only being slightly higher than 50%. I wish I could get my stats for MTGO and Arena as well though - maybe that would improve things a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of the old timey players in the local community do know me though, due to playing a lot in the 2000s and being around for so long. On occassion, some people may have also referred to me as a \u0026ldquo;limited specialist\u0026rdquo; for some reason. My draft and sealed win rates are slightly better than my constructed win rates, but not by much. I do enjoy limited a lot, and a an important reason for that is that I don\u0026rsquo;t much like the \u0026ldquo;collectible\u0026rdquo; part of Magic. My favorite part of limited events is that I don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about finding singles and putting together a deck beforehand, I just get to show, build a deck, and play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite not considering myself a particularly good player, I still do identify as a competitive \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Spike\"\u003espike\u003c/a\u003e\u0026rdquo;. I attribute my poor win rate and lack of competitive success largely to being lazy. I don\u0026rsquo;t like to grind too much and I don\u0026rsquo;t like to spend too much time play testing, both of which are important factors in getting top tier results competitively. I can play reasonably well, but lack of consistent practice means my execution can be off, or I might miss more complex lines of play, but to get the best results you basically need to be playing perfectly almost all of the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"favorite-decks\"\u003eFavorite Decks\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I\u0026rsquo;m reminiscing, I want to remember some favorite constructed decks I\u0026rsquo;ve playted through the years:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efor casual play, there was this fun deck I used to play back during the college days where I basically put together a bunch of fun cards into a mostly singleton deck featuring \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=27634\"\u003eQuesting Phelddagrif\u003c/a\u003e. This was before Commander was ever a thing!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eprior to 2008, I was mostly a rogue deckbuilder, coming up with my own brews to bring to tournaments. One of my favorite rogue brews was this monoblack \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=136208\"\u003eKorlash Heir to Blackblade\u003c/a\u003e deck I ran \u003ca href=\"/2007/05/future-sight-inaugural-ng-galleria-26-may-2007/\"\u003ebefore regionals in 2007\u003c/a\u003e. (I ended up netdecking for regionals itself)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethere was this fantastic Bant \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=451135\"\u003eFinest Hour\u003c/a\u003e list that I played to a top 8 finish in the \u003ca href=\"/2009/05/regionals-2009-finest-hour-top-8/\"\u003e2009 regionals\u003c/a\u003e. It was a fun aggro-control deck that also had a lot of challenging technical lines of play.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ein 2015, I day 2\u0026rsquo;ed Grand Prix Manila with \u003ca href=\"/2015/02/grand-prix-manila-2015/\"\u003ethis great Jeskai Ascendancy standard deck\u003c/a\u003e that I had a blast playing.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efor Modern, my current deck of choice is Grixis \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=425889\"\u003eDeath Shadow\u003c/a\u003e, which I last played in \u003ca href=\"/2019/08/mcq-richmond-modern-with-grixis-death-shadow/\"\u003ean MCQ in 2019\u003c/a\u003e. I love these interactive and grindy midrange decks where you try to gain incremental advantage every turn, very skill-testing.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"moving-forward\"\u003eMoving Forward\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what to expect for me personally in terms of MTG moving forward. The main consideration is financial: since I\u0026rsquo;m not working full-time anymore, I can\u0026rsquo;t really be spending so much money on Magic as a hobby, especially for travelling. I\u0026rsquo;d probably still enjoy playing in a Grand Prix if there\u0026rsquo;s a local one, not sure if foreign GPs would still be worth it. And while paper tourneys are really the only way for me to enjoy Modern (when Modern is good), I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I\u0026rsquo;m cut out for travelling through Metro Manila traffic to spend my entire day in a hot crowded tournament venue anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven given all of that, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to say I\u0026rsquo;m quitting paper Magic. I\u0026rsquo;ve already said that too many times in the past. And I\u0026rsquo;m still sitting on a sizeable pool of cards (shared with some friends), so before I quit, I\u0026rsquo;d have to consider some kind of exit strategy for that (and probably my MTGO collection too).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, I don\u0026rsquo;t even know what is going to happen to competitive paper Magic moving forward. As I recall, there weren\u0026rsquo;t any APAC GPs scheduled this year, whereas before we always had at least two per year. If there\u0026rsquo;s a new GP Manila, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably want to play that, but who knows when that will be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still love playing the game itself. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried various other CCGs over the years, both offline and online, and really nothing compares to Magic still. It is the king of CCGs in terms of being enjoyable and in terms of presenting fun and complex and interesting lines of play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think the likelihood is that Magic Arena may very well be my preferred platform for playing Magic moving forwards (assuming Wizards doesn\u0026rsquo;t screw it up because of tightening up the generosity for F2Pers like myself), with the occasional foray into paper tournaments as needed. Realistically, I may still be playing Magic another 25 years down the line!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I briefly considered asking my brother to drive over and bring my PS4 home, but that isn\u0026rsquo;t really essential travel so I thought better of it. Cloud and company will have to wait. I\u0026rsquo;m not in a hurry, and really, there\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of other games to play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription/may-2020\"\u003eHumble Choice for May\u003c/a\u003e is out, but not too happy with the choices.

I\u0026rsquo;ve seen this in a few other blogs, where they track all their media (TV/movies/books) consumption. I\u0026rsquo;m already doing this more often with the \u003ca href=\"/tags/watching-lately\"\u003eWatching lately posts\u003c/a\u003e (and in the weeknotes), and my \u003ca href=\"/lists/2020/movies\"\u003e2020 movies list\u003c/a\u003e, but I wanted it to include other media types too (including games), so I started putting together the lists. For the older years, I have to reconstruct the media list from old blog posts and so on, so they\u0026rsquo;re bound to be incomplete and probably inaccurate, but it is what it is. I started from 2002 and working my way back to the present. It\u0026rsquo;s still WIP, but the list should be \u003ca href=\"/media/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eadding some other new stuff/sections, but nothing linked publicly yet.

            "summary": "First week of May. At least two more weeks of quarantine remain. COVID19 Diary still exists, only updated every so often. I stayed in the entire week!\n The week was slightly more productive than the last one, at least in terms of personal projects. I moved a couple of them forward. And also spent a bunch of time spring cleaning and moving stuff around here on the site. Details to follow.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI was reading this post about \u003ca href=\"https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2020/04/nothing-to-hide/\"\u003ehow to respond to the \u0026ldquo;Nothing to Hide\u0026rdquo; argument\u003c/a\u003e against the concept of privacy. The \u003ca href=\"https://spreadprivacy.com/three-reasons-why-the-nothing-to-hide-argument-is-flawed/\"\u003equoted DuckDuckGo blog post\u003c/a\u003e lists some pretty good reasons, but I thought I\u0026rsquo;d expound on some thoughts as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe core of the \u0026ldquo;Nothing to Hide\u0026rdquo; argument is that if you, personally, have nothing incriminating or illegal to hide, then you don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about privacy intrusions. The argument is used mainly to justify things like state-sponsored surveillance, but might also be applicable to data collection activities by large corporations such as Facebook or Google. \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument\"\u003eWikipedia article\u003c/a\u003e for reference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing to understand is that even if you personally have nothing to hide, there are people who do have legitimate reasons for having to hide something, especially from the government, and that society is better off with them having that ability. The primary example of this would be anyone who helps keep the powerful in check: whistleblowers, activists, journalists, and so on. More minor examples (much lower impact) would be people planning surprise parties, people in abusive relationships, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are of course also negative elements who have a lot to hide (criminal activities), but that is neither here nor there. There is no question that governments should be empowered to surveil the criminal elements, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean they should have blanket power to surveil everybody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe quoted post from jlelse mentions the argument in the context of the contact tracing apps being developed to fight the Covid19 pandemic, and this is a prime example. If the data were handled by a centralized entity such as a government or a private company, then presumably someone with that information could use the location data to do something like identify who has been meeting with a journlist, in order to unmask his sources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I trust the government\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I trust corporation X\u0026rdquo; are not good responses either. Even if these entities were purely benevolent (not likely), the mere existence of such a data store is a possible threat, since there is always the possibility of data leaking or systems being compromised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou may ask why should you personally be concerned? Why should you bother using privacy-protecting tools or avoiding privacy-collecting platforms such as Facebook, etc. Since you personally have nothing to hide, why worry about it? I personally have nothing to hide, and in fact even write a lot about the things going on in my life in this very website, I should have nothing to fear right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a very individualistic mentality. Even if you personally have nothing to hide, there are people in society who have legitimate reasons to hide something, and if we get used to or start accepting the lack of privacy or mass surveillance, then we are moving society in a direction that makes it much harder for those people to operate. The less people that are privacy-conscious, then the more that those who use privacy-protecting tools or software stand out and it becomes easier to track them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though we as individual persons may not have anything to hide, privacy protections are a necessary element for society as whole to function and to keep the powerful in check. Just like public health in a pandemic, privacy is a societal concern, and we all need to do our part even if we aren\u0026rsquo;t the ones most at risk. We need to push back against mass surveillance and normalize or promote the use of privacy-conscious tools and software.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
