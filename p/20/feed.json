Nothing major, just a consult that had been put off due to all of this. Before letting us into the hospital, there were the usual temperature checks, but they also had us fill up a form with name, address and contact details, I assume for contact tracing purposes. We waited for a couple of hours in the doctor\u0026rsquo;s queue (my mom was only there to get a referral, which in itself only took like 5 minutes). The hospital was mostly empty, we didn\u0026rsquo;t see any actual sick patients in most of the waiting areas I think. Seating was limited - they had blocked off the seat rows such that only 2 out of every 4 seats was usable. I was super anxious about touching anything, and probably used hand sanitizer at least 5 times during the visit. Their canteen was open, I only went in to get some water while waiting.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWatched mass via Facebook again today.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGCQ in Metro Manila was supposedly only up to the 15th. It\u0026rsquo;s the 14th, and we still don\u0026rsquo;t know what happens after that. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure the IATF has already announced their recommendations. There are rumors going around that we may get sent back to ECQ. Some authorities are saying limited restaurant dine-in will be available this week. In spite of this, my mom already scheduled some tests at the hospital, a result of the referral consult I mentioned earlier.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAs of last night, we are at 25293 cases (+607 from the day before, +4052 from last week), 1074 deaths (+22 from the day before, +80 from last week), 5706 recoveries (+252 from the day before, +1265 last week). Jumps slightly lower than last week, except for recoveries which are about the same, so that\u0026rsquo;s good news.

(Maybe 1 in 10 weren\u0026rsquo;t wearing their masks correctly though.). I went into the nearby Jollibee to see what it was like. Not as many people inside, and the guard took my temp told me to stand aside before later motioning me to get into a particular queue. The queues are spaced (should have taken pictures), and there\u0026rsquo;s tables in front of the cashiers to keep you from getting too close.

Basically an explosion in confirmed cases; over 50% jump from last week. Large jumps in deaths and recoveries too, thought not as alarmingly large as the cases. Regardless of the DoH\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;tardy\u0026rdquo; / \u0026ldquo;fresh\u0026rdquo; massaging of the data, it looks bad, and the explosion in cases kind of aligns with the last days of the ECQ.

The virus is still around, but both the US and my own country have gotten distracted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe US is in its second week of police brutality/black lives matters protests. Meanwhile, our government took on a sidequest of trying to enact a wide-ranging and easily abusable anti-terror bill, triggering some smaller (by comparison to the US).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven\u0026rsquo;t written about the terror bill, mainly because I haven\u0026rsquo;t had the opportunity to dig into it too deeply. But my general impression leaves me two points:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewhat is the justification for asking for increased police/anti-terrorism powers? We don\u0026rsquo;t actually get that many terror attacks pulled off, the last big one was Marawi (which I heard some Congressmen citing, tbf), which was back in 2017. And that was mostly a problem with Islamic militants. I don\u0026rsquo;t hear any of the bill proponents talking about how specifically the limits on govt powers holds them back. How would these added powers prevent another Marawi? Did they actually have intel leading up to the Marawi siege that they couldn\u0026rsquo;t act on due to limited powers? I find this difficult to believe because\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewhat about the authorities\u0026rsquo; history of impunity? It\u0026rsquo;s hard to believe that they are being restricted by the law in anti-terror activities when they don\u0026rsquo;t seem to let the law get in the way for much lesser things. I guess this is the crux of the issue for most people, one of trust. Even if you say there are safeguards in the law, they are still easily abusable. The bill extends the detention period for terror suspects to I think is it 30 days, extendable? But given the speed (or lack thereof) of local courts, even if you challenge any violation of the safeguards, the challenge may take longer to resolve than the detention period. Maybe we should consider cleaning up our justice system first? People wouldn\u0026rsquo;t object if our systems were trustworthy\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, also China banned mocking their national anthem in HK, or something to that effect. China being China.

Not super funny or anything.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSide projects:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked a bit on \u003ca href=\"https://triviastorm.net/\"\u003etriviastorm\u003c/a\u003e stuff this week. I\u0026rsquo;m preparing new questions and cleaning up the old ones, and also some work on a tighter checking algorithm. There\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of features I want to add to this side project, let\u0026rsquo;s see if I manage to get around to them.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlso spent a couple of hours fantasizing about rewriting the site again, maybe back to a dynamic backend, or some kind of hybrid, mostly to address the issues scaling with so many posts. Lol, will probably not do this yet, but it\u0026rsquo;s in the back of my mind.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo recent links for now.

FB API used to be a lot more open as well, but as they continued to flub their personal data management, their API got more and more closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe open API also means services like \u003ca href=\"http://rssbridge.chamallow.com/\"\u003eRSS Bridge\u003c/a\u003e can exist, allowing Twitter feeds to be followed via open formats like RSS/Atom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"twitter-moderation-is-less-evil-than-facebook-moderation\"\u003eTwitter moderation is less evil than Facebook moderation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of them are actually fairly terrible and inconsistent (surely a consequence of operating at that scale without corresponding scaling up of moderation efforts), but at least Twitter is not afraid to at least fact-check Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"twitter-has-better-public-content\"\u003eTwitter has better public content\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlright, this one might be totally subjective or anecdotal based on my own Twitter follows and setup, but I find that public discourse is generally better on Twitter compared to Facebook. It might be due to some of the factors above, and maybe some level of luck/privilege/good filtering on my part. I mean, you can find bad actors and low-quality discussions if you go looking for them, but why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not saying Twitter is perfect. There is certainly a lot of room for improvement, especially technically. But compared to Facebook, I think Twitter is much less of a garbage fire maybe because (a) I don\u0026rsquo;t feel constrained to follow mainly family and friends; Twitter feels more like it can be a window to part of the larger world; and (b) the existence of Tweetdeck and better filtering tools means I don\u0026rsquo;t have to suffer through ads or other such inanity every few posts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: It seems a bit weird to be publishing this right now when the world seems to be on fire. I follow a lot of Americans so a lot of the racism and police brutality-inspired chaos dominates my Twitter timelines at the moment (as can be seen in the Tweetdeck screenshot above). But I think this is also a good illustration of how useful Twitter\u0026rsquo;s filters and options are. If you chose to, (or needed to temporarily, for your sanity maybe?) you can probably block out these events from your timeline completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is certainly a lot of room for improvement especially from the technical side; \u003ca href=\"https://mastodon.technology\"\u003eMastodon\u003c/a\u003e comes to mind as a superior platform in this regard, but that platform doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the scale of Twitter yet, which limits the interesting interactions that can come up. I find a lot of smart and interesting interactions still happen on Twitter, so it\u0026rsquo;s not yet something I\u0026rsquo;m willing to give up.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Alright so someone responded to my previous post on quitting facebook asking why I\u0026rsquo;m quitting facebook but keeping Twitter. This is a fair question; after all, Twitter also makes its money off targetted advertising, can also get you addicted to engagement (likes/RTs), the Twitter app can also be dumb, and there can also be a lot of toxic people on this platform.\nSo here are my reasons for keeping Twitter, and you may also get some tips for improving your twitter experience:",

The tardy ones are the ones that were delayed by 4 or more days due to validation or some other reason.

Basically, many states are responding to protests against police brutality with\u0026hellip; police brutality. Bold move Cotton. I\u0026rsquo;m not an American, but this resonates with me a lot because to see this kind of thing happening in a country that purports to champion human rights, how much worse can it be in a country like ours or a dictatorship like China where they don\u0026rsquo;t even give lip service to the concept? (Spoiler: we already know police brutality and EJKs are a thing in my country.) I give my support to those protesting, and hope they achieve the reforms their country needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne would question why I (and maybe the world) focuses so much on what happens in the USA, given that violence and brutality happen in a lot of other countries too.
