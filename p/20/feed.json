This reminds me of a convo I had with a friend a couple of years back when he saw one of my blog posts. He was getting into content creation himself via a Youtube channel and he asked me what kind of traffic or how many visitors I see on my blog, and I was like \u0026ldquo;You know what, I have no idea!\u0026rdquo; because I never really got into that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to have Google Analytics on the site back when I first migrated to Hugo, because the initial theme I used supported it and why not right? But I got rid of it when I did the redesign because I didn\u0026rsquo;t really use it and didn\u0026rsquo;t care for the additional JavaScript and tracking and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I do have are server-side stats via AWStats, which I do look at maybe once every couple or years or so. For the purposes of this post I decided to pull the server-side stats into a \u003ca href=\"/page/stats/awstats/\"\u003epage on this site\u003c/a\u003e. So if you check that page, I had 29292 unique visitors for the entirety of 2019. That\u0026rsquo;s around 80 visitors per day. The peak was in 2017, when I had around 135 visitors per day. These are pretty weak numbers I guess? I don\u0026rsquo;t really know, but obviously I haven\u0026rsquo;t gone viral or gotten on the frontpage of HN/reddit or anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0026rsquo;s fine! Traffic isn\u0026rsquo;t why I write, and any visitors above 0 are kind of a bonus, since I write mostly for myself! I feel like optimizing for traffic or SEO or whatever would be a bit like selling your soul. I think the whole point of the original post was a nostalgia for the old-style blogs that were writing for the sake of writing, and not to cater to the whims of the search engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do like engagement though, mostly in the form of comments, which is something I have \u003ca href=\"/page/stats/site/\"\u003ebeen tracking before\u003c/a\u003e. (Other than the comments, you can see that most of the stats that I track are \u003cem\u003emy\u003c/em\u003e stats, i.e. how much I post and so on.) Again, it\u0026rsquo;s not a whole lot, but it\u0026rsquo;s enough to feel a bit rewarding every time a new comment comes in. I recently disabled the comment form for the site (been getting too much spam), but this site can still get new comments via webmention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is nice to know that there are actually people out there reading my words. I do know some friends of mine follow the blog somehow (or maybe they just pick up the posts when I syndicate to Twitter), but it\u0026rsquo;s actually more fun when a stranger leaves a good comment!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"on-self-censorship\"\u003eOn Self-Censorship\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone on HN mentioned:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, this is why I don’t have a blog. I have a lot of strong opinions that might be interesting to some people, but I don’t want to miss opportunities because some HR person googled my name and found a post they disagreed with. Or, in the future, not a real person but an algorithm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess this is a result of the current climate, where people can get \u0026ldquo;cancelled\u0026rdquo; for things they\u0026rsquo;ve said in the past etc. And I guess that\u0026rsquo;s a valid concern, if you want to live your life that way. But really, how strong are your opinions if you can\u0026rsquo;t stand for them in public?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I write something, on this blog or elsewhere on the internet, it\u0026rsquo;s because I believe it to be true, at that time. (Or I may also be shitposting, but it should be obvious when I\u0026rsquo;m shitposting.) I\u0026rsquo;ve written some political stuff on the blog and elsewhere on the internet before, and I often criticize my country\u0026rsquo;s government when the opportunity arises. This might become problematic recently, as Duterte\u0026rsquo;s administration has started harassing critics by filing charges against them and so on. But even if it comes to that, I like to think that I would be willing to stand by what I write.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like to think it\u0026rsquo;s because I tend to be right all the time (LOL), but also if I\u0026rsquo;ve said or done or posted something before that would later turn out to be inaccurate or offensive or whatnot, I have no concerns about walking that back and saying \u0026ldquo;Hey, I made a mistake!\u0026rdquo;. That\u0026rsquo;s another advantage running your own blog has over something like Twitter. On Twitter you can only delete your past mistakes. Here I can preserve them, but add a note saying something like \u0026ldquo;My opinion on this has changed\u0026rdquo; or such. I have not yet had a reason to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(I think it helps that I largely hold non-controversial opinions and generally try to avoid being an asshole to people, but that\u0026rsquo;s probably the topic of another post entirely.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s also the idea that you may want to write things that you don\u0026rsquo;t want associated with you IRL. I can understand that. For those kinds of things, you can make one-off posts using throwaway accounts I guess? For me, from the very beginning of my internet presence, I haven\u0026rsquo;t considered anonymizing or protecting my content. My geocities URL had my full name in it for example (and so does this domain!). But I have made some throwaway posts that aren\u0026rsquo;t tied to me, for example when talking about sensitive information or such. But I think for a large majority of the content a regular person would post, this isn\u0026rsquo;t really necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"on-originality\"\u003eOn Originality\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI often notice when I start writing on a particular topic, I learn more about my thoughts and opinions of it and realize my thoughts are wrong or not really novel. Halfway in I give up since I feel like, \u0026ldquo;oh, this actually isn\u0026rsquo;t really adding anything new to the conversation\u0026rdquo;. Then I leave with a new humbleness about my beliefs but also a sense of \u0026ldquo;when am I actually going to know enough to warrant writing about it?\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in a blogging lull around 2010-2015 (as seen on \u003ca href=\"/page/stats/site/\"\u003ethe stats page\u003c/a\u003e!) and thinking of getting back into it and writing more software-related content, but I mentioned to a friend that I was worried that the internet was already oversaturated with such writers/bloggers and I would not have anything original to contribute. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember his exact words, but it was one of the best pieces of writing advice I had ever gotten, something along the lines of: \u0026ldquo;No one else is going to be writing with your perspective and your point of view, so no matter what, you are bringing something to the table.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"on-discoverability\"\u003eOn Discoverability\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people on the HN thread said that Google no longer surfaces older blog content. I anecdotally know this to be not true, because a Google search for the terms \u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en\u0026amp;q=killer%20killer\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;killer-killer\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en\u0026amp;q=pasmado\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;pasmado\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e still shows posts from my blog from 2008 on the first page. I suspect this is because my blog has been continuously updated since 2002, hence my posts never fall \u0026ldquo;out of rotation\u0026rdquo;? Is that a thing? Who knows! SEO, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe original post was correct however in that it is difficult to find old-school blog content if you are searching specifically for that kind of thing. I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned \u003ca href=\"/2020/04/fe45adb8c24e654605b9906dea2df749/\"\u003ebefore\u003c/a\u003e that I want some kind of indieweb federated search focused on searching content from \u0026ldquo;indie\u0026rdquo; blogs (for lack of a better term. We need a better term?). Maybe someday I\u0026rsquo;d write down how I imagine that would work. And implement it maybe? IDK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil then, there are still a lot of blogs around, if you know where to look. One of my favorite avenues is Kicks Condors\u0026rsquo; \u003ca href=\"https://www.kickscondor.com/hrefhunt/\"\u003emonthly HrefHunt updates\u003c/a\u003e. And I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned before, but whenever anyone posts anything remotely nostalgic about old-school blogging on Hacker News, the comments are always full of links to blogs. There\u0026rsquo;s specialized subreddits like \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SpartanWeb/\"\u003er/SpartanWeb\u003c/a\u003e (not many users!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you run a blog, you can help by having a page where you list other blogs you like! Some kind of roll call, but for blogs. Like\u0026hellip; a \u003ca href=\"/page/blogroll/\"\u003eblogroll\u003c/a\u003e? And if they make a post you like, share it on your blog, and maybe on other social media channels too! Us indie and old-school bloggers need to have each other backs!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"more-to-come\"\u003eMore To Come\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am 99.9999% sure this is not the last time I\u0026rsquo;m going to blog about blogging.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The government messaging has not been very tight about the reopening, they should have made much clearer that despite the loosening of restrictions we should still take precautions and not go out unless absolutely essential. I guess it\u0026rsquo;s an indicator that many people were not staying in because they wanted to avoid spreading the virus, but rather because they had nowhere to go.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI mean, that\u0026rsquo;s true in general of course. But it certainly seems much more true in these \u003ca href=\"/2020/03/covid19/\"\u003epandemic times\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore all of this \u003cem\u003ewaves hands arounds frantically\u003c/em\u003e, people had a general sense of routine and predictability about their daily lives. It varied person by person of course, but many people had regular things like a steady job that kept them occupied for most of the week, a school where their kids could go off to most days, maybe a favorite bar or restaurant they visit every week or so, church on Sundays, friends you saw every other weekend or so, malls or stores they would pass by regularly, and so on and so forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though I had a generally looser schedule than most, I was still often able to plot out my coming days with relative accuracy. Oh, I have a client meeting on this day. Then the next day I have to run these errands. Then meeting up with friends (maybe for a quiz night) the evening after. On the weekend a visit with my brothers and the nieces. That kind of thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I would have had some fairly safe medium-term predictions too. If you had asked me at the \u003ca href=\"/2020/01/new-years-checklist/\"\u003estart of the year\u003c/a\u003e, I would have thought I\u0026rsquo;d have seen the Black Widow movies by now, played Final Fantasy VII Remake, and got together with the family in April to celebrate birthdays. But none of those came to pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNowadays, that kind of reasonable prediction seems like a distant memory. Weeks come and go and all the days seem to blend in together, each one indistinguishable from the last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve thought about writing something about what to expect down the road, or the \u0026ldquo;new normal\u0026rdquo; or what not, but (a) so many people (many of whom I\u0026rsquo;m sure are better qualified) are already writing things like that; and (b) I think a lot of it is largely pointless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have all these models and graphs and projections coming out, with varying degrees of reliability. They tell us things like, there will be M cases and N deaths by so-and-so date unless we do this or that. Each model is slightly different, depending on many factors like the country being studied or the data being analyzed and such. And maybe they\u0026rsquo;re right. Surely at least some of them are, right? But all of these are, to make a software development analogy, estimates. Some are certainly more accurate than others - it falls to our individual discernment whether we choose to believe experts and scientists or populist politicians or whatever - but in the end, all of them are still just estimates. Trend-spotting based on data that is probably largely incomplete (certainly so in the case of my own country). And just like estimates, there\u0026rsquo;s no way to know for certain which will turn out to be correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of all the models and trends and predictions, the future remains incredibly hazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many cases will we end up with? How many deaths? All as of yet unknown, but almost certainly far too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill we have a vaccine this year? Next year? In 2022? No one knows for sure. There are many vaccines and treatments in development, but we won\u0026rsquo;t know for a while which ones will turn out effective, if any. There may never be a permanent vaccine, the same way we don\u0026rsquo;t have one for the common cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill there be a second wave? Seems likely. Will it be under control? Who knows. Even countries we previously thought to be doing well are in danger of a possible resurgence, so what then? How much more countries like us that have done far worse in controlling the spread?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill the ECQ in Metro Manila be lifted after the 15th? Nobody knows, even up to now, a mere 5 days before the deadline. And if it is lifted, what happens then? There are people counting down to the ECQ lifting as if it would be \u0026ldquo;back to normal\u0026rdquo;, I can\u0026rsquo;t say it will be, but it almost certainly shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be. Maybe there will be an explosion of people, tired of being cooped up in their houses, and a corresponding explosion of cases, and we are forced to go back to a stricter lockdown. That\u0026rsquo;s my guess, but again, nothing is certain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen will people be able to go back to work? When will your favorite restaurant be open again? When will you get to meet up with friends again? When can I travel to other countries again? All of these, nobody knows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI joke with my parents and brothers that the next time we\u0026rsquo;ll be seeing each other in person again would probably be in August during my birthday month, but something that far off might not come to pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd people are talking about what the \u0026ldquo;new normal\u0026rdquo; is going to be like. That we might have to live with social distancing precautions in the medium-to-long term moving forward. We may be looking at months or maybe even years of social distancing measures. Or cycles of lockdown and loosening, until there is a widespread vaccine, or maybe forever? All distinct possibilities, but again, there\u0026rsquo;s no certainty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there are people that say humanity is going to learn our lesson from this crisis and realize that so many things we previously accepted in our daily life are BS that we can do without. Short list: overpopulation, inequality, low pay for essential workers, work commutes, dress codes, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies will see that work from home is effective, so it will be more common moving forward! The anecdotal reports of companies implementing draconian surveillance schemes to monitor their remote workers makes me doubt that one actually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t buy that this crisis will change society for the better (though I am more than willing to be surprised). Many humans are too set in their ways and can\u0026rsquo;t even be bothered to endure minor inconveniences like wearing a mask to costco or whatever. And there are many who can\u0026rsquo;t wait to be right back there sucking at the fresh teat of capitalism, instead of maybe looking for alternatives that promote and protect the commons instead of exploiting the vulnerable. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong - there are many positive and hopeful stories coming out of this pandemic, of people helping other people get by - that heighten my faith in humanity. My faith in humanity\u0026rsquo;s leadership and elite, however, is probably at an all-time low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the models and projections and predictions for the new normal, these things are useful at the policymaking levels. But for those of us just living our every day lives, it is difficult to look so far ahead. Right now, we are roiling about in a sea of uncertainty, unsure of what the future brings. All we can worry about will be what the next day looks like. Maybe the best we can do right now is just to take it one step at a time, and hope that we are making the right decisions to build towards a new normal that will actually be better than the last one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis post turned out more ranty than I thought it would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Should be enough to last us for 2 weeksish. The grocery actually seemed less chaotic than usual.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEarly this morning (after the mass) I took a walk outside for the first time since the lockdown started. Previously I had only gone out for groceries and meds. Only for less than 30 mins, and only in our subdivision, walking up and down the street. It\u0026rsquo;s good to be walking again, although this short and limited route is quite boring and full of neighbor\u0026rsquo;s dogs barking at me, so I\u0026rsquo;m not too fond of it, but it\u0026rsquo;s better to get the habit started again since I\u0026rsquo;ve been feeling the fatness piling on due to the quarantine and the lack of exercise.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStill no word on what happens to Metro Manila after the ECQ \u0026ldquo;ends\u0026rdquo; on the 15th. The mayors gave a bunch of options to the IATF that basically amounted to \u0026ldquo;whatever, we can\u0026rsquo;t decide\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethere\u0026rsquo;s this great site showing the progress of different countries in battling the pandemic: \u003ca href=\"https://www.endcoronavirus.org/countries\"\u003eEnd Coronavirus .org\u003c/a\u003e. While some of our leadership are claiming we have already flattened the curve, comparing our data to other countries shows we still clearly need improvement.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe government is already preparing guidelines for when we shift to GCQ like only 150 passengers per MRT train (good luck with that!) and so on. This implies that they are leaning towards shifting from ECQ to the more lenient GCQ already.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe really have no data to indicate that the pandemic is under control in NCR, so lifting the ECQ would probably be dangerous, if not outright foolish. That being said, another question is how much longer people can take being under ECQ at all.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSocial distancing in some barangays in QC \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/PhilstarNews/status/1259388201950568449\"\u003ewent out the window today\u003c/a\u003e, as it\u0026rsquo;s the last day for distributing the social assistance funds to those in need. The QC government has had a lot of trouble distributing aid to their residents, which might be explained away by the sheer size of the city (and the fact that administrative support for a population does not scale linearly). I wonder what the statistics are re: number of government employees vs number of citizens per city in Metro Manila? In any case, large-scale logistics has never been the strong point of the Philippine government, at any level. This kind of chaos really holds us back as a society.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWord has it that there were a lot of cars outside today, presumably people buying food to celebrate Mother\u0026rsquo;s Day? For us, we just held a zoom call with the grandkids as usual.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAs of today, we are at 10793 cases (+184 from yesterday), 719 deaths (+15 from yesterday), 1924 recoveries (+82 from yesterday). We\u0026rsquo;re still gaining more than 1,500 active cases a week, although a lot of those are now in the provinces. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if there\u0026rsquo;s a data source I can use that shows the trends for NCR only? \u003ca href=\"https://covid19ph.com/\"\u003eReference.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorldwide, we are at 4 million cases and 280,000 deaths. A full 1/3rd of all worldwide cases and 2/7ths of all deaths are in the US, which is still raring to reopen for the sake of the economy.

Previously I had only gone out for groceries and meds. Only for less than 30 mins, and only in our subdivision, walking up and down the street. It\u0026rsquo;s good to be walking again, although this short and limited route is quite boring and full of neighbor\u0026rsquo;s dogs barking at me, so I\u0026rsquo;m not too fond of it, but it\u0026rsquo;s better to get the habit started again since I\u0026rsquo;ve been feeling the fatness piling on due to the quarantine and the lack of exercise.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWork\u003c/strong\u003e: A few consultation meetings here and there, but starting next week I may need to do some actual coding work for other people.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatching\u003c/strong\u003e: Watched a \u003ca href=\"/page/lists/2020/movies/\"\u003efew movies this week\u003c/a\u003e, The Siege (caught it on TV during my lunch break), Skull Island (because Brie Larson), Ready Player One (it\u0026rsquo;s Cyclops!), and also watched Ang Huling El Bimbo the Musical (Not really a movie, but ok). I also ended up watching the 2 episodes of the Battlestar Galactica miniseries; apparently I had not watched this before watching the 2004 series. I also watched the hilarious Middleditch and Schwartz improv comedy specials on Netflix, fun times.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGaming\u003c/strong\u003e: Played a bunch of Divinity Original Sin 2 this week, though I guess I\u0026rsquo;m still not that far along in the story? I also purchased the Humble Asmodee bundle, for more boardgames-converted-to-PC-games that my weekend playgroup can do.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSite Updates\u003c/strong\u003e: Been putting up some content elsewhere on this site. You can find it easily if you look around, but nothing to announce publicly yet. Need to think about how to present properly, good permalinks, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecent Links of Interest:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m thinking of starting a separate regular type of post where I just post links to things I found on the internet. Kind of like the links page, except with more commentary? I know people like \u003ca href=\"https://pluralistic.net/\"\u003eDoctorow\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.kottke.org/\"\u003eKottke\u003c/a\u003e, or \u003ca href=\"https://waxy.org/\"\u003eWaxy\u003c/a\u003e have been doing this kind of thing for a while, thinking of something along the same lines I guess? Something I can maybe turn into some kind of newsletter later on? We\u0026rsquo;ll see if it pans out. For now, let\u0026rsquo;s keep it in the weeknotes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSomewhat related to the first bullet: Great post from \u003ca href=\"https://secondbreakfast.co\"\u003esecondbreakfast.co\u003c/a\u003e: \u003ca href=\"https://secondbreakfast.co/its-too-late-to-collect-sand\"\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s too late to collect sand\u003c/a\u003e. Basically saying if there\u0026rsquo;s something you regret not being able to start earlier on, it would be a trap to think that you can\u0026rsquo;t just start it today. I say somewhat related to the first bullet because as I was reviewing some older blog entries during the past few weeks I was wondering if I could have made it as a \u0026ldquo;successful blogger\u0026rdquo; like the people mentioned above if I had only been more consistent with my content. Such regrets are ridiculous, as the post implies, because I could always just ramp up my linkblogging now if I wanted. Anyway, I\u0026rsquo;ve also scanned a few of the other posts on secondbreakfast.co, and many of them are fairly good reads, so this one might end up being added to the regular follows and the \u003ca href=\"/page/blogroll/\"\u003eblogroll\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAirBNB is laying off one-fourth of its staff and refocusing its priorities. This is not exactly unexpected given the current situation and the bleak outlook for the travel industry in the near term, but what I found exceptional was \u003ca href=\"https://news.airbnb.com/a-message-from-co-founder-and-ceo-brian-chesky/\"\u003eCEO Brian Chesky\u0026rsquo;s message to their employees\u003c/a\u003e. Announcing layoffs is obviously a feel-bad, but this note was handled extremely well, walking through the rationales and the painful decision and giving their staff clear expectations on what will happen moving forward.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOne tech company that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been treating their employees too well however, has been Amazon. Last week, a \u003ca href=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/04/29/Leaving-Amazon\"\u003epost\u003c/a\u003e from Amazon VP, Senior Engineer, and XML spec-writer Tim Bray made the rounds as he publicly declared he was resigning from his position (costing him around a million dollars) because of how the company has fired whistleblowers who were complaining about Covid-19 safety concerns at their warehouses. Good for Bray, and boo for Amazon. One may also find the links he posted in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/05/06/Answers\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;Responses\u0026rdquo; post\u003c/a\u003e of interest as well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/magazine/closing-prune-restaurant-covid.html\"\u003eGreat article in the NY times\u003c/a\u003e (Annoying paywall warning!) about what it\u0026rsquo;s like owning and having to shutdown a restaurant in these times.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/\"\u003e68 bits of unsolicited advise\u003c/a\u003e from Kevin Kelly\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been enjoying Tom Scott\u0026rsquo;s Youtube channel recently (unsurprisingly, he\u0026rsquo;s a very popular Youtuber).
