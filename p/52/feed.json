            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eFor any nontrivial software project of at least moderate team size, there can be a significant cost to onboarding a new team member, especially at later stages when you are rushing to meet deadlines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most signifiant cost is of course the communication overhead as described in \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month\"\u003ethe Mythical Man Month\u003c/a\u003e. Fun story, the CEO of a company once told me they would add more developers to a delayed project to meet the deadline and when I pointed out the increased overhead he said to me that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a problem because they would just assign modules to those devs that have minimal dependencies so they don\u0026rsquo;t have to communicate so much. Ha! I just shrugged and let him think it was a good idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my experience, it\u0026rsquo;s never a good idea, especially late in the game. Even if you are somehow able to minimize any domain overhead (which I seriously doubt), there is also the nontrivial matter of technical overhead that any new developer intake needs to go through. I\u0026rsquo;m not just talking about learning the programming language or the technical stack - presumably if you are adding someone to the team, he is either already familiar with the stack or you have factored in his being a newbie and needing training time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I\u0026rsquo;m talking about things like templates, UI standards, coding standards, devops processes, configuration, libraries in use, data dictionaries, and so on. Most projects will have \u0026ldquo;preferred ways of doing things\u0026rdquo;, and the more work that has been done on the project, the more such \u0026ldquo;tribal knowledge\u0026rdquo; is often undocumented and you will need to bother someone to figure the stuff out. And if the project is behind schedule and everyone is trying to catch up, it\u0026rsquo;s more likely people are going to forget to tell you stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlightly related side note: If there is very little in the way of standards or tribal knowledge global to the project, that might be a warning sign. I once worked with a client who had several subcontractors to work on the different modules in their system. Each module/subcontractor worked more or less independently from the others, with very little documentation or standards in place. The result was a weird hodgepodge system where one module did things one way, and the next module did things a completely different way, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an example, I was once asked to help in a project with a relatively large codebase and significant deadline pressure and I was coming in hot with no knowledge of the domain and minimal experience with the framework in use. I told them I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure I could hit the target given I had to learn a bunch of stuff, but they were in desperate need and so ok we proceeded anyway. Now, I\u0026rsquo;m an experienced developer, so pulling me in was a better option than pulling in some newbie since there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of stuff I can figure out myself, but off the top of my head, I had to explicitly bother other people about:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eproper access rights to the repo\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eproper access rights to the google drive with all the documents\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCRLF problems when I use windows to clone the repo\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edatabase credentials for the provided dev VM\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eerrors encountered due to undocumented steps missing from the setup document\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewhere should I put new configuration options\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewhere should I put my new module in the menu\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehow to map data in other tables to my new tables\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe proper HTML markup and CSS classes needed to conform to the way they layouted pages\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehow to implement form validations the same way as other screens\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003estandard methods for displaying messages/errors\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehow to setup role permissions for my new screens\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epreferred library for making third party API calls\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eJS errors encountered when using a particular component\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eproblems with dynamically created reccords not behaving properly when the page redirects on error\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026hellip; and probably a lot more I\u0026rsquo;m unable to recall anymore, and that\u0026rsquo;s not accounting for any comments that would be later logged by QA because I was unfamiliar with how other screens usually behaved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re adding developers to a late project, you have to account for these onboarding costs, in addition to the increased communication overhead. That means sounding the alarm and asking for help earlier. If there\u0026rsquo;s a module that\u0026rsquo;s estimated by your devs to take say, one sprint, you can\u0026rsquo;t ask for help one sprint before the needed delivery - you need to look for help maybe one or two sprints earlier. (Of course, the best approach would be to avoid painting your project into this corner at all, but as we all know in this industry, sometimes things just happen!)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I have chat messages as far back as 2016 musing about buying a Macbook Pro. I haven\u0026rsquo;t had a serious \u003ca href=\"/2008/06/new-laptop/\"\u003epersonal laptop purchase since 2008\u003c/a\u003e. (Side note: Qualifier \u0026ldquo;serious\u0026rdquo; because I do have a low-spec MSI laptop I think I bought for cheap some years ago that I\u0026rsquo;m not really happy with. It\u0026rsquo;s got a dead battery now, I should probably install it with a more lightweight Linux or something and maybe use it as a torrent device or such?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy main motivation for getting a Macbook might seem a bit shallow: I want to be able to publish apps on Apple\u0026rsquo;s app store. Not having a Mac, this particular avenue of software development is closed off to me, so it limits my future freelance work possibilities a bit. Secondary reason being that I am fond of \u003ca href=\"/2006/01/adventures-in-linux-land-part-1/\"\u003eexploring alternative OSes\u003c/a\u003e even though I grew up on Windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, dropping hints to friends and relatives that I would appreciate being gifted with a Macbook Pro didn\u0026rsquo;t work. The main thing holding me back from buying a Mac is that they\u0026rsquo;re really very expensive devices. I eventually decided to bite the bullet myself and I purchased a Macbook Air (2017 model, 256gb SSD) last October. Macbook Air instead of Pro so I could save a little bit of money (it helped to convince myself to buy). Also, I\u0026rsquo;m a bit of a Mac newbie anyway, so maybe it was better to start with a slightly cheaper model before going all hardcode? I wanted to avoid the more recent MBPs anyway due to reported issues with the new keyboard. The MBA2017 had a bit of a better hardware spec than the newer Macbooks available at the time as well, so went ahead with the purchase. (It so happened that about a month later, Apple announced a 2018 line of Macbook Airs, but you know, \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/choose-without-regret-and-the-fear-of-missing-out/\"\u003echoose without regret\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#74dfd6287af42d7b4187a0a1cd8b2573-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/macbook-air-2017-model/macbookair_hu8a9e433e3e166639d0aab6421c6203d6_523722_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Chocnut for scale\" title=\"Chocnut for scale\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eChocnut for scale (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"74dfd6287af42d7b4187a0a1cd8b2573-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/macbook-air-2017-model/macbookair.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eChocnut for scale\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"10 Dec 2018 1:56am\"\u003e10 Dec 2018 1:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI do have a bit of experience using a Mac, since I was on an iOS dev team for a short while back at my old job (where my contribution to the project mainly consisted of proposing ways to clean up the very messy Objective-C code base). Back then I had a Mac Mini assigned to me, and I found myself warming up to Mac OS X easily. I can\u0026rsquo;t fully articulate why, but it seems like a very nice piece of software. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of minor UI things that I appreciate and while Windows 10 already has something close to it, Spotlight still feels special, especially since it\u0026rsquo;s been around longer. And I really appreciate the sleek aluminum build; unlike many Windows laptops it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel shoddily put together. It\u0026rsquo;s also quite a bit lighter than the work-issued laptop I was previously using.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I am generally happy with the purchase, although to be honest I haven\u0026rsquo;t used it too much because I\u0026rsquo;ve been cutting back on my work hours since October (which means less computing time is on the move), but it has come in handy on occasion when I\u0026rsquo;d like to work on things away from my desk. There is a tiny bit of friction when switching between devices with different OSes, mainly that keyboard shortcuts are often completely different - things often don\u0026rsquo;t map cleanly between Windows\u0026rsquo; Ctrl and Alt and Mac\u0026rsquo;s Cmd, Option and Ctrl. That being said, it is decent enough for programming work - VS Code and XCode both run smoothly, and it allowed me to finally update an iOS app I\u0026rsquo;ve supposedly  been maintaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Macbook Air 2017 is a nice, handy little machine, and I hope to be using it for years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI recently found a stash of old DOS games we used to play, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d write about the early days of PC gaming. My PC gaming career (such as it is) started way back in the MS-DOS era. It was an interesting time to be a gamer, to say the least. It was a time when you had to make bootdisks and fiddle around with files like \u003ccode\u003eautoexec.bat\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003ehimem.sys\u003c/code\u003e to make sure your PC booted with the correct configuration required to run your game. I got to become familiar with things like VGA drivers and sound drivers and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think we had our first PC in the household around \u0026lsquo;92 or \u0026lsquo;93, while I was in high school. I have this vague recollection of using some text from the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(video_game)\"\u003efirst \u003cstrong\u003eCivilization\u003c/strong\u003e game\u003c/a\u003e in one of my Social Science reports. Pretty sure Civ 1, as I\u0026rsquo;m still playing the series to this day. I played a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e of the first Civ game, enough to be able to master the highest difficulty level and (with sufficient save scumming), conquer the world with Chariots before Christ is born. The first Civ game was also my first experience at \u0026ldquo;hacking\u0026rdquo; a game so to speak, since many of the configuration options were read from plain text files on the disk. Even the Civilopedia entries came from text files, so I was able to copy them out to use in my report as mentioned above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother mainstay of my early PC gaming years was LucasArts-style adventure games. I think my first exposure to these games was during a high school party back in maybe \u0026lsquo;93 or \u0026lsquo;94. The host had a copy of \u003cstrong\u003eManiac Mansion\u003c/strong\u003e on his PC, and I spent some time playing that before getting stuck at the big door at the top of the stairs because the host had lost the copy protection disk. Within the next year, I had played the sequel game \u003cstrong\u003eDay of the Tentacle\u003c/strong\u003e (to this day I am unsure if I ever finished the first Maniac Mansion though) and the similar Monkey Island games. I must admit that I had a lot more patience then, as these days I haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten far with the current crop of Telltale-led adventure games and the endless trial and error that inevitably arises when you get stuck. (I\u0026rsquo;ve been stuck on Broken Age on PS4 for maybe a year now, I should get that done).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the earlist dungeon crawlers my brother and I played was \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waxworks_(1992_video_game)\"\u003ethe horror game \u003cstrong\u003eWaxworks\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. This was a single player game, but I say \u0026ldquo;my brother and I\u0026rdquo; because we were often too scared to play the game alone. The sharp 90 degree turns meant enemies could jump out of nowhere. I\u0026rsquo;m sure if I played it now I would feel silly, but back then I remember we had tried playing the game at night while the parentals were out, and some baddie jumped out at us in the pyramid level and we went afk at the jump scare and ran out to the nearby sari-sari store. After typing this paragraph, I decided to try running the old copy of Waxworks I still had (you can run old games using \u003ca href=\"https://www.dosbox.com/\"\u003eDOSBox\u003c/a\u003e) and it reminded me that the game had very creepy midi music! Probably contributed a lot to the atmosphere. I don\u0026rsquo;t play horror games anymore nowadays lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#49520fc5ad2d4c8ed479cc83eb6e37e8-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/ancient-pc-gaming/waxworks_hufa0f7d0295fe0441123f40579799f0de_56604_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"Waxworks: The pyramid level was the one we were most familiar with, since it was the first one available.\" title=\"Waxworks: The pyramid level was the one we were most familiar with, since it was the first one available.\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eWaxworks: The pyramid level was the one we were most familiar with, since it was the first one available.

I remember playing RTK2 a little bit, but it was RTK3 that we generally spent a lot of time in (we = me and my brothers and some HS friends). I spent so much time on this game, I could finish the game from a single province in the final scenario (where your opponents were 3 large empires). One of our favorite features in RTK3 was the fact that there was a custom character creator. We had a copy of the game that we passed around with a whole bunch of custom characters named after our HS friends. My brother was a big fan of this feature too, he added a bunch of high-stat custom characters named after himself.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI must admit being a bit unconcerned with online privacy tracking by the large vendoers (Google, Facebook, etc). I mean, I do tend to use \u003ca href=\"/2008/09/i-claim-my-name/\"\u003emy real name as username\u003c/a\u003e after all, so most everything I do online can be traced back to me. I assume that anything I do on the internet can be figured out by other parties, so if something is important enough to me that it should be kept private, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t go on the internet at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the services provided by Facebook and Google, I accept that they require tracking my data in order to provide those services. For example, a few months ago I made a Protonmail account so I\u0026rsquo;d have a secure email that I can use in place of GMail. But it turns out, I haven\u0026rsquo;t found a good use case for it yet. I use Gmail\u0026rsquo;s search a lot, and ProtonMail is nowhere that robust. Maybe if I were a spy or something, I would consider using ProtonMail, but for now I think for everyday usage the GMail features are an acceptable tradeoff for the fact that they are reading your email data and using it for targetted advertising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also tried using the alternative, privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo, but I was not too happy with the search results I was getting, and I occasionally find it useful to be able to check my search history for stuff I remember finding but could no longer find. Having my search results tailored for me turned out kind of useful too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReading some forum discussions, there are a lot of people who are vehemently against being tracked for the purposes of targetted advertising. I can understand the sentiment, but personally I don\u0026rsquo;t mind targetted advertising because (a) it\u0026rsquo;s marginally better than being bombarded with ads for things you don\u0026rsquo;t actually care about; and (b) I am not easily susceptible to impulse purchases, at least not due to internet ads. I grew up with the free internet, so even if I wasn\u0026rsquo;t using adblock, my brain automatically ignores ads on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be honest, I accept that these companies are tracking my data because I would track my own data if I could. I find it useful to have my own history. An example is location history; I have my phone GPS on all the time, so Google Maps is able to keep a history of where I\u0026rsquo;ve gone everyday. I reference this every so often, because I\u0026rsquo;m forgetful. \u0026ldquo;Where did I go last Wednesday?\u0026rdquo; is a trivial question to answer when the cloud has the data. As a software developer, I could build my own systems to track this myself, but why bother? I use the cloud as an extension of my own memory, which is often fallible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have been starting \u003ca href=\"/2018/03/rethinking-facebook/\"\u003eto wean myself off Facebook\u003c/a\u003e, though that proves difficult due to network effects. But it would probably be more difficult for me to cease usage of my Google account, since I use it for a bunch of cloud stuff. Well, I did get it started by making Firefox my main browser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do understand the use case for privacy. If you\u0026rsquo;re handling any sort of sensitive information or anything dangerous, say as an investigative journalist in a fascist regime, then maybe an extra level of protection is required. So I appreciate the existence of secure alternatives. I recently found \u003ca href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/8sffn7/pc_users_guide_to_privacy/\"\u003ea reddit thread\u003c/a\u003e that had a good summary of the modern online privacy options available. If you want or need online privacy, you have to understand that there\u0026rsquo;s a tradeoff in terms of convenience. You can give up Google or Facebook services or use Tor and VPNs and all those other stuff, but you lose some features too. And maybe that\u0026rsquo;s fine, it\u0026rsquo;s up to you to determine that\u0026rsquo;s acceptable for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
