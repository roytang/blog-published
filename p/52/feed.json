I try to make sure I study or learn at least one new programming language or framework every year (though I am willing to stretch that definition as needed).

With my recent \u003ca href=\"/2019/01/revisiting-c---after-a-decade/\"\u003erevisit of C++\u003c/a\u003e, I\u0026rsquo;m a bit interested in checking out a new statically-typed compiled language. Rust and Golang or the primary candidates here, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably toy around with both to see which one I like better. The problem here is that I typically do web-based programs, so finding a project where it would be worth using one of these might be challenging.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSwift\u003c/strong\u003e. Since I recently bought a \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/macbook-air-2017-model/\"\u003eMacbook Air\u003c/a\u003e, that opens up the possibility of trying out Swift. I was involved in a mobile project when Swift came out and found it interesting when I was first going through the documentation - maybe because I thought Objective-C was a hot mess (or at least our codebase was back then). I never did get a chance to try it out, so maybe I will this year - if I find an appropriate mobile app to work on.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKotlin\u003c/strong\u003e is to Java and the JVM as Swift is to Objective-C and iOS. It\u0026rsquo;s young, but as a JVM language it has direct interoperability with Java programs, and it\u0026rsquo;s supposedly a first-class language nowadays for Android development. If I do decide to work on a native mobile app, Kotlin is a prime choice for the Android version. (Assuming I\u0026rsquo;m willing to dive back into the JVM ecosystem\u0026hellip;)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCSS Grid\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;ll be the first to admin I\u0026rsquo;m a bit behind on frontend practices; my default layout framework is still \u003ca href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\"\u003eTwitter\u0026rsquo;s Bootstrap\u003c/a\u003e. If I get the chance, I\u0026rsquo;ll do some of my personal web projects using CSS grid.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVue.js\u003c/strong\u003e. Speaking of frontends, I never got too deep into the current crop of frontend frameworks. Funny story, we were meeting with a database vendor to discuss solution options for a client and I mentioned I had already built a small prototype web application using their product. They asked me what framework I was using on the frontend and when I told them I wasn\u0026rsquo;t using any, I was told that was \u0026ldquo;hardcore\u0026rdquo;. While I do think it\u0026rsquo;s helpful for full-stack web developers to be familiar with vanilla JS, I am interested in trying out at least one of the three prevalent frontend frameworks - Vue, React, and Angular. I have kind of tried React a bit with React Native, but at this moment, I\u0026rsquo;m leaning more towards Vue.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMachine Learning\u003c/strong\u003e. Specifically, I want to try out some text generation using recurrent neural networks, like those posts where people generate screenplays etc. I\u0026rsquo;m not too conversant with the theory, but reading some examples and tutorials I think this is something doable. Just need a reasonable corpus of texts to work with\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTDD\u003c/strong\u003e. Yup, test-driven development. I\u0026rsquo;m way behind the curve on this one. I understand the theory and the benefits, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never been in the position to have TDD in my projects. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult sometimes to get management buy-in. At my past job, all of the testing was still manual. I\u0026rsquo;ve dabbled in TDD a bit, tried out some frameworks, but never full-scale in one of my projects. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll try to write some tests for one of my side projects this year.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s it. I think it\u0026rsquo;s quite a lot actually. I\u0026rsquo;ll review this post towards the end of the year to see which of these I end up doing.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAlthough I still primarily identify as a \u0026ldquo;Full Stack Developer\u0026rdquo;, during the past few years I\u0026rsquo;ve also found myself in a role called \u0026ldquo;Solution Architect\u0026rdquo;. The thing about being a solution architect is that there isn\u0026rsquo;t really a clear definition of the role, what it involves, or the scope of responsibility. I suppose it depends largely on the organization and the project. The role mostly involves making techical decisions on a larger scale, like project-wide or organization-wide, rather than on the micro day-to-day technical decisions involved in a typical software development involves. These decisions can encompass not just coding, but also requirements gathering, application design, database design, modelling, testing methodology, processes, deployment, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is actually pretty much what I was doing during my last full-time job anyway. I was basically involved in technical decision-making at all levels. So there\u0026rsquo;s not much change, except that now there\u0026rsquo;s a formal name/title to the role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite that role, in my past job I still insisted on taking on some of the coding work myself, typically the more difficult ones. I think it\u0026rsquo;s important as a technical person to maintain some familiarity with the low-level coding details, even when you\u0026rsquo;re transitioning to higher-level work like management or architectural work. (Also, I still enjoy the vagaries of day-to-day coding.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a solution architect in particular, it helps to be familiar with a wide array of technologies, since it informs your technical recommendations. You won\u0026rsquo;t always get such exposure through official projects either, so it helps to be interested in these things on your own so you can read up or try them out in your spare time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, the term \u0026ldquo;solution architect\u0026rdquo; has been increasing in usage over the past few years, if Google Trends is any indication:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#8538e8aa0341cd3eb7a1630f595cac40-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2019/01/solution-architect/solution-architect_hua2140a621f54624710810700693deb41_39199_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"8538e8aa0341cd3eb7a1630f595cac40-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2019/01/solution-architect/solution-architect.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"7 Jan 2019 5:56am\"\u003e7 Jan 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e(I originally tried Google Trend\u0026rsquo;s embed option, but the embedded chart kept crashing my browser tab, so now you get a screen capture instead)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;d asked me five years ago I would have said such a role was within the scope of a senior engineer or technical lead.

            "summary": "Although I still primarily identify as a \u0026ldquo;Full Stack Developer\u0026rdquo;, during the past few years I\u0026rsquo;ve also found myself in a role called \u0026ldquo;Solution Architect\u0026rdquo;. The thing about being a solution architect is that there isn\u0026rsquo;t really a clear definition of the role, what it involves, or the scope of responsibility. I suppose it depends largely on the organization and the project. The role mostly involves making techical decisions on a larger scale, like project-wide or organization-wide, rather than on the micro day-to-day technical decisions involved in a typical software development involves.",

I think many of their services might be limited to US people though, especially the ones related to smart appliances and such. I wish there were some more advanced output capabilities though. Like, I went to publish a custom API endpoint to accept output from IFTTT, so I can route inputs from different services to my own systems for tracking/archiving/analysis. But maybe that\u0026rsquo;s too much to ask for a general-purpose service. Still, the fact that IFTTT exists is super helpful because otherwise I might consider writing my own APIs for the above functionality. Nowadays when I want to do some sort of service glue I first ask myself \u0026ldquo;Can I do this using IFTTT?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThis year I had the dubious privilege of having to work with a C++ project again. Although my college education was in C, that was a completely different animal. I did self-study C++ for a bit back even before I was working, mostly because I was interested in game development even back then. I remember trying some OpenGL and/or DirectX stuff back with good old Borland Turbo-C++ during the DOS days and using the \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html\"\u003eDev-C++ IDE\u003c/a\u003e when I shifted to Windows. Professionally, I think there was at least one project where I had to work on a Windows-based application using C++ on Visual Studio 6 (before all this .NET nonsense), but for the life of me I can\u0026rsquo;t even remember which project it was anymore. I do remember struggling more with the compiler and the IDE and the layouting of Windows components more than the language itself. And even then, I mostly used the language as an extension of C and not really taking advantage of the more advanced features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough I knew about the language features in theory, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have much experience back then with using features like templates, generic types, or the STL. That was remedied this year when we had a project that required us to adapt an existing open source C++ project and modify it for our needs. This was a full blown project, somewhere in the neighborhood of 175 kloc, and it involved complex stuff like cryptography, encryption, signing, networking, and so on. I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know about the Boost library back then. A huge challenge for me at that time, given my little to no C++ experience. Luckily it was a service process that we planned to compile and deploy on Linux, so at least we didn\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about Windows and UI shenanigans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of our senior developers (who was not available full-time for the project) \u003cem\u003edid\u003c/em\u003e have C++ experience though, and he used to train new hires in C++ at his old company. So he dug out some of his old training slides and gave us a C++ refresher/crash course in the span of an afternoon. A bit too much info crammed into too little time, but still informative. Especially for me, since it\u0026rsquo;s been so long since I touched the language, the slides reminded me of a few things I had already forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n    On \n    \u003ca href=\"/2018/08/1035019095287189504/\"\u003e\u003ctime datetime=\"2018-08-30 04:19:16\"\u003e30 Aug 2018 4:19am\u003c/time\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n    I wrote:\n    \u003cblockquote\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003epython expert: my code ran correctly on my first try! lucky!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ec++ expert: my code compiled on my first try! lucky!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome notes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehaving worked almost exclusively with dynamic languages the past few years, I haven\u0026rsquo;t had the chance of use the \u003ca href=\"https://xkcd.com/303/\"\u003eold XKCD \u0026ldquo;compiling\u0026rdquo; excuse\u003c/a\u003e in a while. When we first tried compiling the project, we were seeing build times in the 10-15 minutes range, which was worrying for our coding cycles. And since we were \u0026ldquo;relearning\u0026rdquo; C++, as it were, we were bound to have more iterations than normal. Luckily we found that the build process tended to be a bit faster on succeeding builds, I guess it does some kind of incremental build? Later on, compiling would take around 2-3 minutes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emakefiles are something I\u0026rsquo;ve never had to deal with before (that sort of thing used to be handled by an IDE during my last go-around with C++). But I had to figure them out early on in this project, otherwise we couldn\u0026rsquo;t add our own new files to the codebase!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI still don\u0026rsquo;t fully understand linking, but we eventually figured out where to correctly place our files so that we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have any referential errors during linking. (Figuring this out also sped up the build process a bit.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAs I mentioned, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have much experience with C++ features like templates and generic types, so one of the challenges we faced early on was making heads or tails of the usage of this third party library called \u003ca href=\"https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20027/JSON-Spirit-A-C-JSON-Parser-Generator-Implemented\"\u003eJSON Spirit\u003c/a\u003e, which was used for representing JSON objects. The library uses a lot of generics and templates and typedefs, so it took a bunch of code tracing and a bit of trial and error for us to get the hang of it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eone thing we discovered early on was that the use of deeply-nested templates and generic types led to a lot of quite obtuse error messages, a bit of a challenge for us who didn\u0026rsquo;t have much C++ experience. This problem is succinctly described in the following tweet:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn C++ we don\u0026#39;t say \u0026quot;Missing asterisk\u0026quot; we say \u0026quot;error C2664: \u0026#39;void std::vector\u0026lt;block,std::allocator\u0026lt;_Ty\u0026gt;\u0026gt;::push_back(const block \u0026amp;)\u0026#39;: cannot convert argument 1 from \u0026#39;std::_Vector_iterator\u0026lt;std::_Vector_val\u0026lt;std::_Simple_types\u0026lt;block\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026#39; to \u0026#39;block \u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026#39;\u0026quot; and i think that\u0026#39;s beautiful\u003c/p\u003e\u0026mdash; mcc (@mcclure111) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/1002648636516282368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eJune 1, 2018\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e \u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo there were a lot of challenges along the way, but this is fairly typical for developers coming into a project with an existing large codebase. And on the upside (my usual upside), I learned a lot, and I felt like a C++ genius a few weeks in. When you climb a learning curve quickly, it can make you feel amazing:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#01b435b3e3de1769b5c6064c7173280b-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2019/01/revisiting-c-after-a-decade/hohohoidiit_hu10548764201c54e6af8f32553bbadfc8_4362_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"01b435b3e3de1769b5c6064c7173280b-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2019/01/revisiting-c-after-a-decade/hohohoidiit.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"5 Jan 2019 5:58am\"\u003e5 Jan 2019 5:58am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end I think we did pull it off and were able to implement and integrate the needed changes well, without any major issues. Given C\u0026rsquo;s challenges with memory management and so on, I was kind of expecting we would encounter things like crashes, memory leaks, and such, but it turns out using the STL and Boost largely alleviates that problem. The project is still ongoing and has a bunch of requirements-related issues, but I think the C++ side turned out relatively well. Unfortunately, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ll have much use for C++ knowledge outside of this project, the language isn\u0026rsquo;t really appropriate for the sort of personal projects I like to take on.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "This year I had the dubious privilege of having to work with a C++ project again. Although my college education was in C, that was a completely different animal. I did self-study C++ for a bit back even before I was working, mostly because I was interested in game development even back then. I remember trying some OpenGL and/or DirectX stuff back with good old Borland Turbo-C++ during the DOS days and using the Dev-C++ IDE when I shifted to Windows.",

This advice means that for a recurring activity, once you get a streak or chain going, as much as possible you should avoid breaking the chain. So if your NYR is to exercise daily, you should try to avoid breaking that chain for as long as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt helps if you\u0026rsquo;re tracking how long your current streak is, either via a calendar or an app, or some other method. The longer the streak gets, the more incentivized you are not to drop the ball by breaking the chain. I mentioned this in \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/duolingo/\"\u003emy Duolingo post\u003c/a\u003e - I feel quite bad when I break a months-long streak in Duolingo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, at some point you\u0026rsquo;re going to fail, and the streak will break. We\u0026rsquo;re only human after all, and \u003ca href=\"/2018/10/you-dont-have-to-be-on-all-the-time/\"\u003ewe don\u0026rsquo;t have to be on all the time\u003c/a\u003e. Failures happen, and that\u0026rsquo;s okay. If the activity is important to you, it should be a simple matter to simply try again and start the chain over. This is of course, a point of weakness: at the time you break the chain, this is when you are most vulnerable to quitting. That\u0026rsquo;s why you have to minimize breaking the chain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot all NYRs or recurring activities have to go on forever though. Sometimes you just want to do 30-day challenges. Or maybe you want to try this activity for a while to see if it works out for you. No need to push yourself to continue with a chain that you find isn\u0026rsquo;t worthwhile.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
