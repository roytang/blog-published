I\u0026rsquo;ve commented quite a few times on Reddit threads regarding this over the years, here\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fxbd5/im_sick_of_this_entire_dlc_scam_cutting_content/c1jdipw/\"\u003emy favorite one\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if they didn\u0026rsquo;t bundle DLC separately and just straight-up sold the game for a higher price (and with a slightly later release date), would you prefer it? Or if the game was released with the same price but no additional DLC at all? Or the game is released with no DLC but six months later a new full version of the game is released with slightly more content that could have been released as DLC but instead you now have to buy a full game again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonally, I find that DLC is a good idea as it allows customers to pick and choose which content they want. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to bitch about it, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to buy the DLC if I don\u0026rsquo;t want to. In fact for longer games like RPGs I just wait for the GOTY to come out later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, the phrase \u0026ldquo;cutting content out of the game\u0026rdquo; shows misunderstanding of how software development in general works. Like all other software development gigs, game development is largely constrained by schedules and real-world budget and resource constraints. And most of the time they\u0026rsquo;re going to fall short of those schedules and have to decide what features to cut so they can make it on time. Having the option of releasing them as DLC creates less pressure on the team and creates an opportunity for content that would otherwise have been cut or saved for a larger expansion disc to be made available. And please don\u0026rsquo;t take at face value the rantings that because 90% of a DLC\u0026rsquo;s content is already on the disc that it should have been included at release - you haven\u0026rsquo;t considered the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-ninety_rule\"\u003eother 90%\u003c/a\u003e yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the other complaints is that with DLC being available on launch or shortly thereafter, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like one is getting the \u0026ldquo;complete\u0026rdquo; experience for a game purchased at full price. I finished the \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/game-review-marvels-spider-man-for-ps4/\"\u003ePS4 Spider-Man game recently\u003c/a\u003e and got the platinum even, and I\u0026rsquo;m super happy with the game, got what pretty much felt like a complete experience. At the time I played the game there were already two DLC packs available, one featuring the Black Cat and another featuring Tombstone. When I finished the game, I thought about buying the DLCs since I enjoyed the game so much, but in the end I decided to hold off since neither of those felt like they were necessary. Worrying that you\u0026rsquo;re missing out on the \u0026ldquo;complete experience\u0026rdquo; is just another form of \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/choose-without-regret-and-the-fear-of-missing-out/\"\u003eFOMO\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also absolutely respect the gaming companies\u0026rsquo; right to determine their own business model and what price points and what DLCs they choose to offer. People complain about low-value DLC like additional weapons or map packs for $10 or such. The decision to release such DLC is a business decision, and like all business decisions, they can really only be influenced with your wallet. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to pay for poor value DLC! Companies can try to nickel and dime you for content, that\u0026rsquo;s their choice. It\u0026rsquo;s your choice to walk away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a side note, in my opinion the worst DLC offenders are multiplayer games (usually from companies like EA or Ubisoft). Maybe my opinion is helped by the fact that I\u0026rsquo;m largely a single-player gamer. There is very little problematic DLC with games like The Witcher 3 (I haven\u0026rsquo;t played either of the expansions!) or Persona 5 for example. Also, even before DLCs were a thing, I had already been playing \u003ca href=\"/categories/magic-the-gathering/\"\u003eMagic the Gathering\u003c/a\u003e. Hohoho TCGs are like the epitome of DLCs, you literally have to pay money just to complete a deck! (Luckily modern online CCGs often provide viable F2P options).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kind of like the DLC model for games where companies constantly release DLC for a game even years after their release, it increases the gameplay lifetime. As long as you can enjoy the game without the DLC of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome specific games with DLC that I \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e purchased:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStreet Fighter V. Fighting games these days have a lot of DLC, usually either cosmetics (costumes) or new characters. For the PS4 version, I only used in-game cash to get new characters, but I also got the Steam version and just got a couple of Season passes there. I usually don\u0026rsquo;t bother with cosmetics, but I did get one costume DLC for SFV, and that\u0026rsquo;s because I thought it was absolutely criminal \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/roytang/status/1018029055994617856\"\u003enot to have Cody\u0026rsquo;s prison garb\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStellaris DLC has been pretty good too. I recently bought my first DLC for Stellaris, and I find the additional content acceptable. Paradox is great at long term support for their strategy games. I look forward to occasionally buying a DLC pack once a year or so and playing the game for a month before abandoning it again lol.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCivilization. For Civ5 and Civ6, I usually bought any DLCs that introduced additional civs, as I like the variance in my games. This seems of questionable value since I\u0026rsquo;ll typically play each new Civ only once or twice, but the DLC packs are usually cheap enough for me not to worry about it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn summary: I think DLC in general is a good if not positive trend for gaming, since it gives the consumer additional choices. It also keeps game prices comparatively low while facilitating additional income sources for the developers.

Recently though I\u0026rsquo;ve started following more sources and blogs that are focused on more\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;cultural\u0026rdquo; affairs. When I started doing \u003ca href=\"/2016/03/sketching-daily/\"\u003e#sketchdaily\u003c/a\u003e a couple of years ago, I started following more artists. During the past few months, as a sort of counterbalance to the prevalently negative current events and tech industry news, I\u0026rsquo;ve also begun following a few more people who are focused more on things like philosophy, history, poetry, literature, creativity, and so on. A lot of it goes over my head - I don\u0026rsquo;t really have any formal background in the humanities - but many times I come upon posts I appreciate and that help expand my horizons and point me down new avenues of thinking. And I can still enjoy good art and good poetry and good prose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have also purposely cut back a bit on the more political follows, especially on Twitter. Following current events feels a lot like being a spectator at a car crash; everything is terrible, but you can\u0026rsquo;t help but be fascinated by what\u0026rsquo;s going on. Even much of the tech industry news tends to be negative - Facebook has done something horrible; there\u0026rsquo;s a new data breach; people are spending too much time on their computers; big tech is helping fascist countries do censorship; and so on. It\u0026rsquo;s too easy to lose yourself in current events and be angry all the time about the state of the world or the country or our leadership. I\u0026rsquo;m not planning to disconnect completely from the news, like some people do, and I\u0026rsquo;m still always open to discussion about any topic (though I have decided to be more restrained in my urge to debate people and respond to every possible outrage).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still believe that good citizens have a responsibility to stay abreast of what\u0026rsquo;s going on in the world and to be informed so that we can make good decisions. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it has to be outrage 24/7. We\u0026rsquo;re not going to run out of bad news any time soon. We have to find the space as well for appreciating what\u0026rsquo;s good in life and for broadening our horizons.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

You are not obligated to do something just because you are the \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; at that something.

Humility disclaimer: I\u0026rsquo;m not claiming to be the best software developer by any stretch, it was probably more of a big fish in a small pond scenario. But the quote above is a reminder for me that pursuing excellence has a price often unmentioned, and you have to be sure you are willing to pay that price, and that it\u0026rsquo;s worth it for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Many times she would be putting in extra hours for days at a time and I would say to her \u0026ldquo;Put that off until tomorrow, it\u0026rsquo;s time to go home.\u0026rdquo; and she would reply along the lines of \u0026ldquo;But I still have so much work to do.\u0026rdquo; and my usual rejoinder would be \u0026ldquo;Are you expecting to finish all of that work tonight?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe modern working world is full of problems, issues, tasks and other work that needs to be resolved, and it can be overwhelming at times. It can seem like the list of to-dos is endless. Software development in particular can seem like never-ending crises and issues and tickets to be resolved, especially for larger teams and larger projects. But that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t mean we sacrifice all our time in pursuit of emptying that to-do list. We put in our hours and pare down that list the best we can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne learns this quickly when faced with any nontrivial project with an issue tracker. Often the list will seem to keep growing with no signs of slowing down. You might have a tendency to say \u0026ldquo;but we can\u0026rsquo;t release software with this many issues!\u0026rdquo; But deadlines are real, and you learn that you have to triage and make trade-offs with the time you have available. Real-world software is released with issues still pending, simply because there isn\u0026rsquo;t enough time to do everything. So you prioritize and choose the most important things, the most critical bugs, and fix what you can in the available time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne has to apply this to one\u0026rsquo;s personal workload as well. No matter how many things you have to do, you don\u0026rsquo;t have infinite time. You have to figure out what\u0026rsquo;s important for you and that\u0026rsquo;s where you focus your time and effort. Pushing yourself beyond what your time and health allow will do no good. That way lies madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven for personal goals this is an issue for me. I want to do a lot of things. There are so many things I want to read, write, create, draw, learn, watch, and try out. I want to do everything. There are so many things I want to have mastery over. Mastery implies regularly spending hours on practice and effort. But there are only so many hours in the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Maybe mild, unmarked spoilers somewhere in this review, be warned!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOverall: the game was amazing and spectacular and fun, especially for a big comic book fan like me, well worth the buy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMechanics: Combat felt a bit weird to me at first, mainly because I was expecting it to be closer to Arkham-style combat, and I kept trying to use Spider-Man\u0026rsquo;s Circle Dodge the same way I use Batman\u0026rsquo;s Triangle counter, and that got me clocked by the first boss of the game (Kingpin) a few times. Spider-man\u0026rsquo;s Dodge doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow you to cancel out of existing animations like Batman\u0026rsquo;s counter, so I really needed to unlearn that instinct. Once you get a hang of it, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty good, but feels a lot more chaotic than Arkham style combat. Arkham combat felt a lot more rhythmic where you just tap commands out and point at the baddie you want to hit. Here it feels like you have to be jumping all the time and swinging across the air and moving the camera around to look for objects to throw at enemies.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMechanics: Web-swinging around Manhattan also felt weird at first. Sometimes the command to web swing would be unresponsive, which I would later realize would be because I was at a height that was too high to find surfaces to swing from. Once you get the hang of it, it feels very smooth and fun and you\u0026rsquo;re zipping around Manhattan like a boss.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStory: Peter Parker in this universe is reminiscent of old-school Peter Parker who\u0026rsquo;s always late to things and always behind on his rent. The early parts have him getting evicted from his apartment (classic Parker!) and looking for a place to crash. (Although after that point, it\u0026rsquo;s never mentioned where he\u0026rsquo;s sleeping, if he is at all.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStory: Spider-man here is however, a well-known public figure, a veteran of super-heroing who even gets some assistance from law enforcement primarily in the form of Captain Yuri Watanabe. He\u0026rsquo;s been webslinging around long enough to build a stable of villains who are constantly referenced about being held in the Raft.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMechanics: There\u0026rsquo;s actually a lot to do around the city. Not really collectibles, but more like different kinds of challenges and missions. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of crimes to stop that you\u0026rsquo;ll hear on police bands as you\u0026rsquo;re web-swinging around. More difficult crimes and missions unlock as the story progresses, and they all come with optional objectives (such as perform X type of special move, etc) that give you bonus rewards. There\u0026rsquo;s also stealth missions reminiscent of Arkham\u0026rsquo;s predator modes, pigeon chasing, research missions that have you doing all sorts of weird tasks, and so on. Missions typically reward you with some form of tokens, which are used to unlock suits, gadgets and upgrades. This Spider-Man has a lot of gadgets, making him closer to a Batman figure in this universe.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStory: In this universe, J. Jonah Jameson is retired from his days at the Daily Bugle and instead hosts an internet radio show where as can be expected, he\u0026rsquo;s always castigating Spider-Man. His broadcasts come in as you\u0026rsquo;re swinging around the city, and Jonah will often comment on things you\u0026rsquo;ve recently done or missions recently accomplished. I especially like it when one of the missions had you doing something ridiculous like intentionally swinging through smog and Jonah makes wild speculations about what the hell you were smoking.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMechanics: The suit selection in the game is fairly good, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of suits available and you unlock more as you level up (you need to purchase them with tokens). You can change costumes at any time, and most cutscenes will show Spider-Man wearing whatever suit you have on at the time, which can be sometimes hilarious. I\u0026rsquo;m severaly disappointed at the lack of the \u003ca href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/spiderman/images/6/69/F0ab528486904cef1297397514b73ef9.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120721011355\"\u003eFantastic Four Amazing Bag-Man costume\u003c/a\u003e though. My favorite costume from this game is the classic comic book costume (screenshots below), I really like how well it\u0026rsquo;s animated so smoothly and gives such a cartoony vibe. I would totally play an entire game rendered in this fashion. It\u0026rsquo;s also hilarious when this costume is used in cutscenes!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/KcHOHTc.png\" alt=\"My favorite costume!\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/4KOBWj0.jpg\" alt=\"Why won\u0026rsquo;t you take me seriously MJ?!?\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://imgur.com/XyiqRIW.jpg\" alt=\"Those guns won\u0026rsquo;t work on me, I\u0026rsquo;m a cartoon!\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMystery: I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why, but the distance scaling in this game is super-off. In-game measurements tell me Manhattan island is about 4 km from top to bottom, which feels really small. The \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan\"\u003eWikipedia entry\u003c/a\u003e says Manhattan is almost 60 sq km, but in-game it can\u0026rsquo;t be more than 10 sq km. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why it would be like this.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStory/Mechanics: You don\u0026rsquo;t get to play as Peter Parker/Spider-Man all the time, there\u0026rsquo;s also a few missions you have to play out as one of two side characters. One of them is the lovable spunky red-headed Mary Jane Watson, who in this universe is not a supermodel actress, but rather has a more Lois-Lane like role as an investigative reported for the Daily Bugle. That means she gets herself into all sorts of troublesome situations where she has to sneak around enemies in order to escape. She\u0026rsquo;s no damsel in distress here, I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure if Peter ever rescues her directly. I like this MJ iteration, she has a lot more spunk. The other side character you get to play at is young Miles Morales, who enter\u0026rsquo;s Peter\u0026rsquo;s life somewhere in the 2nd act of the story. Miles parts consist of sneaking around as well, although he has a different toolset than MJ, mainly consisting of a hacking app that lets him create distractions to bypass guards.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStory: One of the best things in this game\u0026rsquo;s story is the mentorship relationship between Peter Parker and Otto Octavius, although if you know comics, you have a pretty good idea of where this is headed. Unlike the \u003ca href=\"/2004/07/movies-spiderman-2/\"\u003e2nd Tobey movie\u003c/a\u003e, the game gives their relationship sufficient time to develop before you start to see signs of trouble. The fall itself is well-executed and heavily foreshadowed and Peter has only himself to blame when he finds out he helped turn his mentor into an insane mechanical octopus.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStory: The overall story had some twists and some surprises in the ending itself. At the heart of all the problems facing Spider-Man this time around is the incumbent Mayor Norman Osborn, but who never actually turns into a green villain himself. The game\u0026rsquo;s ending heavily hints at a 2nd outing, so they\u0026rsquo;re probably saving Norman for later. Wise decision as well, Spider-Man has a deep bench of villains to pull from, and many of the classic ones haven\u0026rsquo;t been hinted at yet in this game. Aside from the Goblin, the 2nd game could very well introduce us to the Lizard, Sandman, Mysterio, and maybe even Venom among others!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAfter getting the platinum, I was tempted to purchase the \u0026ldquo;City That Never Sleeps\u0026rdquo; DLCs as well for additional content, but I decided to hold off for now. My experience already feels \u0026ldquo;complete\u0026rdquo; and just right anyway, and adding more missions might be too repetitive. Maybe if it goes on sale sometime.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStan Lee (RIP) also had a small cameo in this game. For me it\u0026rsquo;s bittersweet that I got the platinum a couple of days after his death; I consider the game to be a fitting tribute to his life\u0026rsquo;s work.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs is tradition, here\u0026rsquo;s a screendump, awash with in-game spoilers! (Mainly because I chose to include the automatic screenshots that came with each Trophy unlock). You can see during the later parts I was using the comic costume almost exclusively!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/GXG9Qb5\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"//imgur.com/GXG9Qb5\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cscript async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e",

I ran into this one called \u003ca href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/sparketypes/\"\u003eSparketypes\u003c/a\u003e recently. Here\u0026rsquo;s my result:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour Primary Sparketype reveals the essential nature or \u0026ldquo;driver\u0026rdquo; of the work you\u0026rsquo;re here to do (whether it\u0026rsquo;s the work you get paid to do, or not). When you do the work of your Primary Sparketype, you come alive with purpose and, fully-expressed in a healthy way, deepen into meaning, flow, connection and joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a Maven, fascination is your call. You latch onto a topic, field or industry and devour everything you can know about it. Staying \u0026ldquo;surface level\u0026rdquo; just isn\u0026rsquo;t an option for you. It\u0026rsquo;s no fun. You are driven to learn, to discover, to ferret out information, wisdom, knowledge for no other purpose than the joy of learning and knowing something as fully and deeply as you can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour Maven\u0026rsquo;s fascination and yearning to learn might be expressed more generally, as a perpetual curiosity about everything and everyone. Or, it may be more focused on highly-specific topics or fields of interest that evolve over time, often because your ceaseless yearning to learn has largely exhausted what the topic has to offer. So, you find the next area of fascination to move on to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Maven\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s not necessarily about what you \u0026ldquo;do\u0026rdquo; with your rapidly-accumulating reservoir of wisdom. What you learn may be useful to the others, or not. When it is, you enjoy sharing it. It is a beautiful potential \u0026ldquo;by-product\u0026rdquo; that also is essential if you want to turn your Maven-ness into your living. But, when you\u0026rsquo;re really being honest, it\u0026rsquo;s not the essential reason you do it. The fact that is has value to others is more a measuring stick of the depth of your knowledge and ability to fully-express what you\u0026rsquo;ve learned than a true expression of your reason for being. Either way, the deeper driver is the quest to learn, to satisfy your perpetual, insatiable fascination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, there\u0026rsquo;s two results! I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I understand what the difference is. Here\u0026rsquo;s the second one:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember, your Primary Sparketype (above) represents the essential nature of the work you\u0026rsquo;re here to do. Your core driver of purpose, passion, expression and flow in work and life. Your Shadow Sparketype, on the other hand, is also a big part of you. Some may feel its call nearly as strongly. Your Shadow Sparketype most often reveals the work that you may well enjoy and have developed a high level of skill around, BUT it is also largely taken up in service of doing the work of your Primary Sparketype better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour Shadow Sparketype is The Scientist, which means you are driven by, and find a deep sense of satisfaction in the pursuit of an answer to a burning question, or the solution to a significant problem. But, for you, when you\u0026rsquo;re really being honest, that drive is almost always in service of doing the work of your Primary Sparketype at the higher possible level. It\u0026rsquo;s more a means than an end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMany times quizzes like these are eerily accurate - which shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a surprise since you\u0026rsquo;re the one providing the input, so the results will tend to reinforce what your own views are about yourself. I\u0026rsquo;m especially fond of the assessment of the Maven\u0026rsquo;s tendency to latch onto anything that fascinates him, since that happened to me just recently with \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/site-migration-from-wordpress-to-hugo/\"\u003elearning Hugo and the site migration from Wordpress\u003c/a\u003e which I lost sleep over. I think this is one of things that makes me feel most alive - when I find a topic of interest and dive into it and lose sleep over it. Unfortunately, that happens fairly rarely nowadays and rarely lasts very long.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m slightly amused by how I\u0026rsquo;ve read so much about strategies for monetizing content on the internet that by now I can easily recognize when someone else is doing it. After sending me my Sparketype, there was also a link to a page upselling me on their \u0026ldquo;Mastery Program\u0026rdquo; which would allow me to make the most of this knowledge for $29.99. I guess it was a book or video of some sort. Exactly 24 hours after the initial results email, I got a 2nd email which was following-up and encouraging me to take a look at the program. I unsubscribed at this point, but I find it safe to assume I\u0026rsquo;m still in their database. I don\u0026rsquo;t even think I ever signed up. I\u0026rsquo;m not really the type of person who would pay for these things, so as long as I know what I\u0026rsquo;m getting into, I don\u0026rsquo;t mind tolerating the sleazy marketing for a bit.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n",
