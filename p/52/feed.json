Some recent examples. (Spoilers for current seasons of Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow and Daredevil follow)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe current season 4 of Supergirl seems to be focusing on anti-alien sentiment, a thinly-veiled allegory towards the anti-immigration movement propagated in far right \u0026ldquo;nationalist\u0026rdquo; circles. Similar to real-life, hatemongers are portrayed riling up crowds frustrated with losing jobs and threats to law and order due to the presence of \u0026ldquo;aliens\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe pilot episode of Legends of Tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s season 4 includes a short segment where one of the characters visits her mother, a Muslim immigrant in the US, and wishes she could warn her to move to Canada before \u0026ldquo;this country turns against her.\u0026rdquo; Do the Legends know about things to come? (Of course, during the previous season, the showrunners \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/aug/4/dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-producer-admits-muslim-cha/\"\u003eadmitted that the Muslim character in question was introduced precisely as a response to Trump\u0026rsquo;s election\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnd finally, in the fantastic Daredevil season 3, Wilson\u0026rsquo;s Fisk\u0026rsquo;s being billeted in the \u0026ldquo;Presidential Hotel\u0026rdquo; and his calling out his supposed crimes as politically-motivated \u0026ldquo;fake news\u0026rdquo; reminds a lot of people of the current American president.

This, despite the existence the so-called ComicsGate movement among a minority of superhero fans, which is a self-described revolt against \u0026ldquo;liberalism\u0026rdquo;. I wonder if these ComicsGate people also hate the TV shows?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Not just his job as a manager and as a salesman, but everything he chooses to do. As an example, he auditioned for a play (\u003cem\u003eThe Demon Barber of Fleet Street)\u003c/em\u003e and automatically assumed he was getting a part. He also made a movie which fell into the so-bad-its-good category (\u003cem\u003eThreat Level Midnight\u003c/em\u003e) and was pissed off that his girlfriend didn\u0026rsquo;t care much for it. He also claims to have written a business book and an HBO comedy special.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find the above relatable because I have this similar flaw of wanting to do everything and yet feel bad when I fall short.

Modern systems, Perrow argues, are made up of thousands of parts, all of which interrelate in ways that are impossible to anticipate. Given that complexity, he says, it is almost inevitable that some combinations of minor failures will eventually amount to something catastrophic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe description of \u0026ldquo;modern systems\u0026rdquo; above reminds me most of modern software systems. And it is true that modern software systems are made of thousands of \u0026ldquo;parts\u0026rdquo;, and the way they all interrelate with each other can be impossible to anticipate. This is why software defects are inevitable, especially as system size grows. Once a software system is large enough, there will be no single developer who can see all the details of every operation the software does. While we try to maximize testing scope, we cannot possibly handle every possible combination of thousands of inputs, and we limit ourselves to the most likely cases. This is considered an acceptable risk of software development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile your critical software bug is not likely to cost millions of dollars to clean up, a lot of what Gladwell discusses in the article can still be applicable to software development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf software systems can be compared to normal accidents, what else does Gladwell\u0026rsquo;s article say about such accidents that might be applicable to software systems? Later on Gladwell tells us about \u003cem\u003erisk homeostasis:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is another way to look at this problem, and that is from the standpoint of how human beings handle risk. One of the assumptions behind the modern disaster ritual is that when a risk can be identified and eliminated a system can be made safer. The new booster joints on the shuttle, for example, are so much better than the old ones that the over-all chances of a Challenger-style accident’s ever happening again must be lower-right? This is such a straightforward idea that questioning it seems almost impossible. But that is just what another group of scholars has done, under what is called the theory of \u0026ldquo;risk homeostasis.\u0026rdquo; It should be said that within the academic community there are huge debates over how widely the theory of risk homeostasis can and should be applied. But the basic idea, which has been laid out brilliantly by the Canadian psychologist Gerald Wilde in his book \u0026ldquo;Target Risk,\u0026rdquo; is quite simple: under certain circumstances, changes that appear to make a system or an organization safer in fact don’t. Why? Because human beings have a seemingly fundamental tendency to compensate for lower risks in one area by taking greater risks in another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRisk management is a big part of software development, especially as projects grow larger. We need to be careful that we are evaluating the collective risks on a project accurately and not just trading one set of risks for another.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIn fourth year HS, we had an Economics subject, and back then I was fascinated with the idea of free market capitalism \u0026ndash; the free market, the invisible hand, the law of supply and demand, and the idea that through competition we are forced to adapt and become better and more efficient in order to survive. Capitalism mirrored the law of nature: the strong will survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days, I am much less enamored with the idea of capitalism. Not that I disbelieve that it makes us more efficient, but that ruthless efficiency has a cost. Like the law of nature that it mirrors, capitalism ensures that the strong survive, but the corollary is also true: the weak will die and be consumed by the strong. Humans are a societal species, which means we are supposed to be stronger together. But capitalism, optimized towards the pursuit of profit, often times can force us to sacrifice the greater good in favor of individual interests. Corporations especially, will often act as soulless entities whose mandate is above all to pursue profits in the name of the stockholders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of the societal ills in the world today can be directly traced to the ruthless efficiency in pursuit of profit, the prime example being environmental issues like climate change and pollution: governments don\u0026rsquo;t want to enact stronger controls because it will cut into corporations\u0026rsquo; bottom lines, and politicians don\u0026rsquo;t want to piss off corporations that they rely on for donations. Capitalism\u0026rsquo;s ruthless efficiency has brought us to a world of wage inequality, banks too large to fail, and large monolithic companies that are virtual monopolies due to network effect. It\u0026rsquo;s a system that reinforces the rich and powerful (the strong survive) while the masses suffer in silence (the weak will die)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe emergence of large monolithic corporations wielding monopoly powers is especially challenging, and is a natural consequence of \u0026ldquo;the strong survive\u0026rdquo;. As the rich get richer, they can use the accumulated power and money to defeat any further competition that dares to challenge them. Thus they are able to resist becoming more efficient in favor of simply using their leadership status as a blunt instrument. You can see this in the tech industry with virtual monopolies such as Google (search), Facebook (social networking), Amazon (sales, cloud hosting); realistically they can only be challenged by companies of similar scale, there is no space for smaller guys to move into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still think capitalism can be a force for good, and that efficiency is still something to strive for. But I also now believe that this efficiency should be tempered by a corresponding collectivism, whether enforced by states  (through regulation or subsidies or welfare programs) or by some other mechanism. The idea of something like universal basic income is promising, but under a purely free market system, I don\u0026rsquo;t see how it could work. It is hopefully not too late for us to find a way to navigate our society to a post-scarcity Star Trek-like future, where humans are able to dedicate themselves to scientific and artistic pursuits without worrying about survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(If this sounds like a rant with no proposed answers, it is. This post and others like are just me sounding off on how my thinking and philosophical leanings have changed throughout the years, so that I may consider where it can lead me to. Feel free to debate me in the comments.)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

There was some kind of event going on in the main plaza for the Department of Agriculture; Secretary Pinol was there giving a speech. I walked a couple of rounds around the park so I could meet my daily steps target. The sun was coming down and I\u0026rsquo;m not the best photographer but I thought it looked good on the Quezon Memorial Shrine so I took the above shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have fond memories of the QCMC. When we were young our extended family used to have Saturday picnics there. We\u0026rsquo;d roll up this colorful rattan mat and get into our uncle\u0026rsquo;s car and hang out there playing around and riding bikes and eating sandwiches. I also have this vague recollection of my dad bringing me up the tower that is the Quezon Memorial Shrine. (I don\u0026rsquo;t know how that works. Are there stairs inside? Seems tiring to climb.) I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve ever been in the museum at the base of the shrine though, I should try it some day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days I still pass by the QCMC every so often. (A single pass around the park adds a good 1500-2000 steps to my daily walks). There\u0026rsquo;s a lot more stuff there now than when I was a kid \u0026ndash; there\u0026rsquo;s playground sets for kids, some kind of exercise machines, there\u0026rsquo;s now restaurants inside, and a whole lot of small vendor stalls. I remember a while back I saw like a zipline and some kind of small duck boat thing, not sure if they\u0026rsquo;re still there, I don\u0026rsquo;t recall seeing them during my last visit. There\u0026rsquo;s a peace bell from the UN that was inaugurated in 1995. And a lot more weird statues than there used to be. (I regret not taking a picture of this weird gold statue I saw with three boys doing something I have no idea what.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe park doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel super well-maintained; the asphalt roads have definitely seen better days. But somehow I still like it, there\u0026rsquo;s this kind of homely atmosphere, and even on weekday afternoons there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of people hanging out in the park. For me, the QCMC is more \u0026ldquo;iconic\u0026rdquo; than say, Rizal Park in Manila, maybe because I\u0026rsquo;ve lived in QC all my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a few years, there will be an MRT station inside the Circle. I hope it leads to more economic activity in the park in general and doesn\u0026rsquo;t lead to any sort of degradation. I hope to be visiting the park for years and decades to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eFor the past few weeks or so, many in the country were consumed by a sort of lotto fever. The PCSO 6/58 Ultra Lotto had gotten up to a record high jackpot prize of more than 1 billion PHP (roughly 20M USD \u0026ndash; I know some lotteries in the US have prizes way higher than that, but hey, we\u0026rsquo;re not the US.) Many people who normally don\u0026rsquo;t play the Lotto were participating due to the sheer size of the pot. I must confess that even I bought a few tickets during the latter part of the run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor reference, the Ultra Lotto draw has 6 numbers from a pool of 1-58 (hence \u0026ldquo;6/58\u0026rdquo;) drawn three times a week. Using the power of Math (TM), that gives us roughly 40 million possible combinations. By comparison, the Avengers only had a 1 in 14 million chance of surviving the events of \u003cem\u003eInfinity War\u003c/em\u003e, so that\u0026rsquo;s way worse odds and you don\u0026rsquo;t even have a time stone! The price of an individual ticket is 24 PHP, and 24 * ~40 million is ~960 million, so once the jackpot exceeded 1 billion PHP, the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value\"\u003eEV\u003c/a\u003e of a single lotto ticket was already a net positive. If only I had the 960 million and change to bet on every single combination!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had actually started betting on the lotto sporadically since last year, mostly for fun. The first time you make a bet it\u0026rsquo;s kind of exciting. Suddenly you went from zero chance of being instantly rich to a nonzero chance! A ridiculously small, highly unlikely chance, but still a chance!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/ToMjGpKniGqRNLGBrhu/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/jim-carrey-dumb-and-dumber-so-youre-telling-me-theres-a-chance-ToMjGpKniGqRNLGBrhu\"\u003evia GIPHY\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve bet a few times though, the novelty kind of fades away after a while and you kinda feel silly, like you\u0026rsquo;re paying a tax for not understanding the probabilities right. (To be fair, I totally did understand the probabilities, I just chose to hope! How can it be wrong to choose hope!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy last bet was the Friday before the jackpot was actually won, and the jackpot was already past 1 billion at that time. To be honest, it caused me a little bit of anxiety. Obviously winning all that money would be good, but in the Philippines suddenly becoming rich had it\u0026rsquo;s own share of risks, including security risks from less-than-honorable people finding out and targeting you for crimes. There was even \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/9mvg95/what_are_the_possible_risks_in_winning_the_lotto/\"\u003ea Reddit thread\u003c/a\u003e about it. (Yes, reading that thread didn\u0026rsquo;t help with the anxiety.) Luckily (what?) I didn\u0026rsquo;t end up winning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jackpot was eventually won last Sunday, Oct 14, split by two winners, bring the the dreams of a nation to an end. Almost immediately I read some conspiracy theories about how the whole thing was a setup and that the powers-that-be had purposely allowed the jackpot to get so high so more people would bet and then at the last minute they faked one of the winners so they could get the money and use it for the upcoming elections. Or something to that effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must say however, that I don\u0026rsquo;t actually recommend regularly betting on the lotto. It\u0026rsquo;s popular in this country, even when the jackpot isn\u0026rsquo;t that high, I\u0026rsquo;m sure my dad has been regularly betting for decades now. Life is tough in this country and for many people the ridiculously low odds are about the same odds they face in daily life anyway so why not? But if you\u0026rsquo;re going to play the lotto, don\u0026rsquo;t delude yourself into thinking that you\u0026rsquo;re actually going to win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/jim-carrey-dumb-and-dumber-so-youre-telling-me-theres-a-chance-ToMjGpKniGqRNLGBrhu\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",
