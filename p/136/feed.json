            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eWhen you\u0026rsquo;re young and in school memorizing math formulas or history dates or whatnot, all of it seems so silly and you wonder if you\u0026rsquo;re really going to be using all of this knowledge in real life. However, the intent of a general education program isn\u0026rsquo;t specifically to give you knowledge that will be useful to you in the future (although it may turn out to be so)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stuff school teaches you \u0026ndash; literature, mathematics, art, history, science, and so on \u0026ndash; are intended to give you a broad enough base from which you can freely choose the direction you want to go in life. This means that as you specialize, many of these subjects may become \u0026ldquo;irrelevant\u0026rdquo; to you, but having this broad base of knowledge gives you a better foundation in life. Knowledge from unrelated fields can often give useful insight into your own specialized field\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, the most useful stuff you learn from school isn’t the stuff that’s in the lectures or in the textbooks. School is supposed to teach you about more than formulas and history dates too. But it\u0026rsquo;s a problem that most of the time, formal education doesn\u0026rsquo;t deliver the lessons well enough. Math shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be about memorizing formulas or equations, but about developing analytical and problem solving skills. History should be about appreciating how changes affect people and societies, not about memorizing dates. Science should be about appreciating how nature works and developing scientific curiosity. And so on. But because these things are difficult to teach and test for, formal education usually focuses on facts and figures and formulas and all these things that appear in exams. It\u0026rsquo;s up to the student (or his mentors encourage him) to apply himself further\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are still many more holes in formal education. There are memes about how you learn not so useful stuff like \u0026ldquo;mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell\u0026rdquo; instead of real-world useful things like how to manage your finance or how to do your taxes. And for sure we need more of those practical things taught to students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the most important things you learn from school are in the methods of learning and working well with others. School teaches how to apply yourself, how to study and pick up new material, how to listen to other people, how to determine which knowledge is useful to learn, how to discern truth from fiction, how to work within a set of rules, how to manage your time, how to deal with schedules and deadlines, how to work well with other people, how to deal with difficult people, and so on. In short, the most important lessons school teaches you are about how to deal with the real world\u003c/p\u003e\n",

But for the most part I\u0026rsquo;ve restricted it to those channels and have tried to avoid posting about current events in the country on this blog (outside of my personal choices for the election), but I feel that now more than ever those of us who can speak out have a responsibility to do so whenever we can, for several reasons\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://2016.villageidiotsavant.com/2016/08/19/232-sanity-survival-strategies-for-the-next-six-years/\"\u003eVillage Idiot Savant\u003c/a\u003e says:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Third, write. But don’t write as you would for the consumption of social media, write instead to keep a record of these times. Write in long form, write reflections, write your frustrations, write with big words, write even if it appears you are rambling. Write with Art and with Irony. Because we will eventually emerge from this period of madness, hopefully to a season of sanity, and we will need to look back and remember, and if needed, to indict. Write because it will someday be history.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat last part resonated with me. \u0026ldquo;Write because it will someday be history.\u0026rdquo; It reminds me of where we are currently with the Marcos legacy, with an entire generation having been brainwashed to believe that Marcos was actually a hero and a positive influence on this country, all because in the intervening years since the EDSA revolution we (and by we I mean we the people, not just the government) grew complacent and believed that exile was sufficient and that we would not have to worry again about such a dark time in our society to come back and haunt us again\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet here we are again on a road, perhaps even a slippery slope, towards a dark future. Marcos is again being glorified, and the state is once again extending its reach with the similar excuse of \u0026ldquo;peace and order\u0026rdquo;. We do not yet know where this path ultimately leads, perhaps it won\u0026rsquo;t be the darkness many of us can foresee, perhaps we as a society are able to turn away from the brink before it is too late. There are those who believe it is already too late, that we are already in the darkest timeline\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if our country falls under a shroud of darkness, like the darkness of Martial Law it will also eventually pass and hopefully we emerge on the other side stronger and wiser as a country. In the hopes of that light beyond the darkness, we must write. We must take our voices and speak out against what ills we see. It often feels futile, with many of our countrymen already having surrendered their wills to the violence. Many are unwilling to listen, many treat the current leadership as if they are infallible demigods who could do no wrong. Maybe there is really no one listening and you are but a lone voice crying in the wilderness. It is not for them that we need to write, but for those of us who still hope for a better future. And for those in the future to recognize and learn from the mistakes of our time\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe must write and speak, while we still can. We don\u0026rsquo;t know whether we will still be able to speak up tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, we should write to spite those who would silence us for our opposition. For many of the administration\u0026rsquo;s supporters, anyone who speaks out is an open target for harassment and accusations most vile, as one of Rappler\u0026rsquo;s correspondents recently found out:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eChastising Duterte is not mutually exclusive with supporting De Lima.

Not everyone has the liberty to speak up. Not everyone can afford to sacrifice time nor ego to the possibility of a horde of online trolls pouncing on you. Not everyone can afford to be stressed out over this. Not everyone has the temperament to be willing to offend other people or risk losing friendships. All the more reason for those of us who are able to speak up to keep on going and to persist in the face of overwhelming ignorance and hypocrisy. The ones who cannot afford to speak, we speak for them too\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the reasons I didn\u0026rsquo;t write about this too much on this blog is that I didn\u0026rsquo;t want this channel to become about politics. But it feels like so much more than just politics now. Despite what some fanatics may have you believe, we do not voice opposition simply because we believe in another camp or because we want to destroy the current administration. We voice opposition because we want the best for our country, and we believe that these issues \u0026ndash; the continuing demonization of human rights and due process, encouragement of a culture of killing and violence, intellectual dishonesty and willful ignorance, and so on \u0026ndash; are issues worth raising up and discussing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am sure I have friends and family who are tired of me bringing up such subjects. At least one person has unfriended me already without explanation, although circumstances dictate it was about \u0026ldquo;politics\u0026rdquo;. For my friends and family, I apologize. If you are tired of me speaking up, please trust that I am tired too\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Simmons introduces new concepts and the history of his universe and human society quickly and unapologetically. Even the prologue bandies around the terms Hegemony and Ouster with little explanation save what we can glean from context. Most of it is expounded upon and elaborated in the short stories which comprise the majority of the book.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe short stories tell the tales of each of the pilgrims making their way to the far off world of Hyperion to face their death before a time-defying god. It seems that each story follows and develops a different aspect of Hyperion\u0026rsquo;s universe: the first one tells us about religion and space travel and colonisation, the second talks about military life, and so on. My favorite was the scholar\u0026rsquo;s story: although the preceding parts of the story make the ending especially predictable, how he gets there is told incredibly well and you can feel the sadness and despair of his situation\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe disappointing part of the book however was the ending, which seemingly just drops the story like a rock. The last story to be told doesn\u0026rsquo;t even explain why the pilgrim wanted to return to Hyperion, and we do not get the climactic meeting the rest of the book has been leading up to. I understand that the story was actually split into two books, and that I would have to read the succeeding book Fall of Hyperion to get any payoff, but I wish it had been handled better\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn spite of that, I liked it. And maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll pick up the sequel too.
