            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAround the first week of June 2016, \u003ca href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-twitter-pinterest-accounts-hacked-linkedin-hack-facebook-passwords-2016-6\"\u003eMark Zuckerberg, well-known nerd and founder of Facebook, was hacked\u003c/a\u003e. If even the founder of the world\u0026rsquo;s largest social network can be hacked, anybody can! So it might be a good idea to review how you manage and secure your online passwords\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**Avoid using short, simple, or commonly-used passwords! **These are subject to so-called \u0026ldquo;brute force\u0026rdquo; attacks where bad actors just try a whole lot of passwords until they find one that works. You don\u0026rsquo;t \u003cem\u003eactually\u003c/em\u003e have to use numbers or special characters (unless the service requires you to do so). What can really hamper password attackers is password length, the longer the better, since the length of the password increases the computational time needed for a brute-force attack. For the most important services, I would suggest a password length of at least 20 characters (although some services won\u0026rsquo;t allow you to have passwords this long, which deserves a glare from me). If not required to use numbers or special characters, you can simply use a pass phrase composed of multiple English words. This has the pleasant side effect of being easy to remember. As with many things, this is best illustrated by XKCD:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png\" width=\"740\" height=\"601\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake note that it\u0026rsquo;s important to choose passwords or phrases that are not related to common personal information such as birthdays, names of relatives, or anniversaries. This is all information which any attacker might be able to acquire from other sources. This is how Michael Caine\u0026rsquo;s character in \u003cem\u003eNow You See Me\u003c/em\u003e got hacked by the Four Horsemen!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAvoid using the same passwords for every service!\u003c/strong\u003e This is one of the cardinal rules that Zuck broke causing the hack. A few years back, data from LinkedIn was accessed by hackers including passwords, and the hackers were able to use Zuck\u0026rsquo;s LinkedIn password to log in to his Twitter and Pinterest accounts\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou probably don\u0026rsquo;t have to use unique passwords for _every _service \u0026ndash; I have a few \u0026ldquo;low-security\u0026rdquo; passwords that I use whenever I don\u0026rsquo;t care about the account being compromised. Most common usage for me is when I need to ask a question on some programming forum (for the rare case that \u003ca href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/\"\u003eStackOverflow does not suffice)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou need to identify which services are critical to you \u0026ndash; the ones you can\u0026rsquo;t afford to have compromised. Typically (for me at least), this includes financial services (online banking websites), email and social media accounts you use on a regular basis, and probably government services (I don\u0026rsquo;t have any of those at the moment). For these services you should use different passwords for each one, to protect the other accounts in case one of them gets compromised\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the past few years many major services such as LinkedIn have had their password data exposed \u003cem\u003e(If the programmers were doing their job right, the hackers wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been able to decrypt the password data even if they accessed it \u0026ndash; but that\u0026rsquo;s material for another post)\u003c/em\u003e, so if you\u0026rsquo;re using a lot of online service, the odds of some of your data getting hacked at some point is quite high\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem is: most people have trouble remembering one password, how can they be expected to remember multiple passwords and match them to the corresponding service? There are a few of strategies:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e**Use a password manager program **such as \u003ca href=\"https://lastpass.com/\"\u003eLastPass\u003c/a\u003e. These programs will randomly generate and store a new password for you for each service you use. A lot of commenters online swear by this, but I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of it because (a) I need my passwords everywhere, anywhere, any time. LastPass has an option to sync passwords across the cloud, but it requires a premium account; (b) additional steps when you need to create or store or remember a password; (c) if you lose access to the password manager, you also lose everything else\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUse a procedurally-generated password for each service\u003c/strong\u003e. This is my preferred option. It means that for each service, you construct a password using a fixed set of rules, with the rules taking into account the service itself. A simple example would be using a base password + the service name: with a base password of \u0026ldquo;horseradish\u0026rdquo;, you would use \u0026ldquo;horseradishYahoo\u0026rdquo; for Yahoo mail and \u0026ldquo;horseradishFacebook\u0026rdquo; for Facebook and so on. Of course, if your Yahoo mail account is compromised the hacker can still easily guess your Facebook password, so it needs to be more complicated than that. A better example would be: base password + your favorite Transformer whose name starts with the third letter of the service: for Yahoo it would be \u0026ldquo;horseradishHound\u0026rdquo; and for Facebook it would be \u0026ldquo;horseradishCliffjumper\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeep a list of password hints written down\u003c/strong\u003e. Either on paper or on a softcopy document somewhere you can access all the time. Now obviously, if you keep a list of the passwords themselves you risk someone finding that list and accessing all your services. What I like to do is maintain a list of cryptic password hints that really only make sense to me\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e**Memorize them! **For the most important accounts (probably the ones that allow access to other services via forgot password mechanisms), you should generate a unique password and eventually memorize them\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI use some combination of #2 and #3: for most social media services I use #2 but for more critical services like online banking I use some variation of the procedural rules and maintain a list of cryptic hints that describe how I varied the rules. #2 works fine for social media accounts since I can reconstruct the passwords mentally wherever I am without need to reference a list. For online banking services, I don\u0026rsquo;t use them that often but they need to be more secure so it\u0026rsquo;s okay for me to have to reference a list if I forget the passwords. For my primary email accounts, I have a very strong password that I have committed to memory with no hints anywhere\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome random other tips:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e**Change your passwords on a regular basis. **Regularly changing passwords means older passwords can\u0026rsquo;t be used against you in case they are hacked. It can be as simple as changing your password when you log into a service for the first time in a new year\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0026rsquo;t share passwords with anybody!\u003c/strong\u003e Well okay, maybe you can share some passwords with select family members as necessary. But basically don\u0026rsquo;t give your passwords to anyone you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t confess murder to. There are still scammers who pretend to be authorities in order to collect passwords and other information from you. Be wary of strangers!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0026rsquo;t use any browser feature that remembers the passwords for you.\u003c/strong\u003e I suggest typing out your passwords every time. Typing them out makes it easier for your brain to remember your passwords. But more importantly, if your machine is compromised by malware, your passwords can be accessed from the browser\u0026rsquo;s data store\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNot really password-related but you should take note anyway: \u003cstrong\u003eUse two-factor authentication whenever it is available\u003c/strong\u003e. This is where whenever you login to a service, it will also send you a secret code via another channel such as SMS or email. You then need to input that secret code in the service in order to proceed. This is so that even if your password is compromised, hackers still can\u0026rsquo;t access your account. This is starting to become more and more common among the widely used services: Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Steam all provide 2FA. Modern online banking services will even \u003cstrong\u003erequire\u003c/strong\u003e you to use two-factor authentication. (Sadly not all local banks do so)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that post turned out longer than I expected! It might seem like overkill to have overly complicated passwords or password management schemes. If you use any online services which contain important data you can\u0026rsquo;t afford to have compromised, it\u0026rsquo;s a necessary evil and well worth the effort\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Outside had been slightly chilly, the first hints of the coming winter lingering in the air. Inside I gratefully took off my cap and laid it on the counter as I sat down and waved over at the middle-aged lady brewing coffee on the other end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Fresh pot? I\u0026rsquo;ll have some if that\u0026rsquo;s alright. And any bacon and eggs you have,\u0026rdquo; I found myself saying, surprisingly famished. The woman turned as if seeing me for the first time. I spied a name tag against her faded yellow uniform, in gilded letters it spelled out \u0026ldquo;DOLORES\u0026rdquo;. With a surprising assertiveness I followed up, \u0026ldquo;As quickly as possible please Dolores.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDolores\u0026rsquo; raised her eyebrows. I\u0026rsquo;m unsure whether it was because of my unusual order or because of my impertinence, but regardless she turned to the little window behind the counter and whispered something indistinct, I suppose to whoever needed to cook my bacon and eggs. She took her time waddling over with her freshly brewed pot of coffee and poured me a hot cup. She spoke with a long, drawling voice. \u0026ldquo;So, who you running away from honey?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time I was the one to look surprised. My eyes quickly darted around the diner, near empty at this surely ungodly hour. The only other patron was a skinny old man at a booth on the far end, slowly going through what looked like a faded newspaper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDolores smiled a knowing smile. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not rocket science hon,\u0026rdquo; She gestured with her mouth to the parking lot outside, in the direction of the van I had been driving for the past seven hours. \u0026ldquo;You drive up here a bit past midnight in a big-name delivery van, the kind that don\u0026rsquo;t do deliveries at this hour.\u0026rdquo; She put the coffee pot down and waved her hand over my face, \u0026ldquo;Your eyes are tired and your clothes are rumpled and you smell like you\u0026rsquo;ve been in that van for what, half a day now?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re awfully perceptive aren\u0026rsquo;t you,\u0026rdquo; I retorted back without thinking, \u0026ldquo;For a waitress at an all-night diner?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not that unusual you know, there\u0026rsquo;s really only two sorts that end up here at this hour, truckers and people who\u0026rsquo;re running,\u0026rdquo; she gestured at the van again, \u0026ldquo;and that ain\u0026rsquo;t no truck.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Why do people run?\u0026rdquo; I found myself asking. Just making small talk. Why would I care why other people run?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDolores shrugged, \u0026ldquo;Lots of reasons, I guess. Some\u0026rsquo;re crooks, running from the law. There\u0026rsquo;s those in debt and can\u0026rsquo;t afford to pay so they skip town. More and more these days though, there\u0026rsquo;s folks who maybe just got tired of livin\u0026rsquo; their lives and they figure they could just up and vanish, walk out from their nagging wife and their crazy kids and their shitty jobs that probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t last long anyways. A lot of \u0026lsquo;em think they can just find a cabin in the woods somewhere and disappear for a few years, livin\u0026rsquo; off the land. Or maybe they imagine they can drive up to some big city and lose themselves in the crowds.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grunted perhaps a bit too loudly, thinking about how I had gotten here in the first place. Dolores seemed to be able to read my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Let me guess, you have no idea what you\u0026rsquo;re doing here do you?\u0026rdquo; She looked me up and down. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d guess that\u0026rsquo;s your delivery uniform right there, haven\u0026rsquo;t bothered changing out of it. You just kept on driving, no idea where you wanted to go.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Well, I was thinking maybe somewhere up north\u0026ndash;\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Honey, if you really wanted to go, you\u0026rsquo;d have ditched that delivery van o\u0026rsquo; yours as soon as you could. You know as well as I do those things got GPS on \u0026lsquo;em right?'\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded slowly. I had thought about the GPS, but figured I just needed to leave the van somewhere before morning when they would be looking for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;And your cellphone, you got one don\u0026rsquo;t you? Still on you?\u0026rdquo;, she retorted as an indistinct voice called out from beyond the small hole and a plate slid out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Yeah, \u0026quot; I said, patting my left-hand pocket, \u0026ldquo;but I turned it off. My wife must have called me a dozen times by now.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;So tell me hon, why haven\u0026rsquo;t you thrown it out yet?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Throw it out?\u0026rdquo; I was caught a bit off guard, \u0026ldquo;Well, I kind of paid good money for it, and I\u0026rsquo;m still on contract, so\u0026ndash;\u0026rdquo; I trailed off, knowing I wasn\u0026rsquo;t making sense. I shook my head. \u0026ldquo;You think I should go back?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Honey, I ain\u0026rsquo;t telling you what to do, it\u0026rsquo;s your own damn life,\u0026rdquo; Dolores said as she served up a plate full of bacon and eggs. \u0026ldquo;But I see you, you keep glacin\u0026rsquo; at that there wedding ring on your hand, out at the van in the parking lot, and I see a man who ain\u0026rsquo;t ready to let go. You gonna run, you gotta be sure, you gotta cut clean.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; My brow furrowed as I frowned at the bacon in front of me, perhaps for the first time in my life. \u0026ldquo;You know, it was my birthday yesterday.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Dolores\u0026rsquo; turn to grunt, \u0026ldquo;Happy birthday then, but I hope you ain\u0026rsquo;t expecting a discount.\u0026rdquo; She finally picked up the coffee pot, turned away from me, and walked over to the other patron who had motioned her over with his coffee cup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up the fork and started eating. It was perhaps the best meal I\u0026rsquo;ve had in a long while.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Inside I gratefully took off my cap and laid it on the counter as I sat down and waved over at the middle-aged lady brewing coffee on the other end.\n\u0026ldquo;Fresh pot? I\u0026rsquo;ll have some if that\u0026rsquo;s alright. And any bacon and eggs you have,\u0026rdquo; I found myself saying, surprisingly famished.",

The questions were puzzle/problem solving type questions. I think there were 10 questions in all. I don’t remember all of them, but for sure one of them was the pirates puzzle described here: \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.mathsisfun.com/puzzles/5-pirates-solution.html\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ehttp://www.mathsisfun.com/puzzles/5-pirates-solution.html\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e.

It consisted of a few parts, the first part was they gave me some sort of string-manipulation problem and I had to write a program \u003cem\u003eon a whiteboard\u003c/em\u003e and explain and defend it. Nowadays if you asked someone to write a program on paper or on a whiteboard during an interview, it would kind of look ridiculous since it doesn’t reflect a realistic scenario of how programmers work these days (i.e. with the internet and IDEs and autocompletes and whatnot), but that was how things were done back in the day\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eI hadn’t done much programming outside of using C, so that’s the language I used to provide my solution, but in theory I could have just used some sort of pseudocode since they don’t require you to use specific languages. As a programmer applying for a job, I would recommend prioritizing opportunities that don’t require you to know a specific language or set of languages. You’ll learn and grow a lot more as a programmer\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAfter leaving me in the room for thirty minutes, the interviewer came back and I had to explain the program I had written on the whiteboard. It was a typical string-manipulation problem designed to see how well coders think through the process. I don’t remember the details too much, but I remember getting into a debate with the interviewer about the expected behavior for the C function strcpy(). I didn’t want to appear too argumentative, so even though I believed I was right (and I confirmed it afterwards!) I just let it be after insisting a couple of times\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAfter the programming question, I got asked an \u0026ldquo;impossible question\u0026rdquo;. This is another type of interview question that has mostly fallen out of favor these days. The idea of an impossible question is basically the interviewee tries to approximate an answer to a question that would generally take a lot of research to answer. The interviewee has to explain his reasoning of how he would estimate the answer, and from there the interviewer can make a judgment of how well thought out the interviewee’s processes are. I didn’t know about this style of question ahead of time of course, this interview was the first time I’ve encountered it. I actually still remember the impossible question asked of me: I was asked how many people ride the Metrorail (MRT3) in Metro Manila on a daily basis. This was in 2002, so the MRT3 had only been out for around 3 years and wasn’t quite as congested as it was now, so I could make some reasonable assumptions like each train arrives at each station every 5 minutes, each car usually houses 300 people on average, etc, and I think I gave a pretty reasonable answer\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThis style of recruitment process was popular at the time, more than ten years ago. Companies like Microsoft were well-known for it. In fact many potential programming job applicants would be advised on internet forums to google \u0026ldquo;Microsoft interview questions\u0026rdquo;, and many of them became so well-known MS was forced to revamp its processes as well\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWith the problem solving, the code walk-through and the impossible question, the focus was finding not necessarily people who were very good at coding per se, but rather people who exhibited a strong analytical approach to problem solving\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThese days the recruitment process is very, very different. In most, if not all companies, the written exam will focus on technical, coding questions. You’ll be given sample code and need to try to identify the problems with the code. A friend even had to answer questions over the phone about details of Java syntax (pretty useless questions if you ask me)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAnd instead of a technical interview where you have to write code manually, most likely you’ll be given a workstation with an IDE and computer access and asked to implement so-and-so program. Some of the more progressive ones will do a pairing exam where you have to do pair programming with one of their existing developers; such pairing exams give insight on two fronts: your technical skill and how well you can work well with someone already on the team you’re applying for\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eI kind of prefer the old style of recruitment processes because they give a better chance for people like me who had minimal formal programming education but can learn easily and quickly\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",
