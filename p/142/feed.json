There are no good, objective, universally accepted standard metrics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\"\u003eIt follows from the fact that there are no good, objective, universally accepted standard metrics for program size. Typically each programmer in a team will not be doing the same task or even the same type of task, so in order to produce fair evaluations you will need some standard metric of program size to normalize any evaluation. For example, you could choose to use code quality (bugs) as a metric for programmer performance, but not every programmer is assigned to do the same complexity of programs and some modules may be more poorly designed than others resulting in more bugs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\"\u003eLines of code is nice, until you realize that more lines of code does not necessarily mean a larger program or system, it may just mean your programmers don’t write particularly concise code. Often, different programmers will write the same program with different lines of code equally well. There are other possible metrics, but they all have different flaws and none of them capture the complexities of program size particularly well. Function points for example are meant to determine program size based on functional complexity but does not take into account technical complexity. Agile teams will often used a fuzzy metric called story points formed by team consensus but these are notoriously inaccurate and may change in relative size from sprint to sprint and definitely change in relative size across teams.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\"\u003eWhat complicates things even more is that even the best, most senior programmers can slip into poor program quality due to schedule pressure, unreasonable clients or requirements, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\"\u003eWhat I would suggest (and probably is unavoidable) is instead a more subjective approach, combining multiple heuristics to get as fair an evaluation as possible. I would suggest something like the following combination:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHave the programmer define his own goals/targets for the evaluation period. At the end of the period, go over the goals with him and discuss how closely he came to meeting them. These may be quantitative targets or qualitative (“I feel like my code has been of reasonably good quality”). You can compare against the other feedback in this list if there’s any disagreement\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGet feedback from a technical perspective from a mentor or senior developer who has worked closely with the programmer. The feedback can answer some simple questions like “Is his technical skill adequate?”, “Can he be assigned more complex functions?”, “Has he been assigned the appropriate amount of work?”, ““Has he created any problems that someone of his skill level should not be expected to do?”, “How has he contributed to the overall team?”, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGet feedback from other people he has worked with. For people who haven’t worked that closely with him, the feedback will be leaning more towards soft skills rather than technical, i.e. how well he works with other people, how manageable he is, how helpful he is, and so on.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\"\u003eAll of the above are subjective, but in combination should give you a relatively good picture of how well the programmer is performing relative to his peers. You can combine it with whatever corporate-sanctioned metrics you need as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Those same classes were only available during the first semester of each year, which meant I could not retake them during the second semester or over the summer to catch up. So effectively, I had fallen one year behind everyone I knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got the news, it was devastating. Up until that time I had always been a pretty good student and I felt like I had always made my parents proud and happy. I did not know how I would tell them about it, I felt that I had failed them utterly. I knew I only had myself to blame as I had let most of these classes go by without paying much attention to them. Sometimes when you’re used to doing well academically all the time you might get lax and feel complacent and then you’re surprised to find out there’s a lot you haven’t picked up but it’s too late to catch up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents were very understanding. My friends did not make fun of me or anything like that. I decided to take the failure for what it was \u0026ndash; a failure \u0026ndash; and simply learn from my mistakes and move on. I had to toughen up. I accepted that I would not be graduating on time, and that it was my own fault. I spent a semester under academic probation, but from that point onwards I did not fail any other classes, and I successfully graduated some years later, got a good job and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFailure is a setback yes, but it’s a setback you can learn from and that you can recover from. Failure is not fatal (most of the time \u0026ndash; obviously try not to fail at skydiving). As long as you can find a way to move forward there is no reason you would not be able to surpass it. In time you will look back on your failures as struggles that you learned from and made you stronger and more resilient\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis post was originally written \u003ca href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-deal-with-the-fact-that-I-failed-my-year/answer/Roy-Tang\"\u003eas a Quora response\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Here\u0026rsquo;s the deck I played at the last tournament: \u003ca href=\"http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=12828\u0026amp;d=274476\u0026amp;f=MO\"\u003ehttp://mtgtop8.com/event?e=12828\u0026amp;d=274476\u0026amp;f=MO\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m mostly fine with the main deck (except maybe Tamiyo, a bit weak, if I think of something better in that slot I might swap her out). I\u0026rsquo;m not playing Nahiri because I don\u0026rsquo;t have time to get them before Saturday, and also because I\u0026rsquo;m quite used to this build already and in Modern I prefer piloting the deck I already really know\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m thinking of tweaking the sideboard. No idea the meta to expect for this weekend\u0026rsquo;s WMCQ so I want to hit as wide a base as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePermission magic:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThinking of changing 1 Negate 2 Dispel to 2 Negate 1 Dispel to give better game against Tron\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCounterflux. This slot is really only good vs Storm, is it worth it? I figure vs Storm you just always stop the start of the storm chain instead of the end, so maybe not worth it?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnti-aggro:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2 Supreme Verdict or 1 Anger of the Gods + 1 Supreme Verdict? Or should I free up another slot and have 1 Anger + 2 Verdict?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eis Shatterstorm even good against Affinity or should I have 2 Stony Silence instead? (I don\u0026rsquo;t have the 2nd Stony yet though\u0026hellip;)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGY hate:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRelic or RIP? RIP turns off GY stuff forever while Relic is a one-off, but RIP is symmetrical so it turns off my own Snaps\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit: Also, is there some guide somewhere that tells me what\u0026rsquo;s the optimal number to choose for EE in various matchups? I just got this EE, so I\u0026rsquo;m not to used to boarding it in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny other suggestions? What matchups should I look out for? Thanks!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
