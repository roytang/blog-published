            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eUnless you’re working at a small shop that only serves local clients, software development these days is often an international endeavor. That means the aspiring software developer needs to be able to work with and get along with people of different cultures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the company I worked with, most projects back in the day we would have a person from the foreign office in charge. Their roles were either as project manager (PM) or system analyst (SA). They were the ones who would be interacting directly with the clients so they get to decide which things need to be done and will often also be setting the schedule. The PM/SA of my first project often communicated directly (via IM) only with his local counterpart, our team leader (TL), so at first our contact with him was minimal. (I found out later that he wasn’t too comfortable speaking to newbies as he’s afraid of being misinterpreted.) But as is wont in software development, often schedules will not be sufficient and deadlines will not be met and so there will be pressure to keep up from the PM/SA. When you’re starting out, there can be a tendency to be off put by these faceless individuals who communicate with us only email, often sending new problems our way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe PM/SA often had a vastly different culture from us Filipinos who like to joke around and be informal when discussing even work-related matters. And in our case, their first language was Chinese and not English. While they did learn English in school, they use it more formally instead of conversationally. So often their messages or emails will be terse, and when you’re not used to dealing with them you might even view them as bit rude or cold and uninviting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I mentioned, the PM of our first project usually often spoke directly only with our TL, but eventually he warmed up to me and one of the newbie testers who was my batchmate. We often had to discuss or clarify program requirements with him so I guess he got used to us after a while. There was another newbie tester on our team however who he never seemed to warm up to. I remember him asking our TL “Who is \u0026lt;tester’s username\u0026gt;?” even though he had previously replied to some emails of the same tester. There was also one time I remember when that tester sent a detailed email to the PM to clarify some items, and the PM replied but addressed his reply to our TL instead! We would often joke around with that tester that the PM probably still had no idea who he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause they often speak in a formal manner, we are often surprised when a glint of humanity shines through. A remember when one other junior developer was talking on the phone with the PM about a particular problem in production and he came back all worried. When we asked him what happened he said “\u003cPM\u003e said some swear words!” Wow, we must have really been in deep trouble for him to lose his cool!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt turns out not all PM/SAs were like that though. Later a couple of younger SAs joined our team and they were much more agreeable to talk to, willing to joke around a bit and talk about their day and stuff. I think it’s because they were fresh from University so maybe they were still used to English. It’s usually the older PMs who are much more stoic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater on, I got sent to the foreign office to help with some UAT preparation on-site. The stoic PM met me at the office and took me to dinner and drove me around to some tourist spots on my first night, so we got a bit closer. The next day was a Saturday, and we had to go to the UAT site to check the setup and preparations. I met him at the office before going to the site and I was surprised to find that he was going to go to the UAT site in a T-shirt and shorts. After that, I never took him too seriously!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA significant number of years later, I also got to work with some staff from a European country. It was another culture shift, but this time it was a bit easier. Unlike our Chinese friends, the Europeans were friendlier and more small-talkish. Meetings (even over Skype) would often start off with “Hello, how are you guys doing?” and more pleasant things, in those precious few minutes while waiting for everyone to get set up. It’s not all good though, as I distinctly remember a meeting where one of the callers was coughing and wheezing all the time (learn to use mute!), although that was probably a person-specific thing and not a cultural thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven work-wise, it was a vastly different way of working with the Europeans. With the Chinese people we worked with on our projects before, everything was very formal and well-documented and there would be action items and detailed program specs to follow and any changes had to go through a rigid process and schedules would need to be adjusted and such. With the Europeans, we would often have meetings and many of the items would not be resolved and would be moved to the next meeting. It would not be unusual for discussions to go round and round a few times before finally managing to come to a decision. And we’d never get clear specifications from them, only some general items or ideas of what they wanted, and we really had to iterate and show them how things would look before they would sign off (and even if they did sign off, they’re very likely to change their minds later at a moment’s notice!) If you’ve ever seen the BBC show W1A, it’s a pretty accurate portrayal of how it was!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorking remotely and communication via channels like email, IM or video calls is already a challenge even when working with other locals. The additional dimension of a foreign culture means we have to be much more willing to adjust to other people as needed. This means being more open to how other people work with, giving them the benefit of the doubt, clarifying where things seems unclear or where there may be miscommunication, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

And despite the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s summer, the rains have started coming in early, although only sporadically. inb4 \u0026ldquo;the world is healing\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"/2020/03/covid19/\"\u003eCOVID19 Diary\u003c/a\u003e is still being updated every few days. Actually went out 3 times this week, once for groceries, and twice for meds for the parental units (one would assume they would coordinate so I can just buy everything in one go, but nooooo.) Maybe that contributed to why the week went by so fast for me. Going out these days saps your energy a lot more than it used to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiny bit of consulting work this week. Wrapped up something I was checking for a client, and helped another one optimize their Wordpress install. It\u0026rsquo;s simple, but it\u0026rsquo;s honest work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two online quiz nights again this week. I didn\u0026rsquo;t play in the Geekfight one, only watched, as the theme (musicals) was out of my wheelhouse. We actually attended the original one for this back in 2016, and correspondingly did quite poorly lol. The second one was team based and was literature-themed, with four rounds based on specific authors each: Stephen King, Agatha Christie, Michael Crichton and Neil Gaiman. I actually rewatched the Agatha Christie Doctor Who ep for this, but the relevant question was super easy anyway, doh! We did reasonably well, but only managed to finish second. Facebook Live continues to be a horrible experience for this given the lag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"watching-lately\"\u003eWatching lately\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noticed that Psych was on Prime Video and have now accidentally binged the entire first season. I recommended this series to a friend, but upon watching the first season (I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve seen any of these eps before) I can\u0026rsquo;t explain why I\u0026rsquo;m so entertained by it. Shawn\u0026rsquo;s antics are over-the-top, and the cases he solves are often ridiculous, but I enjoy it anyway. (Edit: After reading some old convos with people, I suspect it might because I also on occasion attempt to pretend to be a psychic lol.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly movie I watched last week was Spirited Away. Check the \u003ca href=\"/page/lists/2020/movies/\"\u003e2020 movies page\u003c/a\u003e for my commentary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome things of interest:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCory Doctorow is blogging again outside of BoingBoing via a new blog called \u003ca href=\"https://pluralistic.net/\"\u003ePluralistic\u003c/a\u003e. Each daily entry contains some number of links, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like a newsletter really.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://bibliogram.art/\"\u003eBibliogram\u003c/a\u003e is a privacy-focused write-only web frontend for Instagram, that also provides RSS feeds. This kind of site can be fragile to maintain since I doubt they are using the closed official Instagram API. I fully expect whatever integration they are using to break sometimes and at some point in the future, permanently. Nonetheless, I used it to move some of my follows from Instagram to my feed reader (mostly less important ones like comic book artists). There is also an equivalent web front end for Twitter called \u003ca href=\"https://nitter.net/\"\u003eNitter\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere is also a web extension called \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/SimonBrazell/privacy-redirect\"\u003ePrivacy Redirect\u003c/a\u003e that automatically redirects twitter and instagram requests (among others) to the privacy-focused equivalents (as described above). I tried this for a bit, and it\u0026rsquo;s ok if you only use these sites in a read-only manner. But you can\u0026rsquo;t reply or repost, etc. And if I want to share something via tweet, it attempts to redirect the twitter dialog to nitter, which has no equivalent URL. I also logged an issue \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/issues/146\"\u003ere:trailing slashes on Nitter\u003c/a\u003e. Since I\u0026rsquo;m still using these sites on a read-write basis, I can\u0026rsquo;t use this extension myself, but maybe some of you may find it useful.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"gaming\"\u003eGaming\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIkoria is out on Magic Arena! I\u0026rsquo;ve done a few drafts already, you can check them out at the \u003ca href=\"/tags/mtgiko\"\u003eMTGIKO tag\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy Saturday gaming group recently switched our multiplayer game from Sentinels of the Multiverse to Armello. Quick review: It\u0026rsquo;s a fun, four player competitive board-game like where you try to beat each other to become king of a land of anthromorphized animals. I don\u0026rsquo;t think there\u0026rsquo;s a real-world board game equivalent for it though, some of the mechanics don\u0026rsquo;t seem feasible IRL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also thought about buying one of the Jackbox party packs so I could play online trivia with the quiz team, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten much positive feedback. And they\u0026rsquo;d all need Steam accounts so I could stream the screen to them, that\u0026rsquo;s a barrier. I\u0026rsquo;ll think about it some more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDivinity: Original Sin 2 is still my current ongoing RPG. Haven\u0026rsquo;t been playing it too often, but making some progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSite updates:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI added a link to \u003ca href=\"https://ko-fi.com/roytang\"\u003esupport me via Ko-fi\u003c/a\u003e, if you\u0026rsquo;d like. I don\u0026rsquo;t really expect anybody to use it, but maybe someone finds one of my posts useful and is generous? My expectations are low, so anything that comes through this channel will be a pleasant surprise.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve disabled the comment form from blog posts. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of spam that gets submitted, despite the Google Captcha. They don\u0026rsquo;t show up on the site since I have to review them, but it\u0026rsquo;s a mild annoyance. And for some reason, the spam comments tend to focus on specific posts, an example is the \u003ca href=\"https://roytang.net/2020/01/new-years-checklist/\"\u003e2020 New Year Checklist\u003c/a\u003e post. They used to focus on some older posts, but a while back I disabled comments on posts older than a year. I wonder if spammers share these links and are like \u0026ldquo;hey, this would be a good post to spam comments on!\u0026rdquo; Anyway: on a rare occasion some of my friends will comment via the form, but the majority of interaction with my posts these days is via bridgy webmention, so it probably wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth keeping around. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how that goes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no idea what to expect in the weeks to come. The future is so uncertain.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA while back one of the biggest leaks of personal information in history was made by hackers accessing the Commission on Elections database here in the Philippines. More than 50 million voter registration records, including information such as full names, date of birth, address, among others. A small percentage of the data leaked also included email addresses and even passport numbers. The hack exposed more than half of the country’s population to the possibility of social engineering and other exploits.\nIt was certainly a national embarrassment, especially for those of us working in software development. But the truth of the matter is that securing publicly accessible sites against determined bad actors is difficult, very difficult. It’s something that needs to be taken into account on all levels of the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t consider myself any kind of security specialist, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s something that software developers of all levels need to at least have a passing knowledge of, especially in this modern age where many tech companies store personal/private data for large numbers of users. I tend to classify the security practices and vulnerabilities under several levels:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePhysical / hardware layer - this means controlling the physical access of unauthorized personnel to hardware that contains private information. It would take serious levels of screw-ups for a system to be compromised in this manner, or perhaps a well-placed bribe. It is however, comparatively easy to detect any breaches in this layer. In any case, this is not really a concern for the software engineer.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eServer OS and local network level - this means that controlling the access to the actual OS running on the machine and the corresponding local network the server is on. Practically as bad (sometimes worse) than compromising the hardware layer, a compromise on this layer means the bad actor can access everything, possibly remotely, making it much more difficult to detect. Securing your system on this layer involves among other things making sure known vulnerabilities on your OS are patched or worked around and network access is restricted as needed. This is often the concern of people like network engineers or devops people who are setting up and securing your servers.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eApplication container level - this doesn’t necessarily mean your application itself, but typically websites and web applications will be running inside a container software such as a webserver like Apache, Tomcat, ISS, etc. Securing this layer is often just a matter of making sure the latest security patches are applied and known vulnerabilities are closed and access is restricted as needed. If this layer is compromised, the bad actors will typically have access to any files deployed in the container (which may contain other information that will facilitate further leaks). I also include here securing vulnerabilities in the database software used as your backend.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eApplication level - this refers to your security in the design of your application itself. Typically, problems in the first three layers above will be the responsibility of people setting up the servers and the server software, who are probably a different set of people than the development team. Concerns from this layer onwards are more applicable to the actual application developers.  Application-level security can be further broken down into several levels:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUser authentication - this refers to your application’s implementation of user login and session control, and management of things like passwords, password reset requests, two-party authentication, etc. If the implementation is poor, your application may have vulnerabilities like bad actors being able to identify your users’ usernames by enumerating login requests or being able to brute force their passwords.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFunctional security - this refers to how your application grants rights to each user as to which functions in the system he is able to access. As an example, in a typical system, normal users should not be able to access functions restricted to administrator users.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUser-specific Data security - this ensures that only relevant data for each user can be accessed by each user. For example, if I’m logged in as User ID = 1, I shouldn’t be able to view the data for User ID = 2 simply by changing a parameter such as USER_ID=2 in the URL.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDomain-specific security - this refers to additional security rules specific to the domain your application is involved in. For example, your security rules may demand that sensitive information can only be viewed by users with specific privileges and would need to be masked for other users. This may introduce some special logic in your program development.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLogging - applications typically log a lot of information to log files and audit trails, to facilitate debugging of problems and often also for statutory purposes. Security restrictions may require making sure that sensitive data is not included in the logs and audit trails.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCode level - this refers to security in coding practices in both the code used to write your application and also any third-party libraries or frameworks used by the application. This is highly experience-based and requires knowledge of the most common vulnerabilities as a result of coding practices. Organizations such as OWASP regularly publish lists of the most common vulnerabilities, many of them resulting from poor coding decisions such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, etc. Modern frameworks will typically provide standard ways for developers to minimize the chance of introducing the most well-known vulnerabilities.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDatabase level - this refers to security in the design of the database itself. Examples of concerns on this level are whether sensitive information is encrypted or hashed or whether financial data such as credit card information is stored in the database and secured appropriately (for credit card information specifically, there are standards laid out for managing credit card data that you have to comply with in order to be certified to handle credit card transactions). I guess I would also include in this layer how database backups and purged data are handled - are they backed up and encrypted separated from the main database? - although the protection of such backups may be outside the scope of the application developer.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThird party code - modern day applications use a lot of third party libraries and packages, not to mention code that developers are copying from StackOverflow. And rightly so - since using these dependencies means savings in effort and more productivity. But developers need to be aware of the cost every time we add a new dependency; not only are we dependent on that third party library working correctly, but also that it is generally secure. And if a security issue is found, will it be fixed in a timely manner? And this kind of thing can be difficult to track. There have been stories of websites being exposed to security breaches or even things like embedded crypto miners simply because they added a node.js dependency that had another dependency that had another dependency that was compromised. It\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing more senior developers on the team should be aware of and on the lookout for.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn modern settings, developers often specialize into roles like frontend and backend. And one might think that security concerns are limited only to the backend side, but one should not neglect security on the front end either. There are security concerns on the browser/JavaScript level as well, and you have to make sure that your frontend is aligned with the backend\u0026rsquo;s security paradigms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften times many clients will require that a third-party security audit will be done near the end of the project, and the development team will need to address any security concerns that come up during the audit. I’ve been on the receiving end of these a few times and I’ve found the companies doing them to be fairly thorough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s better for your dev team to be generally aware of security best practices from the very beginning, as it may be more costly to correct security problems towards the end of a project. It\u0026rsquo;s the kind of valuable tribal knowledge among developers that you can carry easily across projects and companies and tech stacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "title": "Bespoke vs Product Development",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eFor most of my time working on software projects, it has always been for bespoke projects. Bespoke basically means a software program or package tailor-made for a specific client. The client provides all the requirements, the team fleshes out more details and specifications, some prototyping may or may not ensure, and implementation proceeds thusly. It’s relatively straightforward compared to product development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI only started getting involved with “product”-like projects over the in the latter half of my career as a software developer. A \u0026ldquo;product\u0026rdquo; is a more general use software program or package, perhaps sold to the mass market or as a service. My experience is mostly with products that are targeted towards the public sector (government agencies and such) and not for general consumer use. Though I imagine many similar issues and pitfalls as I discuss here can occur in other types of product development as well. These are largely issues of \u0026ldquo;building for multiple clients\u0026rdquo; as opposed to \u0026ldquo;building for a specific client\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe project lifecycle is markedly different: you start with an idea for a product, perhaps based on something you’ve already built before, and shop it around to potential clients who could use such a system. A number of clients put out tenders for projects where they specify it has to be a pre-built product instead of a bespoke solution. Typically you use the requirements from these tenders to direct your development while you don’t have clients signed up yet. That’s right, you start development work ahead of time even when you don’t have clients signed up yet. These tenders typically have significant lead time before the actual implementation, so you kind of hope that if you somehow magically win with your proposal, you have everything (or at least most of it) done and in place and ready for the client.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTenders can also sometimes have a requirement to have a demonstration during the tendering process. Therein lies the first problem - since you probably don’t have the product ready yet, there’s probably some crunch time needed in preparing and setting up the demo. Some iffy code will need to be written, sacrificing code quality and maintainability in order to meet the timescales for the demo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, since you want to gain traction as quickly as possible, you try to shop around to as many clients as you can. That means you try to bid for as many tenders as you can, and different clients can have different requirements. This of course creates more problems for the development team in the form of conflicting requirements and even worse, possibly conflicting demo schedules. It’s something that management has to be cognizant of and the company will need to pick and choose its battles. Poorly handled, it could put a lot of pressure on the development team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was discussing this the other day with a younger developer working in another company. They were working on a project that was headed in this direction and he was asking whether things would get better once they have more things, and I kind of laughed a little bit before telling him there’s a good chance it would get worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem of conflicting requirements gets even more complicated when the clients are actually paying for your product because now you have even more responsibility to fulfill their custom requirements. One would think that if you were making an off the shelf product you’re not really subject to the whims of the clients too much, but when you’re trying to gain traction in an existing market you will sometimes need to make compromises to get clients to choose you over more established products, which probably means catering more to their whims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd really, even clients in the same space needing the same product will have their own requirements, idiosyncrasies and ways of doing things. Sometimes even when there are statutes in place dictating standards (like what data should be recorded and so on), different clients will still have different ways of meeting those standards such that your system may not be able to cater for all of the differences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, your product has been planned with such variations in requirements in mind. This means making your system flexible and/or configurable enough to handle any differences between clients, or at least changes can be kept small and manageable between clients. This assumes of course that you had the foresight to predict ahead of time what the differences would be and planned your system architecture accordingly, and that you didn’t have a lot of poor and hard-to-maintain code littered throughout your system because of needing to meet conflicting demo requirements! The more customizable your system needs to be, the more well-structured, modular and lightly coupled the code has to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you don’t have the above, well then likely you’re looking at introducing even more bad code and stretching your code base with code smells everywhere in order to accommodate tight deadlines and conflicting requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s also a lot more that would need to be customizable than you might expect. Some things that clients want tailored for their needs are: UI theme or individual UI elements; menu structures; field names and error messages; message/email/notification templates; access control rights; form layouts, what fields are included in each form, field validation logic; reports, what fields are included, and even retrieval logic. These are just some examples, there are many more that are difficult to foresee just how the clients might want them customized, so most likely even with the best-designed system there will still need to be some level of customization done for each client.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow to avoid such pitfalls? It helps if your product has a strong identity and design from the very start, but that means having a strong product manager or management team with a good understanding of the domain required for your system. The product manager will need to manage the clients’ requirements and the direction of future development. The product manager has to be able to assess the client requests and say “no, that’s not how our product works,” when faced with requests that will make things more complicated for the development team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe above are drawn from my personal experience and from a few other developers’. I’m sure there are ways to handle product development to avoid these problems of course, but I believe that far more projects encounter these difficulties than do not, but it mostly comes down to management understanding the concerns and making adjustments to resources and schedules accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It helped that nothing significantly newsworthy happened over the long weekend. (Well, there\u0026rsquo;s still thousands of deaths worldwide, but somehow our bar for \u0026ldquo;significant\u0026rdquo; has shifted quite a bit.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur lockdown has of course been extended to the end of April. I expect it will go beyond that though, likely the earliest chance for things to start going back to normal might be by June.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGot some consulting work done in the first half of the week, mostly setting up some automation for a client. Looks like they\u0026rsquo;ll have more to do for me next week so at least I\u0026rsquo;m keeping busy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso managed to do two online quiz nights again, doing more poorly this time, but still pretty fun. The second one was held last night (Black Saturday), and it was a team effort, so it involved our trivia team on an FB Messenger call while watching the quiz via FB live. FB Live sucks for this kind of thing due to lag, but we had fun (but still did not do well.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince it\u0026rsquo;s Easter Sunday and the folks haven\u0026rsquo;t seen their grandkids for a while, me and the bros set up a Zoom call so all the grandkids could see the grandparents, everyone all together at once. As could be expected, it was kind of chaotic, but also all kinds of fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"watching-lately\"\u003eWatching lately\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the weekend to watch a few movies, notably completing the Hobbit trilogy. This trilogy wasn\u0026rsquo;t as good as the LotR one (talk about high bar to meet right?), but pretty watchable in its own right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also watched The Departed, pretty intense movie. Gradually building up to watching the Irishman on Netflix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I watched this fantastic collaborative fan-made shot-by-shot remake of Back to the Future II put together during quarantine, featuring all kinds of ridiculousness: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcUUjWbVc4I\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcUUjWbVc4I\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheck the \u003ca href=\"/page/lists/2020/movies/\"\u003e2020 movies page\u003c/a\u003e for my commentary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, I also rewatched the last two seasons of Community (now surprisingly available on both Netflix and Prime Video at the same time!), mostly to prep for a trivia round, but also because it\u0026rsquo;s a fun underrated show and more people should watch it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome things of interest:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ai-art.tokyo/en#/\"\u003eAl Gahaku\u003c/a\u003e, an AI \u0026ldquo;artist\u0026rdquo; that takes an existing photograph and modifies it to look like a renaissance-style painting.

Nice way to present information for easier consumption by the general public.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"gaming\"\u003eGaming\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeen playing mostly Magic Arena (wasting my gold on \u003ca href=\"/2020/04/1248178769275256832/\"\u003ecube sealed\u003c/a\u003e, really fun), Divinity: Original Sin 2 (kind of a slow burn) and a bit of Megaman Legacy Collection (currently about halfway through Megaman 3).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal Fantasy VII Remake is out this week. I had a Deluxe edition preorder with our local game store, but given they\u0026rsquo;re all closed IDK how that\u0026rsquo;s going to work now. The store collected information from everyone who preordered so that they can give out info, but no updates yet. I suspect they\u0026rsquo;re going to try to set up some kind of delivery service, but don\u0026rsquo;t want to promise too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlas even if I could get my FF7R copy, I don\u0026rsquo;t even have my PS4 at home as it was borrowed by my brother in February. I was planning to get it back right before the FF7R release, but eh, life in quarantine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dug up some old draft blog posts that I never published, so I polished them up and we should have some new content for the coming week (other than these weeknotes).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than that, I\u0026rsquo;ve been considering re-organizing how this blog/site is organized. I was recently reading Kev Quirk\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://kevq.uk/why-i-dont-use-a-static-site-generator/\"\u003epost about why he doesn\u0026rsquo;t use a static site generator\u003c/a\u003e, it kind of tempted me to consider switching back to Wordpress. The main problem with Hugo running this site at the moment is that the build time is quite long, so feedback can take a while. (Still the same issue I \u003ca href=\"/2019/11/one-year-with-hugo/\"\u003ereported in November\u003c/a\u003e.) Anyway, I considered going back to Wordpress, and while that\u0026rsquo;s certainly a viable solution, there are some things that I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of doing that would be complicated to do in Wordpress\u0026rsquo;s data structure. Also, my gut doesn\u0026rsquo;t like the idea, although there are certainly some pros. I\u0026rsquo;ll need to think about this a bit more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeday, we\u0026rsquo;ll find our way back to the world we once knew, but it will have moved beyond us.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
