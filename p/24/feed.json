And by crash I mean the displays dying although the PC continues to run for a short while thereafter and after which they proceed to apparently stop operating completely. It only happens when playing games, and most often when playing Magic Arena and sometimes (rarely) when playing Starcraft 2 or Borderlands 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven that I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to try swapping out the video card just yet, and I had already tried doing all the driver updates during the previous episode, I decided it was time to try a more extreme approach. I was going to re-install Windows 10.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI say \u0026ldquo;extreme\u0026rdquo; even though reinstalling my OS is not something I wasn\u0026rsquo;t used to. Back in the days of \u003ca href=\"/2007/12/today-is-a-good-day-to-nuke-your-xp-install/\"\u003eWindows XP\u003c/a\u003e I used to reinstall my OS multiple times in a year, if not in a month. It\u0026rsquo;s only unusual now because Windows 10 managed to go four whole years without giving me even a hint of a bluescreen or any sort of issue like this, so props to MS for improving the stability of their OS. That being said, running an OS over such a long period means a significant amount of cruft has probably been installed and uninstalled and reinstalled over the years, with most of the details long forgotten which leads to a sort of OS rot. So in any case, I figured a reset was due anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did the research first, and apparently Windows 10 provides the reset option itself, I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to make an install USB or anything like that. And the reset happens \u0026ldquo;in place\u0026rdquo;, theoretically without needing to reformat your partitions or displacing your user files, which was good. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t put much stock in theory, so of course for safety, I had to make a backup first. If I had needed to reset Windows 10 two weeks ago I would have been out of luck because I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have had any space to backup critical stuff. Luckily, there was a bit of coincidental foresight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n    On \n    \u003ca href=\"/2019/09/1172359392714358784/\"\u003e\u003ctime datetime=\"2019-09-13 04:00:35\"\u003e13 Sep 2019 4:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n    I wrote:\n    \u003cblockquote\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eI had been waffling on getting a new external HD for a while, but a couple of days ago one of my friends posted about her backup drive failing at 6yo and I was like \u0026ldquo;all my drives are older than that\u0026rdquo; lol\u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo around last week I purchased a 2TB Seagate Backup Plus, so I had a bunch of space available for backups. Now, there is a generally recognized backup rule where any critical data should be backed up using a \u0026ldquo;3-2-1\u0026rdquo; rule; that is: 3 different places, 2 different media types, and 1 offsite. This is a bit too much for a home-based setup where my critical backups consist mostly of documents, family photos, mail archives, old chat logs and such, so I figured having two copies of the stuff I wanted backed up would be sufficient. One copy would remain on my secondary HDD on the desktop, and a second copy on my new Backup Plus. (And yes, that means I was living without the second copy before, which spoiler alert for the end of this story, was very dangerous.) In theory for anything that I didn\u0026rsquo;t mind backing up to the cloud for privacy reasons, I already had a third copy there via Google Drive and/or Dropbox, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t been too religious with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, backups created, we proceed with Operation Fresh Start:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#4a83c7ac30ee244d164999938df27714-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2019/09/1174123501470408704/EEtTGYIUwAAu1jV_hu370031b005503e42e8d76ab384a1fb83_19213_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"I am almost certainly going to regret this lol\" title=\"I am almost certainly going to regret this lol\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eI am almost certainly going to regret this lol (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"4a83c7ac30ee244d164999938df27714-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2019/09/1174123501470408704/EEtTGYIUwAAu1jV.png\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eI am almost certainly going to regret this lol\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"20 Sep 2019 12:00pm\"\u003e20 Sep 2019 12:00pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2019/09/1174123501470408704/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;20 minutes or longer\u0026rdquo; was pretty much a lie (or a programmer\u0026rsquo;s estimate, as you will), and it took more like half a day. But it went smoothly more or less. Afterwards I had to reinstall a bunch of software (more on that in the next post!). And then I tried using the PC for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince my main purpose was to avoid the crashing, the first test was running Magic Arena. Sure enough, no crashes since the reset, all the games finished smoothly etc. Pretty good!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow for the bad news: I was getting terribly slow read/write times on my secondary 2TB HDD. At first I thought there was some ridiculousness with Windows Explorer or other background processes gumming up the worst, so I booted into Ubuntu (using a USB boot drive) to see if copying from the disk would be better there. (Side note: I miss having an Ubuntu desktop, but discretion is the better part of valor, so maybe I won\u0026rsquo;t try to dual-boot it just yet). Sadly, Ubuntu told me there were some 40,000+ bad sectors on the 2TB drive (!) which meant it was almost certainly failing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily I had the foresight to do backups beforehand and got all the critical stuff. Or not. It turns out I forgot to archives a whole 20+ gigs of photos from my Mom\u0026rsquo;s old PC after that PC\u0026rsquo;s hard drive had died. And violating the backup rule, there was no other copy of those photos anywhere else!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe secondary drive was still there, so my first instinct was to power through and try to copy them off that drive but this turned out to be impractical as it was taking forever. Then I remembered that before using the old PC (which she inherited from me after I bought this current one), my Mom had been using a small ASUS netbook whose display had died. I confirmed with her that all the photos from the PC had come from that netbook, and happily I was able to boot it up and connect it to an old VGA monitor so I could copy her files from there. It took the better part of a day, but I was able to save most of her files. Whew! I\u0026rsquo;m backing these up to her Google Photos account as soon as she remembers to give me her creds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, the next problemw as what to do with my current desktop\u0026rsquo;s 2TB drive. A couple of consecutive chkdsk runs (both of which took more than a workday to finish) confirmed the worst: many bad sectors and many unreadable segments. It would certainly not be prudent to continue to use it, it had to be replaced. I considered just replacing with a 500GB SSD, but I needed the 2TB capacity. Not just for the critical stuff, but mostly for game installations as well and also I had been running a Plex media server off this desktop so there were a bunch of movies and TV series eps there. It was ok to lose them to a reformat, since most of them could be re-downloaded, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t go to a smaller capacity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really liked the idea of getting a second SSD though (to help with load times), so I considered getting both a 500GB SSD \u003cstrong\u003eand\u003c/strong\u003e a new 2TB HDD but this was a bit of an expensive option. Then I learned about the existence of so-called SSHDs or Solid State Hybrid Drives. Basically they\u0026rsquo;re normal HDDs except they come with a small SSD cache to boost read/write speeds for commonly-used files. Basically you\u0026rsquo;re getting something a bit faster than a normal HDD, but not with the capacity costs of a full-blown SSD. Not a bad idea, and I convinced myself to try it out. The 2TB Seagate Firecuda looked like a good SSHD to try out, and it was a quite a bit less expensive than my previous option of an SSD+an HD. I wanted to get one today!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, all the shops I called didn\u0026rsquo;t have any in stock, so I went ahead and ordered one from Lazada (slightly pricier). I\u0026rsquo;m a bit wary about ordering electronics online, because of warranty issues and such. But what the heck, I should risk my money every so often. Purchased! Ordering online meant I\u0026rsquo;d have to wait a few days for the delivery, so until then I have to live only with my primary 250GB SSD. Luckily this is sufficent to play Magic Arena and SC2 and write on this blog and SSH to work servers etc. I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to install most Steam games or download videos and such until the new drive gets here though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am hopeful that the failing hard drive was the cause of my recent gaming crashes and that replacing it solves the issue. All of the offending games were previously installed on the 2TB secondary so it\u0026rsquo;s a decent hypotheses. Both Arena and SC2 have been behaving since I moved them to the SSD, so signs are good. That being said, this HDD failure combined with the previous episode is pretty much an indication that my PC is getting on with age. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping it will last me a few more years still, but that is more the optimist in me than anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn summary:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ebackups good\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003egonna try out an SSHD\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epc might be dying.

It\u0026rsquo;s interesting enough not only on its own, but also for the discussion generated around any piece about qutting social media. I will admit I\u0026rsquo;ve been flirting with the idea myself, but that\u0026rsquo;s a topic for another day. Of particular interest to me at the moment is this comment about the article on \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20934675\"\u003eHacker News\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy biggest issue with social media is less that it\u0026rsquo;s distracting (IMO not necessarily an unhealthy thing) but that it has, for me, more than anything else seemed to make all aspects of my life a competition with others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Instagram, you\u0026rsquo;re competing with others on who has the happiest life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn LinkedIn, you\u0026rsquo;re competing with others on who has the steepest career trajectory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven on Twitter, perhaps more acutely in certain jobs or industries, it seems like you\u0026rsquo;re competing with other in gaining professional influence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt creates a lot of anxiety that stems from a feeling like you\u0026rsquo;re constantly on the verge of falling behind others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlenty of scholars/thinkers/philosophers have said something to the effect of focusing on just being a better version of you. Social media enables the exact opposite i.e. forcing you to constantly evaluate how you compare to others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt reminds me of my previous post \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/comparison-is-the-thief-of-joy/\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;Comparison is the Thief of Joy\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e. This kind of mindset is applicable to real life as well as social media, though I do agree that social media tends to exacerbate the problem. If you are the type of person who has this mindset, then yes it\u0026rsquo;s probably a good idea to reduce/control/filter your social media usage accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI generally don\u0026rsquo;t suffer from this problem, mainly because I outgrew comparing myself to other people a long time ago, but also because I tend to aggressively filter my social media channels so that I\u0026rsquo;m only seeing content from people that are of interest to me. I wonder sometimes about those people who whine that Twitter is so toxic or some such complaint. Don\u0026rsquo;t they know they control the kind of people who appear in their feed? Why are they following toxic people? (I understand that this may be more of a problem that is difficult to control once you get to higher follower counts, but hey that\u0026rsquo;s the price you pay I guess.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhat related: Our 25th high school reunion is coming up next year, and this early our batch has a thread about High School Reunion Anxity (HSRA). Here are some excellent words from a batchmate that I thought were good to share (removing some stuff specific to this person and the batch, since the post was to a private group. Will happily cite the original poster if she requests it):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0026rsquo;re not alone. It\u0026rsquo;s common to feel a lot of anxiety about attending a high school reunion. Our 25th at that. Kasi ohmaygad ganyan na ba tayong katanda?!\n\u0026hellip;\nThe second common barrier to attending is HSRA. Mostly because you might feel your life didn\u0026rsquo;t turn out the way you wanted and that other batchmates have done so much better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo 2a - your life didn\u0026rsquo;t turn out the way you wanted. You know what? My life didn\u0026rsquo;t turn out the way I wanted. \u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m willing to bet nobody\u0026rsquo;s life turned out exactly the way they planned. And that\u0026rsquo;s OK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2b - other batchmates have done better. OK so please for your own mental and emotional health do NOT compare other people\u0026rsquo;s external stuff (visible on Facebook, Instagram, etc) to your internal stuff. That\u0026rsquo;s illogical and bad science. Also will drive you crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n",

A couple of weeks ago, a friend pointed out that I might enjoy playing the recent Jeskai Nuneca decks that had become popular recently. I checked out a sample decklist, and you bet I jumped at the chance to play Mulldrifters again lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe set about to gather the cards. Since we almost never sell cards, even draft chaff, we had most of the cards available already. The only exception was red elemental blasts/pyroblasts for the sideboard and some extra Archaemancers which we ended up getting from a shop. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have Ash Barrens (apparently a pauper staple), and didn\u0026rsquo;t want to bother looking, so I made do with extra common fetches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the pauper deck to my first event today, completely blind to what the meta was lol. I figured I\u0026rsquo;d just enjoy the event and see how the deck plays and what the meta is like.

expect, since it was pauper I expected it to play a bit more like a limited format compared to Standard or Modern. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The format is diverse with a lot of different decks and most of the matchups are highly interactive. I wish I could say I placed well too, but after a couple of good matches, I folded to some misplays. Here\u0026rsquo;s the match record:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR1 2-0 vs MonoU Faeries/Delver\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR2 2-0 vs RG Madness\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR3 1-2 vs U/B\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR4 0-2 vs Boros\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR5 0-2 vs MonoU Faeries/Delver\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made one misplay in R3 when I agreed with my opponent\u0026rsquo;s assessment that both my spellstutters would die after he disfigured them both. We later agreed that one of them should have survived and two of this spells should have been countered. I also made a mistake when I allowed my R5 opponent to Snap his own Spellstutter to counter my Preordain when I had a Standard Bearer on the board. This is a result of not playing this card since Apocalypse! Lol. A few other minor mistakes in sequencing in the other games, but nothing too major. And I needed better sideboard plans, since I almost never knew what to pull out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving forward, I might play a bit more of this format, at least it provides a fun and cheap alternative to Modern for paper Magic!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I am aware of the existence of Pauper as a format in MTG, but I never paid too much attention to it before. A couple of weeks ago, a friend pointed out that I might enjoy playing the recent Jeskai Nuneca decks that had become popular recently. I checked out a sample decklist, and you bet I jumped at the chance to play Mulldrifters again lol.\nWe set about to gather the cards.",

I\u0026rsquo;m new to procreate so I\u0026rsquo;m still learning the features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder if you could give me some advice. One thing I learned here is that there is a feature like when you draw in a circle then hold the pen in place for a bit, it will automatically \u0026ldquo;smooth\u0026rdquo; the circle. However, when I tried doing this, I can\u0026rsquo;t get it to work consistently. The main problem is that I have unsteady hands, so when I hold the pen in place to do the smoothing, there is often still some slight movement so I guess this is why I can\u0026rsquo;t trigger it consistently. Would you know if there is any workaround or alternative for someone like me?\u003c/p\u003e\n",
