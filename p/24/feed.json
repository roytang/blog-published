            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eSo a couple of days ago, Yahoo announced that it was shutting down \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8xwe9p/yahoo-groups-is-winding-down-and-all-content-will-be-permanently-removed\"\u003eYahoo Groups\u003c/a\u003e. I was a big user of Yahoo Groups back in the day. I was a member of several active mailing lists in the early 2000s, including some fandom groups (see: \u003ca href=\"https://roytang.net/2018/10/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-final-fantasy-forum/\"\u003eThe Rise and Fall of the Final Fantasy Forum\u003c/a\u003e) and a few alumni groups and some \u003ca href=\"https://roytang.net/tags/mtg/\"\u003eMTG\u003c/a\u003e-related ones. Now all of that content is vanishing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I hate losing content to the sands of time, I immediately looked at my options for archiving my Yahoo Groups content. Groups like archive.org are working to archive publicly-accessible groups, but most of the relevant ones for me were private groups, so I had to do things myself. Yahoo itself provided a link to a \u003ca href=\"https://help.yahoo.com/kb/groups/download-data-privacy-dashboard-sln28671.html\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;data privacy dashboard\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e which could supposedly export your data, but it\u0026rsquo;s ridiculously useless. It only exports your subscribed groups and your preferences for each group. None of the relevant things like messages, files, photos, etc. Yahoo also provides a page with instructions on how to \u0026ldquo;download your files and photos\u0026rdquo;, but it basically only says to go to the web interface and download them one by one, also ridiculous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked instead to an open source \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/andrewferguson/YahooGroups-Archiver\"\u003earchive script written in Python\u003c/a\u003e that I could easily modify for my own needs. I made a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/roytang/YahooGroups-Archiver\"\u003efork with my own changes\u003c/a\u003e. The only change to the main script was to continue processing when an error 500 was encountered. The original script terminated processing at this time, assuming you had been rate-limited. But manual checking revealed that Yahoo Groups was throwing the error because there were some messages it simply could not retrieve for whatever reason. I simply removed the script-ending line so that the processing could continue after an error 500. I also added a separate script to download group photos, since the original only downloaded messages. (More on that later.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-to-archive\"\u003eWhat to Archive?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to only archive groups where I had actively sent messages myself for a period of time. I was a member of some public developer-oriented groups that I never really participated in, so those were out. I also decided to archive messages, files and attachments for the relevant groups. There\u0026rsquo;s this one group where I was only active for maybe a few months in the early 2000s, but the group itself stayed semi-active for up to a decade, so I ended up archiving more than a 100k messages from that group, most of which were not personally relevant to me. Well, it\u0026rsquo;s not like these archives take a whole lot of space, so I\u0026rsquo;ll keep them for now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"files-and-photos\"\u003eFiles and Photos\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned, the original python script only exported messages but I wanted files and photos too. I was a bit more selective for the files and photos and only chose to archive from those groups that were more personally relevant to me. (i.e. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get the files/photos for that 100k-message group mentioned above). Luckily, the relevant groups didn\u0026rsquo;t have many files. It would have taken longer to write a script to do it, so I just manually downloaded files one by one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhotos were a different matter. A couple of the relevant groups had too many photos to bother downloading one at a time, so I ended up doing the method of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0026ldquo;load the webpage and scroll down until you have all the photos\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esave the html\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003erun a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/roytang/YahooGroups-Archiver/blob/master/archive_photos.py\"\u003epython script\u003c/a\u003e to parse the HTML, store the metadata and download the full-res photo\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"wrapping-up\"\u003eWrapping up\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t have that many groups so I only ended up with around 300MB (compressed) total worth of messages, files and photos archived. I stored them in my usual archive places (cloud storage, a couple of external HDs). Most of that (maybe 80%) is that really big group too, so if needed I can dump most of those messages later. Someday I may do a further deep dive or analytics of all this archived YG data, who knows what I\u0026rsquo;ll find! (Spoken like a true digital pack rat.)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The text is as it was submitted and unedited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt started innocently, with a comment on a post I had made on a physics message board I frequent. I had discussed the various commonly known theoretical approaches to time travel, and how most of them were dismissed as possibilities due to new discoveries, empirical evidence, or contradictions in the equations. I had concluded by saying that given the current state of known physics, time travel was most likely impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commenter, one Damian Butler, had written:\nDo you really consider time travel impossible? Don’t you think the Weismann-Roth conjecture might apply when you consider an N-dimensional space? Depending on the circumstances of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about this for the rest of the day and replied that night as to why it seemed unlikely for such a set of circumstances to occur. It led to a long thread where Damian kept pushing some questions about how I disproved the various theories. A few other physicists joined in to provide inputs. I woke up the next day to find that I had received a private message from Damian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey, sorry if this is weird. But I looked through your message history. You’re Sadie Brown from the Tieling Institute right? I’m a grad student at the university nearby. You want to grab a coffee sometime and let me pick apart your time travel ideas some more? :)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t think much of it. Don’t meet up with strangers from the internet right? But later I reread the late night exchange. He had raised a lot of interesting points. There was a hint of insight far beyond an ordinary grad school student. I messaged him that I would be on campus the next Saturday and we could meet up then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so we did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I first met Damian I didn’t notice the horns on his head. They were rather small. Aside from that he looked like the rest of us normies who can’t afford to get adventurous with a DNA resequencer. The short stubby horns barely poked out from the sides of his forehead, almost completely covered by his wavy black hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You barely show those. What’s the point?” I had asked him then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a style thing, he said. He wasn’t into those gaudy full-body changes. Not like those types who have scales all over their arms or the hairy freak conversions. Resequencing was expensive, so most people wanted to show it off. A status symbol for the ostentatious or the daring. Minor changes like horns weren’t usually worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamian was different. He had wanted something simple, unobtrusive yet noticeable once you pay attention. He didn’t want to stand out in a crowd, but he wanted people to remember him after a short conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized immediately how gifted Damian was. For a grad student, he was well-versed across multiple fields of physics, in many cases surpassing my own knowledge. We started seeing each other regularly after that. Not in a romantic way. He didn’t seem interested in that. It was the intimacy of scientific peers. He proved an important sounding board for my research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is it someone as young as you knows so much about physics?” I asked him once. He seemed hesitant, but he told me that science ran in his family. He preferred to keep our discussions to the work, so I avoided probing into his personal life too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout two months after we met, the distortion in Antarctica was discovered. I was the top of my field in particle physics at that time (or so I’m told). I was asked to go there and study it. I also had to pick a research partner. Damian was an easy choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had never expected to become a scientist. I was a hard worker, but I never had the brilliant intuition for scientific discovery that others had. More than once he had jokingly offered to pay for the resequencing to improve my intelligence. Unlike me, Damian wasn’t a hard worker. He was sort of an impatient genius, his mind always flitting from one subject to another. I was the type who always kept notes and made sure we stayed on track. Our team worked well. He provided the bursts of genius. And me? I provided the hard work to bring that genius to fruition, I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe distortion was unprecedented. It was an energy field sustained across a wide open area around a hundred and fifty meters across. It caused electronics and other finer instruments within it to go haywire. Most significantly, time passed differently within the field. Damian and I were just one of two dozen research teams from different countries who came to Antarctica to study the phenomenon. Barriers had been set up around the field’s outer limits, and the research teams regularly conducted experiments on the field’s nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe knew from initial reports that humans could pass through the field safely, but as time went by that changed. The field’s strength fluctuated, but it was growing stronger. Soon it became necessary to wear radiation suits near and inside the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe always knew the research was dangerous. The field’s energy readings were exotic and unpredictable. But Damian was reckless, determined to prove himself. Always pushing forward with an urgency I hadn’t seen during the talks we had back at the university. I repeatedly reminded him about the limits of our experiments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Enter, put the items in the field and get out in 30, got it. Don’t worry so much!” He had said it so casually on that day. But no matter how routine the experiments had become, there’s always room to be careless. We were measuring the effects of the field on different chemical substances. Some isotopes reacted differently than others. It was Damian’s turn this time to bring the items into the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that time I was in our tent at the edge of the field checking our instrumentation and lab space. Damian was already in the radiation suit well into the field. As I went through the supplies I realized that the tray of samples Damian was supposed to be carrying had been left in the tent. I quickly picked up the communicator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damian, get back here. That’s not the righ\u0026ndash;”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the sensor readings went wild. A sudden burst of energy flowed out of the field like a wave. The explosion that followed took everyone by surprise of course. But I was the one closest to the blast. I was knocked off my feet, my vision was blurry, and my ears were ringing. I could barely tell what was going on. I don’t remember falling unconscious, but I’m pretty sure my last thoughts were of Damian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I woke up, I asked where Damian was. I wasn’t aware of my own injuries, which turned out to be minor. They told me that the distortion field was gone. Dissipated in a burst of energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamian was nowhere to be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one else was in the field at that time. There were no other casualties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was discharged quickly. The first few days, I was distraught. I didn’t know what to do. Damian didn’t have any family, as far as I knew. I didn’t have anyone to contact. I tried to talk to someone at the physics department at the university but they told me they never had anyone by the name Damian Butler in the department. Distress turned into anger. Had Damian been lying to me all this time? He was so well-versed in the science lore I hadn’t bothered digging too deeply in his credentials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked through his belongings at the base station. Among his documents or identification, nothing stood out as a clue as to his real identity. At the bottom of his suitcase however, I found a leather-bound notebook. It seemed he had a liking for pen and paper, unusual in this day and age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thumbed through the pages. They were filled with equations and diagrams and theoretical physics proofs, many of them covering the topics we had discussed. He had never been the note-taking type. On some pages he had scribbled in red marker on the notebook’s margins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2/27 Finally got a chance to talk to Sadie Brown in person. She’s everything I expected her to be. Hopefully the hints I gave her will be helpful once she encounters the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFebruary? This was when we first met. How had Damian known about the field? I flip ahead a few pages until I find another note in the margins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5/11 The discovery of the Antarctic Rift has been made public. As I hoped, Sadie chose me to be her research partner. This might be my only chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow? And what did he mean by “his only chance”?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next few pages were filled with notes about the experiments we conducted on Antarctica. I thought I had been thorough with my own digital notes, but Damian had painstakingly transcribed everything: energy readings, time, background noise, weather, and so on. There were some computations he had inserted among the measurements, some of the equations were unfamiliar to me. Finally I found the next note in the margins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7/9 So far the rift has been dormant. Unexpected. History tells me that the incident happens in a bit more than a month, but the field doesn’t have enough energy for that to happen. Perhaps something happens to jumpstart the process?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is impossible, I tell myself. How could Damian\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the notebook’s last page, in hastily scribbled red ink, I read Damian’s last words to me, dated the day before the incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8/14 Sadie, if you’re reading this, then either I have successfully jumped, or I am dead. In either case, I apologize for lying to you. And for switching the items in the last experiment. You deserve to know the truth. As you may suspect from reading the past entries, I am a time traveller. I was stranded in this timeline six years ago and have been searching for a way back ever since. Luckily I still remembered a bit of my history, enough to know that in this era Sadie Brown takes the first steps towards practical time travel. Imagine my surprise to find out that it would be me who would be the trigger for the Antarctica incident. Of course I don’t remember my own name in history, so I assume that you will keep my involvement secret. I thank you for all your help throughout the past few months, and hope that I was helpful to you as well. This may surprise you, but I met you before, when I was very young. You were very old then of course. I barely remember the meeting, but my mother told me many times that you were very happy to meet me. You were especially pleased with the name your great-grandson had been given. I will always cherish our time together. Yours thankfully, Damian Brown.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I’ve had this post in the works for a while, and it kept getting longer and longer (possibly my longest post to date). I also had my friend \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DavidRamirezSFFwriter/\"\u003eDavid\u003c/a\u003e review it first to make sure I wasn’t saying anything too ridiculous, and he and I discussed some of the things and some of his points made it into the final post.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve basically lived all my 40-odd years in Metro Manila (barring maybe at most half a year total spent outside the Metro). I started commuting around when I was 10-11 years old, so that’s around 1989ish. Jeepney fare then was I think P1.50? Maybe that was the student fare. I remember it took two rides to get to my elementary school so I needed P6 for a round trip. The minimum fare these days is P9, so the increase has been 600% in 30 years. Probably still a bit too low, as jeepney drivers are still quite poor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring GS, HS and college I rarely ventured too far from home (schools were always nearby) and mostly stuck to Quezon City. I only got to go to the other Metro cities when someone else was driving me there for some reason. I do remember one time I had to take a late night bus ride home from Paranaque during HS, it was my first time commuting in a fully-packed standing-room only bus. For the most part, I didn’t care too much about traffic growing up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still remember when the MRT3 opened up (Wikipedia says this was in ‘99), I took a ride during the first week just to go to Robinson’s Galleria, I think, for no reason. I was amazed because the train made it so much easier to go to Ortigas which before that had seemed very far (even back then the buses were always full). I remember thinking back then that the MRT3 had effectively reduced the space between cities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2003, I got a job in Ortigas in Pasig, around 13-14km from home. Not too far, and the commute route was a reasonable 45-60 minutes most days (and 30 mins on really good days). I took the MRT most of the time to Ortigas, as I still have some notes from around that time telling me it was a 1500-step walk from the MRT station to my office. North Avenue station was the first station on the North side, so although there was often a queue, it was reasonable and it wasn’t too hard to get on a train. On the way home from Ortigas, I’d prefer the bus. Since Ortigas was in the middle of the route, the MRT would be quite full by the time it got to Ortigas station, so the bus was easier and I’d often get to sit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracking my social media, I can tell I started complaining about the \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/roytang/status/22969325502\"\u003eMRT\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/roytang/status/11074462310\"\u003etraffic\u003c/a\u003e around 2010 onwards. Most probably the build-up to the problem started a few years before that, in the later half of GMA’s term. Traffic and commuting and the MRT had gotten constantly worse since then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I left the Ortigas job in late 2015, I had to allocate somewhere around 2-3 hours for travel time, and even then I’d still occasionally be late. Even today, Google Maps tells me driving that distance at around 10am would take around 3 hours. MRT lines famously grew to be sometimes a kilometer long during rush hour at North Avenue. This was the line to get into the station! By this time I usually preferred taking an FX to ortigas, but that queue usually took at the minimum 30 mins to \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/roytang/status/242417436496896000\"\u003e1 hr\u003c/a\u003e, possibly longer. By this time I had also started taking taxis and ubers where possible (I had the privilege of being able to afford more expensive rides), but even this was quite difficult..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoincidentally (or not), the traffic troubles coincide with the continuous years of economic growth since the time of GMA. Then-President Noynoy Aquino famously \u003ca href=\"https://ph.news.yahoo.com/aquino-traffic-sign-booming-economy-110430239.html\"\u003epointed out this correlation\u003c/a\u003e, a bit of a tone deaf remark politically (in response to the complaints about traffic), but he was not incorrect. The big problem with the improved economy is that like elsewhere in the world, the gains are not evenly distributed, most of the economic gains went to big metropolitan areas like Metro Manila, which means people are still incentivized to work and move here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis would not in and of itself have been a problem if the government managed Metro Manila well and scaled up infrastructure as needed to anticipate the economic growth. It’s not just the current admin or the previous admin or the local governments that’s dropped the ball, it’s basically everyone in the national and local governments since the 80s. This catastrophic traffic was \u003ca href=\"https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/10/08/19/palafox-traffic-fixes-8-lrt-lines-edsa-long-walkway-no-more-mm-govt-offices\"\u003epredicted at least 40 years ago\u003c/a\u003e yet not much has been done.

I’m not a city planning expert or anything, just a layperson giving some suggestions that I think are reasonable and/or common sense, and probably better than coming up with inane ideas like “coding by car brand” or suggesting that people just wake up earlier to get to their destinations or denying that we have a mass transportation crisis. The solutions I suggest here are not intended to be a “be-all, end-all”, but perhaps can be the starting point of discussions. And, I know that given the implementation track record of our government this may be difficult, but spitballing solutions to these problems also requires perhaps not a little bit of optimism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShort-term solutions\u003c/strong\u003e: It’s sad to say this, but I don’t believe there are any viable short-term solutions. None that can cause widespread relief from the traffic problems anyway. Most of the systemic solutions will be on a timeline of 5 years or more, and will definitely cost serious money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOn a personal level\u003c/strong\u003e, the best thing any individual could do would be to adapt his own situation as much as possible. If your commute is in the order of 2-3 hours or more per direction, I would strongly suggest looking for a better arrangement, either look for a job closer to home, rent a place closer to your work, or ask for WFH privileges. I realize that not everyone can afford these changes, but sometimes you’ll be surprised at what you can afford.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find that people are often quite bad at evaluating tradeoffs in time vs money, with a general preference towards money. For example if you’re working in an industry like mine (software development) where the salaries are generally higher than the average in the Metro, there’s a good chance you can afford to pay a bit more for rent or accept a lower salary if it brings you closer to home. But many people will refuse that tradeoff because for them money is the most important thing. Never mind that you’re wasting 5-6 hours daily in traffic. If money were really that important to you, consider spending it to save maybe 3-4 hours of travel time and use the extra time to freelance online and earn more money. Being stuck in traffic doesn’t earn you more money, it takes away your time and your energy and your mental health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEmergency powers\u003c/strong\u003e: I actually don’t mind giving the government emergency powers to the government to help speed up procurement timelines and such, but senator Grace Poe has a point when she says the \u003ca href=\"https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/09/14/1951678/grace-poe-emergency-powers-ok-if-backed-master-plan\"\u003eDoTr has to at least provide a specific plan/outline\u003c/a\u003e as to how they are going to use those emergency powers, instead of just granting them a blank check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMove jobs and labor out of Metro Manila\u003c/strong\u003e. Or at least out of the major business districts (Makati, Ortigas, Taguig). Of course, the government can’t force businesses to move to less congested areas or outside the Metro altogether, but perhaps the economics can be made to favor moving out. The problem with this is that labor and capital are caught in kind of a loop: capital wants to establish offices where the labor market is so they prefer the business districts and are willing to pay higher salaries there; labor wants to work where the salaries are high and there are many options so they prefer those areas too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne common suggestion I see (on reddit, etc) is to \u003cstrong\u003eincrease the minimum wage in the provinces to reduce the flow of labor to Metro Manila\u003c/strong\u003e. This is a reasonable first step, although it affects mainly the lower-skilled workers. For example, if a construction worker could be paid the same rate in his home province as in MM, he would be less inclined to go to MM. For higher-skilled work this can be a challenge, since it requires that those companies move or establish offices in the provinces, and increasing salaries run counter to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might be also good to incentivize (provide tax breaks or benefits) things like:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCompanies that provide work from home days for their workers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCompanies that provide shifting or flexible hours to avoid rush hour\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCompanies that establish in less populated regions (PEZA incentives, but more widespread)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCompanies that provide relocation assistance for new hires in less populated regions (so they live closer to work)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAffordable housing in major business areas\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the problem with incentives like these is that not only are they revenue-negative, they also add to the administrative burden, i.e. more work is involved to make sure the incentives are going to the right companies. I think it would probably be a simpler approach to \u003cstrong\u003ejust disincentivize (i.e. tax) companies that have offices in major business areas\u003c/strong\u003e, to discourage further congestion in those areas. The additional tax rate can be made to scale according to the number of employees the company has, so as not to penalize smaller businesses, and the more you contribute to congestion, the more you pay. This has the added benefit of raising money for the needed infrastructure improvements elsewhere. It should be a national government imposed tax (so the cities can’t muddle with it), though the local governments can be asked to help in collections to simplify effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMove government offices out of Metro Manila.\u003c/strong\u003e While we can’t force companies to move out of Metro Manila, there is one big employer that we can just order to, and that’s government. As an example, just near where I live, there’s the Department of Agriculture, Department of Agrarian Reform, Bureau of Jail Management and Prisons, National Housing Authority, etc. There’s no reason these offices have to be in Metro Manila; heck for the DA and DAR it’s probably better to have their main offices closer to the farmlands. There’s also camps like Camp Crame and Camp Aguinaldo. I can see an argument for having the civilian police headquarters in the metro (but probably not smack-dab in the middle of EDSA), but why the military headquarters? Many of these government facilities aren’t in the more congested business districts, but the more we can reduce the overall population of Metro Manila, the better. And moving them to the provinces has the benefit of adding jobs to those areas too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInfrastructure:\u003c/strong\u003e Obviously MM needs a lot more of everything: more trains, more train lines, bridges across Pasig River, etc. The focus should be on improving mass transportation options instead of more roads or routes, since those \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/10/23/6994159/traffic-roads-induced-demand\"\u003ejust incentivize people to drive more\u003c/a\u003e. We as a country are hopefully on a path to continue economic growth, so our infra needs to be better able to scale up with that growth, and that means mass transportation. This is already a well-known thing, I’m not saying anything new here, the bigger problem is that the governments take forever to implement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSubway:\u003c/strong\u003e I am cautiously optimistic about the planned subway from Quezon City to Taguig. David is worried that it will likely be flooded a lot of the time, and that’s much more costly than just an equivalent above-ground rail line. I think the major difference is that the above-ground rail line would have more right of way issues so it may take longer to complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBikes:\u003c/strong\u003e It would be a big change culturally, but if we really want the city to be able to support larger populations, we have to promote usage of bikes. That means developing bike lanes and bike-friendly roads bike-friendly parking and having companies provide work lockers so people can change and not be smelly after biking to work. Having a bike culture would be a much more efficient use of road space and also improve the health of the population in general and be very eco-friendly. Much better than our current trend of more and more motorcycles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMass transportation:\u003c/strong\u003e we need more, not less. As a lifelong commuter I cringe whenever I find private car owners complaining that PUVs are causing all of the traffic and there should be fewer of them on the street. Try commuting during the rush hours when it’s difficult to get a ride and see if you still have that sentiment. It’s true that PUV drivers need a lot more discipline, but the solution there is to revamp the business model of those services to avoid having the drivers behave that way. The boundary system has to be the single biggest cause of PUV traffic problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJeepney (and Bus) Modernization:\u003c/strong\u003e I support the goals of jeepney modernization, though in general I think the government is going about it the wrong way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack when we lived at our grandmother’s house, our next-door neighbor was a jeepney driver. I like to think that he owned his vehicle (it was always parked at their house), but for all I know he was paying a daily boundary somehow. He ran the Project 2-3 route along Kamias/Anonas, and sometimes he’d recognize us kids when we get a ride on his jeep, and he’d refuse to accept our fare. There is a romanticized notion of the jeepney driver as the serial pull-up-by-your-bootstraps informal entrepreneur, symbolic of Filipino genius and creative expression with all their decorations, and I think such a thing would be fine in smaller municipalities. For a large, densely crowded beast like Metro Manila, it’s simply not an approach that scales, and it’s time to move on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePublic transport is a public good\u003c/strong\u003e. I believe transport routes should be treated similar to services like water or power. A single service provider, chosen through a competitive bidding process, would serve each area or route/set of routes. If you’ve tried any of the good public transportation systems in other cities like Singapore or Hong Kong, you know this is how it works. Public transport routes are a centralized service, not run by individuals cowboys jostling with each other for riders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn’t propose to immediately replace existing jeepney and bus operators with such service providers. It’s ridiculous to think such a transition could be done in a one-time, big-time manner. I would choose a few pilot routes/areas where we can introduce the new service providers. They can initially be competing alongside the existing PUVs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe service providers could propose the initial fare rate themselves as part of their bids. One of the criteria for the competitive bidding process would be that the rates must be reasonable. Competition with the existing routes would also hopefully keep the rates in line. Rate increases would be subject to approval by a regulatory commission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn theory, each route/area being monopolized by a single service provider means each driver no longer needs to compete with other drivers on the next route. But we’ll need strict SLAs in place to make sure the service is being provided as expected. The franchise grant should impose certain requirements such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEuro-4 compliant engines\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efixed salaries, benefits and no commissions for drivers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePrioritize existing drivers of the same jeepney routes when hiring\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eobservance of fixed stops.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMinimum of X vehicles in the field during lean hours and minimum of Y hours during rush hours (as defined by government - need to conduct studies on the optimum numbers for each route).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePenalties for traffic violations by their drivers (with some leeway)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnd so on\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther factors such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewhat kind of vehicles to use (maybe subject to branding guidelines and maintenance standards)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehow much to pay the drivers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecan be left up to the service providers, for them to balance vis-a-vis their proposed rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would however prefer we get higher capacity vehicles than just the 20-22 passengers that jeepneys today can support. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking something like the public buses/shuttles used in Hong Kong or Singapore. I believe they are smaller than the city buses we have on EDSA, so they can navigate our narrower streets. Maybe prescribe a minimum passenger capacity for vehicles? Actually I would assume the economics are in favor of more capacity (since it means each trip can earn more money), so it might happen naturally. Of course not all routes would be able to support such buses, so maybe only where it makes sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this scheme, we may end up with transport fares slightly higher than what we have now. Probably closer to FX rates really. And honestly, it’s a bit anti-poor, but I think it’s something we have to live with. One of the big reasons the jeepney modernization plan is hard to pull off is because the current fares mean that drivers earn very little for a day’s work. At least this way the market determines the initial rates and the drivers don’t have to live in abject poverty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned, we pilot the program on a few routes, and then we can observe the first few routes for a maybe 3-6 months. Are there enough vehicles servicing the route? Are drivers earning enough money? Has traffic worsened? Then adjust the parameters for the next set of routes. We should aim to strike a balance between low fares and reasonable income for the drivers and service providers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the goals should be to make it attractive for existing drivers to switch over to working for the service providers. And also slowly wean people away from using jeeps. Same process could be applied to buses too. Franchise grants can be relatively short so that non performing suppliers can be replaced easily. Once the public gets used to the new service, we can phase out the old jeepneys on a per route basis. (Not all the old jeepney drivers will want to work for the service providers, alternative livelihood assistance may be needed for them)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePremium transportation options:\u003c/strong\u003e Senator Grace Poe (her again?) was derided recently for a suggestion to have “business class trains” in the MRT to encourage the upper class to take public transportation. Trying to do this in the MRT now is ridiculously impractical (which is why she was derided for the suggestion). However, I do agree that having premium transportation options available to the more affluent might be a good idea. It can still help to reduce the number of cars on the road. I’m especially fond of the P2P buses that were introduced to the Metro a few years back. They’re a lot more expensive than regular buses, but they’re comfortable and as long as it’s not rush hour, there’s not much of a queue. I often take a P2P bus where available. Maybe more routes are in order? Perhaps along the hopefully soon-to-be-finished North-South skyway?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePort congestion is also an issue\u003c/strong\u003e that contributes to the traffic as well. A lot of trucks are needed to carry the cargo offloaded in the port of Manila to the provinces. I would suggest developing other ports North and South of Metro Manila and diverting as much of the port traffic there as possible. I know we already have some existing nearby ports such as the port of Batangas, but AFAIK there’s still a lot of cargo traffic from outside Metro Manila passing through the port of Manila. The goal should be to minimize that. David also suggests developing freight rail lines from the port of Manila to provincial hubs. Freight rail can fast track cargo shipments instead of relying on trucks which add to traffic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOptional:\u003c/strong\u003e Another issue with Metro Manila is that it’s composed of different fiefdoms, er, cities. Each of them have their own jurisdictions and traffic rules and so on. This is unnecessary and contributes to the chaos. I would suggest \u003cstrong\u003ehaving a centralized authority managing transportation issues\u003c/strong\u003e in MM. Something like how Transport for London manages transportation in the greater London area. This body would be responsible for things like:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emanaging service providers, rates, traffic rules\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eenforcement\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003econducting studies\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eproposing solutions\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eand so on.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe traffic management duties of the MMDA can be absorbed by this new body. This requires taking away some autonomy from the local governments, so it requires legislation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stark reality is that no matter the denials, we are in the middle of mass transportation crisis in Metro Manila and will probably remain that way for the foreseeable future. We may get some short-term relief from some projects that may finish in the next couple of years (North-South Skyway, etc). But in the long term there is much, much more that we need to do to turn Metro Manila into a sustainable megacity. The idealist in me still hopes we can get our act together and somehow get there. Like I said, a reasonable amount of optimism is needed. We shall see, shan’t we?\u003c/p\u003e\n",
