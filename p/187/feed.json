Unfortunately, when I clicked on the link, it no longer existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, I still think it’s worth sharing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewritingadvice: by Chuck Palahniuk\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn six seconds, you’ll hate me.\u003cbr/\u003e\nBut in six months, you’ll be a better writer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom this point forward—at least for the next half year—you may not\u003cbr/\u003e\nuse “thought” verbs. These include: Thinks, Knows, Understands,\u003cbr/\u003e\nRealizes, Believes, Wants, Remembers, Imagines, Desires, and a hundred\u003cbr/\u003e\nothers you love to use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe list should also include: Loves and Hates.\u003cbr/\u003e\nAnd it should include: Is and Has, but we’ll get to those later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil some time around Christmas, you can’t write: Kenny wondered if Monica didn’t like him going out at night…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, you’ll have to Un-pack that to something like: “The\u003cbr/\u003e\nmornings after Kenny had stayed out, beyond the last bus, until he’d\u003cbr/\u003e\nhad to bum a ride or pay for a cab and got home to find Monica faking\u003cbr/\u003e\nsleep, faking because she never slept that quiet, those mornings, she’d\u003cbr/\u003e\nonly put her own cup of coffee in the microwave. Never his.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of characters knowing anything, you must now present\u003cbr/\u003e\nthe details that allow the reader to know them. Instead of a character\u003cbr/\u003e\nwanting something, you must now describe the thing so that the reader\u003cbr/\u003e\nwants it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of saying: “Adam knew Gwen liked him.” You’ll have\u003cbr/\u003e\nto say: “Between classes, Gwen had always leaned on his locker when he’d\u003cbr/\u003e\ngo to open it. She’s roll her eyes and shove off with one foot,\u003cbr/\u003e\nleaving a black-heel mark on the painted metal, but she also left the\u003cbr/\u003e\nsmell of her perfume. The combination lock would still be warm from her\u003cbr/\u003e\nbutt. And the next break, Gwen would be leaned there, again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn short, no more short-cuts. Only specific sensory detail: action, smell, taste, sound, and feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypically,\u003cbr/\u003e\nwriters use these “thought” verbs at the beginning of a paragraph (In\u003cbr/\u003e\nthis form, you can call them “Thesis Statements” and I’ll rail against\u003cbr/\u003e\nthose, later). In a way, they state the intention of the paragraph. And\u003cbr/\u003e\nwhat follows, illustrates them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example:\u003cbr/\u003e\n“Brenda knew she’d never make the deadline. Traffic\u003cbr/\u003e\nwas backed up from the bridge, past the first eight or nine exits. Her\u003cbr/\u003e\ncell phone battery was dead. At home, the dogs would need to go out, or\u003cbr/\u003e\nthere would be a mess to clean up. Plus, she’d promised to water the\u003cbr/\u003e\nplants for her neighbor…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you see how the opening “thesis statement” steals the thunder of what follows? Don’t do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf nothing else, cut the opening sentence and place it after all the others. Better yet, transplant it and change it to: Brenda would never make the deadline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThinking is abstract. Knowing and believing are intangible. Your\u003cbr/\u003e\nstory will always be stronger if you just show the physical actions\u003cbr/\u003e\nand details of your characters and allow your reader to do the thinking\u003cbr/\u003e\nand knowing. And loving and hating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t tell your reader: “Lisa hated Tom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, make your case like a lawyer in court, detail by detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresent each piece of evidence. For example:\u003cbr/\u003e\n“During roll call,\u003cbr/\u003e\nin the breath after the teacher said Tom’s name, in that moment before\u003cbr/\u003e\nhe could answer, right then, Lisa would whisper-shout ‘Butt Wipe,’ just\u003cbr/\u003e\nas Tom was saying, ‘Here’.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the most-common mistakes that beginning writers make is leaving their characters alone. Writing,\u003cbr/\u003e\nyou may be alone. Reading, your audience may be alone. But your\u003cbr/\u003e\ncharacter should spend very, very little time alone. Because a solitary\u003cbr/\u003e\ncharacter starts thinking or worrying or wondering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example: Waiting for the bus, Mark started to worry about how long the trip would take…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA better break-down might be: “The schedule said the bus would come\u003cbr/\u003e\nby at noon, but Mark’s watch said it was already 11:57. You could see\u003cbr/\u003e\nall the way down the road, as far as the Mall, and not see a bus. No\u003cbr/\u003e\ndoubt, the driver was parked at the turn-around, the far end of the\u003cbr/\u003e\nline, taking a nap. The driver was kicked back, asleep, and Mark was\u003cbr/\u003e\ngoing to be late. Or worse, the driver was drinking, and he’d pull up\u003cbr/\u003e\ndrunk and charge Mark seventy-five cents for death in a fiery traffic\u003cbr/\u003e\naccident…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA character alone must lapse into fantasy or memory, but even then\u003cbr/\u003e\nyou can’t use “thought” verbs or any of their abstract relatives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, and you can just forget about using the verbs forget and remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo more transitions such as: “Wanda remembered how Nelson used to brush her hair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead: “Back in their sophomore year, Nelson used to brush her hair with smooth, long strokes of his hand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, Un-pack. Don’t take short-cuts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetter yet, get your character with another character, fast.\u003cbr/\u003e\nGet them together and get the action started. Let their actions and\u003cbr/\u003e\nwords show their thoughts. You—stay out of their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd while you’re avoiding “thought” verbs, be very wary about using the bland verbs “is” and “have.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example:\u003cbr/\u003e\n“Ann’s eyes are blue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ann has blue eyes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVersus:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ann coughed and waved one hand past her face, clearing the cigarette smoke from her eyes, blue eyes, before she smiled…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of bland “is” and “has” statements, try burying your details\u003cbr/\u003e\nof what a character has or is, in actions or gestures. At its most\u003cbr/\u003e\nbasic, this is showing your story instead of telling it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd forever after, once you’ve learned to Un-pack your characters,\u003cbr/\u003e\nyou’ll hate the lazy writer who settles for: “Jim sat beside the\u003cbr/\u003e\ntelephone, wondering why Amanda didn’t call.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease. For now, hate me all you want, but don’t use thought verbs. After Christmas, go crazy, but I’d bet money you won’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(…)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this month’s homework, pick through your writing and circle every “thought” verb. Then, find some way to eliminate it. Kill it by Un-packing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, pick through some published fiction and do the same thing. Be ruthless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Marty imagined fish, jumping in the moonlight…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nancy recalled the way the wine tasted…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Larry knew he was a dead man…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFind them. After that, find a way to re-write them. Make them stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ndash;\u003cp\u003eThanks Hiraku!
