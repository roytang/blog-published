I knew it was sci-fi, but that was about it\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd it turned out to be some really good sci-fi too. Simmons introduces new concepts and the history of his universe and human society quickly and unapologetically. Even the prologue bandies around the terms Hegemony and Ouster with little explanation save what we can glean from context. Most of it is expounded upon and elaborated in the short stories which comprise the majority of the book.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe short stories tell the tales of each of the pilgrims making their way to the far off world of Hyperion to face their death before a time-defying god. It seems that each story follows and develops a different aspect of Hyperion\u0026rsquo;s universe: the first one tells us about religion and space travel and colonisation, the second talks about military life, and so on. My favorite was the scholar\u0026rsquo;s story: although the preceding parts of the story make the ending especially predictable, how he gets there is told incredibly well and you can feel the sadness and despair of his situation\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe disappointing part of the book however was the ending, which seemingly just drops the story like a rock. The last story to be told doesn\u0026rsquo;t even explain why the pilgrim wanted to return to Hyperion, and we do not get the climactic meeting the rest of the book has been leading up to. I understand that the story was actually split into two books, and that I would have to read the succeeding book Fall of Hyperion to get any payoff, but I wish it had been handled better\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn spite of that, I liked it. And maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll pick up the sequel too. Some really good sci-fi and world-building and storytelling with a disappointing ending.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/18436248-roy-tang\"\u003eView all my reviews\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI like to say that software development is a challenging career because no two projects are ever the same and there are always new challenges to face and new concepts to learn, but the truth of the matter is a bit more complex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWriting software is about breaking down large problems into a series of very small technical problems for which we already have solutions.\u003c/strong\u003e Examples of small enough technical problems include list sorting, comparison, arithmetic operations, path traversal, string concatenation, returning a string as an HTTP response, rendering text to the screen, retrieving submitted parameters from an HTTP request, and so on. Any given non-trivial software project will be broken down into thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands of such small tasks, some occurring more often under different contexts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe job of the software developer designed to implement such a program or some part of a program is to identify all those tiny tasks and the order in which they need to be done, then actually do it and put it all together in a way that satisfies the software\u0026rsquo;s requirements. Finding out the proper arrangement of tasks is a form of design in and of itself, separate from the design of the software requirements. This is why many programmers will tell you that coding itself is both design and implementation \u0026ndash; the coder still has to make numerous small decisions, rearranging code and tasks until he finds the correct arrangement that works to satisfy your needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInvariably, practically all of these tiny tasks are either trivial to implement (based on knowledge the programmer already has), or have already been implemented somewhere else by some other programmer. This is why Q\u0026amp;A sites such as \u003ca href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/\"\u003eStack Overflow\u003c/a\u003e are very useful for the modern programmer \u0026ndash; you simply dip your pool into the communal knowledge of the programming community and most of the time the programmers who have solved the same problem before will tell you how they did it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Practically all\u0026rdquo; means in the rare instance, you will still encounter problems that as far as you can tell have yet to be solved by anyone else in the world. I am unsure if there is anything quite as depressing to the programmer as finally finding a single Google hit about that one problem he was unable to solve only to find that it was a link to his own unanswered Stack Overflow question from months before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften this happens when you are doing something or some combination of things so obscure no one else has tried it before, or when you are legitimately blazing new ground. It largely depends on the field you are working in \u0026ndash; if you are using proven frameworks to build your 10th web application, most likely 999 out of every 1,000 problems you have are already solved. On the other hand, if you were maybe writing drivers for a new piece of hardware, or maybe writing a new framework to be used at the same time as the first application using it, that number shoots up considerably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat to do when faced with such a situation where all the sources you consult \u0026ndash; mentors, experts, textbooks, the internet, and so on \u0026ndash; are unable to help you solve the problem and it stops you from moving forward? Well, if you can sense that trying to solve the problem on your own or brute forcing it in some manner may waste a lot of time that you can\u0026rsquo;t afford, you should remember what I said above: **Writing software is about breaking down large problems into a series of very small technical problems for which we already have solutions. **This means your first choice should be to check first if there is an alternative arrangement of tasks for which that particular problem could be avoided (that is, \u0026ldquo;re-design your code to work around the problem\u0026rdquo;). You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t box yourself into a particular sequence of steps, be willing to \u0026ldquo;think outside the box\u0026rdquo; to look for other solutions that while not immediately obvious, may be more feasible (i.e. \u0026ldquo;already solved\u0026rdquo;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis method of iterating the arrangements of parts until the software works might seem a bit clunky, but I\u0026rsquo;ve found it useful to think in this manner \u0026ndash; it makes even the impossible problems seem feasible. Now, if only problems with humans could be solved just be rearranging things\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It took a few years for the Philippines to catch on, \u003ca href=\"http://www.interaksyon.com/infotech/philippine-internet-connection-turns-20-years-old-this-month\"\u003ethe first internet connection in the country was only set up in 1994\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy personal experience with the internet came a bit later, during our freshman year in University, sometime in the schoolyear 1995-1996. Around that time a couple of friends and I would walk out to this computer shop along Katipunan avenue that had internet access. Computer shops weren\u0026rsquo;t prolific back then, and most of them offered only document editing and printing services. They didn\u0026rsquo;t even have LAN gaming back then, as DOOM had only come out the year before and Starcraft was just a gleam in Blizzard\u0026rsquo;s eye. This particular computer shop we trekked to had 2-3 terminals with internet access, which at that time we mostly used to browse anime-related websites and fanfiction (RIP \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime_Web_Turnpike\"\u003eAnime Web Turnpike\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInternet usage grew quickly in the succeeding years. A couple of friends got internet connections first. One of them lived near the University so a bunch of us happened to hang out there often, not just for internet access but also to read manga and watch anime. We jokingly referred to his house as \u0026ldquo;the Entertainment Capital of UP Village\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forget when we got our own internet connection at home. I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember the provider we used. We stuck with one of the monthly plans for a while, but also went through a period of trying out prepaid internet access plans (RIP ISP Bonanza) and sometimes even hacking a free email service to also give me internet access (RIP Edsamail). It was the days of dial-up modems and beeping sounds, when piracy consisted of arcane commands issued in dark IRC channels. (The first time I got pirated music wasn\u0026rsquo;t off the internet however \u0026ndash; for some reason I had gotten an MP3 of Oasis\u0026rsquo; Wonder Wall on floppy disks. Yes, multiple disks).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from the piracy and the fanfiction, the internet was a treasure trove of information. I quickly learned the usual web development skills \u0026ndash; HTML and CSS were relatively easy, and I had a geocities website set up back in the day, a strange green-text-on-black-background kind of thing (I was never particularly good at web design). My email address for most of the university years was a Yahoo one (RIP Yahoo 2016), which I often used to join discussion groups on various geeky topics like video games and anime and what not \u0026ndash; these days we have reddit for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, internet in the Philippines has come a long way and is a big part of daily life for most people. There\u0026rsquo;s still a lot of improvement to go \u0026ndash; broadband here is still very expensive and very slow compared to other countries and there is no real competition yet, something hopefully to be solved soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was your first encounter with the internet?\u003c/p\u003e\n",
