Their album has several good tracks (since I don\u0026rsquo;t listen to radio, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure which of them are popular or not.) My favorites are \u0026ldquo;Jeepney\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Lunes\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;22\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Partisan\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Dragonfly\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Jillian\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;KLSP\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; um, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty close to naming the whole album :p.

My favorite Sugarfree track is from their first album though \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Burnout\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course there\u0026rsquo;s Rivermaya\u0026rsquo;s new single \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll Be Safe Here\u0026rdquo;. Pretty good, Rico Blanco is really good with the lyrics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor live performances, I posted a link to the \u003ca href=\"http://www.alphaquam.com/live/index.php\"\u003eAlphaQuam Live Music Archive \u003c/a\u003eon \u003ca href=\"http://del.icio.us/roytang\"\u003edelicious \u003c/a\u003ea while back. They have this great performance of \u0026ldquo;Careless Whisper\u0026rdquo; by Ben Folds and Rufus Wainwright. If you want more rock-type sounds, try Vertical Horizon\u0026rsquo;s live rendition of \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re A God\u0026rdquo;, complete with Top Gun intro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, and one song that\u0026rsquo;s been on LSS for me all day: \u0026ldquo;King of Pain\u0026rdquo; by Sting.

            "title": "Games: Legend of Zelda -- Minish Cap",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThe last Zelda game I played (as in, to the end) was Link To The Past, and I think it was on David\u0026rsquo;s old SNES. Or it may have been on ZSNES, I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sure anymore. Before that was the first Zelda, which I actually finished on its original console!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeems that the years have been kind to the Zelda formula: Octoroks and Tektites on the world map, Bats, Skeletons and Wizrobes underground, Boomerangs and Arrows to throw about, Pieces of Heart to collect, Swords, Bottles, hidden passages, name it, it\u0026rsquo;s all here. I miss Dodongo though. :p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing to note about the Zelda series\u0026hellip; they\u0026rsquo;re really good with level design, and the use of space. The overworld of Minish Cap is a good example. The land of Hyrule is relatively smaller this time around compared to Link To The Past, but the game mechanics of having the ability to occasionally shrink to insect-size and the ability to unlock new areas with kinstone fusions mean you\u0026rsquo;ll be visiting most areas several times, making the most of the space. Of course, there\u0026rsquo;s the usual Zelda mechanics of passageways hidden by bombs, secrets accessible only with the use of tools, etc. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s just that I haven\u0026rsquo;t played a Zelda game for so long, but I\u0026rsquo;m just amazed at how much stuff they can pack into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe puzzles were ok, the usual block puzzles and stuff. Nothing too difficult, but not too easy either. I wish they had put some super-difficult puzzles for optional sidequests though. (The sidequests here mostly rely on collecting kinstones.) I think something along the lines of Lufia II\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;World\u0026rsquo;s Most Difficult Trick\u0026rdquo; would have been nice. I was particularly disappointed by the \u0026ldquo;walking\u0026rdquo; puzzles in the final dungeon, where you have to walk over a certain set of tiles continuously without repeating any tiles. The two such puzzles I encountered were straightforward. Why introduce that type of puzzle if it was going to be so easy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoss battles were ok, with some difficult ones being the Octorok in the Temple of Droplets, and any battle that needed me to split into four. I guess the clone battles would have been easier if I had gotten the \u0026ldquo;fast spirit bar charging\u0026rdquo; upgrade thingy. The final boss was moderately difficult, but then again I only had two bottles. With four bottles I might have started yawning. :p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was in college and had more free time, I would have surely completed everything there was in the game, but these days, I just finish it and be done with it. (Same with Star Ocean 3, I only managed to beat one optional dungeon and boss.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall Minish Cap is a good game, as I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure every Zelda is. The designers are still pretty good, not many boring parts in the game (the figurine thing was boring though\u0026hellip; mainly because the interface was so tedious.) Made me wish I had had a chance to play the N64/GC outings.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

At least the MRT guys have the excuse that they have to deal with droves of people at a time; There are mall entrances where they barely glance at your stuff in a routine manner; you could be sneaking in a decapitated human head in a plastic bag and they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t notice.

Instead it made a wonderful churning noise that made me quickly hit the eject button. This is Sony\u0026rsquo;s best form of copy protection: In my experience, our PS2 can only play somewhere between 30% \u0026ndash; 50% of all pirated discs out there. I don\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026hellip; it may just be our PS2 model. Sometimes if I particularly like a game, I will buy 2-3 pirated copies until I find one that agrees with our PS2. This is why I have 3 copies of \u003ca href=\"http://roytang.net/blog/2005/01/games-star-ocean-till-the-end-of-time/\"\u003eStar Ocean: Til The End Of Time\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaruto 2 \u0026ndash; failed. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the disc. I tried searching through all the PS2 DVD cases we have, but I was unsuccessful. In the average pinoy techie\u0026rsquo;s house, there would be hundreds of audio CDs, VCDs, data CDs and DVDs, many of them pirated. Finding one specific disc outside of its case is a nigh-impossible task. Going out and buying a new (pirated) copy would be far easier \n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnotebase-1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf piracy is so problematic, why use pirated discs? Because frankly, the alternatives are roughly 10 times more expensive. At least. This is especially true for PS2 games; last I checked PS2 games retail for around 4000 pesos around here (more than 80 dollars) By comparison, PC games retail for roughly the correct dollar-equivalent prices. \n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnotebase-2\"\u003e[2]\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt should be noted that I have NEVER bought original PS2 games \n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnotebase-3\"\u003e[3]\u003c/a\u003e\n, while I have bought several original PC games.

The astute Pinoy gamer would note that the price of even PS1 titles is still roughly around 3000-4000 pesos, which makes no sense at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder what compels store owners to sell PS2 originals at these prices? Are there so many piracy-conscious console owners that they are able to fuel such a high demand for PS2 originals that result in high prices? Who buys at these stores?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t know why games (and digital media in general) have to be the same cost or more expensive in a third world country where people obviously have less money than developed nations. Of course, I am not saying we are entitled to lower prices because we are poor. But don\u0026rsquo;t companies who sell these consider that selling to citizens of developing nations at lower prices would be better than the zero sales caused by high prices/piracy combination?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the future, I may be more compelled to buy console originals online, especially if I can find good deals on used copies. Well, at least as soon as I become more confident about buying things online.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Space-faring lad gets stranded on backwards-planet, gets involved and suddenly gets thrust into a conflict against the Creator that threatens the existance of the very universe. The usual sort of thing. There\u0026rsquo;s a giant plot twist somewhere in the second disc that changes the very nature of the Star Ocean universe and guarantees that this is, in fact, the last game of the series. Actually, in retrospect, the plot is fairly okay, but it could\u0026rsquo;ve been pulled off better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gameplay is where it\u0026rsquo;s at of course. As well know, RPGs are about gameplay, not story. \n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-5\" id=\"footnotebase-5\"\u003e[5]\u003c/a\u003e\n Gameplay-wise, the single best feature of this game is: Battle Trophies! Battle Trophies are awards granted to you for certain things done in combat, such as avoiding certain spells, winning with no damage, winning by tiny slivers of life, etc. Many boss battles have associated battle trophies such as \u0026ldquo;Defeat so-and-so in 1 minute\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Defeat so-and-so without taking damage.\u0026rdquo; Accumulating battle trophies means unlocking higher difficulty levels, extra costumes and extra modes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other good things carry over from Star Ocean 2. The real-time battle system is the same, with a bunch of improvements. The Fury gauge stops battles from being a button-bashing-fest, and the anti-attack auras add some tactical element to the battles. Damage bonuses for chaining together special moves are neat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eItem Creation is still here, but the system is vastly different from SO2. Instead of just crafting items yourself anywhere you are, you can hire inventors to work for you in workshops throughout the world. You can work with them of course, in an assembly line fashion that shows your characters going through various experiments to make stuff. However, I greatly miss that feature of Star Ocean 2\u0026rsquo;s Item Creation where you are shown a blob of some sort of raw creation material that slowly but surely transforms into a wonderful item. Losing that feature sort of removed the joy of item creation. =p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are however, some bad things about this game. Mostly minor nitpicks actually. The most important one is this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe menu interface for the battle arena sucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeriously, everytime I go to fight the ranking battles, I have to go through three or four menus. One to ask whether I need to be given a tutorial. One to choose what type of battle I want to fight. Before I beat the champions, I get asked whether I want to fight them. One where I choose the opponent for my battle. The one with the tutorial really ticks me off every time I see it. I\u0026rsquo;ve already read the tutorial! Must you ask me every single time? Would you like fries with that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally, the \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d like an explanation\u0026rdquo; thing could just be placed in the second menu. I should only have to decide two things: One, I want to fight a ranking battle; and two, I want to choose my opponent. Single battles or team battles are slightly worse, as you must choose your fighter and your difficulty level in addition to the above choices. I wonder how hard it would have been to make a simple menu system for the arena, instead of relying on the conversation system?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realize this is a really petty thing to note, but when you start playing the battle arena, you have to go through those menus repeatedly every two or three minutes. It got annoying fast. And don\u0026rsquo;t get me started on those bunny races\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other bad thing is: bad endings. Well, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting much given that the story wasn\u0026rsquo;t that good anyway, but eh? The general ending wasn\u0026rsquo;t much more than \u0026ldquo;Hey, we\u0026rsquo;re still alive! Cool!\u0026rdquo;, and the individual endings were a bit sleepy. Or maybe it was just the lackluster music playing during the endings?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall though, a decidedly good game, one I\u0026rsquo;m going to try to finish at least two more times, and a worthy end to the Star Ocean series. Looking forward to Tri-Ace\u0026rsquo;s next series\u0026hellip;  \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

That\u0026rsquo;s when I started the site on \u003ca href=\"http://topcities.com\"\u003etopcities \u003c/a\u003esome time back. I moved some of the \u0026ldquo;journal\u0026rdquo; posts I had from there into blogger, using a very detailed process I shall refer to as \u0026ldquo;manual copy-and-paste and editing of links\u0026rdquo;. I still had some backup copies of most of the old site around, and \u003ca href=\"http://www.archive.org\"\u003earchive.org \u003c/a\u003ewas a big help. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t much editing actually, I just went through most of the links and marked those which were broken. I didn\u0026rsquo;t transfer (yet) any posts which needed additional files to exist on my own server, those are a bit more troublesome, so later. All in all, the content of the posts are presented as they are, or were, typos and all, making these archives a genuine representation of my frame of mind circa 2002.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe purpose of this exercise is of course for posterity. Putting all these posts in one place makes it easy for me to export them in some method in the future. (And even if blogger goes down for some reason, these posts are now also hosted on my fateback account, and you know there\u0026rsquo;s safety in redundancy.) So, past memories safely preserved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, that\u0026rsquo;s what a journal should be about right? Something that lets you look back into the past, to see what B*S you were trying to put out back then. Online journals are roughly ten thousand times more exciting than private ones; if you\u0026rsquo;re honest enough (i.e., you don\u0026rsquo;t edit out any embarassing stuff from old posts), there\u0026rsquo;s always the tendency for something from the past to come back and bite you in the ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an example, in the last post I made a comment about how I may have pissed my dentist off. It\u0026rsquo;s a funny story actually. I wanted to post, but was in too much tooth-pain to think clearly; so after the tooth-pain cleared, I decided to \u003ca href=\"http://roytang.net/blog/?p=93\"\u003epost about it\u003c/a\u003e. (Note to future self: even if you move to a different server, keep the fateback account, so these permalinks would still actually work.) About a week after that, I sent an email to my dentist, (wow, I exchange email with my dentist, I\u0026rsquo;m like, so cutting edge, for 1999) and she read the blog entry. She mailed me back saying the post \u0026ldquo;knocked her off her chair\u0026rdquo;, or something. I emailed back, saying it was just an exaggeration, hoping I didn\u0026rsquo;t piss her off. She hasn\u0026rsquo;t responded yet though (and I haven\u0026rsquo;t needed any dentist-time lately), so I conclude that there\u0026rsquo;s a distinct possibility I may actually have pissed her off. I\u0026rsquo;ll found out when I need to get this impacted molar removed, I suppose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, anyway, yeah. Coming back to bite you in the ass. And for this reason, I\u0026rsquo;m hesitant to let anyone at work know about this blog. (At least one person at work knows it exists, but does not know the location) My long-term memory is a bit stupid, I may have inadvertently said something here that may be bad for me professionally, I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure. And of course I have no idea how a certain someone would react to me publishing on the internet my feelings about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat am I saying? Am I going to be more circumspect in the future, and avoid anything that may get me in trouble? Hell, no. Although I did breifly consider taking down the \u003ca href=\"http://roytang.net/blog/?p=64\"\u003eUnrequited\u003c/a\u003e post, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I should stand for what I\u0026rsquo;ve written. No matter how bad, sappy, or stupid it was, it\u0026rsquo;s my work, I should just take it for what it is. Hence bringing back the old posts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHmm\u0026hellip; I really only wanted to post that I was bringing back the old posts. I talk a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Added the comments thing, made it a bit more public. My favorite post of this year: \u003ca href=\"http://roytang.net/2004/11/my-eyeglasses-belong-to-the-sea/\"\u003eMy Eyeglasses Belong to the Sea\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeriously, I think I\u0026rsquo;ve changed a lot this past year. Especially due to the first entry above. Personally, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve broadened my horizons somewhat, I feel stronger, better as a person, more confident in myself. I\u0026rsquo;m a lot less antisocial now, and heaven forbid, I actually greet people in the office in the mornings and before I go home! Professionally, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve accomplished a lot as well. I learned a lot of new things; I\u0026rsquo;m a Web developer now, although my area of expertise is now apparently Oracle Reports; Participated in a lot more projects than I did in 2003, learned a lot of new stuff; Became a trainer for several batches of newbies (I think half the office calls me ‘Sir\u0026rsquo; now\u0026hellip; ); had my first ON, etc. All in all, a very productive/fruitful/exciting year was 2004.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the future? What does 2005 hold for our brave not-so-young hero?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried thinking up some New Year\u0026rsquo;s resolutions, but, as many intelligent folk know, resolutions suck. Sure, they probably have some motivational value, but if you really know what you want, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t need the end of an arbitrarily-decided calendar year to start. So, in lieu of resolutions, I present the following list of things-I-might-have-resolved-to-do:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBlog every day. This was a good idea, but I figured forcing yourself to do something regularly _just for the sake of it _was not a good thing. I\u0026rsquo;ll blog when I have something to say, thanks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLearn to cook/bowl well. This sounds neat. But the real problem with me trying to learn new skills outside my comfort zone is that they tend to eat up goof-off time. But I _want _to learn new things. So, for this one, I\u0026rsquo;ll do \u0026lsquo;em if I can and I feel like it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLearn PHP/mySQL and use dynamic stuff for this website. This is an easier proposition, since it\u0026rsquo;s something that falls well within one of my areas of interest (coding). However, I already code a lot at work, so I\u0026rsquo;m not really that motivated to code outside of work. I think I may be able to do this to some degree or other though.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBroaden my horizons. Do new things. Visit new places. This is a good idea. And I hope I can do it some. But I won\u0026rsquo;t resolve to do it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s it I guess, let\u0026rsquo;s see what 2005 has in store for us. Bring it!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I\u0026rsquo;ve just realized that Christmas is a rather stressful season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one thing, there\u0026rsquo;s the multitude of Christmas gatherings one has to attend. With family. With relatives. With friends. With friends of family. With coworkers. With coworkers who are friends. It\u0026rsquo;s not that I don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy myself at these gatherings mind you. In fact, lately I\u0026rsquo;ve found myself enjoying the company of other people more. It\u0026rsquo;s just that I\u0026rsquo;m not yet an entirely social person, and too many social gatherings too soon somewhat stretches the limits of my comfort zone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristmas is stressful. Everyone is busy, busy, busy. Going from place to place apparently, as the traffic has been horrible lately, with jams stretching well into the early morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of early morning, I left work close to midnight last night. We\u0026rsquo;ve been in crunch mode for the past two weeks or so, what with multiple deadlines coming up in January. Not that I can\u0026rsquo;t handle of course. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that every other developer in one of my projects is going to be on vacation next week. Since I\u0026rsquo;ve had to run on pure genius these past few days, and as side effect, I was often more loud, sarcastic and smarmy than usual. To anyone who was annoyed by this, I apologize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the highlight of my last day of work before Christmas? Sometime before dinner I wrote a love letter and sent it by email to \u003ca href=\"http://roytang.net/blog/?p=53\"\u003eher\u003c/a\u003e. Nothing much, just telling her some things I wanted her to know, and greeting her for the holidays and stuff. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting anything back, but I guess I got lucky. A few minutes before I left the office, I got a jabber message from her. To paraphrase:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003eher: boo!\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher: thanks for the lovely letter :)\nme: I\u0026rsquo;m glad you liked it. my christmas is complete :)\n\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was more of course, a small exchange of pleasantries and even more holiday greetings. But I got that warm, fuzzy feeling again. Maybe Christmas this year wasn\u0026rsquo;t so bad after all. =)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHappy Holidays!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
