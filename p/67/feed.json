It\u0026rsquo;s a fantastic read for anyone who grew up playing PC games during the 80s and 90s. It gives us a birds-eye view of what the burgeoning gaming industry was like back then, not just with the technical and business aspects, but a lot of the human aspects as well: there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of drama, conflict, and betrayal to go around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book\u0026rsquo;s narrative does a good job of contrasting the Two Johns: Carmack was a programmer, a technical wizard who pushed the boundaries of game programming where no one else dared go. He was interested purely in the programming and in the creation of virtual worlds and preferred a smaller, leaner, ruthlessly efficient company focused on making the most of his technology. Romero was a gamer first, and an ambitious and competitive one. He was the number one competitor on their own deathmatch games and dreamt of building a gaming empire, living the life of a rock start among the gaming community as the front man of id software. Together their complimentary skill set would take them through a dizzying rise to fame and fortune in the game development world as they blazed new trails, defined new genres, and inspired a new generation of competitors. At the same time, their differences would ultimately cause them to go down different paths \u0026ndash; knowing full well in advance how the story ended for their partnership made me turn the pages quicker as I dreaded the inevitable split.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a gamer since the late eighties, and though I never considered myself particularly good at first-person shooters, I did play most of the games that comprised id software\u0026rsquo;s wonder years \u0026ndash; Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Doom II, Quake and Quake II. I will freely confess I mostly used the build-in cheat codes to just fool around in most of these games, although I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I finished Quake II\u0026rsquo;s single-player campaign legitimately. We didn\u0026rsquo;t have good internet back then, so the only opportunity I ever had to play Deathmatch back then was split-screen on a console at a friend\u0026rsquo;s house, even then it was helluva fun. Post-Quake II, I never played FPSes much again, though I did enjoy reading about John Romero and Ion Storm and was looking forward to their promised RPG Anachronox and only later heard about what a failure Daikatana turned out to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still have this lingering dream of breaking into game development somehow. Though I\u0026rsquo;m not envious of the death march crunch mode periods typically described in the book, I am a bit envious of what a huge advantage it was for geniuses like Carnack and Romero to have been at the right place and time for the nascent games industry to turn them into legends. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;d have had the technical chops to compete with them if I had the same opportunities, but I surely would have given it a go. I consider myself closer in temperament to Carnack than Romero \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;m more interested in the technical side and could probably use some help in the promotion and game design and level design stuff. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;ll ever actually get there, but I take solace in this quote from the penultimate chapter of the book:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n    Carmack disdained talk of highfalutin things like legacies but when pressed would allow at least one thought on his own. \"In the information age, the barriers just aren’t there,\" he said. \"The barriers are self-imposed. If you want to set off and go develop some grand new thing, you don’t need millions of dollars of capitalization. You need enough pizza and Diet Coke to stick in your refrigerator, a cheap PC to work on, and the dedication to go through with it. We slept on floors. We waded across rivers.\" \u003cbr /\u003e\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e",

The combat system is basically Pokemon. So yes, it\u0026rsquo;s Ghibli+Pokemon. Pokemon in this game are called \u0026ldquo;familiars\u0026rdquo; and each party member can have up to 3 familiars ready to fight in battle. The party members can fight directly as well, but most of the time it\u0026rsquo;s a better idea to let your familiars go at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can imagine, the grindiest part of the post-game was collecting all the familiars. Ok, not all of them, the achievement only required 250 different species captured, but that\u0026rsquo;s a helluva lot. During the normal main game run, I only captured a bit less than 100 different species. It was made more grindy by the fact that there\u0026rsquo;s no mechanism for trying to capture the familiars (i.e. pokeballs), you basically just have to beat them in battle and whenever you beat one, there\u0026rsquo;s like a 2-8% chance that you will get an opportunity to recruit it. Thankfully, you can shortcut the grind a bit by collecting the lower level ones and using metamorphoses (basically pokemon evolutions) to get the higher level ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story feels like it\u0026rsquo;s targeted towards children, so it has a kind of fairy tale feel, and the world is very bright and cheerful (mostly) and there\u0026rsquo;s things like a kingdom where the king is a giant cat, and so on. Not that the plot is simple mind you \u0026ndash; there\u0026rsquo;s quite a bit or parallel worlds, a tiny bit of time travel, and a few plot twists thrown in (although you might have seen them coming).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy favorite part of the game has to be all the puns. Many of the familiars have some sort of pun involved in their name, like there\u0026rsquo;s a dog familiar called \u0026ldquo;Ruffian\u0026rdquo;; there\u0026rsquo;s an egg-shaped familiar with a pharoah mask called \u0026ldquo;Eggyptian\u0026rdquo;. There\u0026rsquo;s a cat thief familiar called \u0026ldquo;Purrloiner\u0026rdquo;, who evolves into a \u0026ldquo;Cutpurrse\u0026rdquo;, and can then evolve into another form which you can fight on the seas called a \u0026ldquo;Puss in Boats\u0026rdquo;. There\u0026rsquo;s a sheep familiar called \u0026ldquo;Baatender\u0026rdquo; who can evolve into a \u0026ldquo;Baabarian\u0026rdquo;. There\u0026rsquo;s a familiar that wears a turban and he\u0026rsquo;s called a \u0026ldquo;Turbandit\u0026rdquo;, and he has higher forms called \u0026ldquo;Turban Myth\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Turban Legend\u0026rdquo;. Okay, I\u0026rsquo;ll stop before I enumerate them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a few other systems familiar to JRPG players \u0026ndash; crafting, a casino, farming enemies for drops, bounty hunts, errand boards and so on on. Oh and some nonsense about fixing people\u0026rsquo;s hearts by finding people willing to contribute attributes like confidence and kindness and whatnot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all a very fun game and something I\u0026rsquo;m glad to have gotten off my backlog! Not sure if I\u0026rsquo;ll have time to play the second game though, maybe in another five years?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e__\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I have fond memories of this movie and being especially excited at the sequence where they use the flying drone thing to create a distraction while one of the kids sneaks out avoiding the hostage takers in order to communicate information to law enforcement, and he has to sneak back in in time for roll call, which he misses and he has to pretend he was in the shower all along.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI realise it\u0026rsquo;s a bit weird for me to be reviewing a marketing book, given my self-proclaimed aversion to marketing and sales. A while back I wrote a \u003ca href=\"https://roytang.net/2018/06/book-review-tribe-of-mentors-by-tim-ferris/\"\u003ereview for Tim Ferris\u0026rsquo; book Tribe of Mentors\u003c/a\u003e on this blog, and for some reason someone decided to contact me citing this review and asked if I would review this other book and they would give me a complimentary copy. This was something new to me, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d try it out! (I guess this a thing I do know. Feel free to send me books on random topics to review!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/1-Page-Marketing-Plan-Customers-Money/dp/1989025013/ref=la_B01B715MGW_1_1?s=books\u0026amp;ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1529560817\u0026amp;sr=1-1\"\u003eLink to the book on Amazon.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, on to the book: It\u0026rsquo;s relatively short, it only took me a while to get through it because of general busy-ness. Coming from someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t have much experience in marketing and sales, I think the book gives a decent overview of this space. I have some prior informal knowledge of many of these concepts, but it\u0026rsquo;s nice to have a more structured idea of how the general flow of marketing works. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find a lot of modern marketing techniques distasteful. I\u0026rsquo;m not especially fond of people aggressively push-marketing to me via cold calls or pushing flyers in my face. To the book\u0026rsquo;s credit, it points out that such blind-shotgun techniques are wildly ineffective. And while it doesn\u0026rsquo;t go into too much detail about each particular area, I think having a more solid understanding of modern marketing techniques and mentalities will help me \u0026ldquo;understand the enemy\u0026rdquo; better, so to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs to the 1-page marketing plan itself: I don\u0026rsquo;t have enough marketing knowledge to say whether it\u0026rsquo;s really an innovation in implementation as the author claims, but it seems like a reasonable checklist for a business to consider when planning out their marketing activities. If I ever manage to talk myself into starting a business, the overview given by this book would certainly be useful. The book itself isn\u0026rsquo;t very expensive, so I think it\u0026rsquo;s a reasonable buy for someone new to the marketing space.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

A direct quote: \u0026ldquo;It is literally easier to cheat on taxes and filing requirements via connections/bribery than it is to make a good faith effort to follow regulations.\u0026rdquo; This is not something I would want to deal with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHiring other people\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA while back I was discussing with someone the prospect of setting up a food stall franchise somewhere. They offered an affordable package and assistance, but I balked at the idea that I would have to find and hire someone to man the stall myself. I have enough trouble delegating my work to other people when I\u0026rsquo;m in a team of competent engineers. I find the idea of entrusting an entire store or stall in which I invested hard-earned money unnerving.

However, I have spent the last couple of years working with a small startup, where I had a lot more visibility into the overall business process, so I guess I have a slightly better appreciation of marketing and sales now. These skills are largely focused on manipulating humans, whereas my own skillset is largely focused on manipulating computers. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that a lot of marketing techniques and sales methods feel very \u0026ldquo;scummy\u0026rdquo; to me, like clickbait ads and so on. I know these can be done well and in ways that conform with my own personal code of honour, but still, in my head these skills constitute \u0026ldquo;black arts\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;necessary evils.\u0026rdquo; \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of these are hurdles I\u0026rsquo;d have to overcome if I ever really want to start a business.

But I do recognize that I have this problem of emotional attachment to a project, especially if I\u0026rsquo;m the main person responsible for it. When working on anything you of course need a certain amount of drive or passion that commits you to the project and pushes you to do the best work you can, but there\u0026rsquo;s a line you can cross where it becomes unhealthy for you. It\u0026rsquo;s when the project and the stress that comes with it starts to take over your life, such that it starts eating up your personal time and you can\u0026rsquo;t get it out of your mind and maybe you even start having nightmares about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key to realize this is happening and take a step back and think about whether you need to let go of things for a while. Maybe take some time off even. Learn to compartmentalize and set aside work when you leave the office. Emotional detachment is a skill I still have to learn and master, but it\u0026rsquo;s essential. Otherwise (as the quoted zen proverb states), you get dragged. That means the stress starts to cascade through your personal life and your health and that can\u0026rsquo;t be good for you. As the HN thread notes, work is not the end-all and be-all of life, and on your deathbed you won\u0026rsquo;t wish you had worked more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;But how can I possibly scale back my involvement, there\u0026rsquo;s so much stuff to do!\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/em\u003e Delegate. Ask for help. Ask to adjust the schedule. Trust your team to get things done. Find a better approach. Regardless, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t sacrifice your well-being for the sake of work. As the airline safety videos tell you, you have to take care of your own oxygen mask before taking care of others!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI actually find this to be a problem with me with personal matters as well, not just with work. I tend to get attached to particular problems or issues and won\u0026rsquo;t give it a rest until I\u0026rsquo;ve somehow managed to resolve the issue. Most of the time this isn\u0026rsquo;t a big problem (I rarely have big personal issues), but some time ago a close friend and I drifted apart because I was insisting that she should follow my advice. I don\u0026rsquo;t regret giving my advice \u0026ndash; I still think I was right \u0026ndash; but I do regret pushing so hard for it, it was her life to live, not mine. (This particular situation led to the creation of one of my personal rules: Don\u0026rsquo;t insist on helping people who don\u0026rsquo;t want to be helped.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small side note: I binged seasons 3-7 of \u003cem\u003eParks and Recreation\u003c/em\u003e lately (seasons 1-2 weren\u0026rsquo;t very good sadly). While I\u0026rsquo;ve always considered myself most similar to the characters of Ron (loves breakfast food, hates government inefficiency, prefers substance over form) and Ben (nerdy, loves pop culture and boardgames and Batman), I realized after this rewatch that I also embody one of the character Leslie\u0026rsquo;s worst traits. And that trait is the inability to detach from her work and even her personal problems. She gets a certain tunnel vision when she\u0026rsquo;s focused on a particular issue and tenaciously never lets go of it. Granted, she does get a lot of stuff done over the course of the series, but more than once the other characters have had to point out how her overzealousness creates problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo yes, letting go. I don\u0026rsquo;t consider myself super religious, but there\u0026rsquo;s a prayer I like, called the serenity prayer, that I think kind of embodies the kind of personal detachment I want to strive for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n    God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,\u003cbr /\u003eCourage to change the things I can,\u003cbr /\u003eAnd wisdom to know the difference.\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n",

We teach students from a young age to follow rules and answer roll calls. We teach them standard prescribed solutions. We teach them how to take exams and how to find the right answers. Even school culture among students teaches kids to conform or be ostracized. Our school systems are optimized for generating employees for industry \u0026ndash; and in the old days industry meant factory workers, who knew just enough to get on an assembly line and put things together. Even today, we are told that the purpose of education is that we need it in order to get a good job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocally, this talk became even more relevant when the \u003ca href=\"http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/10/04/Protest-rally-student-activists-UP-state-universities-PNP-Albayalde.html\"\u003eDirector General of the Philippine National Police questioned why state scholars \u0026ldquo;go against the government\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e. This is a common line found in the comments section of news articles as well whenever students from universities would participate in protest actions against the government. As if by virtue of the government providing for the education of its citizens (as is their responsibility), the students now owe the government an unquestioning obedience and should turn a blind eye to any of the government\u0026rsquo;s abuses. (This line of thinking seems to be primarily prominent during the current administration though \u0026ndash; I didn\u0026rsquo;t really notice people commenting this way during previous admins despite the fact that students have *always* tended to be more activist).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me, this is working as intended. The purpose of the state sponsoring education shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be in order to create obedient, unquestioning citizens. It should be to create citizens that are more discerning and analytical and able to make intelligent and informed decisions about the country\u0026rsquo;s future. And we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be educating people simply so they can find good jobs (although that\u0026rsquo;s part of the reason as well), we should also be educating them because an educated citizenry leads to a better society. (And when I say educated here, I assume there is an ethics component involved as well.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudent activism isn\u0026rsquo;t a bug, it\u0026rsquo;s a feature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Of course, I\u0026rsquo;m not advocating that all students should be required to be activists, just that we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t consider universities producing some percentage of students as activists as a problem.)\u003c/p\u003e\n",
