The book is an analysis of history, of what geographical advantages certain civilizations had that allowed them to triumph over others. He presents a lot of interesting topics covering linguistics, animal/plant domestication and food production that may explain these differences. Given my poor geography knowledge, I would have appreciated more maps in the book. There are some topics here I enjoyed more than others, such as how Pizarro conquered the Incans. But a lot of the topics are presented a bit dryly, in an academic fashion. Making academic topics interesting is tough, I found myself having difficulty reading some of the later chapters. The book overall is very informative though, I learned a lot about the sort of things historians analyze to understand the particulars of human civilization.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/18436248-roy-tang\"\u003eView all my reviews\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

What other very useful skills are there besides selling?\n Selling is really just a form of communication, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t apply only to selling products and services to other people for money. You\u0026rsquo;re selling whenever you\u0026rsquo;re applying for a job, or suggesting a place to eat, or trying to woo a girl.",

IDK much about Davao, but my impression is he didn\u0026rsquo;t do that in 3-6 months. But I am happy that his \u0026ldquo;killing criminals\u0026rdquo; rhetoric now includes the rider that it must be within the scope of the law\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBinay\u0026rsquo;s preparation for this debate seems to have been to keep telling himself \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a decisive leader!!! I\u0026rsquo;m a decisive leader!!! I\u0026rsquo;m a decisive leader!!!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiriam no longer has the fire she used to have, stumbled a few times. She could have a much stronger rebuttal as to why we the constitution has that ban on political dynasties if only her VP candidate\u0026rsquo;s family wasn\u0026rsquo;t the reason we needed to put that there!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuterte agreeing with people and insisting that implementation is the problem - upvotes. But none of the candidates detailed implementation plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiscussion on policies and issues generally one-sided - everyone agrees with the stuff that has to be done, but no one really talks about details of how, etc. Reflection of the fact that we don\u0026rsquo;t really have parties with differing ideologies (aside from Duterte\u0026rsquo;s federalism. Oh and Binay\u0026rsquo;s insistence that political dynasties are cool LOL)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from Binay getting shot down a few times, nothing too fiery/exciting happened. Candidates didn\u0026rsquo;t really do rebuttals so much as elaborate on their own plans\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoxas\u0026rsquo; closing statement is a much better approach than all his political ads and strategies so far\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know all too well that you can\u0026rsquo;t really form an accurate assessment of a person from one interview so I don\u0026rsquo;t really expect that the candidates will have room to espouse all the details of their platforms, but I hope the succeeding debates can at least give more challenging questions and a bit more time for the candidates to elaborate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI missed round 1 (rewatched the archive), but on my way home I noticed the security guards in our subdivision listening to the debate on the radio. Say what you will about the debate\u0026rsquo;s format and lack of challenging questions, but the fact that we are having any sort of discussion at all that manages to capture the public\u0026rsquo;s attention is already an improvement. Hopefully the organizers of the next two debates manage to learn something and try to improve on the first one\u003c/p\u003e\n",
