The French person behind the ticket booth greeted us in Tagalog when we told him we were from the Philippines. I was pleasantly surprised to find out the audioguide offered for the museum used a Nintendo 3DS XL and a custom cartridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe museum had a lot of Greek and Roman pieces and of course French artwork.

We had booked a different hotel for our last leg, the \u003ca href=\"http://charmsuites.com/\"\u003eCharm Suites\u003c/a\u003e along Parallel Ave. It turns out the staff were mostly Filipinos so they were very welcoming to us. The 3-person hotel room was easily the best we had booked for the trip. The room was large and came with a large TV, a fridge, a kitchen area with plates, utensils and a stove for cooking and thankfully free wi-fi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe spent the last leg of the trip in decompression mode, mostly relaxing at the hotel room. I was planning to attend a Dragons of Tarkir (MTG) Prerelease that weekend so I took a 30-minute walk Thursday to find the place I would be playing at, which turned out to be in an area filled with shops relevant to my interests: toy stores, book stores, comic stores, etc. I decided to register for the prerelease at Gigamesh, a large sci-fi/fantasy/comic book store with a back room for the tournament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the weekend we took a leisurely afternoon/evening walk to the Barcelona coast so that we could make contact with the Mediterranean sea and having seaside paella for dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent Saturday at Gigamesh having a good time playing with Spanish cards at the DTK prerelease. I had spent some time during the past few days studying up on the card lists in Spanish, worried that I would have a tough time with the local players. Most of them understood English well enough though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Sunday was our flight back to Manila through Singapore, and the end of our trip. And the end of this series of posts, I hope you enjoyed it \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I\u0026rsquo;d be willing to go into such detail again haha. Well, I have a couple more trips planned this year, so let\u0026rsquo;s see what happens there. Thanks for reading!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
