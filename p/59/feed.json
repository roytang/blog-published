People from 1997 would be totally confused that everyone visits ONE SITE to participate in forum discussions. The 1997 way of doing things would be two hundred different forums for subject interests and if you wanted to find another one you would have to Ask Jeeves or use a web ring. People from 1997 would be \u003cem\u003eappalled\u003c/em\u003e that Reddit not only doesn't ban Stormfront, we let them run communities \u003cem\u003eunder our noses\u003c/em\u003e like redpill and the D (or gradually take them over, like tumblrinaction and cringepics). But the bitterness in our cup, we mixed for ourselves: this is the logical consequence of \"wouldn't it be great if all forums were just a click away from each other?\" Why have forums when you can have THE forum? And then let's put a corporation in charge of it, a corporation that's too much of a fucking pussy to actually take action against evil that's happening on their watch -- except sporadically, hypocritically and only when the media spotlight burns too bright.\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n    So, sure, the Jones defenders are half right in that the modern internet is a corruption of the original Dream of the Web: far from a decentralized \"web\" of users, everything now is a natural monopoly, and the corporations rent the actual function of the Internet back to us, piecemeal. We are no longer a web, but a series of watering holes.\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI miss the decentralized internet of 2007 that the comment above alludes to. A few weeks ago I was cleaning up some old files and found a list of blogs I used to follow. Most of them are dead now, either unavailable or no updates in years. Probably the owners thought \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rsquo;s the point\u0026rdquo; and started hanging out in one of the corporate silos instead. Some of them were people I knew IRL, while others were strangers I met or online or whose blogs I stumbled upon and found interesting enough to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col start=\"2\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlight tangent 1: Hill I am willing to die on: a \u003cem\u003eblog\u003c/em\u003e is a website with a series of posts, often reverse chronological nature. A \u003cem\u003eblog post\u003c/em\u003e is a single post on a blog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstandably, running and maintaining your own blog isn\u0026rsquo;t for everybody; it\u0026rsquo;s much easier to set up a Facebook page or a Twitter account or a subreddit and just post everything there, and that\u0026rsquo;s fine. But what\u0026rsquo;s disappointing is the lack of open interoperability between these channels that makes it difficult for smaller sites to operate independently of the large behemonths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlight tangent 2: I miss RSS, I really wish it took off. I mean, fundamentally, sites like Facebook and Twitter aren\u0026rsquo;t that much different from feedreaders of yore (Okay, I still use a feedreader, it\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://feedly.com/\"\u003eFeedly\u003c/a\u003e), except we\u0026rsquo;d probably need to expand the protocol to standardize on reply/commenting systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4.5.

One that I found interesting is \u003ca href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\"\u003eMastodon\u003c/a\u003e. I currently have an account, \u003ca href=\"https://mastodon.social/@roytang\"\u003e@roytang@mastodon.social\u003c/a\u003e, not sure if I\u0026rsquo;ll migrate to a different server at some point. It\u0026rsquo;s much less toxic than Twitter, and I\u0026rsquo;m especially fond of their \u003ca href=\"https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/07/cage-the-mastodon/\"\u003edeclared philosophy re: abuse and harassment\u003c/a\u003e. However, there isn\u0026rsquo;t that much interesting content yet, at least as far as I can tell. If you know of someone interesting to follow on Mastodon, tell me about it!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5.5. Andy Baio of \u003ca href=\"https://waxy.org/\"\u003ewaxy.org\u003c/a\u003e recently posted an interesting \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/1027793032676962305\"\u003etweetstorm talking about how it was in the early days of Twitter and how Mastodon feels by comparison\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col start=\"6\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI run a personal blog with very few readers (I\u0026rsquo;m fine with that), and I use social media cross-posting to notify Twitter followers and Facebook friends when I have new posts. Or at least I used to, until Facebook recently pulled the plug on their APIs that now make it impossible to autopost from Twitter. I\u0026rsquo;m tempted to stop crossposting altogether lol. (At the very least I know there\u0026rsquo;s at least one person that reads my blog without me posting the link to Facebook, so that\u0026rsquo;s nice.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a kind of relevant Oatmeal comic about this \u003ca href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/comics/reaching_people\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.

Those shapeless, formless platforms haven't earned it and don't deserve it. I've blogged about this many times, but I still believe it: When I log into Facebook, I see Facebook. When I visit your blog, I see you.\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think it\u0026rsquo;s highly unlikely that we get anything close to the decentralized internet back. The internet trend of megacorps and centralization and consolidation is reflective of real-life trends after all (capitalism and economics of scale and mass consumerism and all that seem to point in this direction.)

Pitkin\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be a milestone of some kind, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? Like any other birthday though, I don\u0026rsquo;t feel much different. I still feel like a kid (hence the \u0026ldquo;kid-at-heart\u0026rdquo; in this blog\u0026rsquo;s header), no more an adult than I was twenty years ago. More or less still the same person. I still enjoy the same pursuits, prefer the same foods, have the same hobbies, appreciate the same things. I would like to believe that despite the harshness of the world I still remain mostly an idealist. That in the face of chaos I remain stoic and committed to reason. That I can still step forward into the world with faith in humanity. (Though the past few years have been challenging to say the least.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot everything is the same of course. What is humanity if not change? Perhaps a little bit wiser, maybe a bit more battle-scarred, almost certainly a tiny bit less optimistic and a tiny bit more cynical. Knees a little bit more wobbly. A tiny bit more forgetful. Traveled more of the world. Learned more about people. Maybe even understood them a little bit more. Hoped, dreamed, disappointed, challenged, failed, got back up again, got hurt, hurt people back, achieved victory, suffered defeat. Seen more, lived more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still hold a lot of the aspirations I had when I was young. When you are young, you tend to dream ambitiously. This is the benefit of youth, your world is yet unbounded by harsh realities, you are invincible and everything is within your reach. These days, I think I still hold to the same hopes and dreams, but I have a better acceptance of what their probabilities are. And right now I\u0026rsquo;m at a stage of life where my priority is mainly to enjoy life and not to stress myself too much. Do things that I want. Work on projects that make me feel alive. Sleep in on rainy mornings. Read good stories. Enjoy the company of family and loved ones and friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife and age and time, they come and go. This is supposed to be some kind of midpoint isn\u0026rsquo;t it? But who knows how much time we really have in this world? (Or how much time this world has at all?) Life and age and time, they creep on you slowly, in an almost unnoticeable manner. Days and months and years pass by quickly and fade to memory. All the more for us to cherish each moment as it comes and it passes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking forward to the next forty.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
