            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a New Year\u0026rsquo;s Resolution, why not try learning a new language? Since late 2014, I\u0026rsquo;ve been using \u003ca href=\"https://www.duolingo.com/\"\u003eDuolingo\u003c/a\u003e to teach myself new languages. Learning a new language not only helps when you\u0026rsquo;re travelling, but it unlocks different ways of forming thoughts in your brain, helping cognitive development (I may have made up that last part with absolutely no basis except my own speculation.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first language I tried to study using Duolingo was Spanish, mainly because back then we had an \u003ca href=\"/2015/04/europe-2015-barcelona-part-1/\"\u003eupcoming trip to Europe (including Barcelona)\u003c/a\u003e planned in 2015 so the Spanish would have helped. The Philippines also has a lot of history with the Spanish, so there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of words I could pick up easily. I figured there\u0026rsquo;s no reason to make things too difficult right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t finish the course before our trip, there was far too much content! At some point during the following year (2016), I did manage to complete all of the available Spanish courses though, so yay! The most challenging part was understanding the use of reflexive pronouns like \u003ccode\u003ete\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003eme\u003c/code\u003e, since using them changed the structure of sentences. I also had to adjust to male/female words, and the vast number of verb tenses. But otherwise, Spanish wasn\u0026rsquo;t too tough. At some point, Duolingo claimed that I was \u0026ldquo;50% fluent\u0026rdquo; in Spanish, but that seems ridiculous lol. This statistic no longer appears after a recent revamp, so they probably realised that too. I don\u0026rsquo;t consider myself anywhere near fluent, but I know enough Spanish to recognize a few words here and there when watching the Spanish scenes in \u003cem\u003eBetter Call Saul\u003c/em\u003e, so that\u0026rsquo;s a thing. Listening to spoken Spanish is much tougher than reading words off a screen. I suppose if I want to further my mastery of the language, I would need to listen to more Spanish convos or read more Spanish prose or such, but for now I\u0026rsquo;m happy with continuing the Duolingo lessons. They have since revamped the course and introduced more exercises, so there\u0026rsquo;s still quite a bit to learn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometime in 2017, I also decided to add a second language to my daily Duolingo exercises. Hard mode this time, I chose Japanese. The main reason being I\u0026rsquo;m a bit of a weeb lol. Japanese is a lot more challenging than Spanish because in addition to learning a whole new vocabulary and sentence structure, I have to learn new characters as well! I actually gave studying hiragana/katakana a go back in high school, when a friend and I tried learning Japanese to decipher some Japanese RPGs (maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll write about that someday). Whatever I learned there has largely faded though, but I did retain some minimum vocabulary from all those years of exposure to anime. It\u0026rsquo;s still very challenging - even up to now I\u0026rsquo;m still in the introductory sections learning hiragana and simple sentences, I find myself having to repeat lessons and exercises often and even up to now I\u0026rsquo;m still not super familiar with many of the hiragana characters. I should probably be doing some writing exercises as well (which Duolingo doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide) - the mechanical act of drawing the characters should help with recall - but I\u0026rsquo;ve been too lazy to get into that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuolingo is free to use. That of course means there\u0026rsquo;s stuff like ads and in-app purchases, which might annoy you if you dislike that kind of thing. I dislike them too, but I can kind of tolerate them I guess. The in-app purchases don\u0026rsquo;t really have any effect on what I want to be doing with the app anyway. Completing the lessons also earns you some in-game currency which you can use to unlock some extra lessons/exercises. I\u0026rsquo;ve never had to use them though, so I still have a ton of the in-app currency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuolingo has that nice feature where it tracks when you\u0026rsquo;re doing the exercises on a regular daily basis and tracks your \u0026ldquo;streak\u0026rdquo;, which is psychologically very effective on me. I often hold the streaks for months and then I accidentally break the streak for some silly reason like being too busy with work, then I\u0026rsquo;m sad and annoyed and I leave Duolingo alone for a couple of weeks so I can move on. Then I start over. I\u0026rsquo;m currently at an 86-day streak again. Duolingo is a rare example of a new thing I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to stick with for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne weird thing about Duolingo is that although it offers lessons/exercises on different platforms - web, mobile, tablet - the method of delivery is not consistent across all platforms. Web is more limited obviously, since they often won\u0026rsquo;t have access to a microphone. But I don\u0026rsquo;t understand why their mobile and tablet (IPad) versions aren\u0026rsquo;t consistent. The main inconsistency is the way they track in-app \u0026ldquo;experience\u0026rdquo;. The mobile version gives a \u0026ldquo;streak bonus\u0026rdquo; for maintaining a streak, while the IPad and web versions do not, so you can earn more experience when using the mobile version. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter to me - my daily targets are set such that I always need to do two sets per day (one Spanish and one Japanese), but I find it mildly annoying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all Duolingo provides a positive experience, and I\u0026rsquo;ll probably be using it for yearrs to come. I don\u0026rsquo;t really have any specific goals for why I\u0026rsquo;m learning Spanish and Japanese, both just seem like really good languages to know, or at least be able to partially understand. Who knows, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll even try to add a third language some day lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I was actually two seasons behind. This series is great, and I really enjoy Bob Odenkirk\u0026rsquo;s portrayal, but it might be just a bit overhyped for me. We already know where Jimmy/Saul, Mike, the Salamancas, and Gus Fring end up given \u003cem\u003eBreaking Bad\u003c/em\u003e, so that kind of takes away a bit of tension. Still, it\u0026rsquo;s a fine TV show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also got caught up with \u003cstrong\u003eThe Ranch\u003c/strong\u003e, which is a weird show for me to watch given how hillbilly it is, but I find the perspective strangely refreshing. Also, Elisha Cuthbert really helps. I was surprised that they had killed off Danny Masterson\u0026rsquo;s character (oops spoilers), apparently it was a #MeToo thing or such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInto the Spider-Verse\u003c/strong\u003e was great, especially for a fan of the comics.

I had low expectations, but the movie was a surprisingly fun spectacle.

To the tune of \u0026ldquo;Oh, did you know \u003ccode\u003eCharacter\u003c/code\u003e is actually \u003ccode\u003eVillain\u003c/code\u003e?!?\u0026rdquo;. Still, the movie was nice, exceeded my expectations. It expanded the Incredibles\u0026rsquo; superhero universe and there was even some surprise Bob Odenkirk!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also watched \u003cstrong\u003eSolo: A Star Wars Story\u003c/strong\u003e on Christmas eve (since we didn\u0026rsquo;t get a Christmas Star Wars film this year). We didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to finish it before we went to mass though, so I finished the movie myself a couple of days later. I had skipped watching this in the theater given the mediocre ratings, but now that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it, that\u0026rsquo;s a decision I\u0026rsquo;ve come to regret. It\u0026rsquo;s a reasonable movie with a servicable plot, especially given it\u0026rsquo;s basically meant to expound upon a couple of throwaway lines from the original trilogy. The plot even leaves some dangling threads that could have picked up in succeeding movies, had Disney not decided to scrap (at least for now) the Star Wars spinoff movies. The movie compares unfavorably to \u003cem\u003eRogue One\u003c/em\u003e, which had the far superior heist scheme. In both movies we expected many of the introduced characters to be killed off, but the Rogue One deaths were much better than the Solo ones. Still, it\u0026rsquo;s an okay addition to the Star Wars universe. I read that it also has some tie-ins to the various animated series, which I\u0026rsquo;m not too familiar with.

Thankfully, I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to hold myself back so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo help suppress such urges, I\u0026rsquo;ve also recently resumed private journalling, a practice I haven\u0026rsquo;t revisited for quite a while. Basically just a document where I can dump my own thoughts about things that are probably inappropriate for public consumption. So I get the benefits of writing my thoughts down without any possible privacy issues. So far the need for private journal entries has been few and far between. Between the blog and the private journal, it should be a lot easier for me to take a look back at what I was thinking at any given point in time, should the need arise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last time I did the private journalling thing was with a service called \u003ca href=\"https://750words.com/\"\u003e750 words\u003c/a\u003e, which was pretty good. It inspired me into a daily writing habit for a bit more than a year. I should probably go through those sometime and see if I can\u0026rsquo;t mine them for blog posts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for this blog and the daily posting thing, I have to admit the past week or so has been challenging. The week of Christmas is usually busy as there\u0026rsquo;s last minute gift buying and family visitors and holiday meetups and such so I don\u0026rsquo;t always have the time and/or energy to write posts. I thought about breaking the \u0026ldquo;daily posting\u0026rdquo; rule a few times, but somehow managed to keep it going. The problem with requiring myself to post every day is that it violates \u003ca href=\"/2018/10/you-dont-have-to-be-on-all-the-time/\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t have to be on all the time\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e. While writing this post, I considered loosening the commitment for the New Year, something like \u0026ldquo;post every day, unless you really don\u0026rsquo;t have time or energy\u0026rdquo;, but that\u0026rsquo;s pretty much how habits are broken. I do still find the practice fruitful, so I will continue it for the time being, as much as I can.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

As a result, I\u0026rsquo;ve accumulated a signficant gaming collection and backlog, most of it on PC, but some on consoles too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#5a5a2f68627ba15131cd22c9dd07dad6-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/gaming-backlogs/steam-backlog_hu63af5ca40a1dfa16174803efc09e4844_294301_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"5a5a2f68627ba15131cd22c9dd07dad6-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/gaming-backlogs/steam-backlog.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"26 Dec 2018 5:56am\"\u003e26 Dec 2018 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s all sorts of ways to get extra games, mostly on PC:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSteam sales. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are some games I\u0026rsquo;ve purchased off Steam sales that seemed like a good idea at the time but still haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten around to after years and years. Ever since Steam introduced (cheaper) regional pricing, it\u0026rsquo;s been a lot harder to resist the sales\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHumble Bundles. I really enjoyed humble bundles when they first came out, they had some great indie games like Bastion and Braid. Recently their bundles have dipped a bit in quality, and there\u0026rsquo;s been a bunch of repeats, but I still get a bundle every now and then. Reviewing my previous bundle purchases just now, I\u0026rsquo;ve had some steam keys that I haven\u0026rsquo;t activated since 2010!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also decided to try subscribing to Humble Monthly some time this year, mostly to get Tales of Berseria (which unsurprisingly I haven\u0026rsquo;t played it yet). Getting a bundle of 6-8 games every month is a quick way to accumuate a backlog. I unsubbed after a couple of months because the quality of succeeding bundles wasn\u0026rsquo;t that high\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe major digital stores (Steam, GOG, Humble) also often have promotional giveaways throughout the year, so that builds up the backlog too\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eon the console side, I\u0026rsquo;ve been a Playstation Plus subscriber a long time, so I count that as part of my backlog too - there\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of PS+ games I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to get around to but haven\u0026rsquo;t yet\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the bundles also results in me getting some duplicate keys. To alleviate the backlog, every few years I even do a holiday giveaway of a few Steam games to friends and family on Facebook (sorry if we\u0026rsquo;re not friends there lol).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m trying to do better - this year I have been trying to work through my older gaming backlogs (I even \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/late-game-review-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/\"\u003ecompleted Skyrim\u003c/a\u003e after 7 years!) and minimize my game spending, though I still did buy quite a few games. \u003cem\u003e(Hmm, maybe it would be nice to do some data analytics of how many games I\u0026rsquo;ve bought/played on Steam year-on-year.)\u003c/em\u003e The lack of free time for gaming is a serious problem too, combined with a few other factors:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emy tendency to want to get all the achievements for a game often significantly increases the playtime per game\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003elong-term games that reward daily grinding (a more common theme these days) take up some of my gaming time as well.

Maybe I should do something like go through all the small games first, and just immediately stop playing if I find them not to my liking. (This is a bit difficult for me since I dislike giving up on things). Hmm, that\u0026rsquo;s an idea. What if I do a Twitch/Youtube channel where I feature and try out lesser-known indie games on Steam? I certainly have a whole lot of them! Something to consider for the future!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Filipinos are well-known for celebrating the longest Christmas season, with decorations and Christmas songs starting to become common around September. The most well-known meme around this time is about the song \u003cem\u003eChristmas in our Hearts\u003c/em\u003e by Jose Mari Chan, which is one of the songs malls often play during the season. Many memes leading up to December or even earlier imply Jose Mari Chan preparing to strike on unsuspecting Filipinos.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTraffic in Metro Manila, already pretty terrible, often gets much worse in December. I usually take lots of days off \u003cem\u003e(sometimes even the whole month)\u003c/em\u003e to avoid this. The malls are jam packed as well, same as the roads. It gets much better right after Christmas, in the week leading up to New Year. That week between Christmas and New Year is probably the second lightest week in the year traffic-wise (second only to whenever Holy Week is).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA Filipino-only tradition are the so-called \u003cem\u003eSimbang Gabi\u003c/em\u003e, a series of early morning or late-night masses that many Catholics try to complete from Dec 16 to Dec 24. I\u0026rsquo;m an RC, but I dislike going to these because there\u0026rsquo;s always so many people. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve gone to one of these in around two decades.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn annoying thing, at least in Metro Manila, is the Metro Manila Film Festival. While I have nothing against Filipino films even though I don\u0026rsquo;t watch them, the fact that they are given a monopoly during the last week of December means any big blockbuster foreign films often get pushed to January (we don\u0026rsquo;t have Bumblebee yet for that reason), and smaller Christmas releases often just won\u0026rsquo;t be shown in the country. It would be significantly less annoying if the MMFF actually included quality films instead of whatever hot garbage Vic Sotto and/or Vice Ganda are giving the public.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePeople who live in subdivisions get an upsurge of roving bands of kids who sing Christmas carols \u003cem\u003e(sometimes badly)\u003c/em\u003e somewhere between 6-9pm every night in December. They appear more often as Christmas day draws near. We rarely ever give them anything. The sheer volume is a problem. It\u0026rsquo;s not like American Halloween where it\u0026rsquo;s one night in a year, this is every night for a month. \u003cem\u003e(Actually, some of these kids sometimes try this during Oct/Nov going \u0026ldquo;Happy Halloween\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;Merry Christmas!\u0026rdquo;, but that\u0026rsquo;s much rarer.)\u003c/em\u003e Sometimes even while I\u0026rsquo;m walking around the subdivision they\u0026rsquo;ll come up to me saying \u0026ldquo;Namamasko po!\u0026rdquo; \u003cem\u003e(only in the Philippines is Christmas a verb)\u003c/em\u003e, which annoys me as it kind of smacks of mendicacy. Maybe it would be different if some of the kids\u0026rsquo; groups weren\u0026rsquo;t obviously like they just randomly got together and decided to see if they could get some money from low effort carolling. We usually end up ignoring the doorbells around the time when there are carollers, but that seemed unwise. I suggested we just put a sign saying something to the effect of \u0026ldquo;PATAWAD! BAWAL MANGAROLING!\u0026rdquo; but I\u0026rsquo;m told that wasn\u0026rsquo;t nice or something lol\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMost companies in Metro Manila hold some kind of Christmas party in December, so most events places are booked, good luck to anyone trying to arrange their Christmas party late. Common Christmas party fare include lechon, gift exchanges, raffles, and the dignity of new company employees \u0026ldquo;required\u0026rdquo; to render a performance number.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI think (but don\u0026rsquo;t have the statistics to back me up on this) that petty crime also has an uptick during December. Both times I\u0026rsquo;ve been the \u003ca href=\"/2009/12/when-your-wallet-gets-stolen/\"\u003evictim of pickpocketing\u003c/a\u003e were around this time. It makes sense - people are more desperate during Christmas, and the crowds make it easier for pickpockets.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMost of these are from a middle-class Metro Manila experience of course, since that\u0026rsquo;s what I know. Even the poorer families try to get into the spirit, with some even taking on debts just to be able to have a decent Christmas celebration, which for me is a bad idea. I think there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of pressure from society to have \u0026ldquo;proper\u0026rdquo; celebrations, but if you\u0026rsquo;re hard up, even a simply Christmas dinner at Jollibee should be enough.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eGift giving is something I\u0026rsquo;m quite bad at. Okay wait, that\u0026rsquo;s not accurate. I\u0026rsquo;m fine with the gift giving. The real problem I have with is gift-buying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not good at buying gifts for other people. The main problem I guess is that I\u0026rsquo;m not good at buying things in general, unless those are things that are of particular interest to me. And since my interests are a bit niche, there tends to be not much overlap with what gifts I think other people will appreciate. I tend to not know what sort of gifts are good or even appropriate to give to other people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a group of people, the concept of fairness comes into mind as well. Like, if I have a group of friends that I regard at about the same level, it would feel weird to me to only give a gift to one or two of them, it seems not fair to the others. This leads to even more gift-buying paralysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other day I was at a mall and saw there was a sale on some DC Superhero Girls Lego sets, and my niece loves Lego and she\u0026rsquo;s also my goddaughter and so I figured I would get her one as a gift. And I did, even though in this country Lego sets at 50% are still a bit pricey. But I kind of had a bit of buyer\u0026rsquo;s remorse, not because it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a good gift (I think it was), but it set me up for an additional dilemma: my 1-year old nephew is also my godson, and now I felt compelled to buy him a gift that has around the same value, otherwise it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel \u0026ldquo;fair\u0026rdquo;. But I have no idea what to get for a 1yo! Looking forward to my nephews growing old enough in a few years that I can give them Transformers!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will probably end up handing the parents a cash gift, they\u0026rsquo;ll understand. Cash is a great gift because it\u0026rsquo;s unproblematic, but it can also seem a bit thoughtless. But anyone who knows how bad I am at buying things will understand. I often give cash as wedding gifts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother common gift-giving scenario in the Philippines is the secret santa/kris kringle/gift exchange that is quite common especially among office workers during Christmas season, usually with some approximate expected gift value. This is usually okay for me, as long as people aren\u0026rsquo;t unnecessarily pressured into joining an exchange if they don\u0026rsquo;t want to. I especially like it when the exchange participants are expected to provide a wishlist - this alleviates my handicap a bit. While I understand the spirit of gift exchanges as a social function, it does seem a bit inefficient to me. Logically, gift satisfaction can be maximized by each person just buying what they want for themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, typically most exchanges will have value requirements in the P300 to P500 range, for which I don\u0026rsquo;t have much options in what I\u0026rsquo;d ask for - anything I want for myself will tend to be at least slightly more expensive than that. These days I tend to ask for some grocery type stuff like \u003cem\u003equezo de bola\u003c/em\u003e or spam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother anecdote, only slightly related: when we were kids, my brother had this gift exchange in school that he forgot to ask my mom to get a gift for. I helped him put together a weird gift out of scraps (to put it kindly). We had fun putting it together, but the recipient did not appreciate it, and I remember he said he got a scolding from the teacher lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, the end result of all of this combined with my usual frugality is that I rarely buy anyone gifts, even for Christmas or birthdays. I will sometimes buy gifts if I happen to chance something that I know the recipient will like (like the Lego example above), especially if it\u0026rsquo;s on sale or at a reasonable price. Most other occasions I think family and friends already know I don\u0026rsquo;t usually give gifts. And in return, I tend to not expect too much in the way of gifts either, although I am of course appreciative of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

And that satisfaction is linked to forming satisfying memories of experiences, and not the fleeting experiences themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, it’s worth asking if we want to be happy, to experience positive feelings, or simply wish to construct narratives that seems worth telling ourselves and others, but doesn’t necessarily yield pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy own attitude towards happiness has evolved throughout the years. I think that right now my personal concept involves some mixture of joy (what he describes as fleeting happiness, enjoying the current moment), meaningful (participating in activies that make me feel sufficiently engaged or challenged), and avoidance of discomfort or boredom. The joy part may be simply things like spending time in the company of friends, reading a good book, enjoying a good movie, and so on. But those different elements live in a precarious balance. I can\u0026rsquo;t be enjoying myself all the time, it would get boring. I need to intersperse enjoyment with meaningful activities. So I imagine in the day to day equation, the answer to \u0026ldquo;what makes me happy?\u0026rdquo; depends on which element of the balance needs to be reinforced at that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aspect of avoiding discomfort or boredom is a bit more complicated than the others. I made a promise to myself some time ago that I would avoid doing things that I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do. This may seem nonsenical, I mean of course you don\u0026rsquo;t do things you don\u0026rsquo;t want to do. Except sometimes you do, maybe because of work pressure, peer pressure, or societal pressure or something else. So I wanted to avoid those kinds of things. But life isn\u0026rsquo;t that straightforward, and sometimes you do want do some things that cause you discomfort or boredom, if they satisfy some other goal. Like for example, you can sacrifice your comfort for a while if it helps you get a dream business off the ground. Or you can participate in an activity you dislike because you know it will make your family happy. And so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis post ended up a bit of a meandering ramble, maybe because the concept of happiness itself is not so simple as we want it to be. I was just inspired to think a bit more about happiness because of the article. I suspect I will be revisiting this topic at a later time, and hopefully will be better able to express my thoughts on happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe happiness isn\u0026rsquo;t a set of principles to be encoded, just simply a life to be lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
