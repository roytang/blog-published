Seeing the occasional art post wander across my feeds is often a welcome respite from the terrible news in the world today.

He often posts his drawings on \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jimlee/\"\u003ehis instagram\u003c/a\u003e and he also has \u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/jimlee\"\u003ea Twitch channel\u003c/a\u003e where he occasionally livestreams himself drawing. I\u0026rsquo;m watching the stream right now as I\u0026rsquo;m typing this post!

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI said in my previous \u003ca href=\"/2017/02/review-duelyst/\"\u003eDuelyst review\u003c/a\u003e that \u003ca href=\"https://www.direwolfdigital.com/eternal/\"\u003eEternal\u003c/a\u003e didn\u0026rsquo;t really hook me. That was in Feb 2017. I stopped playing Duelyst after around six months. I started playing Eternal regularly July of that year, and have been playing regularly ever since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat changed my mind? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure, but once I got around to playing Eternal regularly, I found myself enjoying it. I think one of the main factors is that out of all \u003ca href=\"/tags/ccgs/\"\u003ethe online ccgs\u003c/a\u003e I\u0026rsquo;ve tried, Eternal is the one that\u0026rsquo;s closest to \u003ca href=\"/categories/magic-the-gathering/\"\u003eMagic the Gathering\u003c/a\u003e. That\u0026rsquo;s not really surprising, since a number of Eternal\u0026rsquo;s lead designers are MTG Pros and Hall of Famers. As such, my review will tend to compare Eternal to MTG.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEternal games play out almost exactly like MTG games. Each player plays mana sources (called Power in eternal), then uses his pool to play creatures and spells to interact with the enemy. You send in creatures to attack and deal damage to the enemy until the enemy\u0026rsquo;s life total is at 0 (Eternal starts at 25 life vs MTG\u0026rsquo;s 20.), the enemy can send his units to block your attackers, and so on. Eternal feels like a smoother, more streamlined MTG. I\u0026rsquo;m also playing MTG Arena regularly these days, so I know that by comparison Eternal\u0026rsquo;s games feel like they flow quicker and finish faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the relevant changes that I believe make it feel like a faster MTG:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003elimited fast effect windows. This is the main one. MTG Arena has to stop and ask you what you want to do every time there\u0026rsquo;s an opportunity to play fast effects, and there\u0026rsquo;s tons. In Eternal, there are only three windows: during combat, at the end of the enemy\u0026rsquo;s turn, and whenever the enemy plays a spell. And you can only play fast spells (basically MTG instants), there are no creature abilities to activate at instant speed.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe game will automatically pass priority whenever you don\u0026rsquo;t have any relevant plays. MTG Arena does this automatically as well. You can turn it off, since it has a bit of disadvantage (it conveys information to the opponent)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esimilar to HS, Eternal limits the number of creatures you can have on the board. Eternal allows twelve on each side vs Heathstone\u0026rsquo;s seven. This is more due to technical constraints than anything else. MTG Arena has to play the same on paper, so you can crash the game by generating some large number of creatures somehow.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#f653e5535156b73f5d214483a5874674-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/eternal_board_limit_hub36af13f9519955d1931871364475345_567453_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"f653e5535156b73f5d214483a5874674-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/eternal_board_limit.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"25 Nov 2018 2:00am\"\u003e25 Nov 2018 2:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEternal\u0026rsquo;s power system is similar to MTG\u0026rsquo;s mana system - you have to draw cards that provide power the same way that you have to draw lands in MTG. This means one of MTG\u0026rsquo;s inherent \u0026ldquo;problems\u0026rdquo; - mana screw - still happens in Eternal. In fact, on the forums mana screw is one of the complaints that often comes out (I suspect from former HearthStone players). Coming from MTG, I understand that building your deck to avoid mana screw is one of the skills needed in games like Magic and Eternal. Eternal eases the problem a little bit with its mulligan mechanic: Eternal gives you one free mulligan, and the 2nd hand is guaranteed to have 2-4 power. As I write this, they are also experimenting with allowing a 2nd mulligan that drops your starting hand size by one, still with the guarantee of 2-4 power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColor screw can still be a problem in Eternal, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have enough of the correct influence (Eternal\u0026rsquo;s analogue to color), you can\u0026rsquo;t play cards that require that influence. They improved on this a bit because in Eternal, power and influence aren\u0026rsquo;t tied together the way mana and color are, they are independent. The influence requirements are \u003cem\u003eminimums\u003c/em\u003e that aren\u0026rsquo;t used up like mana of a given color. That is, if you have one Fire influence, you can play any number of cards that require one Fire influence. In MTG, if you only have one source of red mana, that red mana can only be spent for one card at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFactions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of color/influence, Eternal has five factions like MTG\u0026rsquo;s color pie:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ctable\u003e\n\u003cthead\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003cth\u003eFaction\u003c/th\u003e\n\u003cth\u003eSymbol color\u003c/th\u003e\n\u003cth\u003eClosest analogous MTG color\u003c/th\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/thead\u003e\n\u003ctbody\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eFire\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eRed\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eRed\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eShadow\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003ePurple\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eBlack\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003ePrimal\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eBlue\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eBlue\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eJustice\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eGreen\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eWhite\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eTime\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eYellow\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eGreen\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can see, they don\u0026rsquo;t map cleanly. Often in my own head I still refer to the factions by their MTG analogue (and I call Justice Green and Time White), but I\u0026rsquo;ve been improving on this lately. The play styles largely map correctly though. Fire decks are often aggressive with small quick creatures and burn for reach. Primal decks have card draw and counter magic. Shadow decks have a lot of removal and life draining. Time decks have mana acceleration and big creatures. Justice decks have Wrath of God lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs expected, many of Eternal keywords are similar or analogous to MTG keywords.

Also, Aegis will protect against Wrath-style effects whereas Hexproof does not.

There\u0026rsquo;s far too many to cover here!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRe: other mechanics, the main one to note is that Eternal takes full advantage of the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s a computer game and doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to deal with player memory issues. This means that buffs and debuffs stay on cards, even when they leave zones. Unlike Hearthstone, the graveyard/void zone exists and thus reanimator strategies are viable. There is some amount of RNG, such as \u0026ldquo;units gain a random battle skill\u0026rdquo;, but not as much as HS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nice mechanic they have is the \u0026ldquo;Market\u0026rdquo;. Basically each deck can have a set of five cards set aside as a \u0026ldquo;Market\u0026rdquo;/sideboard, and there are a set of cards (one for each faction) that allow you to fetch a card of that faction from the market. Basically similar to the way the Wishes worked in Magic. It\u0026rsquo;s a clever approach that allows for some form of \u0026ldquo;sideboarding\u0026rdquo; even for best of one matches\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSkill Level, Competitive Play and F2P\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think Eternal is inherently more skill-based than HS because of:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emanabase decisions\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emuch less RNG\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eattacking and blocking\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meta for competitive play is rather healthy, there are a number of viable decks in different archetypes that can you to Master ranking on the ladder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEternal provides several modes for Limited play as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s Forge, which is similar to Hearthstone\u0026rsquo;s Arena\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s monthly sealed leagues\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s 4-pack draft available at any time\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn terms of F2P, Eternal is the most generous among CCGs I\u0026rsquo;ve tried in terms of how much it gives players for free, as far as I can tell. Aside from the standard three daily quests, your first ranked win of each day gets you a free pack. There\u0026rsquo;s a free Gauntlet mode where you fight against AIs, and just grinding Gauntlet can get you enough gold to purchase the campaigns, which give you more cards to work with. When you start out, you quickly earn starter decks for five factions and five color pairs. These decks are decent enough for ranked play; I remember I took the Rakano and Stonescar starter decks up to Gold rank during my first month. They recently nerfed gold rewards from chests (that you earn from quests) by 10% for balance reasons, but I think the rewards are still pretty generous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hit Master rank in constructed on my third month of play (same rate as with Duelyst I believe) and have regularly hit it ever since. By comparison, I\u0026rsquo;ve never hit legend rank in HS. It really helps that Eternal games are quick and a lot more fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a while longer to hit Master rank in draft - more than one year in fact, I only hit it last week. This was the last achievement I needed for Steam completion too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#16ef1703755644be4695f85a61fdc85d-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/eternal_draft_master_hu00fcd3b62d84728fe9d738e25b00aec7_359716_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"16ef1703755644be4695f85a61fdc85d-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/eternal_draft_master.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"25 Nov 2018 2:00am\"\u003e25 Nov 2018 2:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLore and Aesthetics\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEternal\u0026rsquo;s world is described as \u0026ldquo;Six Guns and Sorcery Combined\u0026rdquo;, which means there\u0026rsquo;s Gunslingers alongside magic users and shamans and such. There\u0026rsquo;s a little bit of steampunk in there too, along with valkyries, yetis, centaurs, wisps, dinosaurs, radiants (basically magical aliens), grenadin (basically goblins), sentinels (basically giant robots), and a bunch of other stuff too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s pretty fun, and the story is continuously being updated. Each monthly league and the occasional campaign or new card set represents a change in the story. Major characters are represented by powerful cards and often have multiple versions representing their stages of growth. A prime example is Icaria, the young Valkyrie captain who later becomes a rebellious keyword-souped Akroma-like avenger after witnessing her superior\u0026rsquo;s misdeeds:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/eternalcardgame/images/6/6d/Icaria%2C_Valkyrie_Captain.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/318?cb=20180307222958\" alt=\"Icaria, Valkyrie Captain\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/eternalcardgame/images/e/eb/Icaria%2C_the_Liberator.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/318?cb=20181012184436\" alt=\"Icaria, the Liberator\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from the lore, I like the game\u0026rsquo;s overall aesthetic. Many game actions have smooth and quick animations that keep the game alive. Units with Aegis are wrapped with an animated bluish glow. Legendary units crash onto the field with force, attacking units dive towards their blockers, and so on. I think the animations and aesthetic are comparable with HS in this regard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Future\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question is now: will I keep playing Eternal now that I\u0026rsquo;ve hit my usual target of all the Steam achievements?

I think I will play it for a while, the designers seem to know what they\u0026rsquo;re doing, and a new set comes out next month too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a few other online CCGs I have accounts for that I haven\u0026rsquo;t really gotten into for some reason or another, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll try giving them another chance next year. There\u0026rsquo;s Spellweaver (very slow games and kinda boring), Shadowverse (not a fan of the aesthetic and ugh the UI is so messy/cluttered), and Gwent (uh, it\u0026rsquo;s weird). There\u0026rsquo;s Valve\u0026rsquo;s Artifact coming out too, I might try that if reviews are good. So many card games to play!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I said in my previous Duelyst review that Eternal didn\u0026rsquo;t really hook me. That was in Feb 2017. I stopped playing Duelyst after around six months. I started playing Eternal regularly July of that year, and have been playing regularly ever since.\nWhat changed my mind? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure, but once I got around to playing Eternal regularly, I found myself enjoying it. I think one of the main factors is that out of all the online ccgs I\u0026rsquo;ve tried, Eternal is the one that\u0026rsquo;s closest to Magic the Gathering.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eLooking back on 8 years of apple tablets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got my first iPad (1st generation!) \u003ca href=\"/2010/10/ipad-first-impressions-and-snap-judgments/\"\u003eback in 2010\u003c/a\u003e with 64gb storage. This version was purchased for me by a friend in Singapore. I got the 3g model back then, but I never got around to using that feature. Future purchases would be wifi only. My main usage for the iPad back then was for reading ebooks/comics and playing some games. I spent a lot of time on \u003ca href=\"http://onemanleft.com/games/tilttolive/\"\u003eTilt to Live\u003c/a\u003e on that bad boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first upgrade was a 4th generation iPad that I asked a friend to buy for me in Hong Kong in October 2012. This was a straight upgrade for performance reasons. The 1st gen iPad was already having trouble with modern apps and the latest iOS, my usage for it was pretty much the same. I think the game I played the most on the 2nd iPad was Mika Mobile\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"http://www.mikamobile.com/games/battleheart/\"\u003eBattleheart\u003c/a\u003e. Come to think of it I don\u0026rsquo;t think I ever finished that game, I wonder if my save would still be there if I reinstalled it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy current iPad Pro is my 3rd apple tablet. It\u0026rsquo;s a 1st generation iPad Pro (2015) with 128gb, which I bought around this time in 2016. At this time, my previous iPad was still doing well, but my main motivation for getting the iPad Pro was the Apple Pencil. I had started getting back into drawing as a hobby and wanted to explore digital sketching. With my previous iPad I had tried purchasing some kind of capacitive stylus, but those never worked out, as the precision was never good enough for my liking. The Apple Pencil solved those issues and has been great, it\u0026rsquo;s a fantastic product. Most of my digital drawing is done using Procreate, although I also tried a few other apps like Paper by 53 and Autodesk Sketchbook Pro. I could also be using the Apple Pencil for note taking, and I have done so on occasion, but I\u0026rsquo;m not that much of a note taker so this doesn\u0026rsquo;t come up often. When I do use it, I find the handwriting functionality fairly good as well. My note-taking app of choice is ???.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite being my newest iPad and being only two years old, this one is the least well-maintained and is experiencing some problems. It already has quite a few cracks on the display, so it looks quite worse for the wear. (See the visible cracks in the image below.) I don\u0026rsquo;t think the cracks are on the display itself, probably on the thin protective layer on top, because the cracks extend over the bezels. I suspect this is due to me banging my bag around too much. The battery life also seems much worse these days, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if that\u0026rsquo;s due to the most recent version of iOS. When my niece comes over she always drains the battery with her Youtubes and weird games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#0e69c4442bdbda5b4311c38fb14a7bc3-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/ipad-retrospective/ipad_screen_hu2b43923f691899f894bf5ea67bd89c2d_510489_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"0e69c4442bdbda5b4311c38fb14a7bc3-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/ipad-retrospective/ipad_screen.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"24 Nov 2018 2:00am\"\u003e24 Nov 2018 2:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the most mysterious problem is an incessant beeping. It\u0026rsquo;s been happening for a while, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to figure out yet. Basically, at times the iPad will beep continuously, as if it was being repeatedly plugged and unplugged into the charger. It happens most often when I\u0026rsquo;m lying in bed holding the iPad above me at an angle or at my side. I can\u0026rsquo;t identify whether it happens due to position or something else. Also, it\u0026rsquo;s rare for it to happen when I\u0026rsquo;m using the iPad in some other place or position. And it \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e happens when I\u0026rsquo;m not using the iPad. I\u0026rsquo;m starting to suspect that it has to do with some sort of static charge caused by my hands and the bed somehow, but that seems ridiculous. That, or my iPad has developed sentience and is trying to communicate with me through beeps. (That theory gives a fun image whenever I put the iPad down and the beeping starts to taper off.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of charger problems, another issue I have with Apple tablets in general is hardware-related but not with the tablet itself - the problem is their lightning cables, which tend to rapidly fall apart over time. I\u0026rsquo;m talking the official Apple lightning cables here. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried some unoffical ones as well, but those seem highly inconsistent as to whether they\u0026rsquo;ll even work, so I tend to prefer the official ones. I just wish they lasted longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#ac261482d13679ea21e09bf3aa55d03d-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2013/09/382888558639333376/1_382888558639333376_BVBLHXECMAAAfE0_hu3edde0d04816e45cb5653fead35df854_34977_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"I have no idea why this keeps happening to my ipad cables.

When I first got the iPad, I did indulge myself in purchasing a few apps, mostly games like the aforementioned Tilt to Live and Battleheart. Gaming on the iPad is okay, but as can be expected it\u0026rsquo;s a big battery drain. I often got iPad versions of \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; games like Street Fighter, Injustice, and so on. But I stopped buying apps in 2013. I don\u0026rsquo;t know my rationale at the time, but I do know today that buying apps on the iPad is extremely problematic for one reason: rapid changes in iOS. The programming APIs change rapidly, and apps will often need to be updated to work with more recent versions of iOS, and many app developers won\u0026rsquo;t bother keeping up. That means many apps will tend to be short-lived - I checked my purchase history and roughly more than half of my previously purchased apps could not even be downloaded anymore. (Not sure if this would be alleviated by using older iOS versions). Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m spoiled by backward compatibility on Windows, where I can basically still run software from two decades ago. These days, my iPad gaming is mostly just Words with Friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from drawing and gaming, my other main usage is for reading. I use both iBooks and the Kindle app and also Comic Flow for comics. At any given time, my tablet is loaded with hundreds of books and comics, so it\u0026rsquo;s hard to run out of things to read even if there\u0026rsquo;s no internet. I still enjoy reading physical books, but having a fairly large library easily accessible is great too. This is the main reason I often get high-storage versions even though they\u0026rsquo;re a lot more expensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, I\u0026rsquo;m happy with my iPad purchases so far, I\u0026rsquo;ve used them constantly, and even the older models are still in use by other family members. I will admit I am tempted by the recently announced new iPad Pro iteration, especially given the problems my current iPad already has. It\u0026rsquo;s attractive for me mainly due to the Pencil now being able to be docked on the iPad itself and the reports that it performs about as well as a Macbook. These tablets are quite expensive though, and I\u0026rsquo;ve already made one big tech purchase this year (more on that in a future post I guess), so I\u0026rsquo;m skipping on the new iPad Pro for now.

I\u0026rsquo;ve commented quite a few times on Reddit threads regarding this over the years, here\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fxbd5/im_sick_of_this_entire_dlc_scam_cutting_content/c1jdipw/\"\u003emy favorite one\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if they didn\u0026rsquo;t bundle DLC separately and just straight-up sold the game for a higher price (and with a slightly later release date), would you prefer it? Or if the game was released with the same price but no additional DLC at all? Or the game is released with no DLC but six months later a new full version of the game is released with slightly more content that could have been released as DLC but instead you now have to buy a full game again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonally, I find that DLC is a good idea as it allows customers to pick and choose which content they want. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to bitch about it, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to buy the DLC if I don\u0026rsquo;t want to. In fact for longer games like RPGs I just wait for the GOTY to come out later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, the phrase \u0026ldquo;cutting content out of the game\u0026rdquo; shows misunderstanding of how software development in general works. Like all other software development gigs, game development is largely constrained by schedules and real-world budget and resource constraints. And most of the time they\u0026rsquo;re going to fall short of those schedules and have to decide what features to cut so they can make it on time. Having the option of releasing them as DLC creates less pressure on the team and creates an opportunity for content that would otherwise have been cut or saved for a larger expansion disc to be made available. And please don\u0026rsquo;t take at face value the rantings that because 90% of a DLC\u0026rsquo;s content is already on the disc that it should have been included at release - you haven\u0026rsquo;t considered the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-ninety_rule\"\u003eother 90%\u003c/a\u003e yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the other complaints is that with DLC being available on launch or shortly thereafter, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like one is getting the \u0026ldquo;complete\u0026rdquo; experience for a game purchased at full price. I finished the \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/game-review-marvels-spider-man-for-ps4/\"\u003ePS4 Spider-Man game recently\u003c/a\u003e and got the platinum even, and I\u0026rsquo;m super happy with the game, got what pretty much felt like a complete experience. At the time I played the game there were already two DLC packs available, one featuring the Black Cat and another featuring Tombstone. When I finished the game, I thought about buying the DLCs since I enjoyed the game so much, but in the end I decided to hold off since neither of those felt like they were necessary. Worrying that you\u0026rsquo;re missing out on the \u0026ldquo;complete experience\u0026rdquo; is just another form of \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/choose-without-regret-and-the-fear-of-missing-out/\"\u003eFOMO\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also absolutely respect the gaming companies\u0026rsquo; right to determine their own business model and what price points and what DLCs they choose to offer. People complain about low-value DLC like additional weapons or map packs for $10 or such. The decision to release such DLC is a business decision, and like all business decisions, they can really only be influenced with your wallet. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to pay for poor value DLC! Companies can try to nickel and dime you for content, that\u0026rsquo;s their choice. It\u0026rsquo;s your choice to walk away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a side note, in my opinion the worst DLC offenders are multiplayer games (usually from companies like EA or Ubisoft). Maybe my opinion is helped by the fact that I\u0026rsquo;m largely a single-player gamer. There is very little problematic DLC with games like The Witcher 3 (I haven\u0026rsquo;t played either of the expansions!) or Persona 5 for example. Also, even before DLCs were a thing, I had already been playing \u003ca href=\"/categories/magic-the-gathering/\"\u003eMagic the Gathering\u003c/a\u003e. Hohoho TCGs are like the epitome of DLCs, you literally have to pay money just to complete a deck! (Luckily modern online CCGs often provide viable F2P options).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kind of like the DLC model for games where companies constantly release DLC for a game even years after their release, it increases the gameplay lifetime. As long as you can enjoy the game without the DLC of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome specific games with DLC that I \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e purchased:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStreet Fighter V. Fighting games these days have a lot of DLC, usually either cosmetics (costumes) or new characters. For the PS4 version, I only used in-game cash to get new characters, but I also got the Steam version and just got a couple of Season passes there. I usually don\u0026rsquo;t bother with cosmetics, but I did get one costume DLC for SFV, and that\u0026rsquo;s because I thought it was absolutely criminal \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/roytang/status/1018029055994617856\"\u003enot to have Cody\u0026rsquo;s prison garb\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStellaris DLC has been pretty good too. I recently bought my first DLC for Stellaris, and I find the additional content acceptable. Paradox is great at long term support for their strategy games. I look forward to occasionally buying a DLC pack once a year or so and playing the game for a month before abandoning it again lol.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCivilization. For Civ5 and Civ6, I usually bought any DLCs that introduced additional civs, as I like the variance in my games. This seems of questionable value since I\u0026rsquo;ll typically play each new Civ only once or twice, but the DLC packs are usually cheap enough for me not to worry about it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn summary: I think DLC in general is a good if not positive trend for gaming, since it gives the consumer additional choices. It also keeps game prices comparatively low while facilitating additional income sources for the developers. And we as gamers always have the freedom not to indulge companies that release bad DLC.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAside from my hobbyist readings (keeping up with gaming and comics news, etc), my usual reading diet used to consist of current events and tech news, primarily through apps like Flipboard and Feedly, secondarily through social media like Reddit and Twitter. Recently though I\u0026rsquo;ve started following more sources and blogs that are focused on more\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;cultural\u0026rdquo; affairs. When I started doing \u003ca href=\"/2016/03/sketching-daily/\"\u003e#sketchdaily\u003c/a\u003e a couple of years ago, I started following more artists. During the past few months, as a sort of counterbalance to the prevalently negative current events and tech industry news, I\u0026rsquo;ve also begun following a few more people who are focused more on things like philosophy, history, poetry, literature, creativity, and so on. A lot of it goes over my head - I don\u0026rsquo;t really have any formal background in the humanities - but many times I come upon posts I appreciate and that help expand my horizons and point me down new avenues of thinking. And I can still enjoy good art and good poetry and good prose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have also purposely cut back a bit on the more political follows, especially on Twitter. Following current events feels a lot like being a spectator at a car crash; everything is terrible, but you can\u0026rsquo;t help but be fascinated by what\u0026rsquo;s going on. Even much of the tech industry news tends to be negative - Facebook has done something horrible; there\u0026rsquo;s a new data breach; people are spending too much time on their computers; big tech is helping fascist countries do censorship; and so on. It\u0026rsquo;s too easy to lose yourself in current events and be angry all the time about the state of the world or the country or our leadership. I\u0026rsquo;m not planning to disconnect completely from the news, like some people do, and I\u0026rsquo;m still always open to discussion about any topic (though I have decided to be more restrained in my urge to debate people and respond to every possible outrage).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still believe that good citizens have a responsibility to stay abreast of what\u0026rsquo;s going on in the world and to be informed so that we can make good decisions. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it has to be outrage 24/7. We\u0026rsquo;re not going to run out of bad news any time soon. We have to find the space as well for appreciating what\u0026rsquo;s good in life and for broadening our horizons.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI remember a conversation I often had with a friend, the first team lead I ever worked with. Many times she would be putting in extra hours for days at a time and I would say to her \u0026ldquo;Put that off until tomorrow, it\u0026rsquo;s time to go home.\u0026rdquo; and she would reply along the lines of \u0026ldquo;But I still have so much work to do.\u0026rdquo; and my usual rejoinder would be \u0026ldquo;Are you expecting to finish all of that work tonight?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe modern working world is full of problems, issues, tasks and other work that needs to be resolved, and it can be overwhelming at times. It can seem like the list of to-dos is endless. Software development in particular can seem like never-ending crises and issues and tickets to be resolved, especially for larger teams and larger projects. But that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t mean we sacrifice all our time in pursuit of emptying that to-do list. We put in our hours and pare down that list the best we can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne learns this quickly when faced with any nontrivial project with an issue tracker. Often the list will seem to keep growing with no signs of slowing down. You might have a tendency to say \u0026ldquo;but we can\u0026rsquo;t release software with this many issues!\u0026rdquo; But deadlines are real, and you learn that you have to triage and make trade-offs with the time you have available. Real-world software is released with issues still pending, simply because there isn\u0026rsquo;t enough time to do everything. So you prioritize and choose the most important things, the most critical bugs, and fix what you can in the available time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne has to apply this to one\u0026rsquo;s personal workload as well. No matter how many things you have to do, you don\u0026rsquo;t have infinite time. You have to figure out what\u0026rsquo;s important for you and that\u0026rsquo;s where you focus your time and effort. Pushing yourself beyond what your time and health allow will do no good. That way lies madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven for personal goals this is an issue for me. I want to do a lot of things. There are so many things I want to read, write, create, draw, learn, watch, and try out. I want to do everything. There are so many things I want to have mastery over. Mastery implies regularly spending hours on practice and effort. But there are only so many hours in the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
