I remember I bought the game for Steam on launch day. I finally \u0026ldquo;finished\u0026rdquo; it after 350 hours of gameplay and seven years real-time. \u0026ldquo;Finished\u0026rdquo; in this case means \u0026ldquo;achievement complete\u0026rdquo;, not just \u0026ldquo;main quest complete\u0026rdquo;, because as any Bethesda gamer knows, that’s not how their RPGs roll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had been looking forward to this game because I had previously enjoyed both ES4: Oblivion and Fallout 3 on PS3 and had also just finished Fallout: New Vegas on Steam and was open to more open-world exploration. I remember being tempted by the badass collector’s edition Alduin statue too but opted out due to price and the fact that it was huge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first character was a male Nord named Hunter. I actually managed to finish the main quest a bit more than a month after getting the game (fairly fast!). I used that first character to complete all the guild quests \u0026ndash; Companions, Mage’s Guild, Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood. Afterwards I immersed myself with the open world and toyed around with mods for a bit. I played it on and off again for a few years, and buying the DLC expansions (Hearthfire, Dawnguard and Dragonborn) eventually when they were on sale. I started a few other runs but never got far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2016, I started my final run \u0026ndash; the character that I would be able to bring to \u0026ldquo;achievement completion\u0026rdquo; including all DLCs. This final character was Arche, an Imperial (named after the Tales of Phantasia character).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#1b033aa856422de0367794d936365c4d-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/late-game-review-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/2%20-%200mR5pvs_hu199fdb365079d28ca2b0d5d133f8063f_273613_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"My final armor set was the Deathbrand from the Dragonborn expansion since I was trying to level up Light Armor.\" title=\"My final armor set was the Deathbrand from the Dragonborn expansion since I was trying to level up Light Armor.\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eMy final armor set was the Deathbrand from the Dragonborn expansion since I was trying to level up Light Armor.

It’s been available for a while and been ported to every platform imaginable (it even got a new console release this year!), so there’s not much point talking about the features and whatnot. There are some other things I’d like to cover though:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLevelling Up and Legendary Dragons\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last achievement I got was the one for killing a legendary dragon, which took me forever. The first issue was that legendary dragon’s don’t spawn unless you’re already level 78. In my 2nd run, I finished the Dawnguard and Dragonborn content and all other achievements by around level 50, and it was a grind to get to level 78 througn conventional means. I didn’t want to do any console cheats to get to 78, so I tried to look for faster ways to level up. There’s a bunch of suggestions on the internet, but here are the best ones:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTelekinesis \u0026ndash; with enchantments to reduce MP cost, you can use Telekinesis to quickly level up Alteration, simply by levitating an object in front of you until you run out of magic, then you just rest and repeat. This method was still fairly slow for me though and more importantly it was really boring. I read some posts saying you could speed up this process by levitating an object then doing fast travel to a far location so that the game thinks you were using Telekinesis during the entire trip, but I could never get this to work and that feels a bit too exploit-y for me.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGiant blocking \u0026ndash; basically go find a camp with high level giants, then keep blocking their attacks with your shield, healing when necessary. The advantage of this is that it increases multiple skills \u0026ndash; Block, Restoration and Light/Heavy Armor (depending on what you’re wearing). However, it wasn’t much faster than the Telekinesis method and it was also quite tedious and if you weren’t careful, you could die.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFinally, I came upon, in my opinion, the single fastest way to level up in Skyrim: the Illusion mastery spell Harmony. You can use Muffle to level up your Illusion until you learn Harmony, but once you have Harmony, things go into overdrive. You simply go into the middle of Whiterun (near the plaza is fine, or that big tree in the middle section) and cast Harmony. The spell has a very, very wide AOE so it affects almost all citizens, gaining you ridiculous amounts of Illusions skill levels. A single casting can earn you as much as 50+ Illusion levels. This method is quick, safe, easy, and I wish I had discovered it earlier. As it is, it took me from 68 to 81 in around an hour.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter getting to Level 81, the next problem was actually finding a Legendary Dragon to fight. Supposedly there was one that always spawns at Arcwind Point, but I never got one to spawn there, even after clearing my mods. I tried fast-travelling across dragon burial grounds for a while with no luck. Eventually I managed to randomly find a Legendary Dragon while wandering near Dragon Bridge (that’s where my last save is!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMods\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a *lot* of mods installed, mostly additional gameplay/quests, additional items added to the game world, convenience mods (adding map markers etc), or stuff to improve the ambience. I’m not much for stuff like graphics improvements or silly mods that add Thomas the Tank Engine or Macho Man dragons. I did have this mod that added Star Wars lightsabers to the game that I wanted to get rid of but I had so many mods installed I always gave up trying to find it on the list. The best mods I used throughout my 350 hours were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70219/\"\u003eForgotten City\u003c/a\u003e \u0026ndash; this mods add a self-contained quest that involves time travel, groundhog day-style time loops, multiple paths to resolution and investigating a mystery. It was so good it got turned into its own \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/874260/The_Forgotten_City/\"\u003estandalone game\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=720815421\"\u003eStan Bush combat music\u003c/a\u003e \u0026ndash; basically replaces Skyrim’s combat music Stan Bush’s songs \u0026ldquo;The Touch\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Dare\u0026rdquo; from \u003cem\u003eTransformers The Movie,\u003c/em\u003e giving you a quick adrenaline boost when combat starts. I didn’t actually notice that Skyrim had separate combat music before I installed this mod!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThat’s it, out of literally two hundred mods only two stood out for me lol.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWishlist for Elder Scrolls 6 (or things I wish they had done in Skyrim)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMake the shovel useful \u0026ndash; it’s weird that there’s a shovel object in the game but it’s not really used for anything, not even as a weapon (I’m sure there’s mods that do that), but I was thinking stuff like buried treasure quests could require you to have a shovel to dig up chests or maybe you can randomly dig in the dirt and hope for goodies (one of the Zelda games did this AFAICR)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMountain climbing \u0026ndash; okay, this wish is straight from Breath of the Wild. One of the best things about BOTW was the ability to climb anywhere, a refreshing addition to an open world overworld after Skyrim’s \u0026ldquo;How the heck do I get to the top of this mountain\u0026rdquo; challenge.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMore immersion in the Hearthfire DLC \u0026ndash; don’t get me wrong, I liked the Hearthfire DLC, it added a nice opportunity for role-playing with the chance to get married and adopt kids, makes for some nice stories and \u003ca href=\"https://tumblr.roytang.net/post/174535189435/playing-skyrim-i-have-my-wife-aela-and-adopted\"\u003efun moments like this\u003c/a\u003e. After a while everything falls into a rut though, it would have been nice if they had expanded the Hearthfire content with some additional radiant quests. Some random ideas: Your wife or one of your kids goes missing, you have to find her; bandits threaten your house and you and your family have to defend it; you gave one of your kids two many daggers and now he accidentally stabbed one of his friends; your entire house has vanished along with your family! It has been teleported somewhere!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eActually just more radiant quests in general would have been nice for a bit more variance (I’m not sure if I will ever be satisfied). I think there’s already mods that do this, but I never tried them out.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe ability to take over a fort after you clear it. Skyrim has a lot of small forts or buildings held by bandits or whatever, it would have been a nice alternative to buying a house, after you clear a bandit the Jarl of the containing hold offers you a chance to buy/earn the title for the hold. Once you own a hold, whenever you recruit new followers you can choose to send them to the hold instead of following you around, and same as the house you could build improvements like a smith, stables, etc, and earn money from shops maybe?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also have the Legendary Edition on Steam (free upgrade since I had the DLCs), but I don’t think I have the patience to go through the entire game again. The size of the game and the excellent mod community mean one could very well play Skyrim forever, especially since Bethesda tells us \u003ca href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-elder-scrolls-6/elder-scrolls-6-next-console-generation\"\u003eThe Elder Scrolls 6 is still a ways away\u003c/a\u003e. Unfortunately, there are still a lot of other games to play, and now I’m finally able to uninstall Skyrim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAttached to this post are a dump of my Steam screenshots folder. (These used to be embedded via an \u003ca href=\"//imgur.com/a/ZWNxtnz\"\u003eImgur album\u003c/a\u003e, but I edited the post on 2020-Sep to embed them here instead, for reasons.)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eText editors (and by extension IDEs) are a programmer’s best friend. I thought I’d look back at a number of text editors I’ve used over the years. (I grew up with Windows, so I won’t list vim/emacs/nano here, even though I’m at least a bit proficient with vim by now. That is, I know how to exit vim.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotepad \u0026ndash; of course, the default editor in Windows. The one we turn to when all else fails. It used to be pretty bad at handling UTF-8 and probably just gives up on large files, but for quick and dirty work, it’s sufficient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.crimsoneditor.com/\"\u003eCrimson Editor\u003c/a\u003e \u0026ndash; relatively useful. First editor I used with multiple tab support and find in files. The first team lead I worked with (who I affectionately call \u0026ldquo;boss\u0026rdquo; to this day), recommended this to me mostly because she thought the dog icon was cute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.ultraedit.com/\"\u003eUltraEdit\u003c/a\u003e \u0026ndash; a very powerful editor, lots of features. We mostly used it back then for the superior UTF-8 handling and for the ability to open very large files. However, it has one glaring flaw that prevented me from using it too much: It’s not free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/\"\u003eNotepad++\u003c/a\u003e \u0026ndash; I think this had roughly the same if not slightly larger feature set as Crimson Editor. But it was well-maintained and received regular updates, even up til now. (The latest update was a few weeks ago.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/\"\u003eEclipse\u003c/a\u003e \u0026ndash; ok, I’ll include IDEs in this list. Most of my early career was in Java web development, and our IDE of choice was Eclipse. Slow-as-hell, always-compiling, unforgiving Eclipse. It had a rich features set, but again, hella slow, even among Java IDEs. Still, I spent enough hours with it to become fairly proficient with it and I even published a few internal blog posts on the most useful shortcuts and how to get the most out of the IDE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisual Studio .NET \u0026ndash; I actually had experience with the older Visual Studio versions, since we had a few legacy VC++ programs we had to maintain, but that was minimal at best so I don’t have much familiarity there. But then we had a C# project and I used VS.NET for a while. I didn’t care much for the C# language, but I did enjoy that VS.NET was way faster than Eclipse and especially enjoyed how good the Intellisense feature was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://atom.io/\"\u003eAtom\u003c/a\u003e \u0026ndash; when I left my long-time job and started considering other directions to take my career, I considered using Atom because it was open source and I had long wanted to get into open source, and I figured what better way to get involved than to help improve your own tools right? Sadly, while I liked Atom’s feature set, I was turned off by its incredibly poor performance and loading times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com/\"\u003eSublime Text\u003c/a\u003e \u0026ndash; Sublime is so good. Extensive feature set, good performance. Only downside is that it’s not free, although it was so good I considered actually paying for version 3 at one point. Luckily I didn’t before deciding to try out my current text editor of choice:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\"\u003eVS Code\u003c/a\u003e \u0026ndash; VS Code is great. It’s free and it’s open source and it’s cross-platform. It has a good feature set. It’s super extendable and it has a vibrant extensions ecosystem. It performs reasonably well. I’d say not as fast as Sublime on startup, but way more tolerable than Atom. Once it’s loaded it’s blazing fast. It also inherited my favorite feature from VS.NET, Intellisense! Microsoft did a good job with this one. And I was able to have my \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/61206\"\u003efirst pull request for VS code\u003c/a\u003e merged into the codebase a few weeks ago! (I can now officially claim to be an open source contributor? Lol) I’ve only been using VS Code for a short while (less than half a year) so I’m sure I have yet to tap into its full potential, but I feel it’s deep enough that it will greatly improve my workflows as I gain more mastery over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n",

If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.\"\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother article about it that I like is this Medium post titled \u003ca href=\"https://extranewsfeed.com/tolerance-is-not-a-moral-precept-1af7007d6376\"\u003eTolerance is not a Moral Precept\u003c/a\u003e.

It means that we accept that people may be different from us, in their customs, in their behavior, in their dress, in their sex lives, and that if this doesn’t directly affect our lives, it is none of our business. But the model of a peace treaty differs from the model of a moral precept in one simple way: the protection of a peace treaty only extends to those willing to abide by its terms.

It was supposed to be a straightforward yum upgrade, which meant of course there would be a problem. The problem turned out to be one of the SOAP calls to a third-party service. After a bunch of retries and log checking, we found that OpenSSL was complaining that the third party’s certificate didn’t have enough bits in the Diffie-Hellman (DH) parameters. Complaining to the third party would have taken forever, so we had to find a workaround ourselves.

These days, I only get to play a few, but I still enjoy a lot of the music tracks from this game, often the battle music since I prefer more upbeat tracks. Here are some of my favorite JRPG tracks from recent years:\nRivers in the Desert (Persona 5) \u0026ndash; easily the best song in the OST for me, and the rest of this OST is amazing so that\u0026rsquo;s saying a lot.",
