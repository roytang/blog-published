            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eWhen Game of Thrones entered its sixth season in 2016, it was true spoiler territory for those of us who had read the GRRM books before HBO\u0026rsquo;s TV adaptation turned the property into a worldwide phenomenon. Due to the author\u0026rsquo;s glacial writing pace, at this point the TV series went past the point that the novels had reached. Thus nobody \u0026ndash; book readers or tv viewers \u0026ndash; knew what events would unfold in the story. I usually don\u0026rsquo;t watch the episodes until a few days after they air. On the day the first episode aired I found while scrolling through my social media feeds that one of my friends (who shall remain nameless) posted what turned out to be the resolution to the cliffhanger ending of both the previous TV season and the last available book. It was of course followed by immediate comments of \u0026ldquo;Spoiler!\u0026rdquo; from me and a few other people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people might say, what\u0026rsquo;s the big deal? When you\u0026rsquo;re invested in a story, getting unintentionally spoiled as to future plot points is a terrible feeling. It robs of you of the the experience, as you now go into the story with certain expectations. You only ever get one chance to watch/read/experience a story for the first time. If you enjoyed that experience, you should be considerate of others and not take that same experience away from them. (Unless they ask for it of course.) Sure, it\u0026rsquo;s just a story. But hey, life is stories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe need to talk about what happened in a story is certainly understandable. You\u0026rsquo;re excited about the story and you can\u0026rsquo;t wait to talk to people about it and tell them what you think and speculate about what happens next and so on. It\u0026rsquo;s akin to coming back to school/work on Monday and discussing what happened in your favorite TV shows over the weekend. (Back in high school we probably had multiple Monday morning conversations along the lines of \u0026ldquo;Can you believe Goku is still running down the snake road?\u0026quot;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when it\u0026rsquo;s you and your buddies talking about it over the water cooler after everybody\u0026rsquo;s seen the episode in question that\u0026rsquo;s fine. But in the modern age, we have social media, and with social media comes the tendency to broadcast your thoughts to the world. If you\u0026rsquo;re not careful you\u0026rsquo;re going to accidentally spoil everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m writing about this because of Avengers Infinity War of course. I normally post a spoiler-free review on Facebook after watching a movie, but there\u0026rsquo;s so much to unpack in this movie I had to get down my thoughts and write \u003ca href=\"http://nedstarkdies.com/avengers-infinity-war/\"\u003ea spoiler-filled review over on NedStarkDies.com\u003c/a\u003e. Marvel themselves were well aware of the dangers spoilers poised in ruining people\u0026rsquo;s experience of the movie. In the weeks running up to the movie, they ran a campaign to encourage people to avoid spreading spoilers using the hashtag \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ThanosDemandsYourSilence\u0026amp;src=typd\"\u003e#ThanosDemandsYourSilence\u003c/a\u003e. The campaign included a letter from the Russo brothers and a \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhLsx3BzsvY\"\u003evideo message from the cast\u003c/a\u003e. The campaign seems to have been largely successful, which is amazing to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSide note: I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to watch the movie on the opening day, so it was a bit brave for me to still be scanning my feeds in the days before I was able to watch. But I think I got away mostly unscathed. I will say however, that I do consider as mild spoilers reactions like \u0026ldquo;I need a hug\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;that wasn\u0026rsquo;t good for kids\u0026rdquo;. I mean, that already implies the tone of the ending. But then again, I\u0026rsquo;m probably more finicky about spoilers than most \u0026ndash; these days I tend to avoid all but the first trailer for any movies I plan to watch since I feel that succeeding trailers already tend to spoil too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne last spoiler-related anecdote: my brothers and I are big fans of profession wrestling (WWE). We used to follow all the storylines and whatnot. Back in 2005, up-and-comer Dave Batista (who also happens to appear in Infinity War) got his first title shot at Wrestlemania 21. One of my brothers was unable to watch the show at the time that it aired on local TV. But he didn\u0026rsquo;t want us to spoil the match outcome for him until he got a chance to find a copy that he could watch. We didn\u0026rsquo;t want to download it because it would have taken too long on our very slow internet back then. It took him a couple of months to find a store that had DVD copies of the event. As the lady behind the counter handed him the DVD she commented something along the lines of \u0026ldquo;Batista was so good in this event sir, he became the champion!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAs a programmer, I\u0026rsquo;ve always been a big fan of \u003ca href=\"https://stackoverflow.com\"\u003eStackOverflow\u003c/a\u003e. I asked my \u003ca href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/99271/c-sharp-com-office-automation-rpc-e-sys-call-failed\"\u003efirst question there\u003c/a\u003e and also \u003ca href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/99302/would-it-be-useful-to-include-the-class-name-and-variable-name-in-any-nullpointe/99512#99512\"\u003ewrote my first answer\u003c/a\u003e in September 2008, which was the month the site launched, so I was pretty much there from the beginning. The site was a huge boon to programmers when it first came out, because the internet as a venue for asking questions and answers back then was a horrible fragmented landscape of small forums and mailing lists and sites like Experts Exchange, all of which were terribly designed. (StackOverflow founder Joel Spolsky talks about this a bit in a \u003ca href=\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2018/04/06/the-stack-overflow-age/\"\u003erecent retrospective post\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStackOverflow changed all that, providing a one-stop Q\u0026amp;A site where programmers were incentivized to contribute through gamification and achievements. It became my first port of call for asking technical questions. (My \u003ca href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/18494/roy-tang?tab=questions\"\u003equestion history\u003c/a\u003e says I have asked 98 questions through the years \u0026ndash; going through them was a bit fun, it was kind of a fun reminder of stuff I used to work on through the years.) For the first few years, I was even reasonably active in answering questions \u0026ndash; 44 of the 52 questions in my \u003ca href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/18494/roy-tang?tab=answers\"\u003eanswer history\u003c/a\u003e were from 2008-2011. I even got a few answers accepted! My usage tapered off after that, mostly restricted to asking new questions whenever I was studying some new technology. But still even now I\u0026rsquo;m told that I\u0026rsquo;m within the top 13% of the reputation score on the site. I\u0026rsquo;m far from being Jon Skeet or anything, but safe to say I\u0026rsquo;m an entrenched user.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo you can imagine that it piqued my interest when I came upon \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@Aprilw/suffering-on-stack-overflow-c46414a34a52\"\u003eApril Wensel\u0026rsquo;s Twitter thread on the toxicity of StackOverlow and her subsequent blog post about it\u003c/a\u003e. At first I was skeptical, it felt like an overreaction. I mean sure, there\u0026rsquo;s the occasional rude jerk who responds unpleasantly but that\u0026rsquo;s not unheard of on either the internet or IRL. And as far as I recall, I had never personally encountered any toxicity during the time I was active there and I never felt unwelcome on the site. But as I read more details and examples and \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/8c61bk/asking_a_question_on_stackoverflow_in_a_nutshell/\"\u003ereddit threads\u003c/a\u003e and so on, I got a better sense of both StackOverflow\u0026rsquo;s reputation and its problems. Issues that were difficult for me to see as someone who not only has a long history with the site but also as someone with a lot of experience in software development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one thing, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to recognize that StackOverflow has a beginner problem. Beginners as in beginner devs, especially ones who haven\u0026rsquo;t yet mastered the crucial skill of \u003ca href=\"http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html\"\u003ehow to ask questions\u003c/a\u003e. Programmers have a reputation for wanting to get to the point Given the site\u0026rsquo;s reputation, it can be intimidating for newbies to participate. The \u0026ldquo;Ask Question\u0026rdquo; screen isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly super welcoming. More senior developers might find it easier to figure out what the rules and culture of the site are and behave accordingly, but for newbies or people who aren\u0026rsquo;t super confident I can understand why it might be a harrowing experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that the community responds the way it does to poor questions: downvotes, rude comments, getting your question closed as a duplicate. And probably worst of all is the negative karma score. It can be pretty discouraging for people who aren\u0026rsquo;t used to negative feedback or who have anxiety or lack self-confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePossibly related: everyone I know who does have a StackOverflow account also happens to be a gamer person who at one point or another also indulged in online multiplayer games. I wonder if this points to a general correlation between gamers and people who don\u0026rsquo;t mind the culture of StackOverflow. It kind of makes sense because gamers are used to responding to negative feedback and figuring out the rules of a system. And people who play online multiplayer games are likely used to even more toxicity than a simple internet forum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the week I had this blog post in my drafts folder, \u003ca href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/\"\u003eStackOverflow released their own take on the matter\u003c/a\u003e, outlining some initial steps to improve in this regard. The acknowledgement of the problem and the initial steps are great signs. Hopefully they can also look at improving downvotes (perhaps by requiring the downvoter to provide a reason for the downvote) and duplicate handling (perhaps by giving the original poster a time period to respond to suggested duplicates and indicate if and why he doesn\u0026rsquo;t consider them duplicates.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t 100% agree with everything April Wensel said. For one thing, I still understand and appreciate the purpose of StackOverflow as being a repository of knowledge that is supposed to benefit the community at large and not just the specific asker. And I don\u0026rsquo;t mind that some prefer to trim away pleasantries from questions. StackOverflow optimizes for the future reader, not for the asker. This bears out in how useful StackOverflow is in Google search results. In this regard, I believe StackOverflow has mostly achieved its goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in many ways mentality this makes it inappropriate for certain types of questions. It\u0026rsquo;s not so good for newer devs that need to be walked through their code or don\u0026rsquo;t have enough experience to even know how to ask the right questions. And as a developer starts working on more advanced topics and more specialized libraries, the usefulness of general-purpose sites like StackOverflow start to wane. Over the past few years I\u0026rsquo;ve found myself relying more on narrower forums like the Github issues list for a library I\u0026rsquo;m trying to use, or the vendor\u0026rsquo;s official support channels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps StackOverflow has held a monopoly on the developer Q\u0026amp;A space for too long, and while they\u0026rsquo;re figuring out these things, there might be an opportunity for a new breed of Q\u0026amp;A sites with different kinds of focus to emerge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "As a programmer, I\u0026rsquo;ve always been a big fan of StackOverflow. I asked my first question there and also wrote my first answer in September 2008, which was the month the site launched, so I was pretty much there from the beginning. The site was a huge boon to programmers when it first came out, because the internet as a venue for asking questions and answers back then was a horrible fragmented landscape of small forums and mailing lists and sites like Experts Exchange, all of which were terribly designed.",
