You don\u0026rsquo;t have to speak in front of an audience of hundreds or thousands to practice, you can do smaller steps first, like maybe in a classroom setting. If you are having trouble for example with a presentation you want to do in class, ask a small group of friends if you could practice the talk/presentation in front of them so they can give you feedback. This will give you more confidence during the actual talk.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\"\u003eSpeaking of confidence, another key is to \u003cb\u003elearn how to express your ideas confidently\u003c/b\u003e. This means practice as well, with an example above. But the practice here isn\u0026rsquo;t restricted to speaking, you need to practice this at every opportunity. You need to practice expressing your ideas not only verbally, but also in written form. You need to be comfortable with the notion of presenting your ideas to people. One thing that can help is to have a like-minded group of friends, the kind you can have deep ongoing conversations with. Or join a debate team in school. Or even try discussing issues with strangers on internet forums (be careful with this one haha). Basically take any opportunity you have to practice expressing your ideas so that you have the confidence to present them to an audience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Namely, many of the apps are now basically unusable and almost always crash with \u0026ldquo;Unfortunately, [app] has stopped\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried checking it before but couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any obvious problems (like lack of disk space, etc). I also tried installing an app to check the system logs (I believe it was named CatLog) but couldn\u0026rsquo;t find anything relevant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the past couple of days, the problem became significantly worse. The tablet would always pop an alert \u0026ldquo;Unfortunately, Contacts has stopped\u0026rdquo;, and after you dismiss it with [OK], the alert pops up again, repeat ad infinitum. The tablet is practically unusable now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComplicating things is that it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to get the thing to even boot. If I restart it, it loads into a black screen with the Asus logo and a spinning loading icon and stays there forever. Image for reference: \u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/NBhvZ2T.jpg\"\u003ehttp://i.imgur.com/NBhvZ2T.jpg\u003c/a\u003e. My mom says she can get it to boot sometimes but only after restarting several times (I don\u0026rsquo;t have the patience for it, I\u0026rsquo;ve never gotten it to boot)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve already managed to back up her relevant data, so I suggested that I do a factory reset. So I hold Power and Volume Up during startup and boot into the following menu: \u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/Anb5Kjl.jpg\"\u003ehttp://i.imgur.com/Anb5Kjl.jpg\u003c/a\u003e There\u0026rsquo;s an error message there, IDK if it\u0026rsquo;s relevant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the Droidboot Menu, I choose \u0026ldquo;Recovery\u0026rdquo; and it reboots again. This time it boots into a screen with a dead Android mascot and the text \u0026ldquo;No command\u0026rdquo;. Here\u0026rsquo;s a shitty cameraphone image for reference: \u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/QgOvHkm.jpg\"\u003ehttp://i.imgur.com/QgOvHkm.jpg\u003c/a\u003e At this point, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how to proceed. The Volume buttons are unresponsive. Tapping Power does nothing. If I leave it in this state for a while, it proceeds to try to boot and gets stuck again at the loading icon I showed in the first image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny advice as to how I can get this tablet back into a usable state?\u003c/p\u003e\n",
