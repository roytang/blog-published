For some people, programming is just a job: they come in, they do what they\u0026rsquo;re told to do, and go home. They don\u0026rsquo;t want to think about process involvement or anything like that.

It\u0026rsquo;s not really about talented/experienced programmers and more of about the company culture - although that will be driven largely by the senior programmers in the company. I would also prioritize working in companies that are primarily programming shops, instead of say, a programming department in a bank or some other type of business. Programming shops will be more focused on the dev process as one of their priorities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\"\u003eOr if you like your job and don\u0026rsquo;t want to leave, you can also try to persist. Don\u0026rsquo;t be obnoxious, but every so often when some problem is encountered you can say \u0026ldquo;we could have avoided this if we have done X\u0026rdquo; or something like that. Get to know the senior software developers on your team and try to discuss programming practices with them.

The book starts off with a lot of action before settling into a phase where the three protagonists wander around a lot and sleep in tents and finally into a big showdown at Hogwarts with virtually every character in the series showing up for one big brawl. It\u0026rsquo;s fun to read, but I\u0026rsquo;d love to see it in the film too (soon!). I\u0026rsquo;m a bit ambivalent about how Severus Snape was handled, with the author basically treating him as a bad guy the entire series only to flip him at the last minute. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that Alan Rickman died before I finished the series - before Alan Rickman\u0026rsquo;s death I was unaware that Snape was a beloved character and being aware meant I knew he had to do a face turn at some point. The ending was satisfying enough, pretty good for a fantasy series actually; but I would\u0026rsquo;ve hoped for more details on what happened to the rest of the cast nineteen years later. We basically only got endings for Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione and Draco. Overall the series was pretty good, and covered some ground I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have expected for a children\u0026rsquo;s/young adult series.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/18436248-roy-tang\"\u003eView all my reviews\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",
