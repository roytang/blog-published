My first run was with the vanilla version of the game when it first came out in 2011 (yup, I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing this game on and off for 7 years), and during this second run I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to complete the DLC content as well.

I’m actually also one achievement away from completing this, which is the draft master one. I started my draft master run about a week ago with around 42,000 gold, let’s see if that’s enough to get me there by end of month. So far I’m at 16,000+ gold left and only at gold, doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem likely I can make it. The new draft format seems fun though. I’ve actually gotten a lot of playtime out of Eternal considering it’s F2P for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#b0b383929eb8e0d122a6b04902c4a234-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/07/july-2018-gaming-update-from-2011/20171025204940_1_hu2d2758c3b03a808e9e4dc046ae5d2fc4_437474_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"I\u0026#39;ve actually played enough Eternal that I regularly make Master rank (usually within the last week of the month) and my favorite was when I beat the top-ranked player at that time (I mulliganned this hand obviously)\" title=\"I\u0026#39;ve actually played enough Eternal that I regularly make Master rank (usually within the last week of the month) and my favorite was when I beat the top-ranked player at that time (I mulliganned this hand obviously)\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve actually played enough Eternal that I regularly make Master rank (usually within the last week of the month) and my favorite was when I beat the top-ranked player at that time (I mulliganned this hand obviously) (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"b0b383929eb8e0d122a6b04902c4a234-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2018/07/july-2018-gaming-update-from-2011/20171025204940_1.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;ve actually played enough Eternal that I regularly make Master rank (usually within the last week of the month) and my favorite was when I beat the top-ranked player at that time (I mulliganned this hand obviously)\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"16 Jul 2018 1:00am\"\u003e16 Jul 2018 1:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill doing my once a week \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/310950/Street_Fighter_V/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStreet Fighter V\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e sessions, although it’s really tough to find online matches, not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s because I\u0026rsquo;m perpetually stuck in bronze.

I mean, when people ask if I\u0026rsquo;m getting a Nintendo Switch and there\u0026rsquo;s like Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Octopath Traveller, Mario Odyssey and so on, which is like two or three hundred hours of gameplay altogether, where am I gonna find time for that? Kingdom Hearts 3 is coming out early next year and I still have maybe another 100-200 hours of games from the 1.5+2.5 collection to get through. The one upcoming release that I am seriously tempted by is Insomniac\u0026rsquo;s PS4 Spider-Man game (no surprise there). Somehow when I was in college I had time to play lots of RPGs and stuff, but being a working guy really eats away at your gaming time.
