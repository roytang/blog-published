The gaming industry has also grown exponentially since then, with many more high-quality \u0026ldquo;must play\u0026rdquo; releases per year. As a result, I\u0026rsquo;ve accumulated a signficant gaming collection and backlog, most of it on PC, but some on consoles too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#5a5a2f68627ba15131cd22c9dd07dad6-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/gaming-backlogs/steam-backlog_hu63af5ca40a1dfa16174803efc09e4844_294301_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"5a5a2f68627ba15131cd22c9dd07dad6-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/gaming-backlogs/steam-backlog.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"26 Dec 2018 5:56am\"\u003e26 Dec 2018 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s all sorts of ways to get extra games, mostly on PC:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSteam sales. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are some games I\u0026rsquo;ve purchased off Steam sales that seemed like a good idea at the time but still haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten around to after years and years. Ever since Steam introduced (cheaper) regional pricing, it\u0026rsquo;s been a lot harder to resist the sales\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHumble Bundles. I really enjoyed humble bundles when they first came out, they had some great indie games like Bastion and Braid. Recently their bundles have dipped a bit in quality, and there\u0026rsquo;s been a bunch of repeats, but I still get a bundle every now and then. Reviewing my previous bundle purchases just now, I\u0026rsquo;ve had some steam keys that I haven\u0026rsquo;t activated since 2010!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also decided to try subscribing to Humble Monthly some time this year, mostly to get Tales of Berseria (which unsurprisingly I haven\u0026rsquo;t played it yet). Getting a bundle of 6-8 games every month is a quick way to accumuate a backlog. I unsubbed after a couple of months because the quality of succeeding bundles wasn\u0026rsquo;t that high\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe major digital stores (Steam, GOG, Humble) also often have promotional giveaways throughout the year, so that builds up the backlog too\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eon the console side, I\u0026rsquo;ve been a Playstation Plus subscriber a long time, so I count that as part of my backlog too - there\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of PS+ games I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to get around to but haven\u0026rsquo;t yet\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the bundles also results in me getting some duplicate keys. To alleviate the backlog, every few years I even do a holiday giveaway of a few Steam games to friends and family on Facebook (sorry if we\u0026rsquo;re not friends there lol).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m trying to do better - this year I have been trying to work through my older gaming backlogs (I even \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/late-game-review-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/\"\u003ecompleted Skyrim\u003c/a\u003e after 7 years!) and minimize my game spending, though I still did buy quite a few games. \u003cem\u003e(Hmm, maybe it would be nice to do some data analytics of how many games I\u0026rsquo;ve bought/played on Steam year-on-year.)\u003c/em\u003e The lack of free time for gaming is a serious problem too, combined with a few other factors:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emy tendency to want to get all the achievements for a game often significantly increases the playtime per game\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003elong-term games that reward daily grinding (a more common theme these days) take up some of my gaming time as well. The most recent culprits are \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/\"\u003eEternal\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/mtg-arena/\"\u003eMTG Arena\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003enew games coming out that I want to play lol\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRealistically, I\u0026rsquo;ll never be able to got through my entire Steam collection in my lifetime, but I can try! Maybe I should do something like go through all the small games first, and just immediately stop playing if I find them not to my liking. (This is a bit difficult for me since I dislike giving up on things). Hmm, that\u0026rsquo;s an idea. What if I do a Twitch/Youtube channel where I feature and try out lesser-known indie games on Steam? I certainly have a whole lot of them! Something to consider for the future!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Filipinos are well-known for celebrating the longest Christmas season, with decorations and Christmas songs starting to become common around September. The most well-known meme around this time is about the song \u003cem\u003eChristmas in our Hearts\u003c/em\u003e by Jose Mari Chan, which is one of the songs malls often play during the season. Many memes leading up to December or even earlier imply Jose Mari Chan preparing to strike on unsuspecting Filipinos.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTraffic in Metro Manila, already pretty terrible, often gets much worse in December. I usually take lots of days off \u003cem\u003e(sometimes even the whole month)\u003c/em\u003e to avoid this. The malls are jam packed as well, same as the roads. It gets much better right after Christmas, in the week leading up to New Year. That week between Christmas and New Year is probably the second lightest week in the year traffic-wise (second only to whenever Holy Week is).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA Filipino-only tradition are the so-called \u003cem\u003eSimbang Gabi\u003c/em\u003e, a series of early morning or late-night masses that many Catholics try to complete from Dec 16 to Dec 24. I\u0026rsquo;m an RC, but I dislike going to these because there\u0026rsquo;s always so many people. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve gone to one of these in around two decades.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn annoying thing, at least in Metro Manila, is the Metro Manila Film Festival. While I have nothing against Filipino films even though I don\u0026rsquo;t watch them, the fact that they are given a monopoly during the last week of December means any big blockbuster foreign films often get pushed to January (we don\u0026rsquo;t have Bumblebee yet for that reason), and smaller Christmas releases often just won\u0026rsquo;t be shown in the country. It would be significantly less annoying if the MMFF actually included quality films instead of whatever hot garbage Vic Sotto and/or Vice Ganda are giving the public.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePeople who live in subdivisions get an upsurge of roving bands of kids who sing Christmas carols \u003cem\u003e(sometimes badly)\u003c/em\u003e somewhere between 6-9pm every night in December. They appear more often as Christmas day draws near. We rarely ever give them anything. The sheer volume is a problem. It\u0026rsquo;s not like American Halloween where it\u0026rsquo;s one night in a year, this is every night for a month. \u003cem\u003e(Actually, some of these kids sometimes try this during Oct/Nov going \u0026ldquo;Happy Halloween\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;Merry Christmas!\u0026rdquo;, but that\u0026rsquo;s much rarer.)\u003c/em\u003e Sometimes even while I\u0026rsquo;m walking around the subdivision they\u0026rsquo;ll come up to me saying \u0026ldquo;Namamasko po!\u0026rdquo; \u003cem\u003e(only in the Philippines is Christmas a verb)\u003c/em\u003e, which annoys me as it kind of smacks of mendicacy. Maybe it would be different if some of the kids\u0026rsquo; groups weren\u0026rsquo;t obviously like they just randomly got together and decided to see if they could get some money from low effort carolling. We usually end up ignoring the doorbells around the time when there are carollers, but that seemed unwise. I suggested we just put a sign saying something to the effect of \u0026ldquo;PATAWAD! BAWAL MANGAROLING!\u0026rdquo; but I\u0026rsquo;m told that wasn\u0026rsquo;t nice or something lol\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMost companies in Metro Manila hold some kind of Christmas party in December, so most events places are booked, good luck to anyone trying to arrange their Christmas party late. Common Christmas party fare include lechon, gift exchanges, raffles, and the dignity of new company employees \u0026ldquo;required\u0026rdquo; to render a performance number.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI think (but don\u0026rsquo;t have the statistics to back me up on this) that petty crime also has an uptick during December. Both times I\u0026rsquo;ve been the \u003ca href=\"/2009/12/when-your-wallet-gets-stolen/\"\u003evictim of pickpocketing\u003c/a\u003e were around this time. It makes sense - people are more desperate during Christmas, and the crowds make it easier for pickpockets.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMost of these are from a middle-class Metro Manila experience of course, since that\u0026rsquo;s what I know. Even the poorer families try to get into the spirit, with some even taking on debts just to be able to have a decent Christmas celebration, which for me is a bad idea. I think there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of pressure from society to have \u0026ldquo;proper\u0026rdquo; celebrations, but if you\u0026rsquo;re hard up, even a simply Christmas dinner at Jollibee should be enough.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Some random notes I had jotted down about Christmas:\n Filipinos love Christmas. Filipinos are well-known for celebrating the longest Christmas season, with decorations and Christmas songs starting to become common around September. The most well-known meme around this time is about the song Christmas in our Hearts by Jose Mari Chan, which is one of the songs malls often play during the season. Many memes leading up to December or even earlier imply Jose Mari Chan preparing to strike on unsuspecting Filipinos.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eGift giving is something I\u0026rsquo;m quite bad at. Okay wait, that\u0026rsquo;s not accurate. I\u0026rsquo;m fine with the gift giving. The real problem I have with is gift-buying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not good at buying gifts for other people. The main problem I guess is that I\u0026rsquo;m not good at buying things in general, unless those are things that are of particular interest to me. And since my interests are a bit niche, there tends to be not much overlap with what gifts I think other people will appreciate. I tend to not know what sort of gifts are good or even appropriate to give to other people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a group of people, the concept of fairness comes into mind as well. Like, if I have a group of friends that I regard at about the same level, it would feel weird to me to only give a gift to one or two of them, it seems not fair to the others. This leads to even more gift-buying paralysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other day I was at a mall and saw there was a sale on some DC Superhero Girls Lego sets, and my niece loves Lego and she\u0026rsquo;s also my goddaughter and so I figured I would get her one as a gift. And I did, even though in this country Lego sets at 50% are still a bit pricey. But I kind of had a bit of buyer\u0026rsquo;s remorse, not because it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a good gift (I think it was), but it set me up for an additional dilemma: my 1-year old nephew is also my godson, and now I felt compelled to buy him a gift that has around the same value, otherwise it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel \u0026ldquo;fair\u0026rdquo;. But I have no idea what to get for a 1yo! Looking forward to my nephews growing old enough in a few years that I can give them Transformers!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will probably end up handing the parents a cash gift, they\u0026rsquo;ll understand. Cash is a great gift because it\u0026rsquo;s unproblematic, but it can also seem a bit thoughtless. But anyone who knows how bad I am at buying things will understand. I often give cash as wedding gifts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother common gift-giving scenario in the Philippines is the secret santa/kris kringle/gift exchange that is quite common especially among office workers during Christmas season, usually with some approximate expected gift value. This is usually okay for me, as long as people aren\u0026rsquo;t unnecessarily pressured into joining an exchange if they don\u0026rsquo;t want to. I especially like it when the exchange participants are expected to provide a wishlist - this alleviates my handicap a bit. While I understand the spirit of gift exchanges as a social function, it does seem a bit inefficient to me. Logically, gift satisfaction can be maximized by each person just buying what they want for themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, typically most exchanges will have value requirements in the P300 to P500 range, for which I don\u0026rsquo;t have much options in what I\u0026rsquo;d ask for - anything I want for myself will tend to be at least slightly more expensive than that. These days I tend to ask for some grocery type stuff like \u003cem\u003equezo de bola\u003c/em\u003e or spam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother anecdote, only slightly related: when we were kids, my brother had this gift exchange in school that he forgot to ask my mom to get a gift for. I helped him put together a weird gift out of scraps (to put it kindly). We had fun putting it together, but the recipient did not appreciate it, and I remember he said he got a scolding from the teacher lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, the end result of all of this combined with my usual frugality is that I rarely buy anyone gifts, even for Christmas or birthdays. I will sometimes buy gifts if I happen to chance something that I know the recipient will like (like the Lego example above), especially if it\u0026rsquo;s on sale or at a reasonable price. Most other occasions I think family and friends already know I don\u0026rsquo;t usually give gifts. And in return, I tend to not expect too much in the way of gifts either, although I am of course appreciative of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

And that satisfaction is linked to forming satisfying memories of experiences, and not the fleeting experiences themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, it’s worth asking if we want to be happy, to experience positive feelings, or simply wish to construct narratives that seems worth telling ourselves and others, but doesn’t necessarily yield pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy own attitude towards happiness has evolved throughout the years. I think that right now my personal concept involves some mixture of joy (what he describes as fleeting happiness, enjoying the current moment), meaningful (participating in activies that make me feel sufficiently engaged or challenged), and avoidance of discomfort or boredom. The joy part may be simply things like spending time in the company of friends, reading a good book, enjoying a good movie, and so on. But those different elements live in a precarious balance. I can\u0026rsquo;t be enjoying myself all the time, it would get boring. I need to intersperse enjoyment with meaningful activities. So I imagine in the day to day equation, the answer to \u0026ldquo;what makes me happy?\u0026rdquo; depends on which element of the balance needs to be reinforced at that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aspect of avoiding discomfort or boredom is a bit more complicated than the others. I made a promise to myself some time ago that I would avoid doing things that I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do. This may seem nonsenical, I mean of course you don\u0026rsquo;t do things you don\u0026rsquo;t want to do. Except sometimes you do, maybe because of work pressure, peer pressure, or societal pressure or something else. So I wanted to avoid those kinds of things. But life isn\u0026rsquo;t that straightforward, and sometimes you do want do some things that cause you discomfort or boredom, if they satisfy some other goal. Like for example, you can sacrifice your comfort for a while if it helps you get a dream business off the ground. Or you can participate in an activity you dislike because you know it will make your family happy. And so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis post ended up a bit of a meandering ramble, maybe because the concept of happiness itself is not so simple as we want it to be. I was just inspired to think a bit more about happiness because of the article. I suspect I will be revisiting this topic at a later time, and hopefully will be better able to express my thoughts on happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe happiness isn\u0026rsquo;t a set of principles to be encoded, just simply a life to be lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It would be a fascinating story, if only it weren\u0026rsquo;t so bad for the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis character arc is of someone who rose to the level of this own incompetence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore becoming president, he was basically the worst kind of businessman - a sleazy con man/grifter always looking out for ways to scam other people to further his own interests. A snake oil salesman who somehow stumbled into becoming president of the most powerful country on the planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho knows why he ran for president? Maybe the Russians goaded him into it. Maybe he thought it was good for his businesses. Maybe he thought he could profit off campaign contributions. The most unlikely reason seems to be that he believes he could do good for his country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now he finds himself in a very challenging position, the pressures and problems which could be understand by very few other people in the world. His position is now subject to increased legal scrutiny that could threaten him, his family, and even his con man businesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike many tech guys, I\u0026rsquo;m also acutely aware of the problems besetting Mark Zuckerberg and his super-dominant social network Facebook, mostly problems of his own making. Again, it would be a fascinating story, if it weren\u0026rsquo;t so bad for the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch like Trump, he seems to have risen to the level of his own incompetence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started this software company when he was still in college and somehow it grew and snowballed until he was in charge of the most powerful communication platform on the planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t start out with noble intentions, calling his users \u0026ldquo;dumbfucks\u0026rdquo; and everything, so it\u0026rsquo;s no surprise he and his company made a lot of stumbles along the way, many of them only coming out just now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe surely had no idea that his proposed advertising business model and his mission of connecting the world would lead to fake news, Russian collusion, and numerous privacy problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis position as head of Facebook leads to pressures and problems which could be understand by very few other people in the world. And now he finds himself under increased legal scrutiny that could threaten his business model, his company, and even his legacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeday (perhaps soon), Trump and Zuckerberg will be held to account for their failings. Until then, the world is being moved by men who were completely unprepared for their positions and are basically making it up as they go along. (Of course, many, many people are making it up as they go along\u0026hellip;). I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if there any lessons to be learned from these observations, but maybe it\u0026rsquo;s just a stark reminder that a man\u0026rsquo;s reach cannot exceed his grasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThe other day I was passing through the \u003ca href=\"/2018/10/the-qc-memorial-circle/\"\u003eQC memorial circle\u003c/a\u003e (as is my wont) and I decided to walk around the \u003cem\u003etiangge\u003c/em\u003e/flea market that\u0026rsquo;s often there. It seemd larger than usual that day, so I figured I should finally take a look. And in the process I remembered what I dislike about local flea markets: 90% of the stalls are selling some form of clothes (which I have no interest in browsing - maybe if these stalls sold something my size for once!) and maybe 9.9% are selling cheap knockoff toys (which \u003cem\u003emight\u003c/em\u003e interest me if they were free or such) or cellphone accessories. And maybe, on a rare 0.1% occassion, a stall will have something I\u0026rsquo;m interested in browsing: used books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like browsing books for sale. Never mind that I already have too many books to read already. Used book sales are not very common in Metro Manila. I mean, there\u0026rsquo;s the big franchise stores in the mall like National Bookstore or Fully Booked or Powerbooks, but given that I alreayd have too many books to read and how frugal I am, I rarely buy from those stores these days (though I still do browse through them often).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsed books sales, especially of the random pop-up kind, are a different matter. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit like treasure hunting in a way, where you\u0026rsquo;re hoping toe be lucky enough to find a bargain (I suppose this is how people who like browsing for clothes feel like at these flea markets).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsed book sales aren\u0026rsquo;t very common around here, sadly. There\u0026rsquo;s Book Sale branches in the malls of course, but their selection often isn\u0026rsquo;t very good. Yes, I\u0026rsquo;m picky too! I\u0026rsquo;m usually looking for stuff like science fiction, fantasy, or comics. Or maybe an interesting autobiography or nonfiction book - probably the best purchase I ever made at a Book Sale was getting a copy of \u003cem\u003eThe Rock Says\u003c/em\u003e, The Rock\u0026rsquo;s autobiography for cheap (I still have that book around here somewhere).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere also used to be a small used book store called Chapter IX at a small commercial center near where I live. They had a very good selection, a lot of it sci-fi and fantasy. Their prices weren\u0026rsquo;t super cheap though, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t buy much from them. My copy of \u003cem\u003eDune\u003c/em\u003e came from there. Sadly it isn\u0026rsquo;t there anymore. I think they\u0026rsquo;re mostly just selling books online via Facebook now. Browsing through book pictures online doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel the same as rummaging through stacks of used books - it feels more like intentional buying rather than the browsing I enjoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s another used book store that I sometimes go to called Bookay-Ukay in Teacher\u0026rsquo;s Village. It\u0026rsquo;s okay - the selection is definitely better than Book Sale. They have some comics and sometimes video game guides too (I like those too!). I think I\u0026rsquo;ve bought at least one pocketbook from them and a couple of comics/guides. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if they\u0026rsquo;re still around - the last time I passed by there it was closed, but they seem to have weird hours so IDK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best used book sale I ever found in the Metro was this pop-up stall that I only saw at the Greenfield market near Shaw Boulevard. This was back when Geekfight was doing regular \u003ca href=\"/2013/03/scenes-from-a-quiz-night/\"\u003equiz nights\u003c/a\u003e on Fridays in that area. A number of stalls would be set up there around the Friday night entertainment. Most of the stalls would be food or clothing (as per usual) but there was always at least one stall, sometimes two, selling used books. They both had pretty good selections too, I ended up buying quite a bit from them. I remember buying a couple of Discworld books, some old-school CYOA and \u003cem\u003eHeir to the Empire\u003c/em\u003e (the first Thrawn book) from there. Geekfight stopped doing their quiz nights there after a while though, and since I no longer work in Ortigas, I never really pass anywhere near that area anymore, so I don\u0026rsquo;t know if those used book stalls are still a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI always keep an eye out for book stores, used or not, even when I\u0026rsquo;m travelling in another country. During my first night on my \u003ca href=\"/2004/05/so-i-went-to-hk/\"\u003efirst trip abroad\u003c/a\u003e, I walked a few blocks around the neighborhood where I was staying and was happy to find a small hole-in-the-wall book store just a couple of streets away. Of course, all the books were in Chinese! During \u003ca href=\"/2015/03/europe-trip-2015/\"\u003emy Europe trip\u003c/a\u003e, I remember walking along the Seine in Paris and I came along a series of pop-up stalls in some kind of mini-flea market near the river side. Quite a few of them were selling old and/or used books, many of them French, some in English, and I think there were some Asterix comics in Italian I think. I didn\u0026rsquo;t end up buying anything, but it was fun. I also remember finding quite a few used book stores in the Camden Market in London while I was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, travel tip: you can type \u0026ldquo;book stores near me\u0026rdquo; in Google Maps to see nearby book stores (or any other kind of stores I guess). I do this a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish book stores were more common around here, but I can understand why they aren\u0026rsquo;t too popular. Books often aren\u0026rsquo;t a high priority for the Filipino masses, given all the other challenges in life. I\u0026rsquo;m very lucky to have grown up with parents who not only instilled a love of reading in me, but also had the budget to buy me books all the time. Sadly, these days I don\u0026rsquo;t read too many books anymore (I blame the internet). Hopefully that\u0026rsquo;s something I can correct next year.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine working as something like a security guard or a cashier (aside from the low pay obviously). This is why programming is great for me a career - it\u0026rsquo;s highly skill intensive and at the same time there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of variance because you\u0026rsquo;re almost never solving the same problem twice. And if you are encountering the same problems repeatedly, then you have a new problem to solve - how to stop those problems from repeating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLove of variance can be a double-edged sword though.

At the moment, only the cards from the \u003ca href=\"https://whatsinstandard.com/\"\u003ecurrent standard\u003c/a\u003e are currently available (sets from the previous rotation were available during the closed beta.) Granted, the MTG ruleset is a complicated beast, so they probably have a few bugs hidden away there somewhere but for the most part it is a faithful conversion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe client looks and feels great, a much more modern platform compared to the ugly rustbucket that is MTGO, they really built upon what they started with Duels. Some of the QoL improvements from both Duels and MTGO carry over (mostly Duels). Autotapping of lands and autopass of priority when you have nothing to play are enabled by default. I\u0026rsquo;m always worried that the autotapper will screw something up and leave me in a bad position, but so far that hasn\u0026rsquo;t happened. You can add stops to opponent\u0026rsquo;s upkeep, draw, first and second mains, and end step, same as MTGO. \u0026ldquo;Attack All\u0026rdquo; is available, though I wish it worked better with planeswalkers. When cards from your opponent\u0026rsquo;s hand are revealed, they stay revealed (you can hover over the opponent\u0026rsquo;s hand to zoom in) until they leave that zone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a few issues with the presentation though:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003etriggered abilities could have more options to better handle when they trigger multiple times. One of the worst offenders is \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Ajani%27s%20Pridemate\" target=\"_new\"\u003eAjani's Pridemate\u003c/a\u003e, which is in one of the better starter decks. The triggered ability requires a player confirmation every time, which can be annoying when the Pridemate triggers multiple times on complicated boards. There should be an option like \u0026ldquo;Always take this action\u0026rdquo;, similar to MTGO\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Always yield\u0026rdquo; for triggered abilities\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003etimeouts need a lot of work. The main issue is that the timers still count down while the client is animating effects and you can\u0026rsquo;t do anything. That time really shouldn\u0026rsquo;t count against you.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edamage dealt to creatures and toughness penalties are presented the same way, as lowered red toughness numbers on the creature itself, even though rules-wise they are actually different - the main difference being indestructible doesn\u0026rsquo;t prevent death due to 0 toughness or less. I\u0026rsquo;ve already seen at least one confused newbie on reddit trying to figure out how indestructibility works and being confused because of this.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"new-player-experience-and-economy\"\u003eNew Player Experience and Economy\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNPE is okay. You get a bunch of starter decks, one for each color and color pair. Same as Eternal actually. The starter decks also provide some decent cards to start out your collection, with some mythics even. Some useful cards they provide include \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=History%20of%20Benalia\" target=\"_new\"\u003eHistory of Benalia\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Rekindling%20Phoenix\" target=\"_new\"\u003eRekindling Phoenix\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Settle%20the%20Wreckage\" target=\"_new\"\u003eSettle the Wreckage\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Vraska%27s%20Contempt\" target=\"_new\"\u003eVraska's Contempt\u003c/a\u003e IDK what they\u0026rsquo;re going to do when there\u0026rsquo;s a rotation and the starter decks don\u0026rsquo;t work anymore. Well actually, I guess I don\u0026rsquo;t know what they plan to do for rotation at all, so we\u0026rsquo;ll just see what happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSame as Hearthstone and Eternal, there\u0026rsquo;s daily quests to help you earn gold, and you can win gems from some events, so there\u0026rsquo;s that. You also get a free pack every five wins, with a cap of three such packs per week. I haven\u0026rsquo;t done the math but I\u0026rsquo;d say the rewards system is slightly more generous than Hearthstone, but way less generous than Eternal. You also get some rewards for each win for the day, but this drops off quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weird thing is they didn\u0026rsquo;t go with a \u0026ldquo;dusting\u0026rdquo; system for extra cards, which is how other CCGs usually do it. Crafting is instead done using rarity-specific \u0026ldquo;wildcards\u0026rdquo; which you can open from booster packs. This leads to the so-called \u0026ldquo;fifth card problem\u0026rdquo;, where whenever you open the fifth copy of a card from a booster pack, it literally has no use for you. They have scheduled a \u0026ldquo;duplicate protection\u0026rdquo; update to fix this sometime around 1Q2019, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if that\u0026rsquo;ll work out. I hope they also think about some mechanism for \u0026ldquo;cashing out\u0026rdquo; your rotating cards since they need to implement rotations less than a year from now, but I\u0026rsquo;m even less hopeful about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"limited-play\"\u003eLimited Play\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s draft and sealed options available, with formats (the sets being opened) rotating every two weeks. When I started out I played mostly drafts (as soon as I had the gold, I would draft), since I didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough of a collection yet to make a decent constructed deck. The draft experience isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly the same as paper though. For one thing, you\u0026rsquo;re drafting against bots, not actual humans. Eternal is able to make draft work vs actual humans, so Arena should be able to do it too. IDK how Eternal does it actually, one would presume the first few people to draft a format won\u0026rsquo;t have other draft pools yet to be passed to them. Regardless, Arena should be passing you packs from real humans whenever possible and bots only when no such packs are available. Still, the draft experience is passable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"constructed-play\"\u003eConstructed Play\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a ranked ladder which you can play for free, both Best of 1 (BO1) and Best of 3 (BO3) options are available. You can also play in Constructed Events, which have an entry fee and offer more prizes, and there\u0026rsquo;s also BO1 and BO3 options there. They also often have \u0026ldquo;fun\u0026rdquo; events in different formats like Singleton or some strange format with custom rules. Kind of like Hearthstone\u0026rsquo;s Tavern Brawl I guess?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe limiter for constructed play is your available wildcards. Getting rare wildcards is reasonable enough - you are guaranteed to get one every six packs you open. Mythics are another matter, you are only guaranteed to get one every thirty-six packs. So for a F2P player (that\u0026rsquo;s me!) you will be likely constrained to decks with lower mythic counts, at least early on. For now, I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing \u003ca href=\"https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/standard-mono-blue-tempo-60563#paper\"\u003eMonoblue Tempo\u003c/a\u003e, a tier 2 deck (really has trouble against a resolved ) that has no mythics and has decent play value. I do love me some aggro control, so this is a fine choice for me for now. I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing it in BO3 Competitive Constructed Events (recently renamed to \u0026ldquo;Traditional Constructed\u0026rdquo;), and have a decent enough winrate that it has always made me profit. Standard is in a pretty good place right now actually - there\u0026rsquo;s a ton of viable decks and quite a few other decks that are relatively easy to put together, like monored or Izzet Drakes, so it\u0026rsquo;s a good time to be playing standard in Arena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s great to have an option for BO3 play. The complexity of competitive Magic shines through in BO3 play, although it takes much longer to play them out. Actually, Magic games in general, even BO1, take longer to play than Eternal (which is weird because Eternal has higher deck size and starting life), which means grinding out wins as a F2P player would be more exhausting. There was a recent outcry when they announced a tweak to constructed rewards that would have made BO3 events much less appealing, basically giving them the same rewards structure as BO1 events, which is ridiclous since BO3 games take so much more time. They walked back on that change though, but haven\u0026rsquo;t announced a replacement yet, let\u0026rsquo;s see if they do better next time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#a86f4560dd1d80de1943c6531f477cb6-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/mtg-arena/mtgarena2_hu0db1b18d28ba084f8cda5ee757be0f34_4028631_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"a86f4560dd1d80de1943c6531f477cb6-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/mtg-arena/mtgarena2.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"18 Dec 2018 1:56am\"\u003e18 Dec 2018 1:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI also have this not-so-competitive BG midrange deck that I was building towards before I netdecked the MonoBlue one. I had already spent a few mythic wildcards towards it, kind of a bad choice really, because the ranked ladder does this weird matchmaking thing where you\u0026rsquo;re more likely to fight against decks that have similar rare/mythic counts. So what usually happens is my unoptimized BG monstrosity gets roflstomped by tuned netdecks and such. After discovering this, I now mostly only play either the starter decks on ranked (to fulfill my daily quests) or Competitive Constructed with the Monoblue (in order to build up gold/cards). I still occasionally do break out the BG deck for fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrote most of the above paragraphs in a draft a week or two ago, and they just recently released a new patch that overhauled the rank system and matchmaking. I haven\u0026rsquo;t explored it too much yet, I hope it\u0026rsquo;s better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"f2p-esports-and-competitive-play\"\u003eF2P, ESports, and Competitive Play\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWizards announced recently that \u003ca href=\"https://magic.wizards.com/en/competitive-magic\"\u003eArena will join the Pro Tour as part of their competitive play offerings and there will be a combined $10M prize pool for both paper Magic and Arena in 2019\u003c/a\u003e. This is exciting for me because it offers a more convenient avenue for competitive play. I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest, I\u0026rsquo;m a bit older now and I\u0026rsquo;m not too fond of playing in big paper MTG tournaments anymore. You have to travel somewhere, and it\u0026rsquo;s often hot and crowded and I have to shufffle with my sweat hands and you have to make sure your opponent\u0026rsquo;s not cheating and so on. But if I\u0026rsquo;m playing from the comfort of my home computer, well that\u0026rsquo;s a lot better for me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was initially planning to play Arena same way I play other online CCGs - grinding it out as a F2P player. But I might be willing to change that depending on how the competitive landscape looks moving forward. It will probably be cheaper for me in the long run anyway - both paper Magic and MTGO are expensive options. So I\u0026rsquo;m hoping WOTC doesn\u0026rsquo;t screw this up and provides a decent tournament experience for Arena. It\u0026rsquo;s especially timely as there\u0026rsquo;s no convenient Grand Prixs near me next year so I was planning to kind of lay low with paper Magic anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"summary\"\u003eSummary\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMTG Arena is still in open beta, and I assume the formal release will be around late 2019, when the next rotation comes in. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably make a follow-up post at that time. I\u0026rsquo;m optimistic and hoping for the best and hopefully all the issues will be ironed out. Arena has the potential to trounce the online CCG scene, especially since Valve\u0026rsquo;s Artifact hasn\u0026rsquo;t been able to live up to its hype (though I might still try it). All Wizards has to do is to not screw things up!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Collapsing into bed at the end of a tiring day is rest for the body, but we need rest for the conscious mind as well. Space for our mind to wander. Space for background thoughts to percolate. Space for the conscious mind to step aside and let the unconscious process everything the world throws down upon us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the decade and change that I was working a regular nine-to-five, that downtime often came during the otherwise torturous Metro Manila commute. These days, I have a lot more free time at home, but even that free time tends to be consumed by reading or some kind of electronic activity - a temptation often difficult to resist.
