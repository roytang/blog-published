This time I wanted to add some smarter behavior to make it more able to figure out when to group files into folders without constantly needing manual intervention from me. To do this, I needed to persist some data between runs \u0026ndash; so that the script remembers how it categorized previous files and is able to group similar files together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow since my software development career has largely been as an enterprise-y kind of developer, my first thought was to just use a database to store the data. I already had a MySql installation on my machine so that was fine, I just needed Python to interface with it. After looking up how to do it, I balked at having to install a new Python library just to connect to MySql and reconsidered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs programmers, we have a tendency sometimes to over-engineer solutions because that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re used to doing. Did I really need a database for this? The data won\u0026rsquo;t be very big, and I won\u0026rsquo;t need to do any sort of maintenance on it, so maybe a simpler solution was in order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ended up just using pickle, which was already built-in to Python:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-python\" data-lang=\"python\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#66d9ef\"\u003edef\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan style=\"color:#a6e22e\"\u003eload_db\u003c/span\u003e():\n\tall_series \u003cspan style=\"color:#f92672\"\u003e=\u003c/span\u003e {}\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color:#66d9ef\"\u003ewith\u003c/span\u003e open(DATABASE_FILE, \u003cspan style=\"color:#e6db74\"\u003e\u0026#39;rb\u0026#39;\u003c/span\u003e) \u003cspan style=\"color:#66d9ef\"\u003eas\u003c/span\u003e handle:\n\t\tall_series \u003cspan style=\"color:#f92672\"\u003e=\u003c/span\u003e pickle\u003cspan style=\"color:#f92672\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003eload(handle)\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color:#66d9ef\"\u003ereturn\u003c/span\u003e all_series\n\n\u003cspan style=\"color:#66d9ef\"\u003edef\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan style=\"color:#a6e22e\"\u003esave_db\u003c/span\u003e(all_series):\n\t\u003cspan style=\"color:#66d9ef\"\u003ewith\u003c/span\u003e open(DATABASE_FILE, \u003cspan style=\"color:#e6db74\"\u003e\u0026#39;wb\u0026#39;\u003c/span\u003e) \u003cspan style=\"color:#66d9ef\"\u003eas\u003c/span\u003e handle:\n\t\tpickle\u003cspan style=\"color:#f92672\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003edump(all_series, handle, protocol\u003cspan style=\"color:#f92672\"\u003e=\u003c/span\u003epickle\u003cspan style=\"color:#f92672\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003eHIGHEST_PROTOCOL)\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e(Above code \u003cem\u003eprobably\u003c/em\u003e gives you an idea what kind of files I\u0026rsquo;m sorting\u0026hellip; )\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an added benefit, I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to design any database schemas or tables or whatnot, pickle just lets me serialize the map as-is and reload it later from disk without any hassle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess my lesson here was: don\u0026rsquo;t over-complicate things when something simple will work fine.

Churchill\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the current world political climate, it seems that in many instances democracy and the related values (equality, human rights, and so on) are increasingly taking a back seat to populism and increasingly authoritarian leaderships. One sometimes has to consider whether authoritarian states would in fact be more effective in this day and age. After all, China\u0026rsquo;s ascension as a world power shows that even authoritarian states are able to achieve great gains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe allure of authoritarianism is understandable for anyone who\u0026rsquo;s been exposed to problematic democracies: progress is often held back by countless deliberations, committee meetings, legislative mills, and various other processes that mean elected officials are able to accomplish very little until it\u0026rsquo;s time again for them to think about the next election.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe authoritarian state on the other hand has the advantage of being able to push a singular vision, since it has concentrated power unto itself, it can set aside any dissent and other discussion, put its foot down and say \u0026ldquo;this is what we\u0026rsquo;re doing, let\u0026rsquo;s do it.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess it might also seem to be easier on an individual level? You just have to trust your leadership (since you probably don\u0026rsquo;t have a choice) and not think too hard about things other than what\u0026rsquo;s going on in your own life. This is probably also why authoritarian states are more likely to try to get away with rights violations and such \u0026ndash; people are more concerned with their own survival and their own lives and not too worry too much about the things the state is doing to \u0026ldquo;other people\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe risk of course of such a single-minded \u0026ldquo;getting things done\u0026rdquo; attitude is: you might not be doing the right thing. When the state has concentrated power unto itself, there is a tendency to promote only those ideas and projects and whatnot that adhere to the state\u0026rsquo;s singular vision. Another problem is that anyone who dissents or holds different values than the authoritarian state\u0026rsquo;s singular vision can be labelled or vilified as enemies of progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAuthoritarian states also have the tendency to set aside values commonly held in democratic states: freedom of expression and religion, human rights and equality, and so on, if they are seen to hinder progress. I guess you have to consider whether as a society, you are willing to sacrifice these values in the name of getting things done. And it\u0026rsquo;s sad when you find that many of your countrymen don\u0026rsquo;t consider democratic values all that important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemocracy on the other hand, due to the nature of (in theory) every voice being given value, has a stronger tendency towards a diversity of ideas, so that more options are considered and thus theoretically better decisions are made. This mirrors the natural world, where genetic diversity allows a species to more easily thrive and adapt to changing circumstances. In the same way, we hope that by encouraging debate and dissent democracies are better able to adapt to the challenges the world presents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAuthoritarianism is great when you have leadership that you can trust to make good and wise decisions for the betterment of all. But humans are weak and fallible beings prone to faults such as arrogance, pride, greed, and so forth, so more likely than not the leadership in an authoritarian state cannot be trusted. While the same can be said of democracies (since in the real world there are no perfect democracies), at least in democracies we have a greater chance of being able to change the state of affairs to try something new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",

But in shops where most of the testing is done manually, developers can easily fall into the habit of adding the client-side validations (since failing to do so would earn them a bug report) and forgetting the server-side validations altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main problems are that (a) HTTP requests can be spoofed, they do not need to have come from a form submitted via a browser; and (b) even for forms submitted via a browser, the Javascript validations may have been tampered with on the client-side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor explicit validations for which you wrote out some logic (for example: email address must be so-and-so format), it is obvious that you need that on the server side. But for some classes of validation you may forget to handle them especially if they do not explicitly generate errors in the webpage on the client-side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst example: when the contents of a drop-down list are dependent on some other value on the form. On the client-side you probably already restrict the choices such that the user is unable to select an invalid combination so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like a check is needed. But on the server-side, you still have to check that the choice submitted for the drop-down field is a valid value given the other values submitted in the request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond example: when you hide or disable certain fields in the web page depending on some other value on the form. Same as above, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to add a specific check on the client-side since the user is already prevented from doing so by the UI. But on the server-side, you have to make sure not to save or process any values from those hidden/disabled fields if the other values on the form indicate they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be processed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeak validations on the server side are dangerous because at the very least they will create bad data in your system and at the very worst may expose you to security vulnerabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
