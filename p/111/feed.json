But in shops where most of the testing is done manually, developers can easily fall into the habit of adding the client-side validations (since failing to do so would earn them a bug report) and forgetting the server-side validations altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main problems are that (a) HTTP requests can be spoofed, they do not need to have come from a form submitted via a browser; and (b) even for forms submitted via a browser, the Javascript validations may have been tampered with on the client-side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor explicit validations for which you wrote out some logic (for example: email address must be so-and-so format), it is obvious that you need that on the server side. But for some classes of validation you may forget to handle them especially if they do not explicitly generate errors in the webpage on the client-side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst example: when the contents of a drop-down list are dependent on some other value on the form. On the client-side you probably already restrict the choices such that the user is unable to select an invalid combination so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like a check is needed. But on the server-side, you still have to check that the choice submitted for the drop-down field is a valid value given the other values submitted in the request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond example: when you hide or disable certain fields in the web page depending on some other value on the form. Same as above, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to add a specific check on the client-side since the user is already prevented from doing so by the UI. But on the server-side, you have to make sure not to save or process any values from those hidden/disabled fields if the other values on the form indicate they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be processed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeak validations on the server side are dangerous because at the very least they will create bad data in your system and at the very worst may expose you to security vulnerabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The game doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the best graphics (WiiU, etc), but I really like how it looks and how the world is built and all the different environments and the weird and sometimes absurdly large beasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/KnpoEd3.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a whole lot of stuff to do in-game. It plays mostly like a single-player MMO, with party members that act on their own and most skills on a cooldown. There\u0026rsquo;s a ridiculous number of quests and items to grind for, I\u0026rsquo;m even tempted to still continue with the post-game content (if only I didn\u0026rsquo;t have FFXV waiting for me!), as I\u0026rsquo;m only at around 70% completion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story was okay, at many points well-told and hitting a lot of emotional highs (although some of the characters felt a bit over-acted). The ending was\u0026hellip;  well, kind of sequel-baiting. A mixture of disappointment and confusion and hope haha. I don\u0026rsquo;t imagine that they\u0026rsquo;ll have a sequel set in the same universe/timeline, so it felt a bit like they made up a ridiculous explanation that would attempt to explain some of the nonsense that happens in the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s an imgur album with some stuff I screen-grabbed along the way:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/CEbsI\"\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n    \u003ca href=\"//imgur.com/CEbsI\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e",
