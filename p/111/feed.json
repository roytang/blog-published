            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eBack when I was starting out as a software developer, webapps weren\u0026rsquo;t really a thing. Not as much as they are now anyway. My company provided training to new hires, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t get any web development training at the time, even though they already had a few web development projects in play at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead my initial training involved mostly development of so-called client-server software. This was software that was installed and run on the client machine but they would connect to a remote database server. Up until the early 2000s most enterprisey-type systems used these kinds of program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was trained in using mostly two tools:  Borland Delphi and Oracle Forms and Reports. These were the sort of tools that would have been billed as reducing the need for specialized programmers or developers. They featured drag and drop user interfaces to design forms or report layouts. The Oracle tools featured robust database integration that let you drag and drop to associate form fields to database tables and fields. Supposedly even people with minimal training would be able to do the work of application programmers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn practice of course, the only people patient enough to work with these tools in-depth were the programmers themselves. And client requirements always eclipsed the capabilities of these tools, such that expert programmers were still needed to push the tools to their limits and beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTools like Oracle Forms and Reports had a lot of problems with modern software development practices. For one thing, the \u0026ldquo;source\u0026rdquo; files weren\u0026rsquo;t actually text files. They were mostly binary format files with some PL/SQL interspersed, and could only be opened in the proprietary IDE that only Oracle provided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBinary formats meant that while they could reap some of the benefits of source control (namely version history and such), actually figuring out the differences between revisions involved opening up both versions in the IDE and comparing each item/script/setting in the two files. Doing things like global find and replace were also a pain in the ass, especially in systems that had hundreds of forms. It was so bad I remember spending some time trying to reverse engineer the binary format so that I could attempt to make some of this work easier. No dice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother issue was that Oracle\u0026rsquo;s IDEs were notoriously buggy. Their Reports IDE in particular often had me incensed. If you dragged the wrong thing to the other wrong thing, you would crash the IDE entirely. In fact, we had a list of things to avoid doing that would crash the entire IDE entirely. The built-in text editors were so bad, I often had a entirely separate text editor open in a separate window so I could copy-paste PL/SQL code there for any complicated edits. (Back then we were for some reason fond of \u003ca href=\"http://www.crimsoneditor.com/\"\u003eCrimson Editor\u003c/a\u003e although it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as full-featured as \u003ca href=\"http://www.ultraedit.com/\"\u003eUltraEdit\u003c/a\u003e or as reliable with updates as \u003ca href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/\"\u003eNotepad++\u003c/a\u003e) This was actually also sometimes a problem as some versions of the Reports IDE also had a crash on paste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of my first two years of work involved maintenance of Oracle Forms-based systems (with some Delphi work thrown in occasionally). I didn\u0026rsquo;t get an introduction to web development until late into the second year of my career. I was so impressed with web development I made a mock-up of one of the really complicated screens from one of our Oracle Forms projects and it seemed so pretty. I secretly hoped we could convince our clients to port them over to a web application. (1) No dice again; and (2) I probably would have regretted such a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know I would have regretted it because some number of years later, we got a project to migrate an existing client-server system to a web application. The original application was written in Powerbuilder. I figured it was a fairly straightforward reverse-engineer and implement as a webapp, but nooooo. One of the higher-ups decided that to save on costs, we should look into attempting to automate the porting process somehow. We were to write translation software that would take the Powerbuilder source and convert it into the appropriate web application screens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was ridiculous for a good number of reasons, but as a tech lead, I had to look into it and had to prove it was in fact not viable (Spoiler alert: it was not). The first concern was that Powerbuilder also had a binary format. This was solved when I found that someone had already written a tool to export Powerbuilder binaries into some kind of text format. It was a bit crude, but it was a way forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second concern is that client-server form behaviors do not map well to web applications. My favorite example of this is editable grids. These are some kind of excel-like grids that were commonplace in client-side systems. And when users upgrade their legacy systems to web apps, they inevitably expect that their editable grids should work the exact same way on the web as they did on the client-side forms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack then Javascript-backed editable grids were still in their infancy, and each one we tried had their own sets of problems and limitations which would lead to some number of client complaints. Some clients even wanted editable grids that could accept copy-pastes from excel! Yeah, we had to develop Google Sheets! I personally had to roll my own editable grid framework from scratch at least once too. I ranted so often against client\u0026rsquo;s editable grid requirements that a few developers often quoted something I said in one of our internal chat rooms:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cjaeger\u003e you say \u0026ldquo;editable grid\u0026rdquo; i hear \u0026ldquo;problems\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway yeah, porting client-side behavior to a web framework would not have been straightforward. At least not to the way our internal web development framework liked to do things. In order to have any kind of reasonable mapping, I would have needed to build some kind of Javascript rich-client framework (or see which ones of the emerging ones we could use). That also meant rewriting a lot of the backend code to support a bunch of new operations. It was a lot more work than the expected output of \u0026ldquo;a series of steps to easily or automatically migrate PowerBuilder source code to web applications.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I raised that the idea was not viable, I was asked to give a more detailed explanation. This involved taking one of the more complex Powerbuilder source files, putting it into an Excel, and line-by-line explaining how and why that line could or could not be translated into a web application. As an alternative option to an automated porting program they wanted a guide or process so simple that even junior developers with minimal experience could follow the guide and port the programs quickly. I think they eventually went with this approach. (Which was closer to our normal reverse-engineer-and-reimplement methodology.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days web applications are the norm and client-server programs are a thing of the past. They were relics of a different age. The browser is our universal client now, on the desktop at least. On mobile, \u0026ldquo;apps\u0026rdquo; are effectively client-server programs, though they have a different set of advantages and limitations. Maybe in the future mobile apps will converge as well, into a unified browser client \u0026ndash; although probably mobile browsers need to be more feature-rich before this convergence can take place. My historical disdain for client-server programs carries over to mobile apps though \u0026ndash; I don\u0026rsquo;t like to use too many of them, although that is a story for another blog post.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eOld gamer rants follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaming has changed a lot over the years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one thing, there\u0026rsquo;s the internet now. If you got stuck in a game, you just head on over to GameFAQs or some other site and someone on the message boards will tell you how to get unstuck. Or you can even watch Youtube videos on how to do it! (Side note: I dislike having to watch Youtube videos to figure stuff out. I read really quickly so I prefer some descriptive text.) (Side note #2: I have amazingly written about the youtube thing \u003ca href=\"/2006/12/the-next-generation-of-faqs/\"\u003eback in 2006\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the olden days of gaming, there was no internet. All you had was word of mouth and lots of free time for trial and error. There was this guy we knew where whenever we came over to his house he would have some new _Super Mario Bros. 3 _tricks for us, we had no idea how he figured them out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes you\u0026rsquo;d be lucky and you\u0026rsquo;d have a friend who had an issue of _Nintendo Power _or something and there\u0026rsquo;s a whole lot of secrets in just one issue and you wanted to show off to your friends so you tell them all these tricks. That\u0026rsquo;s how word of mouth happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven fighting games like \u003cem\u003eStreet Fighter II\u003c/em\u003e, when they first came out in the arcades, the machines didn\u0026rsquo;t have movelists or anything like they do now. We had to guess. People figured out how to do fireballs by word of mouth. I remember the first time I played it in the arcade, I was jiggling the joystick randomly trying to figure out how to dragon punch. I had to read an issue of \u003cem\u003eGamePRO\u003c/em\u003e to find out how many different throws Zangief actually had. Then \u003cem\u003eGamePRO\u003c/em\u003e did an April Fools article where they claimed that there was a secret character Shen Long in the game (based on Ryu\u0026rsquo;s poorly-translated win quote \u0026ldquo;You must defeat Shen Long to stand a chance\u0026rdquo;). The article had screenshots and everything. What a cruel trick to play on a playerbase where secrets spread by word of mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finished _Day of the Tentacle Remastered _ on PS4 a while back. It was great. DoTT was one of the first PC games I ever played. I was in 3rd year high school when I played the first game Maniac Mansion at a friend\u0026rsquo;s house. Back then we didn\u0026rsquo;t have walkthroughs or anything so we could literally be stuck for days on one puzzle or whatever. We had to try all combinations of inventory items with verbs and environment items. The Remaster even had a command to highlight all interactible items in the environment, that would have been a big help back in the day! I don\u0026rsquo;t know how long it took me to finish DoTT back then, but I loved it so much I installed it in a secret directory on one of the computer labs in high school (we were the first batch to actually have a computer lab!). The Remaster I finished it in around 3-4 hours. I didn\u0026rsquo;t need a walkthrough to finish the game (I still remembered a lot), but I did for getting all the achievements (some of them were very obscure).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m actually surprised with how well the point and click adventure game genre is doing so well lately (what with Telltale leading the charge and all), as you really have to be disciplined with trying to avoid walkthroughs, otherwise what\u0026rsquo;s the point? Well, you could enjoy the story I guess, but it\u0026rsquo;s a point of pride to finish without a walkthrough, kind of. I\u0026rsquo;m still stuck somewhere on episode one of Telltale\u0026rsquo;s Back to the Future. I think I had to open a door or something. If only achievements could detect whether you used the internet to cheat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen GameFAQs first came out, I was very active on those messageboards. In fact, I probably contributed to a few walkthroughs myself. The great thing about these sites is that they build communities of people actively trying to find secrets and explore every nook and cranny of a single game. I don\u0026rsquo;t have the time nor patience to do that sort of thing anymore, but I\u0026rsquo;m glad that kind of culture exists. It\u0026rsquo;s that culture that enables people to push games to the extreme \u0026ndash; speedrunners, extreme challenges, etc. can be very entertaining to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s actually a bit ironic that walkthroughs are more commonplace now, given that games are certainly a lot less difficult than they used to be. \u0026ldquo;Nintendo-hard\u0026rdquo; games are few and far between and appeal to niche audiences only. In the older Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy games you often had to walk around and talk to every available NPC until you find the guy who will move the story forward. These days that guy has an exclamation point over his head and a marker on the minimap and you can fast travel to him too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be entirely fair, when we were kids we didn\u0026rsquo;t really need walkthroughs because we just had so much damn time. I mean, we had enough time to try to hit every single brick in that stage of \u003cem\u003eSuper Mario Bros 3\u003c/em\u003e that was basically pyramids full of bricks, just to see if any of them held secret coins. (Later we found a glitched cartridge that showed us where hidden blocks were, that sped things up a lot.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to have a strong sense of pride when playing video games, I almost never used walkthroughs when playing through RPGs for example. But things change when you\u0026rsquo;re an adult playing computer games. You have real world stuff to do and not enough time, so you just say screw it when a game makes it too difficult for you. Either you give up on the game or you youtube that stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s some sort of mystery lost when you\u0026rsquo;re playing a game and you know that anytime you get stuck you can just google as a fallback. Well, that\u0026rsquo;s the tradeoff I guess. In exchange though, we get a lot more online gaming content these days, not just walkthroughs: we get let\u0026rsquo;s plays and livestreams and speedruns and all that kind of stuff. Sometimes you don\u0026rsquo;t even have to be playing a game to enjoy the content, so that\u0026rsquo;s kind of cool too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you can still finish a game without a walkthrough\u0026hellip; you just need the discipline to stay away from the internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",

(Your clients are halfway across the world.) They\u0026rsquo;re asking why the website is inaccessible. You check via your browser and sure enough there\u0026rsquo;s an error 500. You have to ssh into the server. Half-asleep, you have to quickly comb through the log files to figure out if there\u0026rsquo;s something you can do about it right now or you have to sadly tell the client that the team has to handle it in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody expects software errors. And nobody can predict how they will happen. (If we could do that, there wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be any errors!) But in general you should stay ahead of future headaches during development time by having robust error handling and reporting principles in place for your development team to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two classes of errors:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eValidation errors \u0026ndash; checks on user inputs. These errors are expected, and the most important thing here is to \u003ca href=\"/2016/11/unclear-error-messages/\"\u003epresent clear error messages that tell the user what was wrong and how they can correct it\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEverything else is an unexpected error, which we can breakdown further according to how the development team would react:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0026ldquo;That shouldn\u0026rsquo;t happen!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; the broadest category, usually caused by human errors in coding/configuration or hardware problems. Examples include: database failure, typos in configuration files, different data formats used by different developers, unexpected system crashes and so on.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0026ldquo;Hmm, oh yeah, we didn\u0026rsquo;t think of that.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; i.e., design flaws or unhandled cases. These are errors caused by program flow or usage that was not anticipated in the program\u0026rsquo;s design but are considered valid use.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0026ldquo;That can\u0026rsquo;t possibly happen!\u0026rdquo;, also popularly known as \u0026ldquo;We have no clue how that happened.\u0026rdquo; Most unexpected errors start out under this category then after some detective work (some developers use the term \u0026ldquo;debugging\u0026rdquo;), it transfers to one of the above categories.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnexpected errors may also be either recoverable (the user can either attempt to repeat the operation to continue or use other functions in the system) or catastrophic (the entire system or subsystem is completely unusable.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, what happens when an unexpected error occurs? There\u0026rsquo;s a number of things that probably need to be considered:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe user needs to be aware that it\u0026rsquo;s not an error on his part and that the problem needs to be reported to support or the system administrator.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe user needs to be presented with enough information to give to the support team to allow them to determine the cause and fix the error.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe program needs to capture what information it can to help the support team find and fix the error.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor client-side errors (typically JavaScript problems, but can also be problems in HTML/CSS rendering), all of the above are difficult, since the mechanisms by which you present #1 and #2 and by which you can do #3 may be compromised by the error. Typically for any client-side errors, you are almost entirely reliant on the user\u0026rsquo;s description of the error and the steps that led to it \u0026ndash; not the most reliable source of information, but you make do with what you have. If you are unable to reproduce the error during debugging, you are in for a whole lot of speculation and trial and error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor server-side errors, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit easier than client-side errors. The first two items are typically handled by having a catch-all error page in the application that gives an error code and message for unexpected errors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the last item, it generally means logging, either to a file or a database-backed audit trail (the file is more reliable). Generally we log the error/exception encountered, including the stack trace, and some log messages on each request/page access. A majority of the time, having the stack trace is sufficient. The access logs allow us to back-trace previous steps which might have contributed to the problem. Any special conditions encountered in the code should also be logged \u0026ndash; this helps to identify errors that can only happen under some combination of special conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0026rsquo;t want to log too much information (what to log might need to be a separate post all on its own), but just enough to help the support team determine the cause of the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, the error is specific to the data being used by the users, or happens only in the environment they are using. And the support team investigating the problem will often not have access to that data or that environment, so your logging and the error reports have to be good enough to allow them to deduce the conditions that caused the error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eError handling for deployed systems is already hard \u0026ndash; so make sure not to make it harder on the future support team by having standard error handling and logging mechanisms.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

They feel that they will be unable to find better or at least similar work and will rather stay than risk it. It\u0026rsquo;s a false sense of \u0026ldquo;job security\u0026rdquo; vs fear. It might be true that you have no good options.

It helps you understand your place in the job market and what you can do to improve your position and maybe open up more options later on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBottom line: if you\u0026rsquo;re unhappy in any way (as indicated by any of the signs above), you should at least be looking.
