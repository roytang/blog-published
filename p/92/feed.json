If you\u0026rsquo;re too lazy to click the link above, the Steam Link is basically a set-top box that streams your gameplay to a TV via HDMI, allowing you to enjoy your steam games from the comfort of a couch. There was also a sale on Steam controllers, but I had a variety of controllers at home to try out, so I passed on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Steam Link came in a box that was bigger than I was expected.

You hook it up to the TV with an HDMI cable. You connect controllers or dongles via USB. Some controllers like the Steam Controller have wireless support. Network connectivity is through a LAN cable or via wi-fi. When it starts up, it searches your home network for computers running Steam, then it gives you a code that you type into the computer to grant access. Once that\u0026rsquo;s done, you can stream your games to the TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI first tried it out with a Logitech F710 Wireless Gamepad that I\u0026rsquo;ve had forever, since that\u0026rsquo;s explicitly meant for games on Windows. I plugged the dongle into the USB slot, but had some trouble at first with the controller not being detected or taking multiple button presses to respond. I wondered if it was lag due to a poor network and worried that I had just wasted some money. It turns out however, that the batteries on the controller simply needed replacing haha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen streaming to the Link, Steam uses Big Picture mode:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#a43ca86a3d39a711e12ca4f0ae12e5aa-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2017/07/hardware-review-steam-link/IMG_0211_hua4dc0f1e3b11eee3ac7aaf6d71fa8316_429308_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"a43ca86a3d39a711e12ca4f0ae12e5aa-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2017/07/hardware-review-steam-link/IMG_0211.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"6 Jul 2017 1:30am\"\u003e6 Jul 2017 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI tried a couple of games I got during the recent Steam sale.

There\u0026rsquo;s a highly-competitive entrance exam and we\u0026rsquo;ve always been told that students who make it in are considered the \u0026ldquo;cream of the crop.\u0026rdquo; (I don\u0026rsquo;t know that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever heard anyone outside Pisay say that though.) Students are given full scholarships and a modest stipend, and are required to take a science course upon graduation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe movie was pretty good. It was more or less four short stories tied together, each one focused on a different year and following a particular batch of students through their stay at Pisay. Each story covers themes central to the Pisay experience: the difficulty of getting in, balancing academics and relationships, stipends, homesickness, trying to pass and failing, wanting to take a non-science course, and so on. The movie takes place during the school years from 1982-1986, basically during the fall of the dictatorship. So it also gets to cover some of the major events during that period and the senior year story has a stronger focus on activism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suspect that the movie will be a lot more appreciated by people who actually went to Pisay or people who lived through the 80s. (I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if teenagers in the 80s really used that much slang though.) I\u0026rsquo;m also not sure how accurate it is as a reflection of what it was to be a Pisay student in the 80s \u0026ndash; some things felt deliberately dramatized for the film\u0026rsquo;s sake. (That\u0026rsquo;s fine though.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis movie hits all the nostalgia points even though it takes place in a completely different time period than when I was there. I look back fondly on my days in Pisay and consider that an important formative period for me. It was challenging and rewarding and it was great to be among peers that shared many of my interests and many lifelong friendships were formed. Maybe someday I\u0026rsquo;ll write about the experience more, but probably one blog post wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
