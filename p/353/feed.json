I bounced it once at his EOT, then when he tried to resolve it again, we went into a counter war. I let him the counter war and resolve Jace, but by then he was tapped out. EOT discard 2 from Esper Charm, then untap and play \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Cruel%20Ultimatum\"\u003eCruel Ultimatum\u003c/a\u003e, taking out what remained of his hand.

I kept my Plumeveils in, assuming he would be boarding in creatures of some sort, and he showed me \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Vendillion%20Clique\"\u003eVendillion Clique\u003c/a\u003e.

In game one, I get hit with disruption \u0026ndash; he has all four \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Tidehollow%20Sculler\"\u003eTidehollow Sculler\u003c/a\u003es come out against me. I waste my single Wrath against the first two and immediately regret it when he follows up with a Cloudgoat and a turn later, the third Sculler. I have four lands untapped and am at 9 life, with Fallout and \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Celestial%20Purge\"\u003eCelestial Purge\u003c/a\u003e in my hand. If I let the Sculler resolve and take the Fallout, I can use the Purge to get it back, but then I\u0026rsquo;d take six from Cloudgoat and friends. I play Fallout with the Sculler trigger on the stack, taking out Scully and 3 soldiers at the same time, and RFG\u0026rsquo;ing one card from my hand permanently. I eventually lost the game and one of the bystanders told me that was a bad play, but from where I was sitting I just wanted to prevent as much damage as I can. No, the bad play in the game was wasting Wrath on the first two Scullers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond game I board in Infests, Wraths and the Scourglass. I keep a hand with Plumeveils, Infests and Fallout, but light on permission. He plays Finks into \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Glorious%20Anthem\"\u003eGlorious Anthem\u003c/a\u003e into \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Ajani%20Goldmane\"\u003eAjani Goldmane\u003c/a\u003e into 2nd Finks into 2nd Anthem, and soon I\u0026rsquo;m losing to 6/5 Finks. Not sure what I could have done here; I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting the Finks since I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really familiar with the BW decklist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8-3 games, 4-1 matches\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 6 vs RW (Boat Brew/Reveillark?)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure exactly if this was Boat Brew or Reveillark, since I\u0026rsquo;m not familiar with the difference between the two. Game one he had early \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Figure%20of%20Destiny\"\u003eFigure of Destiny\u003c/a\u003es, but was constrained by being stuck on two \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Battlefield%20Forge\"\u003eBattlefield Forge\u003c/a\u003e and a \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Windbrisk%20Heights\"\u003eWindbrisk Heights\u003c/a\u003e. I take control easily with Plumeveils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two, I see the \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Reveillark\"\u003eReveillark\u003c/a\u003es for the first time and play poorly against it. I lose quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame three is exciting, he sets up some early damage then uses \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Flamekin%20Harbinger\"\u003eFlamekin Harbinger\u003c/a\u003e to bring out the first Reveillark. He starts setting up Reveillark and \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Siege-Gang%20Commander\"\u003eSiege-Gang Commander\u003c/a\u003e chains, and I have to basically sweep every turn or die. I go as low as one life (if he had a Mogg Fanatic in the graveyard) before he finally ran out of Reveillarks. End of his turn, I flash in \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Plumeveil\"\u003ePlumeveil\u003c/a\u003e, then untap and use \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Esper%20Charm\"\u003eEsper Charm\u003c/a\u003e on his \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Oblivion%20Ring\"\u003eOblivion Ring\u003c/a\u003e which had taken my \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Wall%20of%20Reverence\"\u003eWall of Reverence\u003c/a\u003e, allowing me to gain four life at the end of my turn. From there I slowly climb back up, then draw into my \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Broodmate%20Dragon\"\u003eBroodmate Dragon\u003c/a\u003e to take back the almost-lost game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10-4 games, 5-1 matches\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eROund 7 vs 5-color control\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m 3rd in the standings, and the top 6 get Alara Reborn prerelease passses, so I figure I can draw in to the top six but my opponent, who is 4th thinks he won\u0026rsquo;t make it. So despite my being tired from the mental energy needed for my deck, I shuffle it up and go to battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame one I stick Jace and actually manage to go off with the -10 ability, leaving him with tenish cards in his library. However at that time he resolves Broodmate Dragon and I have no defense against it, so I still lose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two I board in Finks and Wydwen, planning to go aggro. He went with the same game plan, so we raced for a few turns, but eventually I managed to take out his lone attacker (Wydwen) and my Finks went all the way for the win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame three, we were low on time. He had boarded in \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sceptre%20of%20Fugue\"\u003eSceptre of Fugue\u003c/a\u003e, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t even bother trying to get rid of them, instead going aggro to try to take him down before time ran out. I resolve Jace to keep from losing too much card advantage, but then he plays the second Sceptre. We go to time during his turn, and he resolves Cruel Ultimatum, leaving only Jace on my side of the board and him with five cards in hand. I untap and topdeck Lilandra then resolve her. He knows I can just tutor for Ultimatum to recover lost life and there\u0026rsquo;s no way he can win in the extra turns, so we get a draw anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt later turns out that I was right; he still ends up in the top six despite the draw, and we both got free prerelease passes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinal Record\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11-5-1 games, 5-1-1 matches, finishing 3rd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePretty good performance. I actually only wanted to get in some practice before City Champs which is in April, so winning the prerelease passes is a pretty good plus. Frankly, I\u0026rsquo;m glad I was able to play all seven rounds without getting too tired. I had to come in at 7:30am at work so that I could get to Galleria by 11, so I only had around four and a half hours of sleep; despite that I was still able to pilot the control deck decently (most of the time), so I guess it\u0026rsquo;s really feasible for me to play control right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looks Five-Color Control will be my weapon of choice in Standard, at least until Alara Reborn kicks in and we have to evaluate the metagame again. I need more practice against BW Tokens and RW decks though, as I\u0026rsquo;m still not very familiar with those matchups (they became prevalent during my short constructed hiatus). Not sure if I have time to play next week, due to some work activities next weekend, so this may have been my last practice session before City Champs!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

More precisely, I love playing Magic. I want to play spells, to match wits with my opponents, to recover from mana screw, to win from one life, to make bad plays then learn from them. I want to become a better player, with better skills and better execution. I\u0026rsquo;m in it for the game, and trading gets in the way of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, it\u0026rsquo;s not the cost I don\u0026rsquo;t like: it\u0026rsquo;s the hassle. (That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean I\u0026rsquo;m not picky on the cost though\u0026hellip; ) I don\u0026rsquo;t want to walk around tournament sites flipping through people\u0026rsquo;s binders. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to keep asking people if they have rare card X that\u0026rsquo;s hard to find. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to have to haggle over card prices. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to have to figure out if I\u0026rsquo;m being ripped off. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to bring around my own binder. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to arrange for meetups during the week just to get those hard-to-find cards for the weekend\u0026rsquo;s tournaments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just want to play. And the fact that Magic is a collectible game annoys me sometimes, because where exists a game that combines luck and skill in an excellent manner, the limitation of card availability creates an artificial barrier of time, effort and money for someone to play competitively. (Which is why I can\u0026rsquo;t play Extended\u0026hellip; )\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is why I love limited. It distills Magic down into its\u0026rsquo; purest form: you show up, you build your deck, then you play. No loitering around card shops trying to find the cards you need, no last-minute borrowing of cards. Show up. Build deck. Play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been drafting on MTGO again lately, and I wonder why they can\u0026rsquo;t have that sort of thing for constructed. That is: you show up for an event, pay a reasonable entry fee, have access to all the cards in your format of choice, build a deck, then play. No trading barrier. At the end of the event, you give back all the cards you used. It\u0026rsquo;s not something achievable in the real world due to potential theft issues, but in MTGO it\u0026rsquo;s completely viable. I understand that doing this would drive the prices of cards and boosters down, but that\u0026rsquo;s only if it were a common thing. If such events were only held say, once every 1-2 months then the impact shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be that much. Hell, if handled well, it would \u003cem\u003epromote\u003c/em\u003e card sales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just want to play. Is that too much to ask?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eRoy will hopefully have something for the coming Standard PTQ season. Finally, a format I can play!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",
