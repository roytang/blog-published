            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI wrote some stuff about Vita vs 3DS in a Reddit post, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d expand on it here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have access to both a first-generation 3DS with ambassador status (this is actually my brother\u0026rsquo;s but he doesn\u0026rsquo;t use it much) and a PS Vita which is only a couple of months old. I use the Vita a lot more because reasons:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe screen is very very nice, especially compared to the 3DS screens. My eyes hurt a bit after a while of using the 3DS (even with 3D off). The Vita games also look a lot better compared to 3DS ones. The visuals are more crisp and colorful, especially for games like Persona 4 Golden or Disgaea 3.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m a Playstation Plus subscriber (and I have a PS3), which means my available Vita library gets bigger every month without me spending additional money. And with the PS4 support coming, it\u0026rsquo;s even better.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNo online account for the 3DS means I\u0026rsquo;m not going to make digital purchases off the eShop, which limits my available library. I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in making eShop purchases that are tied to the machine; I\u0026rsquo;m worried about losing or breaking the system and losing access to all my purchases. This is a severe limitation of the 3DS in this age of digital downloads.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI just find that I like more games on the Vita. I like Mario and Zelda on the 3DS (I\u0026rsquo;ve finished NSMB, Mario 3D Land and Ocarina of Time; the new Legend of Zelda will probably be the next game I play on 3DS), but aside from that most of the library is meh for me. I played Tales of the Abyss and Paper Mario Sticker Star on the 3ds but both got boring for me after a while (I\u0026rsquo;m probably at around 80% of ToA and gave up on Sticker Star at the first boss). I might try out Fire Emblem, and if there\u0026rsquo;s a new Advance Wars I\u0026rsquo;d jump on that. Etrian Odyssey looks interesting but there are dungeon crawlers on the Vita too. On the Vita so far I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing P4G, Disgaea 3 and Gravity Rush, with some Street Fighter x Tekken thrown in every so often. As soon as I get a bigger memory card, I\u0026rsquo;m going to get into Blazblue Continuum Shift;  then there\u0026rsquo;s Uncharted and Final Fantasy Tactics and I heard Zero Escape was good, and I want to try Guacamelee, and one of these days I\u0026rsquo;m going to give in to impulse buying urges and get Xenogears off the store, oh and if LBP Vita went on sale I\u0026rsquo;d get that, etc. People who say the Vita doesn\u0026rsquo;t have games might just be uninformed; in terms of the number of games I\u0026rsquo;m interested the Vita is slightly ahead, and that whole PS1 classic back library puts it leagues ahead.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAchievements/Trophies. I realize a lot of people don\u0026rsquo;t care for them and don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;get\u0026rdquo; people who like them and that\u0026rsquo;s fine, more power to you. But I do like them, though I\u0026rsquo;m not like a platinum hunter or anything like that.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only real downside of the Vita as far as I can tell is that the memory cards are helluva expensive; but maybe that will change this week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd\u0026hellip; that\u0026rsquo;s it. Just thought I\u0026rsquo;d write some gaming stuff since E3 is happening in a few hours. 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n",
