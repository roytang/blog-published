            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAsians, and maybe Filipinos more specifically, have this cultural bias towards trying to avoid conflict. So often there will be people who don\u0026rsquo;t like to speak up when they think something is wrong, either just tolerating it or hoping someone else will take it up. A software dev in another company once told me that he felt like he was complaining so much that he was looking like a bad guy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is of course, a bad attitude to have. If no one speaks up about the problems we see, how would we ever improve? Someone has to do it, it might as well be you.Â And often there will be benefits too to speaking up, for one thing you might get credit for raising something no one else has thought of. As they say, the squeaky wheel gets the grease\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, you should of course pick your battles. Don\u0026rsquo;t complain too much about the little things, but be sure to raise your voice when there\u0026rsquo;s an important battle to be fought. This will give you a reputation such that when you do raise something, people will pay attention. Having a balanced approach is a lot more helpful thanÂ complaining about every little thing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, and of course if someone is doing something wrong, try not to be combative but be a bit diplomatic. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to offend anyone, you just want to do things the right way. And question the action instead of the person so that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like a personal attack. \u0026ldquo;Hey, is that really how it should be done?\u0026rdquo; will be received better than \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not how to do it, you idiot!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to be unreasonable every so often. As George Bernard Shaw famously said \u0026ldquo;The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

You have to be willing to cut your losses and quit early, and just come back and finish the work the next day, when your productivity isn\u0026rsquo;t shot by tiredness and the general crankiness of the long hours.

For one thing, working too many hours leads to poor quality and sloppy work.

Mistakes made during toxic overtime affect the next build too, and the one after that, and those problems cascade into more overtime. They all compound in one vicious cycle. It\u0026rsquo;s better to just do the work in the morning when you have a clearer head to hopefully not continue the cycle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose are just the productivity and quality downsides \u0026ndash; there\u0026rsquo;s also the problem of high overtime levels leading to increased absenteeism, lower health levels, and higher turnover rates\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe realities of business and schedules and deadlines don\u0026rsquo;t always let us avoid overtime, but hopefullyÂ every time we\u0026rsquo;re forced to do so, we learn from those instances and figure out how to plan better next time (or to get the client\u0026rsquo;s understanding to be more flexible with scope and schedule)\u003c/p\u003e\n",
