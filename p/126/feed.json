            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThe software development process is already difficult mainly because a lot of it so imprecise. Requirements are often only vague wishes that the client has, with no regard to the sheer number of instructions needed to implement those requirements. Throughout the entire process it\u0026rsquo;s important to use feedback loops to determine whether development is on the right path. And like all feedback loops, their effectiveness often hinges on how quickly we are able to turn around and give and incorporate feedback into future iterations\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeedback loops happen whenever someone gets to review something of course. Prototyping with the client is the most basic form of feedback loop. Building a quick prototype, then showing it to the client, seeing what works and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t and what the clients wants to change, then iterating into the next prototype \u0026ndash; all of these reduce the risk that we are not building the correct thing in the first place. Similar feedback loops appear whenever someone reviews your design or your code or your documentation\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me personally, the more important feedback loop happens at the coding level. It is very rare for a dev to code to everything in a program (no matter what size) in one go. Instead, programs are almost always built incrementally, in a loop of code-\u0026gt;build-\u0026gt;test-\u0026gt;back to coding again. Thus it is very important to make sure that this build is as tight and as optimized as possible\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of my major annoyances with working with Java and Eclipse over the past ten years is that even though Eclipse has that \u0026ldquo;build automatically\u0026rdquo; feature that should provide instant feedback, in practice there can be significant lag time while the application is built and for web applications, often your local server will need to be restarted to reflect the changes. Given how often devs iterate while coding, even a few seconds of lag time in each loop is already a minor annoyance. Build times of one minute or more will be deadly to productivity, often taking the dev out of the much-desired \u0026ldquo;flow zone\u0026rdquo;. Thus you have to optimize this cycle as much as possible \u0026ndash; with Java/Eclipse/Tomcat, that meant disabling all unnecessary build validations, reducing your application size by removing redundant code and dependencies, and so on. Hardware optimizations are also an option \u0026ndash; I was really happy when the company finally decided to spend money on SSDs for the devs (money well spent)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis problem also happens in the bigger loop of devs coding -\u0026gt; build deployment -\u0026gt; verification by the testing team -\u0026gt; send bugs/comments back to devs for fixing. Often the main bottleneck is the build deployment, so you want this process as fast as possible as well. I\u0026rsquo;ve been on projects where we had the misfortune to have the build process go as long as 2 hours at a time. After some optimization, we were able to trim it to around 30-40 minutes, but this is still pretty bad. During hard deadlines when you have to deliver something the next day, this loop can cycle many, many times, and long build times will be the difference between whether your team merely does a bit of overtime or have to stay until morning. Unfortunately it can be a difficult problem to address, and the fact that the problems only become urgent during the times of greatest schedule pressure does not help. I believe that once you have a large enough system and dev team, having people dedicated to maintaining and optimizing the build system quickly becomes a necessary evil\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA feedback loop happens in a system when you are able to use an output of that system to influence the inputs, which in turn influences the outputs and repeats the cycle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Ideal_feedback_model.svg/2000px-Ideal_feedback_model.svg.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"824\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn engineering, feedback loops are useful to generate steady-state outputs. We had an entire subject dedicated to feedback loop controllers back in college. I enjoyed the topic so much I took the subject twice! An example of the use of feedback loops would be a thermostat that has a sensor to detect the current temperature. Once it senses the current temperature, it compares that with the target temperature and uses the difference in values to adjust the thermostat input. In this way, the temperature eventually reaches the target value\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumans are also machines subject to feedback loops. We enjoy receiving positive feedback. The more feedback we receive about how well we are performing, the happier we are and the more we are able to perform well. This is part of why we enjoy getting paid a salary regularly \u0026ndash; some part of our brain treats money as a way to \u0026ldquo;keep score\u0026rdquo; and as feedback that hey, you\u0026rsquo;re not doing so bad, here\u0026rsquo;s some cash to keep you going!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeedback can be negative too, but the effect can vary based on the person\u0026rsquo;s attitude. If you accept feedback and criticism of your work and use it to learn and move forward, then you can use even negative feedback as positive reinforcement. If you refuse to acknowledge legitimate negative feedback and instead take it personally or criticize the one giving feedback, then you are failing to learn from the feedback and it either becomes useless or in the worst case can even reinforce negative behavior\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuicker feedback loops allow humans to iterate faster and determine which behavior is best to achieve his goals. My favorite example of feedback loops is in games. Computer and video games are very good at providing near-instant feedback. Run into an enemy? Okay that means you take damage, so that\u0026rsquo;s not good. Finish a task? Ah, you gained some experience points, so it looks like that\u0026rsquo;s good. And games will even tell you immediately how far you are from achieving your goal! How many experience points until I unlock a new ability? How much more damage can I take before I die?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople enjoy this sort of instant feedback loops, so more and more systems are using some form of \u0026ldquo;gamification\u0026rdquo; to improve adoption and usage. Websites like stackoverflow grant you points for answering questions. Fitness trackers give you immediate feedback on how many calories you\u0026rsquo;ve lost. And so it goes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe downside of this instant feedback culture is that it becomes more difficult for us to appreciate things that have long feedback loops. And they are already difficult in the first place, since the feedback takes a long time to get back to you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy favorite example of this is dieting. Dieting is hard mainly because you suffer regularly (due to having to eat food you don\u0026rsquo;t like) but the effect isn\u0026rsquo;t measurable immediately. It takes a while to notice any changes, so it takes more discipline to maintain the diet in the absence of that feedback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is why people have systems like calorie counting \u0026ndash; it provides an intermediate feedback to substitute for the feedback you don\u0026rsquo;t have yet on how much weight you\u0026rsquo;ve lost or gained. But it\u0026rsquo;s still an abstract concept and doesn\u0026rsquo;t translate too easily into weight gained or lost. And also it can be difficult to track precisely since not everything you eat will have a calorie count available. I reckon that once we have an app where you just take pictures of the food you just ate it tells you how many pounds you gained or lost, a lot of people will be better at keeping to their diets\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like to look at the activities I pursue regularly and see if there is anything I can measure to help provide feedback loops for self-improvement. This is why I enjoy daily habits that track streaks \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s simple, instant feedback that tells me I accomplished something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, humans are not machines that need to have perfect systems and be slaves to their feedback loops. So it\u0026rsquo;s also okay to break your daily habits every so often or to cheat on your diet once a week or such, it is one of the privileges of being human. And breaking your patterns also provides some feedback which you can use later\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",

Eliciting information also helps to find any differences in understanding which may be affecting the estimate.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve picked up quite a few daily habits since the start of the year. To name a few: I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing \u003ca href=\"/2016/03/sketching-daily/\"\u003edaily sketches\u003c/a\u003e, I\u0026rsquo;ve been going on a daily walking routine, learning Spanish on \u003ca href=\"https://www.duolingo.com/\"\u003eDuolingo\u003c/a\u003e, I have a quick stretching/exercise routine I do in the mornings, etc. (I\u0026rsquo;m also supposed to be writing daily, but this has proven more difficult to keep doing consistently\u0026hellip; )\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like those daily habits that can be easily tracked with technology. Duolingo tracks my Spanish learning streak (currently on a 147-day streak). \u003ca href=\"http://reddit.com/r/sketchdaily\"\u003er/sketchdaily\u003c/a\u003e tracks my drawing streaks. I have an app on my phone that tracks how often I meet my daily walking target (usually the only problem is if it rains)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a productivity tip \u003ca href=\"http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret\"\u003esupposedly advocated by Jerry Seinfeld\u003c/a\u003e called \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t Break the Chain\u0026rdquo;. It recognizes the power of tracking your streaks. The longer your streak gets, the more it motivates (or pressures?) you to maintain the streak and keep it going. It also helps you realize that doing things repeatedly on a daily basis leads to small, incremental improvements that can quickly compound into big improvements\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaily habits can be difficult sometimes unless you live a totally boring life. Most people will have differing circumstances from day-to-day that may cause you to miss your daily habits every so often. Maybe you have an out-of-town trip that makes your daily gym habit impossible, or maybe you needed to go overtime all week so you needed to skip your extra learnings, and so on. That\u0026rsquo;s kind of fine \u0026ndash; as long as you understand the tradeoffs you\u0026rsquo;re making (it is your life to live and prioritize after all)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even when you\u0026rsquo;re short on time, you can still look for ways to keep your streak going. With Duolingo, I usually do it in the mornings on my desktop pc, but if I\u0026rsquo;m busy all day I can do a quick Duolingo session on my mobile. For sketches, if I don\u0026rsquo;t have much time I can pick up a small post-it and do a quick and small doodle. If it\u0026rsquo;s raining too hard for me to go out and take my walk, I can go to the nearest mall and just do a walkabout there, maybe even running some errands at the same time. I\u0026rsquo;m also supposed to be reading books daily \u0026ndash; one of the daily habits I\u0026rsquo;m not consistent at \u0026ndash; but if I don\u0026rsquo;t have time, maybe I can just read a few paragraphs or pages right before I sleep\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDepending on your personality, trying to maintain a streak can seem to be a burden sometimes. You feel like you\u0026rsquo;re becoming a slave to the habit. But as the book \u0026ldquo;The Greatest Salesman in the World\u0026rdquo; implies, humans by nature are slaves to habit, and if we must be slaves to habit we might as well be slaves to good habits of our own choosing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",
