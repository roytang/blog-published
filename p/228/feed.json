When you talk about a car\u0026rsquo;s speed, it\u0026rsquo;s in something like miles per hour right? Amperes are like the speed of electricity (to be specific, electric charge). When you say \u0026ldquo;this wire has 2 amperes\u0026rdquo;, it means electricity moves through that wire twice as fast as one that only has 1 ampere.

Let\u0026rsquo;s say two people carried the same weight of objects over the same distance, then they both did the same amount of work. But if person A did this work in half the time as person B, then we can say person A used up twice as much power (or twice as many watts) as person B\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen referring to electricity, joules and watts typically refer to the amount of work or power that was used to generate that electricity.
