But I do recognize that I have this problem of emotional attachment to a project, especially if I\u0026rsquo;m the main person responsible for it. When working on anything you of course need a certain amount of drive or passion that commits you to the project and pushes you to do the best work you can, but there\u0026rsquo;s a line you can cross where it becomes unhealthy for you. It\u0026rsquo;s when the project and the stress that comes with it starts to take over your life, such that it starts eating up your personal time and you can\u0026rsquo;t get it out of your mind and maybe you even start having nightmares about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key to realize this is happening and take a step back and think about whether you need to let go of things for a while. Maybe take some time off even. Learn to compartmentalize and set aside work when you leave the office. Emotional detachment is a skill I still have to learn and master, but it\u0026rsquo;s essential. Otherwise (as the quoted zen proverb states), you get dragged. That means the stress starts to cascade through your personal life and your health and that can\u0026rsquo;t be good for you. As the HN thread notes, work is not the end-all and be-all of life, and on your deathbed you won\u0026rsquo;t wish you had worked more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;But how can I possibly scale back my involvement, there\u0026rsquo;s so much stuff to do!\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/em\u003e Delegate. Ask for help. Ask to adjust the schedule. Trust your team to get things done. Find a better approach. Regardless, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t sacrifice your well-being for the sake of work. As the airline safety videos tell you, you have to take care of your own oxygen mask before taking care of others!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI actually find this to be a problem with me with personal matters as well, not just with work. I tend to get attached to particular problems or issues and won\u0026rsquo;t give it a rest until I\u0026rsquo;ve somehow managed to resolve the issue. Most of the time this isn\u0026rsquo;t a big problem (I rarely have big personal issues), but some time ago a close friend and I drifted apart because I was insisting that she should follow my advice. I don\u0026rsquo;t regret giving my advice \u0026ndash; I still think I was right \u0026ndash; but I do regret pushing so hard for it, it was her life to live, not mine. (This particular situation led to the creation of one of my personal rules: Don\u0026rsquo;t insist on helping people who don\u0026rsquo;t want to be helped.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small side note: I binged seasons 3-7 of \u003cem\u003eParks and Recreation\u003c/em\u003e lately (seasons 1-2 weren\u0026rsquo;t very good sadly). While I\u0026rsquo;ve always considered myself most similar to the characters of Ron (loves breakfast food, hates government inefficiency, prefers substance over form) and Ben (nerdy, loves pop culture and boardgames and Batman), I realized after this rewatch that I also embody one of the character Leslie\u0026rsquo;s worst traits. And that trait is the inability to detach from her work and even her personal problems. She gets a certain tunnel vision when she\u0026rsquo;s focused on a particular issue and tenaciously never lets go of it. Granted, she does get a lot of stuff done over the course of the series, but more than once the other characters have had to point out how her overzealousness creates problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo yes, letting go. I don\u0026rsquo;t consider myself super religious, but there\u0026rsquo;s a prayer I like, called the serenity prayer, that I think kind of embodies the kind of personal detachment I want to strive for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n    God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,\u003cbr /\u003eCourage to change the things I can,\u003cbr /\u003eAnd wisdom to know the difference.\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n",

We teach students from a young age to follow rules and answer roll calls. We teach them standard prescribed solutions. We teach them how to take exams and how to find the right answers. Even school culture among students teaches kids to conform or be ostracized. Our school systems are optimized for generating employees for industry \u0026ndash; and in the old days industry meant factory workers, who knew just enough to get on an assembly line and put things together. Even today, we are told that the purpose of education is that we need it in order to get a good job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocally, this talk became even more relevant when the \u003ca href=\"http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/10/04/Protest-rally-student-activists-UP-state-universities-PNP-Albayalde.html\"\u003eDirector General of the Philippine National Police questioned why state scholars \u0026ldquo;go against the government\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e. This is a common line found in the comments section of news articles as well whenever students from universities would participate in protest actions against the government. As if by virtue of the government providing for the education of its citizens (as is their responsibility), the students now owe the government an unquestioning obedience and should turn a blind eye to any of the government\u0026rsquo;s abuses. (This line of thinking seems to be primarily prominent during the current administration though \u0026ndash; I didn\u0026rsquo;t really notice people commenting this way during previous admins despite the fact that students have *always* tended to be more activist).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me, this is working as intended. The purpose of the state sponsoring education shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be in order to create obedient, unquestioning citizens. It should be to create citizens that are more discerning and analytical and able to make intelligent and informed decisions about the country\u0026rsquo;s future. And we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be educating people simply so they can find good jobs (although that\u0026rsquo;s part of the reason as well), we should also be educating them because an educated citizenry leads to a better society. (And when I say educated here, I assume there is an ethics component involved as well.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudent activism isn\u0026rsquo;t a bug, it\u0026rsquo;s a feature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Of course, I\u0026rsquo;m not advocating that all students should be required to be activists, just that we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t consider universities producing some percentage of students as activists as a problem.)\u003c/p\u003e\n",
