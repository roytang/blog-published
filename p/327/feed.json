The one time I came in late to work during the month of February was because of Street Fighter IV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStreet Fighter IV came in with ridiculously high reviews for both the XBox 360 and PS3 versions, the PS3 version garnering a \u003ca href=\"http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ps3/streetfighter4?q=street%20fighter%20iv\"\u003e94 (universal acclaim) on Metacritic\u003c/a\u003e It can\u0026rsquo;t be denied that it\u0026rsquo;s an awesome game, although \u003ca href=\"http://www.sirlin.net/blog/2009/2/22/a-few-things-about-street-fighter-4.html\"\u003enot everyone agrees\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to discuss all the details of the game, you can click through the links above to read more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing we always judge our fighting games on is the \u0026ldquo;random fighter selection\u0026rdquo; feature. SF3: Third Strike didn\u0026rsquo;t have it, but CvS2 and we played that a lot more than SF3 (and we would have never played SF3 had our PS2 not given up on our CvS2 disk). SF4 has a random fighter selection feature, but it\u0026rsquo;s a bit substandard since (a) You can cancel out of whatever selection it randomly gave you and (b) I got six Dhalsims out of seven randoms today! That\u0026rsquo;s insane. Also, in versus mode you have to move the selection cursor back to the random slot when choosing the next fighter (mildly annoying)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother neat feature: during versus matches, the game keeps tracks of continuous wins! Street Fighter sessions at home are generally won in a \u0026ldquo;five-in-a-row\u0026rdquo; basis, i.e. the first player to win five bouts in a row is considered the winner and the session ends. So this feature is pretty useful for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;ve tried playing online, although as usual connection is crap between BayanDSL and PLDT players, and the majority of Pinoy players seem to be on PLDT. Surprisingly, my brother was getting good connection ratings for opponents from Japan! The matching features are okay, despite not having double-blind character selection (this more accurately reflects the arcade experience though!) One thing that seems neat although we haven\u0026rsquo;t tried it yet \u0026ndash; when playing in arcade mode you can allow other online players to challenge you at any time, just like a real arcade game!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne last thing: Cammy\u0026rsquo;s ultra is pretty sw33t.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Unlike constructed where there\u0026rsquo;s a lot less variation in the number of interactions, in Limited basically anything can happen so you need to learn to react to a lot more situations. Maybe I should focus more on Limited again (if only it weren\u0026rsquo;t so expensive!)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

After installation I found out that Conflux release events were this weekend so I might as well play, since I was not able to play IRL at this time. I was hoping MTGO3 had improved by now, and that they had sufficient server loading, etc. to handle the number of players without the servers being crashy and laggy and whatnot.",

RPGs are usually rather long games so it\u0026rsquo;s nice being able to handle them in bite-sized chunks while commuting, et cetera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar Ocean: The Second Story was probably one of the best Japanese RPGs to come out of the Playstation era, despite the lackluster translations of that time (hey, it was pre-year 2000, all translations were pretty bad then!) Now comes the PSP enhanced remake, featuring a brand new retranslation, anime cutscenes, new VAs, an additional character, et cetera. The works! I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing it during off times for about two weeks, and pretty much had Claude overlevelled most of the time since I never removed him from the party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the PS1 version I never managed to complete the optional stuff like the Cave of Trials bonus dungeon and the harder difficulty levels due to lack of time. Hopefully the handheld version will allow me to do those things; I will probably play the Rena story on one of the higher difficulty levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe PSP version is spot-on awesome, and makes me want to play Star Ocean: Til the End of Time again. I\u0026rsquo;m glad that there are still some good games coming out on the PSP despite the high level of piracy on the platform (not that I\u0026rsquo;m helping =/) Hopefully Sony comes out with a handheld that can support the PS2 generation of games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar Ocean: Second Evolution is a very deep game with a decent story and great battle system plus lots of extra stuff to do, so it\u0026rsquo;s highly recommended, especially for fans of the PS1 version.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSide Note: Luckily, I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried Star Ocean: First Departure. I say luckily because it\u0026rsquo;s supposedly quite bad. It was a generation ahead of Second Story so I guess they weren\u0026rsquo;t very good then.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
