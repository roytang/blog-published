            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eSome time ago a friend from high school invited me to her daughter\u0026rsquo;s debut. And I had to proxy for her daughter\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003eninong\u003c/em\u003e and maybe give a few words on what it means to become an adult. My first two reactions were (1) wow I\u0026rsquo;m so old one of my batchmates has an eighteen-year-old daughter; and (2) what the heck would I know about becoming an adult? (I guess (3) was \u0026ldquo;oh, it\u0026rsquo;s a debut, so it\u0026rsquo;s formal and I have to dress up? I hate dressing up.\u0026quot;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong. I certainly consider myself an adult. But I have no idea when that transitioned happened. It\u0026rsquo;s not like when you turn eighteen you get some kind of brain implant that magically tells you how to live life and be independent and get a job and be responsible and do your taxes and all that stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf anything, I would say \u0026ldquo;becoming an adult\u0026rdquo; is a continuing task that keeps going on even when you\u0026rsquo;re nearing the big four-oh and beyond. I guess the zeitgeist is already aware of this though, given how we\u0026rsquo;ve coined the word \u0026ldquo;adulting\u0026rdquo;, which basically means doing stuff that makes you feel like an adult. Like going to the bank. Or signing contracts. Or even dressing up to go to a formal event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we were having dinner at the event, I jokingly said I should just give a message like \u0026ldquo;fake it til you make it.\u0026rdquo; I basically feel that\u0026rsquo;s what most of adulthood is: bumbling along until you figure out what the heck you\u0026rsquo;re doing. When you\u0026rsquo;re a kid you look up to the grown-ups who can go out and do anything they want and confidently do all these jobs and they know everything. But when you grow up you realize that\u0026rsquo;s not really how it works \u0026ndash; most of the time all the adults are struggling through life too, trying to figure out whatever thing they have to do that day, or even just trying to make it to the next paycheck. And you\u0026rsquo;re definitely going to miss being a kid. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s the sign that you\u0026rsquo;re already an adult, when you already miss being a kid?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ended up reading a few words from the actual \u003cem\u003eninong\u003c/em\u003e, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to give my own adulthood message. One of my other batchmates gave the debutante a copy of \u003cem\u003eThe Art of War\u003c/em\u003e as a gift, with the message that adulthood is basically warfare so she should be prepared. While I agree with that sentiment somewhat, I think for me the most important thing about becoming an adult would be learning to find your own voice and identity. That means figuring out what\u0026rsquo;s important to you and what values you hold. Being an adult isn\u0026rsquo;t easy, but knowing yourself in this way gives you a framework to guide you in your adulting decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "title": "Web Frameworks -- Open Source or Roll Your Own?",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA while back I \u003ca href=\"/2016/10/coding-frameworks/\"\u003ewrote about my experience\u003c/a\u003e coding and maintaining an in-house web framework at a previous job. It was a full-stack web framework. We had libraries for front-end Javascript up to server-side database connections. And the entire stack was tightly coupled. But while the framework was serviceable, it was almost always behind modern trends in web development. I always felt like we were playing catch-up. And as a developer I wanted to widen my horizons and try out more things. So more than once I had discussions with higher management about using open source web frameworks in some projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, our in-house web framework already had a long history and most of the devs in our company were used to it. The company had tried using a different Java-based framework stack before. It was back in the days when things like Struts, Spring, Hibernate, etc were beginning to ramp up. It kind of ended in disaster \u0026ndash; that project ended up taking a lot of effort, had a lot of technical problems, and so on. I believe this gave the company leadership the impression that investing in other frameworks are not worth the risk and effort. It\u0026rsquo;s a form of \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here\"\u003eNot Invented Here syndrome\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI admit there are some advantages to having your own in-house web framework. After all, all the popular web frameworks today started out in-house in some company and later they decided to release as open source. And many companies do fine using in-house frameworks. Using an in-house framework means full control over the behavior. And you can tailor the functionality and coding style to your internal processes. In fact it can be a good value add to your company if your in-house framework did something better or unique compared to open source ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there are also significant advantages to using open source frameworks. Maybe I should have used some of these during discussions when I was there:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWith an open source framework, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to maintain the core functionality of the framework ourselves. We wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to maintain the full stack ourselves. We would only need to maintain any customisations and extensions we write for our own needs. For our in-house web framework, every so often we\u0026rsquo;d spend some effort to come out with a new version with incremental improvements. With an open source framework, we could instead redirect that effort to higher-value work.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s more learning material available online, and they don\u0026rsquo;t have to be maintained in-house.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a wider base of experience to draw from. For our in-house framework if you encountered a problem requiring deep framework knowledge, there were only a handful of high-level experts in the company. For an open-source web framework, that expertise is widely available on the internet through sites such as \u003ca href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\"\u003eStack Overflow\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHaving knowledge/experience in established frameworks means your company can get more contracts. You can take on projects that use those frameworks. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to spend proposal space trying to convince clients that your in-house framework is great. With open source frameworks you can reuse marketing copy by someone else!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorking on well-known, established frameworks is better for your developers career-wise. It gives them more knowledge that could be transferable to other jobs. While this isn\u0026rsquo;t a benefit to the company per se, it will make the company more attractive to developers. It even allows the flexibility of hiring developers experience with that framework.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are some disadvantages too of course:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAs mentioned above, there is time and effort involved in learning a new open source framework. This effort is mostly for the experienced developers \u0026ndash; for new hires they will need to learn something regardless\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHaving an in-house team developing your own framework means you have a core set of developers experienced in the full stack. Reliance on open source frameworks means most of your developers won\u0026rsquo;t be familiar with the low level details.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, there\u0026rsquo;s no guarantee that using an open source framework will be painless or be better than developing one in-house. So I can understand the decision to stick with what you know. But for me as a developer, I feel that it\u0026rsquo;s more rewarding to be exposed to different frameworks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact I wrote this post because recently someone asked me what my \u0026ldquo;go-to web framework\u0026rdquo; was and I said I didn\u0026rsquo;t have one. I\u0026rsquo;d rather be flexible enough to learn and work with any existing framework. In our industry where change happens quickly and can catch you by surprise, I think that flexibility is a much more valuable asset to have.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
