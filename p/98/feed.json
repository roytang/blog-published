I\u0026rsquo;m not good enough, etc\u0026rdquo;. The plot also takes longer to solidify.

Sanderson expands upon the worldbuilding, mythos and systems from the first book. The first book already had a theme of hopelessness around it, but the second book goes even darker. And as you can expect for the second book of a trilogy, the ending doesn\u0026rsquo;t leave our heroes or the world in a very good spot.
