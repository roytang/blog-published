It was a\nfeeling he regularly had, that of submitting his will to gravity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was falling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, Ranma managed to fall into a convenient clump of bushes on\nthe outskirts of Nerima, staving off any real damage (which Ranma\nwould\u0026rsquo;ve been impervious to, anyway). He jumped up to his feet and\nbrushed the dust off his red Chinese clothes. At least this time, he\nhadn\u0026rsquo;t landed in water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;What in the world just happened?\u0026rdquo; he said to himself out loud. The\nshrubbery he had fallen into was just outside the Nerima cemetery,\nmeaning he must\u0026rsquo;ve flown quite a long way from the Tendo Dojo. The\nproblem was, this time he didn\u0026rsquo;t recall anyone in particular smashing him\ninto the sky. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t even recall being at the Dojo for the last\nthirty minutes. To the best of his knowledge, it was presently lunchtime\nat Furinkan High.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRanma\u0026rsquo;s musings were interrupted by two familiar voices coming from\nwithin the cemetery. For some strange reason, Ranma\u0026rsquo;s brain decided to\nkick in and realized something strange was going on. The female voice he\nheard was definitely Ukyo\u0026rsquo;s. The weird part was the male voice. He could\nswear it was\u0026hellip;himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfused, Ranma leaps over the wall and crosses to a nearby tree.\nSeveral yards away, he sees Ukyo, and surprisingly, himself! They are in\nfront of a grave, and Ukyo seems to be comforting Ranma for some reason.\nDeciding that discretion was the better part of valor, Ranma decided to\nspy on this impostor. Concealing himself in the nearby shrubbery, he\nlistened in to their conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re doing it again, Ranchan. You keep blaming yourself for what\nhappened. Year after year for five years now we\u0026rsquo;ve been coming here, and\nyou still haven\u0026rsquo;t forgiven yourself.\u0026rdquo; Ukyo\u0026rsquo;s voice came to the (hidden)\nRanma\u0026rsquo;s ears. \u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Ranma said to himself, \u0026ldquo;Ukyo\u0026rsquo;s known this impostor\nfor years? Whose grave is this anyway?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he heard the impostor\u0026rsquo;s voice, as clear as his own. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re\nright Ucchan\u0026hellip;I just can\u0026rsquo;t help but remember what she meant to me\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nShe? Ranma wondered to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Come on, Ranchan. It\u0026rsquo;s time to go. Time to move on.\u0026rdquo; Ukyo said,\nmoving away with the impostor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePuzzled, Ranma steps out of the shadows after they leave, then\nwalks over and inspects the grave they were visiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I..it can\u0026rsquo;t be\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, he said, shocked, \u0026ldquo;A\u0026ndash;Akane Tendo\u0026hellip;died age\nseventeen\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. Ranma\u0026rsquo;s brain, which normally could not handle anything\nmore complicated than one of Ryoga\u0026rsquo;s schemes, was working overtime. He\nhad just been with Akane about an hour ago, insulting her cooking. How\ncould she be dead, with her grave here for the past five years? And who\nwas that impostor?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Only one person can explain what\u0026rsquo;s going on here,\u0026rdquo; Ranma muttered\nto himself, \u0026ldquo;Either that or she\u0026rsquo;s behind it all.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that in mind, Ranma ran off in the direction of the\nNekohanten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo find it no longer there. This was even more of a visual shock\nfor Ranma, as it meant he couldn\u0026rsquo;t get free food there anymore. Besides\nthat, he had just eaten at the Nekohanten this morning! Something strange\nwas definitely going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Looking for someone, son-in-law?\u0026rdquo; a familiar old voice came from a\nnearby rooftop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRanma leapt up to the rooftop and found Cologne there. At least she\nstill looked the same, if everything else in Nerima had gone crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s going on, old ghoul?\u0026rdquo; Ranma spat out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Ah, son-in-law, you are as impolite as ever, in any time.\u0026rdquo; Cologne\nremarked, \u0026ldquo;And to think I came all the way from China to visit you.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;China? What were you doing in China? Where\u0026rsquo;s the Nekohanten? What\ndo you mean in any time? And what the hell happened to Akane?\u0026rdquo; Ranma\nindignantly shot back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;One question at a time, Ranma.\u0026rdquo; Cologne pulls out a folded\nnewspaper from within here robes. \u0026ldquo;Here\u0026rdquo;, she said, passing the paper to\nRanma, \u0026ldquo;read it, and tell me what date it is.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;November 16\u0026hellip;1999?!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;That is correct, son-in-law. You have traveled in time, and you\nare now five years into the future.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Time travel? But how? Why?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Stop blabbering for a while and listen to me, boy.\u0026rdquo; Cologne said,\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t have much time.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Okay.\u0026rdquo; Enough time for what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Five years ago, you and Shampoo were sucked into a temporal rift\nnear Furinkan High. You ended up five years in the future, as you are\nnow. However, in that future, Shampoo was dead, her body found after she\nhad mysteriously vanished for months. When you and Shampoo talked to the\nUkyo Kuonji from that time, she said she had also traveled to the future\nwith Ranma five years before, and she had seen a timeline where she had\ndied. Apparently, in that other time, the same thing that happened to\nShampoo happened to Ukyo instead. With their knowledge of their future,\nRanma and Shampoo came back, and Shampoo\u0026rsquo;s death was averted. Instead of\nShampoo, however, it was Akane Tendo who met their fate.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;What? How could all this be happening?\u0026rdquo; Ranma said, confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I believe it has something to do with the temporal rift five years\nago, son-in-law. After that experience and with the death of Akane Tendo,\nShampoo withdrew her claim to you out of respect for her, and we moved\nback to China. The present-day Shampoo told me to meet you here so that I\ncould tell you all this. I believe that some force at this time, but not\nnecessarily in this timeline, is trying to get you, but someone else\nalways gets in the way.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRanma tried to follow all this, failed, tried again, and finally\ngot it right. \u0026ldquo;How can I stop this? If this is the third time it\u0026rsquo;s\nhappened, even if I save Akane in the past, it\u0026rsquo;ll happen to someone else,\nright?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;There is a chance, son-in-law. You yourself must face whatever\nfate it was that would have fallen upon Ukyo, Shampoo, and now, Akane.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Can you help me?\u0026rdquo; Ranma said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m afraid not, for in this timeline, you are a temporal anomaly,\nso you can \u0026ldquo;Shift\u0026rdquo; back to your time easily, while I cannot. You are\nalone this time, son-in-law.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRanma just nodded gravely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;One more thing\u0026rdquo;, Cologne added, \u0026ldquo;when Shampoo came back from her\ntemporal journey, she was very disoriented and could barely remember what\nhad happened in the past, and she was beaten and bruised. This could help\nyou find out who\u0026rsquo;s responsible.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Waitaminute!\u0026rdquo; Ranma said, \u0026ldquo;If Ukyo and Shampoo were with me when\nthey time-traveled, then this time\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;Akane Tendo would have made the journey with you.\u0026rdquo; Cologne\nended. \u0026ldquo;That is correct, son-in-law. You must find her, before any danger\ncomes to her. You might even figure out what\u0026rsquo;s going on.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;One last thing, \u0026quot; Ranma said, as the ghoul prepared to hop away,\n\u0026ldquo;If I do manage to prevent Akane\u0026rsquo;s death, then this timeline is\ndestroyed? Do you all die?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know son-in-law.\u0026rdquo; Cologne replied, \u0026ldquo;We might cease to\nexist, or just go on as if nothing happened. We don\u0026rsquo;t truly understand\nthe intricacies of time.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Thanks, ghoul. Gotta go!\u0026rdquo; Ranma said, heading for the Dojo. If\nAkane was in this timeline, she would head straight for the Dojo. And who\nknows how her old man would react!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the meantime, Akane was having troubles of her own. She had\nsuddenly found herself wandering on some street after eating her lunch.\nMaybe Ranma was right\u0026hellip;maybe her cooking did have hallucinogenic\neffects, she thought. That thought had quickly fled her mind and she\nrushed to the Dojo to find out what\u0026rsquo;s going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she got there, everyone seemed shocked to see her, as if she\nhad come back from the dead or something. Even more shocking was when\nthey told her she did come back from the dead!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;What do you mean I died five years ago?!\u0026rdquo;, she asked, incredulous,\nwhile trying to shake a crying Soun off her leg, \u0026ldquo;Is this some sort of\nsick joke ?\u0026rdquo;, she said, pointedly looking at Nabiki.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNabiki looked hurt, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not like we would fake your death\nAkane\u0026hellip;the body was there, we all saw it\u0026hellip;Ranma couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop crying\nfor weeks\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Ranma\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she said, turning to him, \u0026ldquo;were you really worried about\nme?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Akane\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; the purple-shirted Ranma said, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026hellip;I always regret not\nhaving told you before\u0026hellip;but I want you to know that I\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red-shirted Ranma Saotome had watched Akane enter the Dojo, but\nhad carefully concealed himself on a nearby rooftop. As he watched the\npurple-shirted Ranma hug Akane closely, he shifted a bit and considered\nrevealing himself and explaining everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he knew no one would listen to him anyway, particularly\nhimself. He just had to wait until he could talk to Akane alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Ranma\u0026rdquo;, Akane said, breaking the hug, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m confused\u0026hellip;just this\nmorning I was at school\u0026hellip;at Furinkan\u0026hellip;how could I have died five years\nago?\u0026rdquo; She looked at everyone for an explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Well, Akane\u0026rdquo;, Nabiki said, \u0026ldquo;It seems that five years ago, you and\nRanma vanished in flash of light near Furinkan\u0026hellip;when Ranma came back, he\nhad no memory of what happened\u0026hellip;and when you came back a week later, you\nwere near death\u0026hellip;we couldn\u0026rsquo;t save you.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry Akane\u0026rdquo;, Ranma said, \u0026ldquo;If only I had done something back\nthen\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Oh!
