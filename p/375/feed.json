There\u0026rsquo;s a service for him at Pisay tomorrow, Dec. 3, Friday. Since I doubt I can go, I\u0026rsquo;ll say my piece here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlix was a helluva guy. Friendly and gets well with the students. And he gave high grades. Seriously. He gave me flat 1.0s (highest possible grade) for all four quarters of fourth year math. Now, not to brag, when I was in high school, math was my thing. Seriously, I could breeze through my high school math classes in my sleep. And few of my batch mates will contradict me when I say I was one of the best, if not _the _best in math in our batch. (That last part is debatable, \u003ca href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/zukeeper/\"\u003esome people \u003c/a\u003emight contest it. :p) The point of this is not me bragging, since I do that often, it\u0026rsquo;s nothing special. No, the point is that I seldom took math period seriously. I often spent math class doodling something in my notebooks, at least on those occasions that I had a pen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn one such math class, Alix caught me and a classmate (you know who you are\u0026hellip; ) passing around a hand-drawn comic strip in class. (During my high school days, I often spent my free energy drawing such small strips about classroom happenings, particularly in the second year. Alas, none of the aforementioned high-school artworks have survived. But I digress.) I got a severe tongue-lashing for that one, something along the lines of \u0026ldquo;No matter how good you are at math, you can\u0026rsquo;t just goof off in class.\u0026rdquo; I felt quite bad about the incident, not only because I got to eat some humble pie in front of the class, but mostly because I felt like I had disappointed the guy. It\u0026rsquo;s not that I don\u0026rsquo;t goof off in other classes, I certainly do; but I felt that Alix expected more of me, since for some reason he believed me to be a good student. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the nerve to respond or apologize to him about this, I just took my tongue-lashing in silence. I wish I had told him I was sorry. I realize this is such a small, trivial matter, but God knows I like to obsess over small, trivial matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, cheers to you sir Alix, wherever you may be. I don\u0026rsquo;t spend much time with the other alumni, but over the past few days, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen the news of your passing spread through the online Pisay alumni community quickly, and many are planning to be there Friday. Rest well, sir Alix, and know that your students look back at you fondly.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

When I first got access to the Internet, I was overjoyed. \u0026ldquo;Wow! Lots of stuff to read!\u0026rdquo; And I read a lot online. I started mostly with anime fanfiction, but pretty soon I enjoyed reading discussions on mailing-lists, message boards, news sites, etc. The internet is a treasure trove for one who always strives for information. But I digress, this post is not about the wondrous internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s about the fact that I like to read. In particular, I like to read books. In fact, I thought about posting something like this because I was looking for a particular book. Specifically, \u003cem\u003ethe Wastelands\u003c/em\u003e, third book of Stephen King\u0026rsquo;s Dark Tower series. And I don\u0026rsquo;t want just any copy, I want a copy in the same series as the first two books I already have. I\u0026rsquo;ve looked through several National Bookstore branches already, but have yet to find one. I know they used to have a copy at the SM North Edsa branch, since that\u0026rsquo;s where I bought the second book \u003cem\u003eDrawing of the Three\u003c/em\u003e. However, I can\u0026rsquo;t find it there; it seems that branch is under renovation, maybe I\u0026rsquo;m just too confused at the change in layout. The salespeople don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be much help either. \u0026ldquo;Stephen King? Try the horror section.\u0026rdquo; That would be great except Dark Tower is not a horror series!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I digress again. Back to the topic. I like to read. I like to read books. The internet sort of changed that. After I first got internet access, I seldom read books for a period of time, meaning most of my college years. In fact, I think the only series of books I was able to follow during my college years was Robert Jordan\u0026rsquo;s Wheel of Time series. (Short review? Started out okay, then got silly, then got annoying. Serious milking cow.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I started working, I had a source of income. (Wow, what a deep and non-obvious statement!) Given this, I was able to start reading again, not only by borrowing from friends (Hi Dave, Mike!), but this time I was able to buy the occasional book myself. So I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to catch up. Sadly, I think the years of reading lots of stuff online has tarnished my reading skills. I still read far, far quicker than most people, but it takes me ages to finish a single book. nowadays. I\u0026rsquo;m currently reading Neil Gaiman\u0026rsquo;s American Gods; I started about a week agao, but I\u0026rsquo;m not even a fifth of the way in! It\u0026rsquo;s not that it\u0026rsquo;s a bad book, it\u0026rsquo;s okay, in Gaiman\u0026rsquo;s usual way, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s because there are a lot more distractions in my life nowadays (work, love or lack of it, video games, blogging); When I was young I was able to read a lot because whenever I had free time I would curl up with a good book. These days however, I find that whatever free time I have, I prefer to spend it in quiet \u003cem\u003emuni-muni\u003c/em\u003e instead of having to use my brainpower to go through a potentially difficult book (thanks, Cryptonomicon!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also want to read more non-fiction, autobiographies and stuff. But I find that such books are usually more expensive than normal paperback novels, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know who I can borrow such from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, what\u0026rsquo;s the point of this post? I like to read. And I want to read more. That is all.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Even though he was able to quote from many other bands, books, and even a separate Radiohead album for free. Even he had personally met the band before, and had freely let them quote his own works in their concerts. Gives a good idea of how fucked-up the worldwide copyright system is. And reminds me why I prefer to just ignore the whole corporate copyright system. (Never mind that it\u0026rsquo;s quite convenient to do so.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn that note, I wonder if local band Parokya ni Edgar had to cough up for their parody of Radiohead\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Creep\u0026rdquo; (I forget what the actual Parokya track title was.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, even \u003ca href=\"http://www.greenplastic.com/news/archives/2003/06/warner_chappell.php\"\u003eposting song lyrics online is illegal\u003c/a\u003e, btw. Or at least according to copyright lawyers. I\u0026rsquo;d think that the band Radiohead itself wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mind these things which supposedly infringe on their copyrights, but of course, the corporate structure which they play under would not stand for it. Maybe the world would be far better off if copyright protections were limited to individuals and not corporations? In the modern-day world of the internet, there\u0026rsquo;s really no need for large recording companies any more, they are just large dinosaurs who refuse to admit the coming ice age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, now that I think about it, I have seldom actually paid for music before. When I was in HS, I sometimes (rarely) bought cassettes. As for CDs (audio CDs I mean), I have _never _bought any audio CDs, pirated or otherwise. Most of the time, I would indulge myself by listening to FM radio or music videos. The downside of this, of course, was that my musical selection was limited to what the big recording companies deemed important enough to promote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days, with MP3s, my selection is a lot more varied, since I get to pick and sample more music via P2P downloading. I don\u0026rsquo;t even listen to radio anymore, at least not intentionally. I pick up new songs by hearing about them from friends or over the internet. Whenever I\u0026rsquo;m listening to a new band, I never know if they\u0026rsquo;re popular or not. I recently started to enjoy Dashboard Confessional; I liked Vindicated when I first heard the Spiderman 2 OST. I didn\u0026rsquo;t need the confirmation of public radio (which came about two weeks after I got my hands on 3 full DC albums) to know I liked the song, and the band. My playlist these days is mostly populated by Dashboard Confessional, Matchbox Twenty, Gin Blossoms, Switchfoot, Rivermaya, Sponge Cola, Sugarfree, Bamboo, Maroon 5, Counting Crows, Better Than Ezra, Live, Coldplay, Lifehouse etc. Not exactly on the leading edge of popular music, but at least I picked up thse bands by myself without relying on recording companies jamming them down my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis rambling post was brought to you by the letter N.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Even he had personally met the band before, and had freely let them quote his own works in their concerts. Gives a good idea of how fucked-up the worldwide copyright system is.",

I finished the last 1/3rd during a 15-minute bathroom break back home. It was a short book. Lots of people have raved about how good it is. What do I think? It\u0026rsquo;s okay, but nothing overly special. Maybe I didn\u0026rsquo;t get too much of it because it didn\u0026rsquo;t have much new material for me. All of this \u0026ndash; having your own \u0026ldquo;personal legend\u0026rdquo;; searching and/or fighting for it instead of deciding to accept and be content with you have; communicating with the \u0026ldquo;Soul of the World\u0026rdquo;; — most of these things are not foreign concepts to me. I think the book would appeal most to those who are feeling a bit down or lost, and looking for something inspirational to give them a slight push and help them find their way. Or something. 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the interesting things presented in the book is the concept of \u0026ldquo;beginner\u0026rsquo;s luck\u0026rdquo;. Basically the book says that the universe conspires to make your personal legend come true, because of this, when you\u0026rsquo;re starting out on something, the universe will give you a small taste of success, so you\u0026rsquo;re enticed to follow-up. I guess I\u0026rsquo;ve never heard of beginner\u0026rsquo;s luck described this way before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book also talks about how most people will disregarding their personal dreams to settle for whatever contentment comes their way in life. Personally, I think I\u0026rsquo;m the sort to prefer to go out and learn new things, or strive to make things better than to just be satisfied doing the same thing day in and day out. In fact, that\u0026rsquo;s one of the things I like about my current job: things often stay interesting. I\u0026rsquo;m almost always learning something new, or doing something different. The only times I don\u0026rsquo;t like my job are when I have to do something similar repeatedly for some time period, that\u0026rsquo;s when I entertain thoughts of quitting. (No real plans though, not anytime soon at least.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of officemates describes me as having a strong personality, and also as someone who wants to live an exciting life. The problem with that however, is that I\u0026rsquo;m also quite lazy. So, I\u0026rsquo;m easily bored and I\u0026rsquo;m also lazy. Quite a paradox\u0026hellip; I like to experience new things, but I also like to spend a lot of time by myself mulling over different things (or sometimes the same thing over and over\u0026hellip; )\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMan, that was a random rambling post if I ever saw one.

To relax, I write full-length novels, solve transcendental math problems and practice karate, taekwondo and aikido.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI save people from drowning, I protect children from danger, I patrol the streets for litterbugs and jaywalkers, I go to government offices and streamline their processes. I hunt down terrorists, I foil coup attempts, I dismantle nuclear weaponry. I feed the hungry and visit the sick. I write the software that hunts down viruses and protects the internet. I wage war against poverty and take down corrupt politicians. I am wanted in thirty-one states and outlawed in fifty countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sew clothes for orphans, I bake cookies for prisoners of war, I read stories to the terminally ill. I have read the Bible, the Iliad, and the works of Shakespeare, all in one sitting. I have memorized the streets of New York, Madrid, Egypt, Beijing and Manila. I served in covert operations in Vietnam and Desert Storm. I have set up research centers to determine the cure for cancer and the secret of immortality. I am never late, I do my taxes months ahead of schedule, I can recite Pi up to the 2000th digit. I never sleep, I cannot be surprised, I make the most of my time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare death in the eye. I bungee jump, I skateboard off high cliffs, I eat Akane Tendo\u0026rsquo;s cooking. I clean up oil spills, I round up lost dogs, I play Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. I have defeated the evil witch, rescued the princess and single-handedly defended the Earth from an alien invasion, armed with nothing more than a swiss knife and duct tape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am a conqueror, I have defeated armies and destroyed nations. I am a lover, I have wooed a hundred women. I am an artist, I have painted murals in every city and written songs in every language. I am a scientist, I have defied and disproven the laws of physics. I am an athlete, I have won twenty gold medals in the last three olympics. I am a spiritualist, I have uncovered the meaning of life yet chose to keep it hidden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am a man of myth and legend, tales of my exploits abound in the darker areas of the night. I am a man of the world, journeying to many places to seek out fame and fortune, protect the innocent and for great justice. I walk my own way, I seek my own truth, I determine my own fate. I stand tall and shake the heavens. When I move, the crowds give way to let me pass. When I speak, the world stops to listen. When I shout, the universe holds its breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am nature\u0026rsquo;s greatest miracle. I am the one foretold by legend, whose coming will be the beginning and the end. Prophets and sages speak my name in whispers, beasts of the jungle scatter when I approach, kings and presidents tremble in my presence, yet children come to me and adore me. I will incite war and destruction, and I will unite all nations under my wing. I am anger, I am fear, I am madness. I am light and shadow, I am order and chaos, I am life and death. I am judge, jury and executioner. I am your greatest dream. I am your worst nightmare. I am your finest hour. I am your darkest day. I am the one you seek, the one you wish to be, the one who decides your fate, I am Roy Tang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Written more than 3 years ago)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I am a man of many things, of many passions. I work as an engineer, remodelling space shuttles so that they don\u0026rsquo;t crash and burn on reentry. I play the piano, the trombone and the harmonica. I am a columnist for an internationally acclaimed newspaper. I produce and direct award-winning movies. To relax, I write full-length novels, solve transcendental math problems and practice karate, taekwondo and aikido.\nI save people from drowning, I protect children from danger, I patrol the streets for litterbugs and jaywalkers, I go to government offices and streamline their processes.",
