For the past two weeks or so, I haven\u0026rsquo;t had much heart for my work. Most of the time, I code while wondering if I should file for half a day\u0026rsquo;s sick leave and head home. Except that I don\u0026rsquo;t know if boredom is a valid excuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Madness, despair and self-doubt lay ahead, uncharacteristically. You have been warned.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t know why. I guess I\u0026rsquo;m just tired. Tired of overly complicated modules. Tired of badly designed data models. Tired of losing two hours every day to commuting. Tired of the heat. Tired of all the people. And maybe, just maybe, tired of trying to figure out how to win her attention. Just her attention mind you. I would be satisfied with just her attention for a good while, and that says a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe I\u0026rsquo;m just losing my sense of belonging. I like the people at work, I really do. I have friends there. Close friends, even. People whom I\u0026rsquo;ve opened up to, shared secrets with, confided in. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve had any new close friends since the original zu crew. And I like the job, or I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have stayed this long. And I am quite sure that I am quite good at what I do. So why do thoughts of resigning keep coming up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m lying to myself of course. I know the reason why it\u0026rsquo;s been so hard to keep a good mood lately. I found out some things I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have, through methods I should not have used. I did not learn anything I did not already suspect. I had nothing to gain by trying to find out, I knew that knowing these things for certain would shatter me, yet I had to know. So I went ahead anyway. And my heart is paying the price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been a fool. I know this to be true, I\u0026rsquo;ve known it all along. I\u0026rsquo;ve always hated letting my emotions get the better of me; I should\u0026rsquo;ve held myself back this time same as any other. What made me think it would be any different? What made me think I could fight fate? What made me think I had what it takes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now I\u0026rsquo;m tired. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do. I don\u0026rsquo;t know whether I have the strength to go on. There\u0026rsquo;s gap there that I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to traverse. A barrier that only grows stronger as I fight it. Common sense and several people in the know tell me that it\u0026rsquo;s alright to quit. I\u0026rsquo;ve fought the good fight, there is no shame in surrender. It happens all the time, people try and people fail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis can\u0026rsquo;t possibly be good for me. Already it\u0026rsquo;s starting to affect my work somehow. And I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure that it\u0026rsquo;s holding me back in more ways than that. This isn\u0026rsquo;t going anywhere, and it\u0026rsquo;s making me so frickin\u0026rsquo; weak. It seems so obvious what needs to be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen why is it so hard to let go?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eWell, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d write about Suikoden IV before I forgot all about it. I finished it around Holy Week, but haven\u0026rsquo;t bothered to go through again, even though I promised myself I would try since I did not get the magic number of a hundred and eight stars of destiny this time around. Curse my pride for not reading any FAQs while playing! Time is short, with work and all, so I should make the most of my games so I don\u0026rsquo;t need to re-play them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuiko 4 has big steps to fill. The first two Suikoden games gained quite a following on the PSX, and the third game, while taking things in a somewhat different direction, was pretty good as well. Does Suiko 4 live up to the series\u0026rsquo; legacy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell\u0026hellip; no. It\u0026rsquo;s mostly the same as Suiko 1 and 2, but the plot is a lot simpler this time, and quite uninspired. Very few truly moving mments or scenes. The story takes place in the Island Nations some hundreds of years before the events of Suiko 1. Only three characters are here from previous games: Viki (no surprise there), Jeane (WTF? How is she alive at this time? Does she possess a true rune?) And Ted, the original bearer of the Soul-Eater true rune from Suikoden 1. The worst part is I didn\u0026rsquo;t get Ted! Damn it. I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have rushed the last part of the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving the Soul-Eater would have been good, because frankly, the hero\u0026rsquo;s true rune in this game, the Rune of Punishment, is really lame. Story-wise and gameplay wise. The story of Suikoden games have always revolved around the 27 True Runes\u0026hellip; powerful, living artifacts of magic that shape the destiny of the world. Sought after not only because of the immense power they wield, but also because the True Runes grant their bearers one thing men can only dream of: immortality. This game is about one madman\u0026rsquo;s desire to possess the power of the True Rune of Punishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, the story follows quite the same trend as Suiko 1 and 2. Hero is a young member of prestigious nation\u0026rsquo;s military arm. Hero is forced to leave his home for some reason. Hero finds a True Rune. Hero gathers together a huge army to lay the smackdown on an evil Empire. When the war is done, Hero fades into obscurity. Really, no spoilers here. So why the plot fall so flat if it\u0026rsquo;s following a tried-and-true formula?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think it\u0026rsquo;s because of the uninspired supporting cast. The silent unnamed hero of Suiko 4 doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any strong, loyal personalities attached to him (Gremio in Suiko1, Nanami in Suiko2, a buttload of people in Suiko3) Because of this, he lacks a powerful mouthpiece to help drive the plot forward. Also, it has always been the problem in the Suikoden series that since they always have a cast of 108 in each game, many characters are underdeveloped. But in Suiko 4, I find it hard to name more than five \u0026ldquo;solid\u0026rdquo; characters that drive the plot. And the Silverburg tactician here is boring here as well. No particularly clever plots or tactics here, don\u0026rsquo;t expect any Matthiu or Shu tricks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGameplay-wise, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty blah as well. It\u0026rsquo;s mostly the same as 1 and 2 though, so it\u0026rsquo;s more of no big improvements than suckiness. There is one thing that bothers me though: The dice-bowl gambling game has been given a limit. You can only bet 3000 potch at a time! This minigame was a major source of funds in the earlier games in the series, and with this cap, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to keep up with the high blacksmith prices towards the end of the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne last complaint. This game seems to be technically inferior to Suikoden III. Case in point: cut scenes. It frustrates me that a simple change of perspective/camera angles in cutscenes demands a load time (as in, fade in/fade out) of 0.5-1 seconds. It\u0026rsquo;s the same scene, the models are already loaded in memory, why can\u0026rsquo;t it be a smooth transition? As it is, the cut scenes are jarring and feel skippy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is all. Will I play it again? Maybe, I really want to use the Soul-Eater again. One nice thing about this game is that for the first time in the series, they include a New game + mode. Not much benefits in terms of carry-over, but one major thing: You can skip cutscenes! But I probably still won\u0026rsquo;t play it again. There are other games to play, and too little time.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The last time I got into an FPS game multiplayer was when Mon, Dave, Paul and I would do a four-way splitscreen on a single TV with the PS port of Quake 2. Insane I know, but fun. Timesplitters is like that, and since I\u0026rsquo;m expectedly not-so-good at these types of games, the challenge level is just about right for Alvin and myself. We always go co-op, since I have no doubt he would beat me hand down in versus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe single player game? I have no idea. I let Alvin play that part just to unlock more characters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd speaking of characters! The real reason I like this game is that the characters are crazy. Alvin likes to play the T-Rex (yes, imagine a T-Rex holding a 12-gauge tactical shotgun), but I try to pick a new one every fight. The most important thing is that the you can be a Ninja Monkey! Wow, I was giggling at that for one whole 30-minute game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo bad Mon is away and we don\u0026rsquo;t hang out much at David\u0026rsquo;s anymore.

I think most are, unless you\u0026rsquo;re one of the graduates. Or one of the graduates\u0026rsquo; parents. Or one of those CAT guys who stops people with digital cameras from getting too close. Too bad I forgot to charge the digital camera batteries before going, or else we would have actually had more than five pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commencement speaker was some guy from batch \u0026lsquo;69 \u003ca href=\"http://sluggy.com/index.php\"\u003e1\u003c/a\u003e with lots of degrees, awards and accolades. I swear, if I ever become commencement speaker, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna be really easy to introduce, since I won\u0026rsquo;t have so much crap attached to my name. But you never know what might happen in 16 years \u003ca href=\"http://beautiful-rookery.blogspot.com/\"\u003e2\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commencement speech was dull, the usual thing commencement speakers say, talking about the graduate\u0026rsquo;s future, the uncertainty, the excitement blah blah blah. If I was the one giving a commencement speech (I have a feeling this blog post will be a basis for my never ever getting that chance), I\u0026rsquo;d probably talk less about hard work and more about passion. Hard work is nice, but it\u0026rsquo;s passion, drive, energy that gets you places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey have this new thing this year, where they don\u0026rsquo;t have a valedictorian, salutatiorian, etc. Instead, they have people with \u0026ldquo;High Honors\u0026rdquo; (weighted average 1.50-1.20) and people with \u0026ldquo;Highest Honors\u0026rdquo; (weighted average 1.20-1.00) It\u0026rsquo;s like the college system of cum laudes. Except it sucks. \u0026ldquo;Valedictorian\u0026rdquo; looks so much better on a resume than \u0026ldquo;Highest Honors\u0026rdquo;, but if you\u0026rsquo;re relying on high school accolades on your resume to land you a job, you probably won\u0026rsquo;t get it anyway, so I guess it works out. Sort of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly teacher who recognized me there was good old Vlad. The guy\u0026rsquo;s been teaching Econ for ten years! Well, okay maybe not. I heard he took time off to either take an MBA or go surfing in Hawaii, maybe both. But judging from the comments in the graduation speech, he still enjoys torturing the kids. Ma\u0026rsquo;am Serrano might have recognized me, but then again, she recognizes everybody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe PSHS Gymnasium is an unforgiving boiling kettle of intolerable heat, especially during these hot summer days. I wonder if I will ever step foot in it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit: I\u0026rsquo;m a moron. I really was incoherent. I forgot I was going to talk about the ten years after part until I saw the title published on the page itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, yeah. Ten years. It\u0026rsquo;s been ten years since I left Pisay to face the cruel world. And where am I now? No earth-shaking accomplishments yet?

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003e[Originally \u003ca href=\"http://boards.gamefaqs.com/gfaqs/genmessage.php?board=589475\u0026amp;topic=20026151\"\u003eposted to the GameFAQs message boards\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, there are rude and annoying people everywhere, especially on the internet. And normally, I don\u0026rsquo;t care, I just ignore them. On battle.net, I just let them be, and keep on playing. Every so often however, some guy comes along who just pisses me off completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I play random 3v3, right? It\u0026rsquo;s not the most \u0026ldquo;skillful\u0026rdquo; type of battles, but it\u0026rsquo;s fun and I enjoy it. My record\u0026rsquo;s nothing too good to look at, but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t call myself a newb. I play a game, I get a team with a lvl 27, two lvl 16s (I\u0026rsquo;m one of them)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon as the game starts, the 27 guy (Green) asks us \u0026ldquo;You guys any good?\u0026rdquo; Now, some people may or may not realize this, but this is rude. There\u0026rsquo;s no point in asking, I don\u0026rsquo;t think there\u0026rsquo;s any satisfactory answer that can be given. And many people don\u0026rsquo;t like to brag, so more often than not your answers will be along the line of \u0026ldquo;I guess so\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not so bad\u0026rdquo;, or if your allies are insecure, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sucky.\u0026rdquo; But you almost never get the answer you want. You can check their stats if you want, but why bother asking them if they\u0026rsquo;re good?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I normally just ignore these questions, and I did. And smartly enough, my other ally, the other 16 guy (Blue) ignored him as well. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why I was stupid enough to do it, but when he asked again, I responded: \u0026ldquo;I won 12 out of the last 15, does that make me good?\u0026rdquo; It was true; I was on some sort of streak I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis answer was: \u0026ldquo;No it doesn\u0026rsquo;t. I hope you guys don\u0026rsquo;t play like level 16, or we\u0026rsquo;re gonna lose.\u0026rdquo; Yeah, like level means anything in random team battles any more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we go to harass, and he\u0026rsquo;s all \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t wanna leave my base, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna get rushed.\u0026rdquo; And since he wants it, sure enough he gets rushed. We go back, we fend it off, and he\u0026rsquo;s really thankful: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m really sick of being rushed, that\u0026rsquo;s why I don\u0026rsquo;t harass. Let\u0026rsquo;s just creep.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we split up and take the greens. (The map was that 6-player one with all the water. Typhoon? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure.) A while later, we get a message. His Level 1 Dark Ranger got killed by creeps. He\u0026rsquo;s embarrassed. \u0026ldquo;OMG! That\u0026rsquo;s so nobish [sic] of me! I\u0026rsquo;m so embarrassed!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe creep some more, we run into 2 of the enemy armies, take out a few fiends and grunts before they run back. He sees my army. \u0026ldquo;OMG mass hunts!\u0026rdquo; he says, even though I told him early on I was getting hunts and dryads. He must\u0026rsquo;ve been too busy whining to himself about his noob teammates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe decide to hit the orc base. We go in, And the battle is fairly furious, a lot of units die. I get messages saying my allies\u0026rsquo; heroes go down, so I give the \u0026ldquo;b\u0026rdquo; word. We start falling back. Green gets started again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;OMG pink [me], there\u0026rsquo;s no way you won 12 of 15, you\u0026rsquo;re such a noob! You\u0026rsquo;re a liar!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, that\u0026rsquo;s it. I could handle arrogant allies, but this one had the balls to call me a liar. I rip into him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Listen here. I\u0026rsquo;m not the one who lost his hero while creeping. I didn\u0026rsquo;t lose any heroes back there. In fact, I killed 3 heroes before we pulled out. What have you been up to?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat shut him up. Blue, by the way, has been cool all this time, just letting Green be. Anyway, Green starts lagging. I start pumping out archers and dryads to counter the wyverns. Green\u0026rsquo;s base gets attacked. I TP in. We push them back. We head back to the orc base for a counteroffensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0026rsquo;s lagging some more. I fire another shot: \u0026ldquo;You know what the best part is? Your clever moonwell placement has trapped my keeper in the trees.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hit the orc base, taking out grunts and shamans and wyverns and fiends left and right. Green lags out. Good riddance. We pull out for a bit to regroup. I take control of Green\u0026rsquo;s army, Blue handles his base. We hit the orc base again. Towers and burrows start going down. We sweep, we clean up, we wipe the floor (all without my Keeper, still cluelessly stuck between moonwells. The Priestess misses him so.) Just before the game ends, I tell Blue my not-so-secret opinion: \u0026ldquo;Green was an idiot.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadly, I forgot to save the replay. I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember who Blue was. I do remember who green was however, and I have a message for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is for you, III_III of Lordaeron. Free advice, if you can\u0026rsquo;t be nice to your teammates, or if you can\u0026rsquo;t stand playing with \u0026ldquo;noobs\u0026rdquo;, either stop playing random teams, or shut the hell up. And it\u0026rsquo;s 14 out of 17 now moron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks for listening GameFAQs. That is all.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The first thing I did was add some Javascript that allows you to show/hide individual posts on the page. But actually, I don\u0026rsquo;t really like it, I\u0026rsquo;ll remove it later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m also wondering whether it\u0026rsquo;s possible to have a Javascript hack that allows Blogger to have categories? The Category names would have to be included in maybe the post title text or the post body text, then we\u0026rsquo;d have a Javascript parser that determines the correct categories for each post. Then we could append category names to the URL to allow viewing by category, using javascript again to parse the URL to find which categories need to be displayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeems like a lot of work though. My Javascript is not as strong as I want it to be — although I have a pretty good idea of how it works, I\u0026rsquo;m no expert. So I guess working on these hacks would be good practice, but maybe the time would be better spent learning PHP and preparing to move to a paid webhost?

The sprawling worlds travelled by Roland of Gilead and his band of gunslingers continues to draw me in; I guess the romantic western atmosphere really appeals to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring these two books, we follow Roland Deschain, the last gunslinger, Eddie and Susannah, gunslingers-in-training as they forge ahead on the road to the Dark Tower, where the fate of all worlds may be decided. Along the way, they gain new allies, one thought previously dead. They storm across the fallen city of Lud, blaze across the wastelands on an insane sentient train, and finally land in Kansas. It is in Kansas that Roland narrates a tale of his youth, and of his days and Gilead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is Roland\u0026rsquo;s tales of Gilead that I most enjoy in the series. Roland\u0026rsquo;s world, the world that has moved on, is a medieval-western hybrid of sorts. A world where people look to gunslingers with fear and respect, a world where a misspoken word in a tavern can get you killed, a world fraught with danger and adventure. In this tale we learn of what happened to Roland after he passed his rite of passage, his first love, and his decision to pursue the Dark Tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look forward to the last three books\u0026hellip; all of which are out in hard cover versions. Wizard and Glass ends on much less of a cliffhanger than Wastelands, so I\u0026rsquo;m willing to wait a bit for the paperback copies to come out, though I hope it doesn\u0026rsquo;t take too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
