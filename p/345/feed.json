            "title": "So I Went to HK",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAs I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned \u003ca href=\"/2004/04/roy-goes-to-hk/\"\u003ebefore\u003c/a\u003e, I was sent to HK a couple of weeks back, for the rollout of a project I\u0026rsquo;ve been involved with for about a year and a half. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s right for me to be talking about the project here, so I won\u0026rsquo;t delve into any specifics. I will however, bore you all with stories from my first trip anywhere remotely far from home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, the plane trip. Economy class (excuse me, fiesta class) on a PAL Airbus from NAIA2 to HK International on Thursday night. Food was okay, I\u0026rsquo;ve had worse, not really enough to turn me off airline food. The PAL flight attendants, as I later discussed with a male coworker, were quite not-young and, well, not-hot. Heh, probably unfair but you get a certain expectation from media, you know? The flight was short (less than two hours) and uneventful, no dizziness or pukathons for me, thanks, unlike when I take the eight-hour bus ride to Bicol. This may seem boring to seasoned fliers, but I liked that little map that told me at what location we were currently flying over. Neat!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an engineering type, I also took notice of the plane itself. Is it normal that airplanes routinely jiggle and vibrate as the plane taxis? I understand that it\u0026rsquo;s unavoidable as things like cars and trains do the same; but shouldn\u0026rsquo;t things be a bit tighter on a plane? Still, didn\u0026rsquo;t really bother me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon landing, I got a glimpse of HK International Airport. I had heard it was huge, but didn\u0026rsquo;t get to look around much as I was greeted at the boarding gate by two of the HK staff. Nice people, one of them bought me dinner at McDonald\u0026rsquo;s although I told them I had already had the airline food. Afterwards, they took mo to The Peak, apparently a famous spot for tourists in Hong Kong. It\u0026rsquo;s a mall-type thing on top of a rather high mountain. From the observation deck, you could see most of Hong Kong. From there I could see that Hong Kong was a very urbanized area, a lot more than Metro Manila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter spending some time there, they drive me to the Staff Quarters near the HK office, where one of our RP staff has been staying for a month. The RP guy greets me, shows me upstairs, shows me the ropes, and I get some sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe office building is right next to the block where the staff quarters was, barely a five-minute walk. I spent most of my time in HK between the office and the staff quarters. Truth be told, the trip wasn\u0026rsquo;t really very exciting, as there was a lot of work to be done and not much time to goof around. I\u0026rsquo;ll just note some things particularly interesting about being in a foreign country:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePeople speaking in an unintelligible language all the time\u003c/em\u003e. Probably the biggest hurdle to anything, it took surprisingly little getting used to the fact that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t communicate perfectly with anyone, and with some people, not at all. On some occasions, I had to buy food or drinks through pointing and using hand signs to find out how much stuff was. When walking on the street, I\u0026rsquo;d turn my head whenever I hear someone speaking English, because it was quite unusual. Also, when dining out with the HK staff, I\u0026rsquo;d have to rely on them to order for me, since I can\u0026rsquo;t read the menus. Which brings me to\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eForeign food\u003c/em\u003e. Anyone who knows me knows I\u0026rsquo;m quite a picky eater. I don\u0026rsquo;t take to new foods very easily. But it\u0026rsquo;s hard to refuse when you\u0026rsquo;re a guest, so I got to taste more new stuff in my five and a half days in HK than I have for maybe the past three years. It\u0026rsquo;s ok, I don\u0026rsquo;t mind, even the veggies. The biggest problem was the fact that I have no idea how to use chopsticks, and almost every meal needs the use of chopsticks. At one point, I had to badger my co-RP staff to help me get food using the serving chopsticks. While I was there, I had some Taiwanese, Thai food, and of course, Chinese. Lots of Chinese. Oh, and an interesting side note: apparently foreign McDonald\u0026rsquo;s have no McSpaghetti.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eReligious issues.\u003c/em\u003e I was unable to hear Mass on Sunday. We had to work most of the day, but I got off around 4PM. I asked one of the HK guys for directions to a Church (we were in Kowloon, I believe), but when I explained that I was Catholic, he didn\u0026rsquo;t know what the term meant. (This is of course ridiculous to a Filipino; everbody knows what a \u003cem\u003eKatoliko\u003c/em\u003e is!) After saying that my faith is similar to another RP staff who he had also met before, he gave me some instructions on where to find a Church. I walked around a bit, following his directions. Which eventually lead me to a Mosque. Ooookay. So I walked around some more (quite a bit actually, went up and down the same road couple of times), I found a place called \u0026ldquo;St Andrews Church\u0026rdquo;, I guessed this was the place he was talking about. I walked in and asked around, found out they had a Mass around 6PM. So I waited for a bit. Around 5:45 I picked up a flier and noticed that it was in fact an Anglican Church (Is it a Protestant thing? Or something else? I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sure), and I it\u0026rsquo;s not the same so I went out looking again. I saw another Church, this time it was Lutheran. Around 6:30PM, I gave up, bought some dinner at McDonald\u0026rsquo;s and took a taxi home. The next day one of the HK staff who said he was Christian told me there was a Catholic Church beside the Mosque\u0026hellip; apparently it was a small one so I failed to notice it. From our discussion, I think there\u0026rsquo;s quite a distinction here between \u0026ldquo;Christians\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Catholics\u0026rdquo;; which is weird since I\u0026rsquo;m fairly sure Catholics are Christian. Anyway, I was wondering why it was so hard to find a Church in a place where\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThere are so many Filipinos.\u003c/em\u003e You can see \u0026lsquo;em everywhere, as you walk along the main streets. Mostly tourists and domestic helpers, I believe. I could hear Tagalog being spoken on the street more often than English. Of course, maybe I should\u0026rsquo;ve asked one of them where I could go to Church\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTaxis are discplined.\u003c/em\u003e This is of course, shocking to any Filipino! A sticker on the inside of every taxi tells you the rules: They can\u0026rsquo;t turn down fares, they have to issue a receipt when asked, they must follow seatbelt laws, etc. Every taxi is equipped with a receipt machine, and every one of \u0026lsquo;em is bright red so they\u0026rsquo;re easy to spot. Overall, while I still experienced traffic jams over there, their traffic situation is still hella lot better than ours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat else can I say? As I said, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have much free time. They were kind enough to give me half the day off on Tuesday afternoon (my flight home was Tuesday evening), and they recommended some places I could go visit. So I went to Quarry Bay, about 2 MTR stations away from the office. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what I was looking for, though, so I ended up mostly wandering aimlessly, not buying anything ‘cept for some food and drinks. I actually managed to walk all the way back to the office, and just decided to buy some chocolates from a supermarket to bring home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the flight home, PAL switched me to a much smaller plane, which sucked. :( I got to see more of HK Airport, and let me say\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s frickin\u0026rsquo; huge. I told the guys who brought me to the airport that NAIA2 is like a fourth of HK airport, but now I think it\u0026rsquo;s more like a sixth. I\u0026rsquo;m told they even have some sort of moving platform thing for people whose gates are so frickin\u0026rsquo; far. It took 30 minutes for our plane to taxi, that should say something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, got home around 11:30, bought some more goodies at the duty-free shop. Took a taxi home, arrived safe and sound. Told stories for an hour or so, then \u0026hellip;  zzzzzz.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

For president, I chose Roco, ‘coz hell, if by some miracle he wins I don\u0026rsquo;t wanna miss my chance to gloat that I voted for the candidate who was right in every possible way. For the party-list rep, last time around I voted for Bayan Muna, but I don\u0026rsquo;t really like how they\u0026rsquo;re soft on the NPA, whether or not the military allegations are true. Akbayan, while still left-leaning (to balance the center-to-right preferences of most mainstream politicians), at least recognizes that the NPA Permit-to-Campaign fees are downright extortion and should be criminalized. For the Senators, the only unusual choice is Doc Hussin (more Muslim representation), but the rest should be obvious. I actually had only 11 senators listed before deciding on Hussin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what will happen to the country now? Who knows, for a while I was thinking of voting for FPJ just to see what kind of new crap our country can go through\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

This was actually the first time I\u0026rsquo;d done some serious \u0026lsquo;net surfing since I borrowed David\u0026rsquo;s KOTOR copy.

I borrowed my friend\u0026rsquo;s copy after he finished it, so I only started it last week, but it\u0026rsquo;s already eaten up a lot of my (non-work) time. Starships, lightsabers, force powers, droids, wookies, twi\u0026rsquo;leks, Jedi, Sith, Hutts, Rodians, the ability to choose between dark side or light side, watching your character deflect dozens of blaster shots with his lightsaber\u0026hellip;I\u0026rsquo;m tempted to stop typing this email now and go play it\u0026hellip;If I had actually played it last year, I\u0026rsquo;d have named it as game of the year above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn non-Star Wars news, I\u0026rsquo;ve had the old machine Cheese looked at, seems the mobo and the vidcard have been fried (again). Something\u0026rsquo;s really wrong with that rig but I\u0026rsquo;m too lazy to change it, especially now that we have a second PC. In any case, it\u0026rsquo;ll take another 2-3 weeks before PC Express can replace it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven\u0026rsquo;t found time to re-play FFX-2 and get whatever ending actually involved Tidus \u0026ndash; too much time spent on NWN and KOTOR. I still want to replay it, as there are a lot of things that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to do, but we have more problems. Our PS2\u0026rsquo;s disc read performance has gotten worse by the moment, we can hardly play on it anymore. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking on getting it checked up somewhere, if only so we can play some Japanese SVCChaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of SVChaos, my brothers and I were at the SM North the arcades last weekend, something we hadn\u0026rsquo;t done in a while. I gave the old CVS2 game a go and promptly got whupped by my opponent, someone who seemed to have been playing this game for a long time. My Sagat did well enough, but Ryu and Blanka just plain choked. It\u0026rsquo;s not just the stick anymore either \u0026ndash; I never noticed it before but I guess the speed of the game really is different from the console version, so I\u0026rsquo;m having a much harder time doing Just-Defend and wake-up DPs. I also gave the SVC Chaos machine a couple of runs, but I\u0026rsquo;m finding it hard to do supers on the thing. The arcade at SM Megamall already has SVC Chaos too\u0026hellip;I\u0026rsquo;m seriously considering playing a couple of games there daily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, we were at the mall to see Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. Fairly good movie, much better finale than the Matrix trilogy. Which is good, because the books deserved to be made into good movies. the huge battles at Minas Tirith were great, although the army ghosts Aragorn fought felt a bit like cheating to win. I seem to recall their journey into the mountain to be a lot longer in the book too, but I may be wrong. Um\u0026hellip;I have nothing else to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

How could I lose?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story is simple enough. Colin Farell plays James Clayton, a young man just out of MIT, recruited by CIA agent William Burke (Pacino). Clayton is obsessed with finding out what happened to his father, who was lost in an accident some fifteen or so years ago. Pacino taunts him by dropping the occasional hint about his father\u0026rsquo;s fate, and Clayton throws away the promising career he would have had in Engineering to join the CIA. The third entry to this little affair is Leila, Clayton\u0026rsquo;s batchmate at the Farm, a chick who may or may not be a double agent, but definitely has the hots for him. The three of them expectedly get involved a complicated plot involving double agents, unofficial operatives and the standard amount of secret agent sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best parts of the movie involve the CIA training. We get a glimpse into the kind of psychological warfare business they teach the recruits at the training centre affectionately called \u0026ldquo;The Farm.\u0026rdquo; Here Al Pacino does what he does, drilling his principles into his students: \u0026ldquo;Trust no one.\u0026quot;; \u0026ldquo;Nothing is what is seems.\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Everything is a test.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weakest part has to be the character of James Clayton himself. The character of Leila puts it best: Why the hell does James feel like doing anything he can to please Burke? James never has any real motivation for following Burke like he was the Messiah. Aside from that mysterious star on the CIA wall at Langley (which may or may not be related to his father), there is nothing stopping James from just calling it quits and heading home. Hell, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have wanted to go through that training, secret agent or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall: Enjoyable enough, despite the predictability of the overall plot. Ending is a bit disappointing, but only a bit, as it leaves an important plot point hanging. I hope we see these characters again sometime\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I\u0026rsquo;m a bit worried about what happens after the training though, from the looks of it people put in a lot of overtime here. :( The best thing about the job is that I\u0026rsquo;m learning a lot of stuff. In two weeks I learned SQL, PL/SQL and Delphi. Starting tomorrow I\u0026rsquo;m gonna be training on Oracle Developer. The work itself looks easy enough — nothing I can\u0026rsquo;t handle. Since most of the coding is done using high-level RAD Tools, I should be fine. On a side note, it\u0026rsquo;s a weird feeling actually having access to money. It\u0026rsquo;s like everything looks different because there\u0026rsquo;s always the possibility of buying stuff. On another side note, I\u0026rsquo;m paying a lot in taxes. My annual salary is like a couple of ten thousand above the minimum for my bracket. It\u0026rsquo;s irritating.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

First I had to wrestle with my PC\u0026rsquo;s small case, trying to figure out where to place the thing. Then, given how old my PC is, it predictably failed to detect the whole capacity of the drive, insisting it was only 8 Gb. I went down to Seagate\u0026rsquo;s website and did some Dynamic Drive Overlay thing that let me overcome the BIOS limitations. But the DDO installed a Bootloader that would often hang the PC upon booting! I had to send in an email to Seagate tech support and wait til the next morning before I could get everything fine and dandy. Now I have a nice healthy 36 Gb of space\u0026hellip; almost 20 times as much capacity as the old drive. Sw33t. The only problem now is that the hard drive didn\u0026rsquo;t come with any screws — so I just placed it on top of the old one. And I had to move my floppy so it\u0026rsquo;s lopsided.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I\u0026rsquo;ve had a couple of days to think about it, so I\u0026rsquo;d like to share my thoughts on the matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, the facts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnix and Square are merging. Square stock will be bought out for Enix stock at 0.81 Square per 1 Enix. The Square president will be head of Square Enix, the Enix board remains in place, they\u0026rsquo;ll move into Enix headquarters in Shibuya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll currently announced releases will go on as scheduled. A FF/DW merger may be in the offing, but no definite plans, and probably only as a side release. No personnel will be let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquaresoft is: Final Fantasy, Chrono, Xeno, SaGa, Mana and assorted other titles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnix is: Dragon Quest/Warrior, Soul Blazer series, 7th Saga, Actraiser, Tri-Ace (Star Ocean, Valkyrie Profile), and a lot of stuff that never made it outside Japan. Enix also has a deal with GameArts on co-developing the Grandia series.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSony, one of Square\u0026rsquo;s major stockholders, will have it\u0026rsquo;s shares diluted to 8% of Square/Enix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNamco, another game company also has some stock in both Square and Enix, and is the publisher of Xenogears\u0026rsquo; prequel, Xenosaga.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquare also has a US publishing deal with EA, set to expire at the end of the year. (This last tidbit may not mean anything\u0026hellip; )\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquare also recently acquired the Quest team (responsible for Tactics Ogre series) and the rights to the Ogre Battle franchise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, what can we see?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst off, Enix will be in control, at least at first. Although the Square guy will be Pres, the Pres can always be overridden by the board, and the Enix board will remain in place until they hold a stockholder election thingy, whatever that\u0026rsquo;s called. You might think this is bad \u0026ldquo;Oh no, Enix is in control, that means FF is doomed!\u0026rdquo; Of course not. They\u0026rsquo;re not stupid. The fact is that Enix being in control of the company\u0026rsquo;s vision and direction makes more sense in light of Square and Enix\u0026rsquo;s overlapping powers. Square develops most of it\u0026rsquo;s products in-house, while Enix publishes a lot of products from other developers like Tri-Ace and Gamearts. Therefore, it makes more sense for Enix to be in control of administrative/business stuff, leaving Square staff to focus on what they do best — game development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what does this mean to us as gamers? In the immediate future, nothing really. All the currently announced projects are unaffected: we\u0026rsquo;ll still get FFXI, FFXII, FF:Crystal Chronicle, FFTA, Unlimited Saga, etc. The only thing I\u0026rsquo;ve found people to be questioning on message boards is whether FF1-2 (which still doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a definite announcement of a US release) will have an English version. This is a possible concern, as Enix didn\u0026rsquo;t even bother to release an English version of their own DW4. Who knows, maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll get a collection of DW4 and FF1-2? 😛 (Addendum: FF1-2 has been announced for US release.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut after the immediate future, what then? Square Enix will almost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecertainly continue the Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior lines. The future for the Chrono series also seems bright, as the original Chrono Trigger was a collaboration between Square and some of Enix\u0026rsquo;s creative staff. Stuff from Tri-Ace and GameArts will probably go on as before, seeing as these development studios are mostly independent of Enix anyway. And if we\u0026rsquo;re lucky, we\u0026rsquo;ll get another Soul Blazer trilogy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I worry about are Square\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;secondary\u0026rdquo; RPG series: SaGa and Mana. Now that Square Enix will have two \u0026ldquo;big\u0026rdquo; series under it\u0026rsquo;s roof, will they still have time to develop these still-young series?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough not really related to the merger, things also look bright for fans of FFTactics. Aside from the upcoming FFTA, Square\u0026rsquo;s acquisition of Quest and the Ogre Battle franchise means we\u0026rsquo;ll probably see more FFT/TacticsOgre type games coming from them. Combined with the unique gameplay perspective of Tri-Ace, who knows what interesting games will come out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been looking around on message boards after the news came out, and it seems a lot of people are worried about how Enix might screw up Final Fantasy, or Square screw up Dragon Warrior or anything like that. To this, again I say: They\u0026rsquo;re not stupid. FF and DW, although they have the same roots, are completely different series now, and their different styles again reflect how Square and Enix can complement each other\u0026rsquo;s strengths. Well, I guess DW will benefit the most, as it\u0026rsquo;s sorely lacking in FFs specialty: really good graphics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother concern that has been raised has been the possibility of a monopoly in RPG games. With this merger, a lot of the big RPG names are now under one roof. Won\u0026rsquo;t the lesser competition cause more lackluster RPGs to be put out? Maybe, but I doubt it. Square Enix still can\u0026rsquo;t afford to let up on the quality, as there are still a good number of other good up-and-coming series out there: Suikoden (Konami), Wild Arms (Sony?), Tales (Namco) and Breath of Fire (Capcom) all still have quite some following and good potential. In fact the above titles will probably slug it out for the Number 2 Console RPG Developer slot\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, the opinions I\u0026rsquo;ve read on the web are mixed: some are good, some are bad. My own personal take is that it\u0026rsquo;s good; mergers generally mean two companies wanting to capitalize on each other\u0026rsquo;s strengths, not share each other\u0026rsquo;s weaknesses. Let\u0026rsquo;s just wait and see, and hope for the best. 😛\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003ch5 id=\"the-bourne-identity\"\u003eThe Bourne Identity\u003c/h5\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new action hero is Bourne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a bit anxious to see this movie, as I had thoroughly enjoyed the book of the same name a long time ago, and I was hoping the movie would give me the same satisfaction. The Bourne Identity stars Matt Damon as rogue CIA agent/amnesiac Jason Bourne. In his quest to uncover his own identity, Jason travels all around Europe pursued by the CIA\u0026rsquo;s agents and dragging along an innocent gypsy girl who just happened to be his best shot for a ride to Paris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I haven\u0026rsquo;t read the book in ages, so I can\u0026rsquo;t say for sure how faithfully the story translates to the movie (although as I recall there was a lot more traipsing across Europe — I may be wrong though) so I have to judge the movie on its own merits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn its own merits, the movie falls short of my expectations. Mainly because I was expecting some fast-paced action, but most of the time it\u0026rsquo;s just Jason and Marie running and hiding from the CIA. It\u0026rsquo;s more of an action/thriller than a straight action flick — Jason spends a lot of time trying to uncover the conspiracy behind his pursuers. However, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to pull off either the thriller part or the action part very well. The thriller part doesn\u0026rsquo;t fly because we know what\u0026rsquo;s going on well before Jason does — the movie shows us what\u0026rsquo;s going on at CIA HQ, how his boss travels to Paris to mete him, et cetera. The action part doesn\u0026rsquo;t fly because the thriller parts get in the way. DOn\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, there are some cool action stunts here — Jason riding a free-falling body down the center of a spiral stairway to gun down one of the CIA agents — but they are few and far between. Also, the director seems to enjoy some sort of shaky, jarring camera work — not really a problem but occasionally\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eannoying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall: Good enough, I suppose. The director is no Robert Ludlum\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebut the story is told well enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch5 id=\"austin-powers-in-goldmember\"\u003eAustin Powers in Goldmember\u003c/h5\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo I make you horny baby?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother Austin Powers movie? Well I knew what to expect — more of the same. I got what I expected, but that isn\u0026rsquo;t really a bad thing. As usual with Austin Powers movies, some parts tend to drag on, while some parts are simply \u0026ldquo;laugh-out-loud\u0026rdquo; funny. This time, Dr. Evil enlists the aid of 70\u0026rsquo;s criminal mastermind Goldmember in a nefarious plot to extort money from the world leaders (as if you didn\u0026rsquo;t know.) Austin himself gets some help (aside from the requisite Powers girl Beyonce Knowles as Foxy Cleopatra) — from none other than his dear old dad, legendary secret agent Nigel Powers (played by Michael Caine) This one has a bit more story than the first two — you get to find out more about Austin and Dr. Evil\u0026rsquo;s history, and some strange plot twists ensue. Expect the return of such characters as MiniMe, Fat Bastard and Dr. Evil\u0026rsquo;s wayward son Scott. Also a new character on the side of British Intelligence is played by Wonder Years star Fred Savage\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe funniest parts are mostly during the opening sequence and towards the end. Expect more gross, insensitive and blatantly offensive humor, more naked bodies, more Fat Bastard crapping, more silhouette jokes, more making fun of MiniMe, hollywood cameos, movie spoofs and the like. This time however, things don\u0026rsquo;t stay the same. Some changes in the status quo happen towards the end and this will obviously not be the last Austin Powers movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall: I liked the second one better, but this one\u0026rsquo;s good too. As is the case with Austin Powers movies, it\u0026rsquo;s not for the easily offended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch5 id=\"signs\"\u003eSigns\u003c/h5\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrop circles? This isn\u0026rsquo;t the X-files is it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf the three movies I saw this week, \u0026ldquo;Signs\u0026rdquo; was the one I was looking forward to the least. The trailer didn\u0026rsquo;t really give me a good impression — looked like some cheap X-Files ripoff with Mel Gibson as Fox Mulder. As it usually happens, turns out I was wrong about the whole thing \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;Signs\u0026rdquo; is one helluva good movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s get it out first: \u0026ldquo;Signs\u0026rdquo; is about an alien invasion. We\u0026rsquo;re talking spaceships and green men. However, unlike movies like Independence Day which tell the story of how the world comes together to defeat an alien menace, \u0026ldquo;Signs\u0026rdquo; tells the story of how a family comes together to survive fear, paranoia and green men knocking on their door. All of the Independence Day stuff happens, but never at the forefront of the story — the giant spaceships are there, somewhere in the background, shown on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story is about a farmer and his family in a small rural town. Overnight, mysterious crop circles appear in his fields. Later on, more signs appear — prowlers around their house, strange radio noises. As a former minister, Mel Gibson faces what he fears the most — the idea that there is no God, and that he and his family are left to fend for themselves against whatever threat is there lurking in the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe movie is extremely well-written, with all the characters playing their parts well, and all the elements coming together towards the end to make a whole lot of sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall: Go see it. Now. Unless you\u0026rsquo;re like my kid brother who would probably get nightmares just thinking about an alien invasion.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "The Bourne Identity A new action hero is Bourne\nI was a bit anxious to see this movie, as I had thoroughly enjoyed the book of the same name a long time ago, and I was hoping the movie would give me the same satisfaction. The Bourne Identity stars Matt Damon as rogue CIA agent/amnesiac Jason Bourne. In his quest to uncover his own identity, Jason travels all around Europe pursued by the CIA\u0026rsquo;s agents and dragging along an innocent gypsy girl who just happened to be his best shot for a ride to Paris.",

Dave, Mon and I played approximately seven hours of CvS2, watched a Jet Li flick then played around eight hours of Warcraft III. WC3 is the bomb!

Then the usual birthday food in the evening, and some new pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had forgotten to go to Church that morning (curse you Warcraft III!!!) so I decided to go to Church this morning. Before going I was stiull a bit down about being a 24-year old bum, but somehow going to Church gave me back a bit of hope. Funny how although I\u0026rsquo;m not a very good practicing Catholic, a few quiet moments with God are enough to change my perspective on things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, this is the start of a new year, hopefully one better than the last. I don\u0026rsquo;t know where fate will take me this year, but I will face life with open arms, overcome all challenges and spit in the face of destiny. All things happen for a purpose, hopefully soon i will know mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
