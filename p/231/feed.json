The other participants were people I knew (relatives, friends, coworkers and the like). The fate of the world may have been on the line or something.  Anyway, they give us the problems to solve and there\u0026rsquo;s three questions and the questions are hard: each question gives you a bunch of real-world facts and you have to find out a specific piece of information, but it looks they\u0026rsquo;ll be requiring a lot of computation and stuff.   I ask I can go do the solving in my room (conveniently, the contest is taking place at our old house back in Kamias), so I go there and boot up TWO computers and start writing programs/scripts to do computational work, internet searches, pattern analysis, etc.  I\u0026rsquo;m at this for a while and there\u0026rsquo;s no progress so I decide to go back and check how the other participants were doing. One of them tells me he\u0026rsquo;s already answered like 10-15 questions and I\u0026rsquo;m like \u0026ldquo;What, weren\u0026rsquo;t there only 3 questions?\u0026rdquo; He tells me to go back and check the paper.  I look for the paper they gave me with the questions and sure enough there were actually 5 pages of questions, and the later pages were easy questions like multiple choice, essay, with some that can be answered subjectively etc.   I facepalm and sit down with a pen to start answering the questions. Someone might have also put a Lego Transformer (it was a G1 Autobot - Trailblazer. This fact is irrelevant, but I like it) on the desk while I was answering. It was around this time I woke up.  And that\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m already awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
