            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eFriends will know I\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting to get a Macbook for quite a while now. I have chat messages as far back as 2016 musing about buying a Macbook Pro. I haven\u0026rsquo;t had a serious \u003ca href=\"/2008/06/new-laptop/\"\u003epersonal laptop purchase since 2008\u003c/a\u003e. (Side note: Qualifier \u0026ldquo;serious\u0026rdquo; because I do have a low-spec MSI laptop I think I bought for cheap some years ago that I\u0026rsquo;m not really happy with. It\u0026rsquo;s got a dead battery now, I should probably install it with a more lightweight Linux or something and maybe use it as a torrent device or such?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy main motivation for getting a Macbook might seem a bit shallow: I want to be able to publish apps on Apple\u0026rsquo;s app store. Not having a Mac, this particular avenue of software development is closed off to me, so it limits my future freelance work possibilities a bit. Secondary reason being that I am fond of \u003ca href=\"/2006/01/adventures-in-linux-land-part-1/\"\u003eexploring alternative OSes\u003c/a\u003e even though I grew up on Windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, dropping hints to friends and relatives that I would appreciate being gifted with a Macbook Pro didn\u0026rsquo;t work. The main thing holding me back from buying a Mac is that they\u0026rsquo;re really very expensive devices. I eventually decided to bite the bullet myself and I purchased a Macbook Air (2017 model, 256gb SSD) last October. Macbook Air instead of Pro so I could save a little bit of money (it helped to convince myself to buy). Also, I\u0026rsquo;m a bit of a Mac newbie anyway, so maybe it was better to start with a slightly cheaper model before going all hardcode? I wanted to avoid the more recent MBPs anyway due to reported issues with the new keyboard. The MBA2017 had a bit of a better hardware spec than the newer Macbooks available at the time as well, so went ahead with the purchase. (It so happened that about a month later, Apple announced a 2018 line of Macbook Airs, but you know, \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/choose-without-regret-and-the-fear-of-missing-out/\"\u003echoose without regret\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#74dfd6287af42d7b4187a0a1cd8b2573-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/macbook-air-2017-model/macbookair_hu8a9e433e3e166639d0aab6421c6203d6_523722_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Chocnut for scale\" title=\"Chocnut for scale\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eChocnut for scale (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"74dfd6287af42d7b4187a0a1cd8b2573-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/macbook-air-2017-model/macbookair.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eChocnut for scale\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"10 Dec 2018 1:56am\"\u003e10 Dec 2018 1:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI do have a bit of experience using a Mac, since I was on an iOS dev team for a short while back at my old job (where my contribution to the project mainly consisted of proposing ways to clean up the very messy Objective-C code base). Back then I had a Mac Mini assigned to me, and I found myself warming up to Mac OS X easily. I can\u0026rsquo;t fully articulate why, but it seems like a very nice piece of software. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of minor UI things that I appreciate and while Windows 10 already has something close to it, Spotlight still feels special, especially since it\u0026rsquo;s been around longer. And I really appreciate the sleek aluminum build; unlike many Windows laptops it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel shoddily put together. It\u0026rsquo;s also quite a bit lighter than the work-issued laptop I was previously using.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I am generally happy with the purchase, although to be honest I haven\u0026rsquo;t used it too much because I\u0026rsquo;ve been cutting back on my work hours since October (which means less computing time is on the move), but it has come in handy on occasion when I\u0026rsquo;d like to work on things away from my desk. There is a tiny bit of friction when switching between devices with different OSes, mainly that keyboard shortcuts are often completely different - things often don\u0026rsquo;t map cleanly between Windows\u0026rsquo; Ctrl and Alt and Mac\u0026rsquo;s Cmd, Option and Ctrl. That being said, it is decent enough for programming work - VS Code and XCode both run smoothly, and it allowed me to finally update an iOS app I\u0026rsquo;ve supposedly  been maintaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Macbook Air 2017 is a nice, handy little machine, and I hope to be using it for years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI recently found a stash of old DOS games we used to play, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d write about the early days of PC gaming. My PC gaming career (such as it is) started way back in the MS-DOS era. It was an interesting time to be a gamer, to say the least. It was a time when you had to make bootdisks and fiddle around with files like \u003ccode\u003eautoexec.bat\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003ehimem.sys\u003c/code\u003e to make sure your PC booted with the correct configuration required to run your game. I got to become familiar with things like VGA drivers and sound drivers and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think we had our first PC in the household around \u0026lsquo;92 or \u0026lsquo;93, while I was in high school. I have this vague recollection of using some text from the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(video_game)\"\u003efirst \u003cstrong\u003eCivilization\u003c/strong\u003e game\u003c/a\u003e in one of my Social Science reports. Pretty sure Civ 1, as I\u0026rsquo;m still playing the series to this day. I played a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e of the first Civ game, enough to be able to master the highest difficulty level and (with sufficient save scumming), conquer the world with Chariots before Christ is born. The first Civ game was also my first experience at \u0026ldquo;hacking\u0026rdquo; a game so to speak, since many of the configuration options were read from plain text files on the disk. Even the Civilopedia entries came from text files, so I was able to copy them out to use in my report as mentioned above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother mainstay of my early PC gaming years was LucasArts-style adventure games. I think my first exposure to these games was during a high school party back in maybe \u0026lsquo;93 or \u0026lsquo;94. The host had a copy of \u003cstrong\u003eManiac Mansion\u003c/strong\u003e on his PC, and I spent some time playing that before getting stuck at the big door at the top of the stairs because the host had lost the copy protection disk. Within the next year, I had played the sequel game \u003cstrong\u003eDay of the Tentacle\u003c/strong\u003e (to this day I am unsure if I ever finished the first Maniac Mansion though) and the similar Monkey Island games. I must admit that I had a lot more patience then, as these days I haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten far with the current crop of Telltale-led adventure games and the endless trial and error that inevitably arises when you get stuck. (I\u0026rsquo;ve been stuck on Broken Age on PS4 for maybe a year now, I should get that done).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the earlist dungeon crawlers my brother and I played was \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waxworks_(1992_video_game)\"\u003ethe horror game \u003cstrong\u003eWaxworks\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. This was a single player game, but I say \u0026ldquo;my brother and I\u0026rdquo; because we were often too scared to play the game alone. The sharp 90 degree turns meant enemies could jump out of nowhere. I\u0026rsquo;m sure if I played it now I would feel silly, but back then I remember we had tried playing the game at night while the parentals were out, and some baddie jumped out at us in the pyramid level and we went afk at the jump scare and ran out to the nearby sari-sari store. After typing this paragraph, I decided to try running the old copy of Waxworks I still had (you can run old games using \u003ca href=\"https://www.dosbox.com/\"\u003eDOSBox\u003c/a\u003e) and it reminded me that the game had very creepy midi music! Probably contributed a lot to the atmosphere. I don\u0026rsquo;t play horror games anymore nowadays lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#49520fc5ad2d4c8ed479cc83eb6e37e8-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/ancient-pc-gaming/waxworks_hufa0f7d0295fe0441123f40579799f0de_56604_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"Waxworks: The pyramid level was the one we were most familiar with, since it was the first one available.\" title=\"Waxworks: The pyramid level was the one we were most familiar with, since it was the first one available.\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eWaxworks: The pyramid level was the one we were most familiar with, since it was the first one available.

I remember playing RTK2 a little bit, but it was RTK3 that we generally spent a lot of time in (we = me and my brothers and some HS friends). I spent so much time on this game, I could finish the game from a single province in the final scenario (where your opponents were 3 large empires). One of our favorite features in RTK3 was the fact that there was a custom character creator. We had a copy of the game that we passed around with a whole bunch of custom characters named after our HS friends. My brother was a big fan of this feature too, he added a bunch of high-stat custom characters named after himself. Sadly, my only remaining copy of this game only has my brother\u0026rsquo;s custom characters and not the ones me and my HS friends made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#d67f359f83486dfd410f8d65d9de5ea1-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/ancient-pc-gaming/rtk3kerwins_hua9d2390344281f4b0116187418d79546_81263_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"RTK3: He really liked naming characters after himself.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI must admit being a bit unconcerned with online privacy tracking by the large vendoers (Google, Facebook, etc). I mean, I do tend to use \u003ca href=\"/2008/09/i-claim-my-name/\"\u003emy real name as username\u003c/a\u003e after all, so most everything I do online can be traced back to me. I assume that anything I do on the internet can be figured out by other parties, so if something is important enough to me that it should be kept private, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t go on the internet at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the services provided by Facebook and Google, I accept that they require tracking my data in order to provide those services. For example, a few months ago I made a Protonmail account so I\u0026rsquo;d have a secure email that I can use in place of GMail. But it turns out, I haven\u0026rsquo;t found a good use case for it yet. I use Gmail\u0026rsquo;s search a lot, and ProtonMail is nowhere that robust. Maybe if I were a spy or something, I would consider using ProtonMail, but for now I think for everyday usage the GMail features are an acceptable tradeoff for the fact that they are reading your email data and using it for targetted advertising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also tried using the alternative, privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo, but I was not too happy with the search results I was getting, and I occasionally find it useful to be able to check my search history for stuff I remember finding but could no longer find. Having my search results tailored for me turned out kind of useful too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReading some forum discussions, there are a lot of people who are vehemently against being tracked for the purposes of targetted advertising. I can understand the sentiment, but personally I don\u0026rsquo;t mind targetted advertising because (a) it\u0026rsquo;s marginally better than being bombarded with ads for things you don\u0026rsquo;t actually care about; and (b) I am not easily susceptible to impulse purchases, at least not due to internet ads. I grew up with the free internet, so even if I wasn\u0026rsquo;t using adblock, my brain automatically ignores ads on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be honest, I accept that these companies are tracking my data because I would track my own data if I could. I find it useful to have my own history. An example is location history; I have my phone GPS on all the time, so Google Maps is able to keep a history of where I\u0026rsquo;ve gone everyday. I reference this every so often, because I\u0026rsquo;m forgetful. \u0026ldquo;Where did I go last Wednesday?\u0026rdquo; is a trivial question to answer when the cloud has the data. As a software developer, I could build my own systems to track this myself, but why bother? I use the cloud as an extension of my own memory, which is often fallible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have been starting \u003ca href=\"/2018/03/rethinking-facebook/\"\u003eto wean myself off Facebook\u003c/a\u003e, though that proves difficult due to network effects. But it would probably be more difficult for me to cease usage of my Google account, since I use it for a bunch of cloud stuff. Well, I did get it started by making Firefox my main browser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do understand the use case for privacy. If you\u0026rsquo;re handling any sort of sensitive information or anything dangerous, say as an investigative journalist in a fascist regime, then maybe an extra level of protection is required. So I appreciate the existence of secure alternatives. I recently found \u003ca href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/8sffn7/pc_users_guide_to_privacy/\"\u003ea reddit thread\u003c/a\u003e that had a good summary of the modern online privacy options available. If you want or need online privacy, you have to understand that there\u0026rsquo;s a tradeoff in terms of convenience. You can give up Google or Facebook services or use Tor and VPNs and all those other stuff, but you lose some features too. And maybe that\u0026rsquo;s fine, it\u0026rsquo;s up to you to determine that\u0026rsquo;s acceptable for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It marshals one last assault and slams us with everything it’s got.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Side note: I\u0026rsquo;ve put his books on an Amazon wishlist. I should remind myself to do this whenever I find books that sound interesting)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about new projects all the time: game dev ideas, app ideas, programming projects, plot ideas for a novel, and so on. Very few of them go on to completion or at least some version of production. Some reasons I\u0026rsquo;ve had difficulty finishing side projects:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI tend to start losing interest when I come across the boring parts of a project or parts I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do. Some examples are UI/design, or promo work/sales/marketing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI might also be overwhelmed by how much work there is that needs to be done. I understand making breaking down the work into a list and then just choosing one task at a time until you get something done. Hmm, I guess sometimes doing the work breakdown is one of the things that falls under the first bullet\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esometimes I might also be frustrated by a lack of technical skill in implementation. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking this applies mostly to stuff like writing or drawing, where I feel like my execution or creativity isn\u0026rsquo;t good enough. This frustration can be overcome by practice, but practice risks the first bullet again\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esometimes I\u0026rsquo;ll also lose motivation if the project turns out too difficult or too time-consuming, as if it\u0026rsquo;s not worth the effort. This can be a legitimate reason for dropping a project, as long as I make sure my assessment is rational.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOne of my main problems seems to be that I\u0026rsquo;m easily distracted by new, shiny ideas that come along. That\u0026rsquo;s why reading this comic felt a bit like a personal attack:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.redd.it/48lvp1vv4p121.jpg\" alt=\"\"\u003e via \u003ca href=\"https://reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor\"\u003e/r/ProgrammerHumor\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do have the ability to go into hyperfocus and gain the flow, enough to immerse myself in what I\u0026rsquo;m doing, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t always last, and it\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a double-edged sword, because if something else grabs my attention, there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance I\u0026rsquo;ll hyperfocus on that. (Another edge being of course, I can be so hyperfocused in burns me out).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Slight tangent: When I\u0026rsquo;m in a team project, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty good at getting things done, because (a) there\u0026rsquo;s usually someone else holding me to account and making sure stuff gets done; and (b) there\u0026rsquo;s usually team mates to help take up those parts that I find uninteresting.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t list plain old laziness among the reasons above, though I\u0026rsquo;m surely guilty of that. But I think usually laziness is a symptom of one of these other reasons and me making excuses for not getting stuff done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of these are some demons I need to tame if I really want to become more independent; I guess at least recognizing them is key and compensating for them where necessary, and making sure I only drop projects if I\u0026rsquo;m convinced they\u0026rsquo;re not worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoincidentally relevant webcomic:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003einspiration strikes \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/qihgd0Q8to\"\u003epic.twitter.com/qihgd0Q8to\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u0026mdash; the Awkward Yeti (Nick Seluk) (@theawkwardyeti) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/theawkwardyeti/status/1070082567402110977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eDecember 4, 2018\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e \u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e ",

My idea was to use this to analyze my public posts (specifically, on Twitter), to see whether I was trending towards being more positive or more negative.

I can\u0026rsquo;t even get a technical blog post out of it since the process was mind-numbingly simply, I just used the \u003ca href=\"https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/\"\u003estraightforward Python TextBlob library\u003c/a\u003e which had a sentiment analysis function.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes things don\u0026rsquo;t work out, and that\u0026rsquo;s fine. Not everything you try is going to be a success. Not all experiments lead to some fantastic discovery. We simply pick ourselves up and move on to the next thing, or the next iteration. If we\u0026rsquo;re lucky, maybe we learn something new that helps us with the next thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is the nature of human advancement: rarely do things succeed on the first try, in many cases it\u0026rsquo;s simply a matter of trial and error, of trying a variety of things until something sticks. This is why using an incremental approach is often advisable - trying small things until they succeed and chaining small things into bigger things, so that at any given stage you never fail too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It\u0026rsquo;s quite creepy, and the mere idea evokes \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosedive_(Black_Mirror)\"\u003ethe dystopian Black Mirror episode \u0026ldquo;Nosedive\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e where people use an app to rate other people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChina\u0026rsquo;s social credit system might be even worse than the Black Mirror one because:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eit\u0026rsquo;s instigated by the state, instead of a (presumably) commercial app like in Black Mirror. Instead of people you interact with regularly rating you, it\u0026rsquo;s now some faceless bureaucrat who might have an agenda. At least if it\u0026rsquo;s people, you might be able to cozy up enough to other people to get your rating back up.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehow would you opt out? In the Black Mirror episode, the protagonist\u0026rsquo;s brother was the type of person who didn\u0026rsquo;t care about social status so the ratings didn\u0026rsquo;t affect him. In a system administered by the state and applied universally, you have no choice. Well, I guess you can still be all \u0026ldquo;meh, I don\u0026rsquo;t care\u0026rdquo; and just don\u0026rsquo;t avail of the benefits unlocked by higher ratings, but since it\u0026rsquo;s the state promoting this, it\u0026rsquo;s likely the scope where the ratings matter will only become larger with time\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy is the idea of a rating system inherently creepy? People judge other people all the time. We judge other people by how they look, the clothes they wear, how they behave, where they went to school, what job they have, what kind of car they drive, and so on. And people often do change their own behavior to influence how others judge them. In certain countries, they already have financial rating systems that allow companies to judge you based on your credit history. It\u0026rsquo;s simply a factor in how human societies work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think having a numeric rating system for social behavior feels so off because it attempts to quantify something that we understand to be inherently subjective, and attempts to impose that standard rating system indiscriminately. And a rating attached to each person universally feels like it would be very difficult to shake off. If someone judges you based on your looks or your clothes you can always change them. If all the people in your neighborhood dislike you, you can always move to a new area. But if there\u0026rsquo;s a quantitative rating attached to you in some centralized database somewhere? People who don\u0026rsquo;t know you can judge you instantly, even if they\u0026rsquo;ve never heard of your past indiscretions. The rating would follow you around where ever you go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least financial credit systems are there to promote good financial decisions (since they are used to judge your credit risk). China\u0026rsquo;s social credit system looks like it\u0026rsquo;s designed to promote obedience to the state or adherence to state-preferred behavior, which means reduced freedoms. One can only hope such an experiment fails and does not propagate to other more democratic-leaning countries, but given the recent worldwide trends, I am not too hopeful.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
