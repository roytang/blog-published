Well, my first answer was that those are just things I find interesting and may look into, but that\u0026rsquo;s not really an answer for the inspiration part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoftware development is a very wide field, one where the amount of things you can learn increases daily, so it\u0026rsquo;s almost impossible to keep up with everything. I think that having a natural tendency or curiosity towards learning new things is a distinct advantage in this industry. Having at least some passing familiarity with a wide range of technologies gives you more options in both job hunting and deciding on technical approaches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen interviewing developers, I often viewed it as a distinct advantage when a candidate invested their own time in trying out new tech. However, I realize that spending your own time to learn things on your own is another form of privilege that I have. Not all developers will have the free time or motivation to do that unless it was part of their work tasks. So insisting that developers should do this in their free time is a bit elitist to say the least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI read \u003ca href=\"http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2018/12/who-should-pay-for-upskilling-software-developers-individuals-or-employers/\"\u003ea blog post\u003c/a\u003e the other day saying it\u0026rsquo;s actually beneficial for companies to pay for their employees to learn stuff during work time. Quote:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiving developers time to learn makes good business sense in a competitive world where attracting and retaining skilled people is an advantage in the marketplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this makes sense, the problem with this is that from experience, many companies are running their projects on very tight schedules, some often almost always behind schedule, which makes giving developers free time for self-improvement will often be unattractive to higher-ups. I know that in my previous jobs, the only way I could justify learning a new technology would be if it was required or important for a specific upcoming project. In a way, having the space to allow developers this privilege is in itself a privilege that not all companies can afford.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSupposedly in the modern softeare industry, demand for developers is still high compared to supply so individuals should still have some leverage here and should vote with our feet. Younger or entry-level developers should ask companies about their policies for upskilling their employees and prefer those which give them more opportunities, and disfavor companies where the devs\u0026rsquo; technical knowledge tends to stagnate, so that companies will learn to adjust. Such factors can only be good for their career in the long run.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

As border inspector, you\u0026rsquo;re charged with inspecting the documents of people who want to enter the country, and your meagre salary depends on how many people you are able to correctly process in one day. The day-to-day gameplay tension is between your need to process as many people as possible so that you have enough to pay rent and feed your family; vs your desire to avoid making mistakes. Mistakes often come in the form of allowing entrants with discrepancies in their papers to pass through unchallenged, and making multiple mistakes in the same day is painful for your salary and endangers your family members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#be6c48b1b69c8295e4e30d0815d116ca-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2019/01/papers-please/papers-please_hu2d60a46d8ef2e2891c0d2fe52ac06588_137907_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"be6c48b1b69c8295e4e30d0815d116ca-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2019/01/papers-please/papers-please.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"13 Jan 2019 5:56am\"\u003e13 Jan 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gameplay is mostly attention to detail. At the start of a run, you only have one or two documents per entrant and it\u0026rsquo;s relatively simply: make sure their passport photo matches their appearance, make sure the passport isn\u0026rsquo;t expired, make sure it has a valid issuing city, etc. As the days pass, the Arstotzkan bureaucracy imposes more requirements upon entrants, making your job considerably harder. Towards the end of the story mode\u0026rsquo;s 31-day period you\u0026rsquo;ll be checking 4-6 different documents per entrant, making sure all their papers are valid and all the info on each document matches the others and so on. It has an element of tediousness reflecting the actual job you are doing, and yet is strangely engaging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story mode is fairly good, and it finds you dealing with challenges like smugglers, refugees, bribes, forged documents, a nosy press, and even a group of rebels plotting to take down the fascist Arstotzkan government, and the occasional terrorist attack on your booth. There are a number of endings, you can choose to play it straight, do your job as ordered and not support any criminal elements at all, and you and your family will live your same life in Arstotzka. Or you can risk everything by helping dissidents and refugees and criminals, and in the end you have to find a way to escape your homeland with your family. Or you could make the wrong decision at some points, and the game will end earlier than expected. Many of the noncritical entrants are randomly-generated I think, but the story-critical ones are preordained to come at specific times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nation-state of Arstotzka is surprisingly efficient in some ways - if you make a mistake such as letting through an entrant with an invalid passport, you are immediately issued a citation (something you come to dread in the game). So somehow the bureaucracy is able to know what is happening in your booth - yet they are unable to detect your interactions with the dissidents and some of the criminals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAchievements: The game provides an autosave each day you complete, and you can resume from any of the previous days, so that\u0026rsquo;s helpful for achievement hunting. I didn\u0026rsquo;t bother going for achievement completion yet though, as the remaining ones I missed seem to require too much backtracking, and there\u0026rsquo;s other games to play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game was a good buy, and perhaps even still a bit relevant in the modern world, despite it\u0026rsquo;s 1980s setting.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA while back we were tasked with helping a client\u0026rsquo;s internal dev team to migrate their repositories from Subversion to Git. The distributed VCS seemed ideal for their situation - they had a very small in-house dev team managing contributions from external subcontractors. The main rationale was that their process of merging contributions from the external developers was extremely complicated and often resulted in conflicts that were challenging to merge. Before this, I hadn\u0026rsquo;t actually used Git too deeply myself (aside from cloning stuff from Github), and especially not in a team setting, so the training one of our other engineers gave them was a good opportunity for me to become familiar with Git as well. During the succeeding months we guided them through the first few pull requests and merges; their repository structure and build process was quite complicated so it took us a while to iron out the kinks. There was often some difficulty when merging PRs from old forks and so on. I mostly let our other engineer who had more Git experience handle any merging. Sometimes I wondered about whether the transition was really worth it for the client, but it all seemed to end up okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was reminded of this because I recently tried the whole workflow of fork and change code and pull request and merge with upstream to resolve conflicts in a larger, non-trivial project. (I don\u0026rsquo;t count the few PRs I did for Hacktoberfest last year, as those were relatively simple). This one was a whole new submodule that I had to merge into the main repository, so there were a lot of changes on my end. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting any conflicts though, because I was only adding new stuff and not modifying existing code. So I tried to make my PR without merging from upstream, not expecting any issues. Unfortunately, it turns out some CR/LF shenanigans between my Windows machine and the repo meant one of my commits had more \u0026ldquo;lines changed\u0026rdquo; than I intended, resulting in a merge conflict. Fortunately, it was easy to simply merge from upstream and resolve the offending files manually. Didn\u0026rsquo;t take me more than 5 minutes to fix the issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy experience with this was a bit amazing in retrospect. Mostly because for a large part of my career to as recently as four years ago, I worked with CVS as a version control system, which is ancient by modern standards. I remember during my first project, we had three branches: DEV, UAT and PROD. And moving changes from any given branch to another was a pain, each file had to be manually re-applied to the other branch. So my instinct has always been to dread any large-scale merge (something I have to unlearn apparently).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGit has a few other advantages of course. One of my favorites is being able to address specific commits individually by hash, and see the file changes and so on. When we were using CVS if you wanted to rollback to a specific change, you had to have the foresight to have tagged that change so that you can check it out again. And CVS for us was always very slow for larger projects with thousands of files, leading to annoyingly long build cycles and wait times. Git seems to be a lot more performant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold no ill will towards my old company for making me use CVS all those years. When I started out it was a reasonable choice, but as time went by better options simply became available, and like many companies it was difficult to leave entrenched systems. I did propose the use of distributed VCS over the years; at first Mercurial and later Git as well, but there was never a good time to migrate without being overly disruptive (this happens when Everything Is Urgent). Probably if I had gotten in on a larger project on the ground floor, but the last time I had a chance for that was around 2007 I think, when Git was still in infancy. Still, I heard from people still there that they\u0026rsquo;re already in migrating to Git, so good for them (even though they waited til I was gone!).\u003c/p\u003e\n",

With my recent \u003ca href=\"/2019/01/revisiting-c---after-a-decade/\"\u003erevisit of C++\u003c/a\u003e, I\u0026rsquo;m a bit interested in checking out a new statically-typed compiled language. Rust and Golang or the primary candidates here, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably toy around with both to see which one I like better. The problem here is that I typically do web-based programs, so finding a project where it would be worth using one of these might be challenging.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSwift\u003c/strong\u003e. Since I recently bought a \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/macbook-air-2017-model/\"\u003eMacbook Air\u003c/a\u003e, that opens up the possibility of trying out Swift. I was involved in a mobile project when Swift came out and found it interesting when I was first going through the documentation - maybe because I thought Objective-C was a hot mess (or at least our codebase was back then). I never did get a chance to try it out, so maybe I will this year - if I find an appropriate mobile app to work on.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKotlin\u003c/strong\u003e is to Java and the JVM as Swift is to Objective-C and iOS. It\u0026rsquo;s young, but as a JVM language it has direct interoperability with Java programs, and it\u0026rsquo;s supposedly a first-class language nowadays for Android development. If I do decide to work on a native mobile app, Kotlin is a prime choice for the Android version. (Assuming I\u0026rsquo;m willing to dive back into the JVM ecosystem\u0026hellip;)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCSS Grid\u003c/strong\u003e.

Speaking of frontends, I never got too deep into the current crop of frontend frameworks. Funny story, we were meeting with a database vendor to discuss solution options for a client and I mentioned I had already built a small prototype web application using their product. They asked me what framework I was using on the frontend and when I told them I wasn\u0026rsquo;t using any, I was told that was \u0026ldquo;hardcore\u0026rdquo;. While I do think it\u0026rsquo;s helpful for full-stack web developers to be familiar with vanilla JS, I am interested in trying out at least one of the three prevalent frontend frameworks - Vue, React, and Angular. I have kind of tried React a bit with React Native, but at this moment, I\u0026rsquo;m leaning more towards Vue.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMachine Learning\u003c/strong\u003e. Specifically, I want to try out some text generation using recurrent neural networks, like those posts where people generate screenplays etc. I\u0026rsquo;m not too conversant with the theory, but reading some examples and tutorials I think this is something doable. Just need a reasonable corpus of texts to work with\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTDD\u003c/strong\u003e. Yup, test-driven development. I\u0026rsquo;m way behind the curve on this one. I understand the theory and the benefits, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never been in the position to have TDD in my projects. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult sometimes to get management buy-in. At my past job, all of the testing was still manual. I\u0026rsquo;ve dabbled in TDD a bit, tried out some frameworks, but never full-scale in one of my projects. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll try to write some tests for one of my side projects this year.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s it. I think it\u0026rsquo;s quite a lot actually.

The thing about being a solution architect is that there isn\u0026rsquo;t really a clear definition of the role, what it involves, or the scope of responsibility. I suppose it depends largely on the organization and the project. The role mostly involves making techical decisions on a larger scale, like project-wide or organization-wide, rather than on the micro day-to-day technical decisions involved in a typical software development involves. These decisions can encompass not just coding, but also requirements gathering, application design, database design, modelling, testing methodology, processes, deployment, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is actually pretty much what I was doing during my last full-time job anyway. I was basically involved in technical decision-making at all levels. So there\u0026rsquo;s not much change, except that now there\u0026rsquo;s a formal name/title to the role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite that role, in my past job I still insisted on taking on some of the coding work myself, typically the more difficult ones. I think it\u0026rsquo;s important as a technical person to maintain some familiarity with the low-level coding details, even when you\u0026rsquo;re transitioning to higher-level work like management or architectural work. (Also, I still enjoy the vagaries of day-to-day coding.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a solution architect in particular, it helps to be familiar with a wide array of technologies, since it informs your technical recommendations. You won\u0026rsquo;t always get such exposure through official projects either, so it helps to be interested in these things on your own so you can read up or try them out in your spare time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, the term \u0026ldquo;solution architect\u0026rdquo; has been increasing in usage over the past few years, if Google Trends is any indication:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#8538e8aa0341cd3eb7a1630f595cac40-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2019/01/solution-architect/solution-architect_hua2140a621f54624710810700693deb41_39199_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"8538e8aa0341cd3eb7a1630f595cac40-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2019/01/solution-architect/solution-architect.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"7 Jan 2019 5:56am\"\u003e7 Jan 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e(I originally tried Google Trend\u0026rsquo;s embed option, but the embedded chart kept crashing my browser tab, so now you get a screen capture instead)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;d asked me five years ago I would have said such a role was within the scope of a senior engineer or technical lead.

            "summary": "Although I still primarily identify as a \u0026ldquo;Full Stack Developer\u0026rdquo;, during the past few years I\u0026rsquo;ve also found myself in a role called \u0026ldquo;Solution Architect\u0026rdquo;. The thing about being a solution architect is that there isn\u0026rsquo;t really a clear definition of the role, what it involves, or the scope of responsibility. I suppose it depends largely on the organization and the project. The role mostly involves making techical decisions on a larger scale, like project-wide or organization-wide, rather than on the micro day-to-day technical decisions involved in a typical software development involves.",
