Focus is back on a smaller group after the larger team in YJ season 2. A few new characters are introduced and I learned about a couple of DC heroes I wasn\u0026rsquo;t familiar with before. Probably still the best animated superhero show to date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the Netflix side, season 2 of \u003cstrong\u003ePunisher\u003c/strong\u003e is out as well. I finished watching it but didn\u0026rsquo;t bother posting a spoiler-free review this time. It was okay, but I don\u0026rsquo;t have much commentary. Not as strikingly good as the first one was, but pretty decent. It feels weird now watching these shows knowing they are likely to end soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeason 2 of \u003cstrong\u003eStar Trek Discovery\u003c/strong\u003e has also started! Only two episodes in so far, but still very good. Feels a lot more classic Trek than the previous season, and a much lighter tone, not just because their captain isn\u0026rsquo;t afraid of the light anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy Netflix history also says I watched Bird Box, which became a bit viral early this month for some reason, but that was just my niece making my mom watch it with her, even after I warned her she would get scared (she did).\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I recently found the stylesheets and such for my old django-powered blog from circa 2008-2009, and recently there\u0026rsquo;s been this \u0026ldquo;10-year challenge\u0026rdquo; meme where people show how they\u0026rsquo;ve changed over the past 10 years.

I used to pretty hyped for superhero movie trailers, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t bother watching this one yet. MCU still has two more movies coming out before this one, and I\u0026rsquo;m already hyped enough for those, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I have hype to spare for a third one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brother was complaining to me about the trailer, saying he was spoiled about some elements. Specifically, he wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware that [actor] was in the movie playing [villain]. I keep up with comic book news, so that wasn\u0026rsquo;t news for me, but I can see how disappointing it might be. Also, this seems to be typical - I check the first trailer for \u003cem\u003eSpider-Man Homecoming\u003c/em\u003e and it did show Michael Keaton\u0026rsquo;s Vulture. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to avoid the villain info, few people consider it a spoiler, it\u0026rsquo;s usually right there in the IMDB page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do think that trailers these days show too much though. During the past few years, I\u0026rsquo;ve been avoiding watching any trailer beyond the first one that comes out. Although given that I follow comic book news, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to avoid spoilers from succeeding trailer. Starting with the new Spider-Man I\u0026rsquo;m considering not watching any trailers at all (at least until I\u0026rsquo;m forced to watch one before an actual movie).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might also be a problem with these comic book movies that they come from an established IP - so someone familiar with the source material like me basically already has an idea of what stuff might happen. The title alone of \u003cem\u003eAvengers Infinity War\u003c/em\u003e gave me an idea of what happens in the movie after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think the perfect trailer for a completely new franchise gives you a taste of what\u0026rsquo;s to come without giving you details of the major conflict and so on. The \u003cem\u003eCaptain Marvel\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eShazam\u003c/em\u003e trailers have been pretty good in this regard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a sequel, the perfect trailer for me would be the first trailer for \u003cem\u003eAvengers: Endgame\u003c/em\u003e, which basically acted as a \u0026ldquo;story so far\u0026rdquo;, giving no new info that we didn\u0026rsquo;t know from \u003cem\u003eInfinity War\u003c/em\u003e. Other than the actual movie\u0026rsquo;s title at least, which I had been anticipating for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I think the matchup overall is about 50-50, maybe 55-45 in Golgari\u0026rsquo;s favor, and your win rate goes up if you get at least one life gain off Wildgrowth Walker. The 3 out of the 4 games I lost I either didn\u0026rsquo;t have access to one color, or never got off 2 lands. (I might need to mulligan better or add more duals - I\u0026rsquo;ve been saving my rare WCs so I only have 3 shock 2 check)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve played both decks on Arena; red has some explosive hands, but has a tendency to run out of steam. If they get the nut draw, there\u0026rsquo;s not much you can do, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be down to 6-8 before turn 4.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving wildgrowth isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary to win - 2 out of my 4 wins I didn\u0026rsquo;t draw one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ideal opening hand has 2-3 explore creatures (ideally two 2-drops, squire is preferred over branchwalker and a jadelight) to ensure a steady flow of lands. On turn one you play an elf if you have it, even if you have to use a shock, because they\u0026rsquo;ll bolt it everytime, and 2 \u0026lt;= 2-3. I kind of wish I had been tracking who was going first - I suspect it matters a lot, I\u0026rsquo;ll do that tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want to play creatures on turns 2-3 and just assume they\u0026rsquo;re going to die. You want them to waste their burn spells on your creatures. Play wildgrowth last, but if he\u0026rsquo;s your only guy, it\u0026rsquo;s okay to run him on 2 (especially if you have Find to get him back later).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen exploring during the early turns, send to the graveyard Tyrant, Karn, big Vraska, or Vivienne, those won\u0026rsquo;t be much help. Getting more creatures is better, just make sure you can play them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0026rsquo;re going to stabilize at around turns 4-6, with around 6-10 life, and hopefully the red deck\u0026rsquo;s hand is spent. 6 life is scary - you\u0026rsquo;re basically hoping he doesn\u0026rsquo;t have two bolts, but it happens. Stay scared, never attack without leaving a blocker for a hasted 2/2 mage. You\u0026rsquo;re hoping he doesn\u0026rsquo;t draw LUtS, Risk Factor or Frenzy (frenzy is the worst for him, light up is the best)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I\u0026rsquo;m sure it bothers other people too, but it annoys me a bit disproportionately. I\u0026rsquo;m an introvert by nature so every unexpected interaction \u0026ndash; even just the effort to shake my head at whatever they\u0026rsquo;re handing out \u0026ndash; takes away from my precious pool of socializing points. In addition to those people trying to flag you down as you walk about the mall, I also dislike it when salespeople in a store approach me unsolicited while I\u0026rsquo;m browsing, offering their help. If I need help, I\u0026rsquo;ll ask for it! If I\u0026rsquo;m interested in what your stall has, I\u0026rsquo;ll approach the stall myself!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s also probably because most of the time if I\u0026rsquo;m walking around in a mall, I have a specific purpose in mind, whether just to get from point A to point B, or to go to X store to buy Y thing, or trying to catch up on daily walking. Sometimes I\u0026rsquo;ll be in a \u0026ldquo;exploring\u0026rdquo; mode, and will probably be more amenable to that kind of thing, but that\u0026rsquo;s a bit rare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand of course that people need to make a living and that stuff needs to be told and there \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e actually people who could use help or might be interested in that condo flier. I wish there was some way to \u0026ldquo;opt out\u0026rdquo; of unsolicited marketing in real life. Maybe some sort of statement shirt I could wear that says \u0026ldquo;Strangers: Don\u0026rsquo;t talk to me unless I talk to you.\u0026rdquo; Since there\u0026rsquo;s not, I just try to avoid contact and maybe have a scary expression on my face. It rarely works though.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It got a bit of press a while back about how it was a nice place to hang out (for a government institution at least), so I had a todo list item about checking it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, last week I did! I passed by on a weekday afternoon about 4pm after running some errands. The library was open until 7pm, so the timing was fine. I went up to the building and the guard asked me what my business was and I said I just wanted to check out the library. He told me that bags weren\u0026rsquo;t allowed inside so I had to go to the baggage counter. Oops, luckily I only had my sling bag and not the full backpack I usually had when carrying a laptop. I left my sling bag at the counter and went inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe space wasn\u0026rsquo;t as large as I thought it would be - the pictures on the website made it seem a bit larger in my imagination. The tables and seats were maybe 75% full, mostly with students and library staff. The main library area was in the first floor. Second floor seemed to be some offices and an outdoor cafe, I didn\u0026rsquo;t explore the second floor too much. I walked around the ground floor rooms for a bit, browsing the shelves. Aside from the main area, there was a separate room specialized for Philippine history and such, a room for kids\u0026rsquo; books, a \u0026ldquo;puppeteers room\u0026rdquo;, and a smaller round room with periodicals and such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was also a small section for fiction books in the main area; the selection was decent, mostly mainstream titles like Hunger Games, some Robert Ludlum, a few sci-fi/fantasy titles, and so on. For the reference materials, it was about what you\u0026rsquo;d expect from a public library - most of it was dated and donated. The tech/comptuers sections had the sort of obsolete computer books you\u0026rsquo;d find at book sale - like \u0026ldquo;How to use Microsoft Access 95\u0026rdquo;, that kind of thing. There were The World is Flat by Friedman, and Obama\u0026rsquo;s book about hope or such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone showed me how to use one of the computer kiosks to search the library\u0026rsquo;s catalog, and I was told it should be accessible via the website, so that seems fine. If you wanted to know whether they had a particular book, you could just check the website first. Also, the catalog said they had some Thor comics, but they were in the children\u0026rsquo;s corner, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like going in there lol. I also tried connecting my iPad to the local wifi, but the internet wasn\u0026rsquo;t very good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI came away not too impressed with the library. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what I was expecting. I guess I was kind of hoping to see if it was a good place to hang out, maybe if I was stranded near city hall due to traffic or waiting around in that area for something. It seems like a fairly good place for students from nearby schools though, especially those with no internet access at home. At least my curiosity was sated and I managed to tick an item off my todo list!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I pass by the Quezon City Hall every so often, and I\u0026rsquo;ve always been curious about the QC public library they have there. It got a bit of press a while back about how it was a nice place to hang out (for a government institution at least), so I had a todo list item about checking it out.\nWell, last week I did! I passed by on a weekday afternoon about 4pm after running some errands.",

In hindsight, it makes more sense that people would actually be playing with people they knew, but the idea of playing chess with strangers seemed fun to me for some reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the other day I was passing by \u003ca href=\"/2018/10/the-qc-memorial-circle/\"\u003ethe QC circle\u003c/a\u003e (as is my wont), and I saw a bunch of white-haired old men playing chess under some tent-like structure. There were four chess sets set up and two of the boards were occupied with ongoing games. I strolled over and started watching the games. One of the guys sitting at the other two tables asked me if I wanted to play, just some quick games. There were chess clocks too! So we could play timed games, 10 minutes each. They told me the sets belonged to one of the gentlemen currently playing, and he just asked for some small amount in coins for playing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter some mumbling that I\u0026rsquo;m very out of practice I pretended to reluctantly agree. We set up the clock and went at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was true that I was out of practice. Most of my chess-playing days were back when I was in HS/college, though I did occasionally play when my old company had chess as a sportsfest event. (That didn\u0026rsquo;t last too long because one of our employees was an actual competitive chess player, and another one was a varsity player in college, so I never got beyond the top 4\u0026hellip;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst game I was black, and my openings were good enough, and we had a decent back and forth in the midgame, but I was behind in pawns and near the end game he forced a queen exchange and my king couldn\u0026rsquo;t handle the pawns in time. I almost ran out of time on the chess clock too!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI agreed to a second game, this time I was white and performed much worse. It was easier for me playing black and just reacting to what the opponent was doing, but as white I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any kind of decent plan and all my attacks ended horribly until I fell to a knight fork attack that took out a rook, then got trapped in a situation where I had to give up the queen to avoid a checkmate. I had already run out the clock by that point, so I just quit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey wanted to play some more, but it was late and dusk had fallen so I begged off and thanked them for the games. I gave the guy 15 pesos for the use of the sets, seemed fine. They invited me to play again if I see them there, apparently they do this often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I would have felt much better if I had manage to win at least one game, but I walked away satisfied anyway. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why I was so excited at the idea - since I do Magic tournaments, playing against strangers isn\u0026rsquo;t new to me. I guess there\u0026rsquo;s something about participating in an activity I don\u0026rsquo;t do too often, and having strangers judge my plays, that made it a bit exciting. And in any case, it did make me think about playing chess online - is Yahoo chess still a thing? Lol. Well, I already have a lot of daily gaming habits, let\u0026rsquo;s see if I can fit that in sometime.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Otherwise, why worry?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you can\u0026rsquo;t get past your overhtinking, I find that it sometimes helps to think about the worst-case scenario. You\u0026rsquo;re already worrying about problematic things happening, so why not go all the way right? Often you\u0026rsquo;ll find the worst-case scenario is something survivable, and it\u0026rsquo;s so ridiculously out-of-left-field that the rest of the worries just fade away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife is too short for worrying.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "A friend was worried and jittery about an event he\u0026rsquo;d been preparing for a while now. He just wanted it to be over and things to not go wrong. I told him not to worry, that he\u0026rsquo;s already done the best preparation he could and that no matter what things will surely work out.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of anxiety, overthinking things that might go wrong, or things that might not go according to plan, and so on.",
