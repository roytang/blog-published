And that satisfaction is linked to forming satisfying memories of experiences, and not the fleeting experiences themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, it’s worth asking if we want to be happy, to experience positive feelings, or simply wish to construct narratives that seems worth telling ourselves and others, but doesn’t necessarily yield pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy own attitude towards happiness has evolved throughout the years. I think that right now my personal concept involves some mixture of joy (what he describes as fleeting happiness, enjoying the current moment), meaningful (participating in activies that make me feel sufficiently engaged or challenged), and avoidance of discomfort or boredom. The joy part may be simply things like spending time in the company of friends, reading a good book, enjoying a good movie, and so on. But those different elements live in a precarious balance. I can\u0026rsquo;t be enjoying myself all the time, it would get boring. I need to intersperse enjoyment with meaningful activities. So I imagine in the day to day equation, the answer to \u0026ldquo;what makes me happy?\u0026rdquo; depends on which element of the balance needs to be reinforced at that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aspect of avoiding discomfort or boredom is a bit more complicated than the others. I made a promise to myself some time ago that I would avoid doing things that I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do. This may seem nonsenical, I mean of course you don\u0026rsquo;t do things you don\u0026rsquo;t want to do. Except sometimes you do, maybe because of work pressure, peer pressure, or societal pressure or something else. So I wanted to avoid those kinds of things. But life isn\u0026rsquo;t that straightforward, and sometimes you do want do some things that cause you discomfort or boredom, if they satisfy some other goal. Like for example, you can sacrifice your comfort for a while if it helps you get a dream business off the ground. Or you can participate in an activity you dislike because you know it will make your family happy. And so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis post ended up a bit of a meandering ramble, maybe because the concept of happiness itself is not so simple as we want it to be. I was just inspired to think a bit more about happiness because of the article. I suspect I will be revisiting this topic at a later time, and hopefully will be better able to express my thoughts on happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe happiness isn\u0026rsquo;t a set of principles to be encoded, just simply a life to be lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It seemd larger than usual that day, so I figured I should finally take a look. And in the process I remembered what I dislike about local flea markets: 90% of the stalls are selling some form of clothes (which I have no interest in browsing - maybe if these stalls sold something my size for once!) and maybe 9.9% are selling cheap knockoff toys (which \u003cem\u003emight\u003c/em\u003e interest me if they were free or such) or cellphone accessories. And maybe, on a rare 0.1% occassion, a stall will have something I\u0026rsquo;m interested in browsing: used books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like browsing books for sale. Never mind that I already have too many books to read already. Used book sales are not very common in Metro Manila. I mean, there\u0026rsquo;s the big franchise stores in the mall like National Bookstore or Fully Booked or Powerbooks, but given that I alreayd have too many books to read and how frugal I am, I rarely buy from those stores these days (though I still do browse through them often).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsed books sales, especially of the random pop-up kind, are a different matter. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit like treasure hunting in a way, where you\u0026rsquo;re hoping toe be lucky enough to find a bargain (I suppose this is how people who like browsing for clothes feel like at these flea markets).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsed book sales aren\u0026rsquo;t very common around here, sadly. There\u0026rsquo;s Book Sale branches in the malls of course, but their selection often isn\u0026rsquo;t very good. Yes, I\u0026rsquo;m picky too! I\u0026rsquo;m usually looking for stuff like science fiction, fantasy, or comics. Or maybe an interesting autobiography or nonfiction book - probably the best purchase I ever made at a Book Sale was getting a copy of \u003cem\u003eThe Rock Says\u003c/em\u003e, The Rock\u0026rsquo;s autobiography for cheap (I still have that book around here somewhere).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere also used to be a small used book store called Chapter IX at a small commercial center near where I live. They had a very good selection, a lot of it sci-fi and fantasy. Their prices weren\u0026rsquo;t super cheap though, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t buy much from them. My copy of \u003cem\u003eDune\u003c/em\u003e came from there. Sadly it isn\u0026rsquo;t there anymore. I think they\u0026rsquo;re mostly just selling books online via Facebook now. Browsing through book pictures online doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel the same as rummaging through stacks of used books - it feels more like intentional buying rather than the browsing I enjoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s another used book store that I sometimes go to called Bookay-Ukay in Teacher\u0026rsquo;s Village. It\u0026rsquo;s okay - the selection is definitely better than Book Sale. They have some comics and sometimes video game guides too (I like those too!). I think I\u0026rsquo;ve bought at least one pocketbook from them and a couple of comics/guides. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if they\u0026rsquo;re still around - the last time I passed by there it was closed, but they seem to have weird hours so IDK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best used book sale I ever found in the Metro was this pop-up stall that I only saw at the Greenfield market near Shaw Boulevard. This was back when Geekfight was doing regular \u003ca href=\"/2013/03/scenes-from-a-quiz-night/\"\u003equiz nights\u003c/a\u003e on Fridays in that area. A number of stalls would be set up there around the Friday night entertainment. Most of the stalls would be food or clothing (as per usual) but there was always at least one stall, sometimes two, selling used books. They both had pretty good selections too, I ended up buying quite a bit from them. I remember buying a couple of Discworld books, some old-school CYOA and \u003cem\u003eHeir to the Empire\u003c/em\u003e (the first Thrawn book) from there. Geekfight stopped doing their quiz nights there after a while though, and since I no longer work in Ortigas, I never really pass anywhere near that area anymore, so I don\u0026rsquo;t know if those used book stalls are still a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI always keep an eye out for book stores, used or not, even when I\u0026rsquo;m travelling in another country. During my first night on my \u003ca href=\"/2004/05/so-i-went-to-hk/\"\u003efirst trip abroad\u003c/a\u003e, I walked a few blocks around the neighborhood where I was staying and was happy to find a small hole-in-the-wall book store just a couple of streets away. Of course, all the books were in Chinese! During \u003ca href=\"/2015/03/europe-trip-2015/\"\u003emy Europe trip\u003c/a\u003e, I remember walking along the Seine in Paris and I came along a series of pop-up stalls in some kind of mini-flea market near the river side. Quite a few of them were selling old and/or used books, many of them French, some in English, and I think there were some Asterix comics in Italian I think. I didn\u0026rsquo;t end up buying anything, but it was fun. I also remember finding quite a few used book stores in the Camden Market in London while I was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, travel tip: you can type \u0026ldquo;book stores near me\u0026rdquo; in Google Maps to see nearby book stores (or any other kind of stores I guess). I do this a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish book stores were more common around here, but I can understand why they aren\u0026rsquo;t too popular. Books often aren\u0026rsquo;t a high priority for the Filipino masses, given all the other challenges in life. I\u0026rsquo;m very lucky to have grown up with parents who not only instilled a love of reading in me, but also had the budget to buy me books all the time. Sadly, these days I don\u0026rsquo;t read too many books anymore (I blame the internet). Hopefully that\u0026rsquo;s something I can correct next year.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Basically competitive skill-intensive games that still have a significant element of random chance, so that the games while interesting, almost never play out the same way. For computer games, I really like the ones that have any sort of random/procedural generation - probably one of the reasons why I really latched onto \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/ancient-pc-gaming/\"\u003eCivilization\u003c/a\u003e and X-Com when I was young.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is also why I probably couldn\u0026rsquo;t thrive in any career that involves a lot of repetitiveness or doing the same thing day in and day out. I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine working as something like a security guard or a cashier (aside from the low pay obviously). This is why programming is great for me a career - it\u0026rsquo;s highly skill intensive and at the same time there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of variance because you\u0026rsquo;re almost never solving the same problem twice. And if you are encountering the same problems repeatedly, then you have a new problem to solve - how to stop those problems from repeating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLove of variance can be a double-edged sword though. The main problem is that it gives me difficulty in trying to do things that require consistent discipline or repeated practice - developing habits like regular exercise can be a challenge. This is why even in my \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/daily-walks/\"\u003edaily walking\u003c/a\u003e, I dislike taking the same route too often. It is a problem to be overcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

At the moment, only the cards from the \u003ca href=\"https://whatsinstandard.com/\"\u003ecurrent standard\u003c/a\u003e are currently available (sets from the previous rotation were available during the closed beta.) Granted, the MTG ruleset is a complicated beast, so they probably have a few bugs hidden away there somewhere but for the most part it is a faithful conversion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe client looks and feels great, a much more modern platform compared to the ugly rustbucket that is MTGO, they really built upon what they started with Duels. Some of the QoL improvements from both Duels and MTGO carry over (mostly Duels). Autotapping of lands and autopass of priority when you have nothing to play are enabled by default. I\u0026rsquo;m always worried that the autotapper will screw something up and leave me in a bad position, but so far that hasn\u0026rsquo;t happened. You can add stops to opponent\u0026rsquo;s upkeep, draw, first and second mains, and end step, same as MTGO. \u0026ldquo;Attack All\u0026rdquo; is available, though I wish it worked better with planeswalkers. When cards from your opponent\u0026rsquo;s hand are revealed, they stay revealed (you can hover over the opponent\u0026rsquo;s hand to zoom in) until they leave that zone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a few issues with the presentation though:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003etriggered abilities could have more options to better handle when they trigger multiple times. One of the worst offenders is \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Ajani%27s%20Pridemate\" target=\"_new\"\u003eAjani's Pridemate\u003c/a\u003e, which is in one of the better starter decks. The triggered ability requires a player confirmation every time, which can be annoying when the Pridemate triggers multiple times on complicated boards. There should be an option like \u0026ldquo;Always take this action\u0026rdquo;, similar to MTGO\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Always yield\u0026rdquo; for triggered abilities\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003etimeouts need a lot of work. The main issue is that the timers still count down while the client is animating effects and you can\u0026rsquo;t do anything. That time really shouldn\u0026rsquo;t count against you.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edamage dealt to creatures and toughness penalties are presented the same way, as lowered red toughness numbers on the creature itself, even though rules-wise they are actually different - the main difference being indestructible doesn\u0026rsquo;t prevent death due to 0 toughness or less. I\u0026rsquo;ve already seen at least one confused newbie on reddit trying to figure out how indestructibility works and being confused because of this.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"new-player-experience-and-economy\"\u003eNew Player Experience and Economy\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNPE is okay. You get a bunch of starter decks, one for each color and color pair. Same as Eternal actually. The starter decks also provide some decent cards to start out your collection, with some mythics even. Some useful cards they provide include \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=History%20of%20Benalia\" target=\"_new\"\u003eHistory of Benalia\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Rekindling%20Phoenix\" target=\"_new\"\u003eRekindling Phoenix\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Settle%20the%20Wreckage\" target=\"_new\"\u003eSettle the Wreckage\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Vraska%27s%20Contempt\" target=\"_new\"\u003eVraska's Contempt\u003c/a\u003e IDK what they\u0026rsquo;re going to do when there\u0026rsquo;s a rotation and the starter decks don\u0026rsquo;t work anymore. Well actually, I guess I don\u0026rsquo;t know what they plan to do for rotation at all, so we\u0026rsquo;ll just see what happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSame as Hearthstone and Eternal, there\u0026rsquo;s daily quests to help you earn gold, and you can win gems from some events, so there\u0026rsquo;s that. You also get a free pack every five wins, with a cap of three such packs per week. I haven\u0026rsquo;t done the math but I\u0026rsquo;d say the rewards system is slightly more generous than Hearthstone, but way less generous than Eternal. You also get some rewards for each win for the day, but this drops off quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weird thing is they didn\u0026rsquo;t go with a \u0026ldquo;dusting\u0026rdquo; system for extra cards, which is how other CCGs usually do it. Crafting is instead done using rarity-specific \u0026ldquo;wildcards\u0026rdquo; which you can open from booster packs. This leads to the so-called \u0026ldquo;fifth card problem\u0026rdquo;, where whenever you open the fifth copy of a card from a booster pack, it literally has no use for you. They have scheduled a \u0026ldquo;duplicate protection\u0026rdquo; update to fix this sometime around 1Q2019, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if that\u0026rsquo;ll work out. I hope they also think about some mechanism for \u0026ldquo;cashing out\u0026rdquo; your rotating cards since they need to implement rotations less than a year from now, but I\u0026rsquo;m even less hopeful about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"limited-play\"\u003eLimited Play\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s draft and sealed options available, with formats (the sets being opened) rotating every two weeks. When I started out I played mostly drafts (as soon as I had the gold, I would draft), since I didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough of a collection yet to make a decent constructed deck. The draft experience isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly the same as paper though. For one thing, you\u0026rsquo;re drafting against bots, not actual humans. Eternal is able to make draft work vs actual humans, so Arena should be able to do it too. IDK how Eternal does it actually, one would presume the first few people to draft a format won\u0026rsquo;t have other draft pools yet to be passed to them. Regardless, Arena should be passing you packs from real humans whenever possible and bots only when no such packs are available. Still, the draft experience is passable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"constructed-play\"\u003eConstructed Play\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a ranked ladder which you can play for free, both Best of 1 (BO1) and Best of 3 (BO3) options are available. You can also play in Constructed Events, which have an entry fee and offer more prizes, and there\u0026rsquo;s also BO1 and BO3 options there. They also often have \u0026ldquo;fun\u0026rdquo; events in different formats like Singleton or some strange format with custom rules. Kind of like Hearthstone\u0026rsquo;s Tavern Brawl I guess?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe limiter for constructed play is your available wildcards. Getting rare wildcards is reasonable enough - you are guaranteed to get one every six packs you open. Mythics are another matter, you are only guaranteed to get one every thirty-six packs. So for a F2P player (that\u0026rsquo;s me!) you will be likely constrained to decks with lower mythic counts, at least early on. For now, I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing \u003ca href=\"https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/standard-mono-blue-tempo-60563#paper\"\u003eMonoblue Tempo\u003c/a\u003e, a tier 2 deck (really has trouble against a resolved ) that has no mythics and has decent play value. I do love me some aggro control, so this is a fine choice for me for now. I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing it in BO3 Competitive Constructed Events (recently renamed to \u0026ldquo;Traditional Constructed\u0026rdquo;), and have a decent enough winrate that it has always made me profit. Standard is in a pretty good place right now actually - there\u0026rsquo;s a ton of viable decks and quite a few other decks that are relatively easy to put together, like monored or Izzet Drakes, so it\u0026rsquo;s a good time to be playing standard in Arena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s great to have an option for BO3 play. The complexity of competitive Magic shines through in BO3 play, although it takes much longer to play them out. Actually, Magic games in general, even BO1, take longer to play than Eternal (which is weird because Eternal has higher deck size and starting life), which means grinding out wins as a F2P player would be more exhausting. There was a recent outcry when they announced a tweak to constructed rewards that would have made BO3 events much less appealing, basically giving them the same rewards structure as BO1 events, which is ridiclous since BO3 games take so much more time. They walked back on that change though, but haven\u0026rsquo;t announced a replacement yet, let\u0026rsquo;s see if they do better next time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#a86f4560dd1d80de1943c6531f477cb6-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/mtg-arena/mtgarena2_hu0db1b18d28ba084f8cda5ee757be0f34_4028631_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"a86f4560dd1d80de1943c6531f477cb6-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/mtg-arena/mtgarena2.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"18 Dec 2018 1:56am\"\u003e18 Dec 2018 1:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI also have this not-so-competitive BG midrange deck that I was building towards before I netdecked the MonoBlue one. I had already spent a few mythic wildcards towards it, kind of a bad choice really, because the ranked ladder does this weird matchmaking thing where you\u0026rsquo;re more likely to fight against decks that have similar rare/mythic counts. So what usually happens is my unoptimized BG monstrosity gets roflstomped by tuned netdecks and such. After discovering this, I now mostly only play either the starter decks on ranked (to fulfill my daily quests) or Competitive Constructed with the Monoblue (in order to build up gold/cards). I still occasionally do break out the BG deck for fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrote most of the above paragraphs in a draft a week or two ago, and they just recently released a new patch that overhauled the rank system and matchmaking. I haven\u0026rsquo;t explored it too much yet, I hope it\u0026rsquo;s better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"f2p-esports-and-competitive-play\"\u003eF2P, ESports, and Competitive Play\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWizards announced recently that \u003ca href=\"https://magic.wizards.com/en/competitive-magic\"\u003eArena will join the Pro Tour as part of their competitive play offerings and there will be a combined $10M prize pool for both paper Magic and Arena in 2019\u003c/a\u003e. This is exciting for me because it offers a more convenient avenue for competitive play. I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest, I\u0026rsquo;m a bit older now and I\u0026rsquo;m not too fond of playing in big paper MTG tournaments anymore. You have to travel somewhere, and it\u0026rsquo;s often hot and crowded and I have to shufffle with my sweat hands and you have to make sure your opponent\u0026rsquo;s not cheating and so on. But if I\u0026rsquo;m playing from the comfort of my home computer, well that\u0026rsquo;s a lot better for me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was initially planning to play Arena same way I play other online CCGs - grinding it out as a F2P player. But I might be willing to change that depending on how the competitive landscape looks moving forward. It will probably be cheaper for me in the long run anyway - both paper Magic and MTGO are expensive options. So I\u0026rsquo;m hoping WOTC doesn\u0026rsquo;t screw this up and provides a decent tournament experience for Arena. It\u0026rsquo;s especially timely as there\u0026rsquo;s no convenient Grand Prixs near me next year so I was planning to kind of lay low with paper Magic anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"summary\"\u003eSummary\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMTG Arena is still in open beta, and I assume the formal release will be around late 2019, when the next rotation comes in. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably make a follow-up post at that time. I\u0026rsquo;m optimistic and hoping for the best and hopefully all the issues will be ironed out. Arena has the potential to trounce the online CCG scene, especially since Valve\u0026rsquo;s Artifact hasn\u0026rsquo;t been able to live up to its hype (though I might still try it). All Wizards has to do is to not screw things up!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing MTG Arena for a good while now, a little bit during the closed beta, and now I think we\u0026rsquo;re still in open beta (?) because things still keep changing around. But I figured I could put in a little commentary about how this thing is going so far. I\u0026rsquo;m coming off the POV of a long-time Magic the Gathering player of course, with a little bit of comparison to Eternal and Hearthstone, the two digital CCGs I\u0026rsquo;m most familiar with.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI read this article about how \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/04/why-bill-gates-gave-up-music-and-tv-for-5-years-in-his-20s.html\"\u003eBill Gates spent 5 years not watching TV or listening to music\u003c/a\u003e in his twenties while building Microsoft. Now, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I watch \u003cem\u003ea lot\u003c/em\u003e of TV, unapologetically.  Quite possible too much. But I can\u0026rsquo;t help but wonder if maybe I would be more productive if I had the same kind of discipline Bill Gates had, and maybe that would increase the odds that I could focus and create something of consequence?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, the idea of cutting off TV completely feels completely ludicrous to me. It\u0026rsquo;s simply something I enjoy too much. Just this past week I was gushing over the Arrowverse Elseworlds crossover which gave me real fanboy delight. But I thought maybe I could review my current regular TV slate and see if I can\u0026rsquo;t trim it a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDC Comics TV: There\u0026rsquo;s from the aforementioned Arrowverse shows (\u003cem\u003eArrow\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eFlash\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eSupergirl\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eLegends of Tomorrow\u003c/em\u003e). I feel like Arrow should have ended a season or 2 ago, but I still mostly enjoy Flash, Supergirl and Legends. There\u0026rsquo;s also \u003cem\u003eGotham\u003c/em\u003e, which is ending with its next season, and I kinda wanna see how it ends. Aside from those, I also want to watch \u003cem\u003eTitans\u003c/em\u003e (DC Universe) and \u003cem\u003eKrypton\u003c/em\u003e (Syfy); not sure if I should bother with \u003cem\u003eBlack Lightning\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarvel Comics TV: The Marvel TV shows don\u0026rsquo;t have as much of a \u0026ldquo;shared universe\u0026rdquo; feel unlike the Arrowverse. There\u0026rsquo;s the Netflix group of shows of course (\u003cem\u003eDaredevil\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eJessica Jones\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eLuke Cage\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eIron Fist\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003ePunisher\u003c/em\u003e), but it looks like we\u0026rsquo;re only getting at most one more season each of Jessica Jones and Punisher, and the rest are already cancelled. \u003cem\u003eAgents of SHIELD\u003c/em\u003e has been great and is up for at least one more season. I\u0026rsquo;m also supposedly watching \u003cem\u003eThe Gifted\u003c/em\u003e but I\u0026rsquo;m way behind on season 2. Also looking forward to the next season of \u003cem\u003eRunaways\u003c/em\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;ve had \u003cem\u003eLegion\u003c/em\u003e on my to-watch list for a while as well, but haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten around to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther: \u003cem\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/em\u003e, but I\u0026rsquo;m behind for the current season, and this has so few episodes per year, it probably shouldn\u0026rsquo;t count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProcedurals: I used to watch a few more of these that have since ended (\u003cem\u003eBones\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eCastle\u003c/em\u003e). The only one I still follow now is \u003cem\u003eCriminal Minds\u003c/em\u003e, and I\u0026rsquo;ve watched almost all of that, so I know the characters well. It might be a fine candidate to drop though. One can only take so much serial murdering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComedies: There\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003eBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u003c/em\u003e, which is some of the best comedy right now on TV. I still watch \u003cem\u003eThe Good Place\u003c/em\u003e, which despite all the praise it gets, I\u0026rsquo;m not superfond of it the way I was with \u003cem\u003eParks and Rec\u003c/em\u003e. I also still watch \u003cem\u003eThe Big Bang Theory\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eModern Family\u003c/em\u003e - those shows aren\u0026rsquo;t the best or super laugh out loud, but they\u0026rsquo;re sometimes interesting. The last two might be worth cutting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnimated: Really only \u003cem\u003eThe Simpsons\u003c/em\u003e (out of loyalty) and \u003cem\u003eRick and Morty\u003c/em\u003e (when it decides to come back).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s not counting the shows on Netflix I randomly decide to pick and binge (recently: The Ranch, Better Call Saul, Adventure Time)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can see, the comics-based shows form a significant majority of my shows. Just counting those that have full season lengths, it\u0026rsquo;s at least 10 hours a week on TV watching, a nontrivial amount of time. One method I\u0026rsquo;ve been using to better make the most of TV time is what I call \u0026ldquo;side-watching\u0026rdquo;, i.e. having the TV show playing on a secondary screen while I\u0026rsquo;m doing other stuff on a primary screen, like working or playing games. It\u0026rsquo;s a more efficient use of time, but I can\u0026rsquo;t focus as much on the show, so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work on all shows. Usually the lighter shows (comedies and animated) are good for these. THe more serious shows I can still \u0026ldquo;side-watch\u0026rdquo;, unless it\u0026rsquo;s an important episode or something where I want to focus on the show (like the aforementioned Elseworlds crossover). This is the same reason I\u0026rsquo;ve mostly stopped watching anime - it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to side-watch since most of it is subbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually now that I\u0026rsquo;ve listed them all out, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem so bad. Anecdotally, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/business/media/nielsen-survey-media-viewing.html\"\u003eAmericans watch around five hours of TV a day on average\u003c/a\u003e (35 hours per week), so my 10-15 hours per week doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem so bad by comparison, especially since I\u0026rsquo;m often doing other stuff at the same time. And half the year those shows are off anyway (IDK what happens to American TV during the off season). Still a ways off from Bill Gates though. Maybe I should make a note to try to be more focused/productive during the off season?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHm. If I really want to make the most of my time, I might need to do more detailed time-tracking since there\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of other leisure activities I also do (gaming, reading, movies, internet browsing), but that seems like a hassle, and it\u0026rsquo;s probably unnecessary. For now, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

While I hold out a tiny bit of hope that maybe somehow human society and/or science will find a way to save us, he was not so optimistic. He reads and writes a lot of speculative fiction and his view is that we are inevitably headed towards an era of land scarcity and resulting wars due to climate changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan you imagine, some thousands of years down the line, some spacefaring alien race chances upon the remains of our sorry civilization and discover all this discussion of our civilization\u0026rsquo;s impending collapse and they\u0026rsquo;re trying to figure out why our civilization fell apart in spite of having sufficient foreknowledge of the upcoming disaster, and they\u0026rsquo;re incredulous that we simply couldn\u0026rsquo;t be bothered because it was too inconvenient!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould humanity still be able to find a way out of this corner we\u0026rsquo;ve painted our way into? Recent signs are not encouraging. We know there is upcoming disaster and yet any adjustment on our part must come at great economic or political costs that we are unable to pay. Climate change is a far-away risk for most people who struggle with everyday problems. Consider the case of Macron\u0026rsquo;s France, which was recently \u003ca href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/05/europe/france-yellow-vest-protests-intl/index.html\"\u003eforced by protests to withdraw a fuel tax\u003c/a\u003e that was intended to reduce the country\u0026rsquo;s climate impact. \u003ca href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/trump-attacks-paris-climate-agreement-cites-france-protests-11014022\"\u003eTrump uses this event to justify the US withdrawal from the Paris climate treaty\u003c/a\u003e. The US clings to its climate-destroying industries like coal in a bid to save jobs. Companies refuse to be regulated because it would be too expensive. And so it goes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis inability to come together and bypass individual interests and work towards a common good may very well be what is called \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter\"\u003ethe great filter\u003c/a\u003e, and it is in front of us, leading to a high probability of self-destruction. Inequality, itself a result of unbridled individualism, makes it much harder for us to come together as well. Capitalism, in spite of its propensity for ruthless efficiency, is not very good at managing a communal property like our planet (or the internet, etc). By endearing ourself to capitalism during the 20th century, we may have chosen a path of doom for our civilization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll this actually made me rethink authoritarianism. Our cultural embrace of freedoms make it difficult to force people to swallow bitter pills needed for our civilization to survive. What if the path to sustainable collective survival lies in the private sector made ruthlessly efficient by capitalism, yet tempered by an authoritarian state that manages the common good? What if China was right all along? They are certainly more committed to battling climate change at the moment, compared to the US.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t advocate any shift towards authoritarianism or fascism of course, but it might be time to consider surrendering some of our individual freedoms and ambitions for the greater good. Inequality needs to be addressed too, some level of socialism might be necessary, such that the burden may be shouldered more by the elites who have taken most of the benefits from the planet anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonally, I think I already have a very low carbon footprint, compared to the average middle class person. I try not to travel too much (even within the city), and I don\u0026rsquo;t drive a car. But the weight of these decisions isn\u0026rsquo;t on us ordinary citizens, especially the developing world. There is very little we can do individually. The onus is on the leadership especially of the more advanced nations, to take the bold steps necessary to reduce inequality and emissions, and on the elite, to participate in the redistribution of wealth and to make sacrifices for the greater good. For the rest of us, all we can do is raise our voices in protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sound like I\u0026rsquo;m calling for some kind of revolution, but I\u0026rsquo;m merely thinking out loud. I\u0026rsquo;m worried for what is to come. For my generation, things will probably be fine. But if nothing is done, the next 2 or 3 generations might be looking at living vastly more difficult lives. I realize this post seems really pessimistic (same for the prior one), which seems a bit off-brand for me. Maybe if we\u0026rsquo;re lucky, I\u0026rsquo;m totally wrong and within the next 5-10 years some kind of solution emerges, and I\u0026rsquo;ll look back at this post and laugh at how silly I was to be worried, but given the nature of humans and society it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to be optimistic.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
