Some would say a bad habit, especially when among company. These days my morning newspaper consists mostly of Flipboard articles, then the local newspaper during lunch and dinner if I am at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from mealtime readings, I also regularly take breaks to check what is going on in social media and my RSS reader. I am, to invent a word, hyperinformed. As soon as something happens, I like to know about it. A bus exploded on EDSA the other day and I told my parents about it before it came up on local news TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis may be a bit of information overflow. And some even say that for the sake of our own mental health, we should avoid consuming the news too regularly. Especially these days, when the news is full of negativity: natural disasters, politicians being stupid or corrupt, crimes and atrocities, invasions of privacy, hatred, racism, war, poverty, and so on. The world can be dark, and news tends to highlight the negative, and consuming it too regularly may begin to affect our worldview.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a desire to stay informed of course, I still consider that a duty as a responsible citizen. To know what issues are being faced by people in our country and in the world, so that we may help craft the decisions to solve those issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut perhaps regular consumption is not so necessary. It might be a good idea to shift to some kind of weekly or monthly schedule of news consumption, instead of daily. The problem would be finding sources that can sum up the past week or month\u0026rsquo;s news, distill it into those things important to know. This might be challenging, especially for local news. But maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll start looking around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then what would I read during breakfast?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

As this \u003ca href=\"https://mabeloni-sandwich.tumblr.com/post/183645870983/the-biggest-problem-with-every-single-bad-review\"\u003etumblr post explains\u003c/a\u003e more clearly than I ever could, perhaps the issue is that the narrative is not something targetted towards me as a man, who has not experienced the emotional gaslighting IRL that many women are exposed to. It\u0026rsquo;s an interesting way to frame the narrative, and probably explains why some movies (i.e. chick flicks) really don\u0026rsquo;t appeal to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did enjoy most everything else about the movie, especially most of the comic book tie-ins and links to other MCU movies. I appreciated how they re-told the \u0026ldquo;Carol getting her powers from an explosion\u0026rdquo; and Mar-vell still being there. I appreciate the surprise that Annette Benning was Mar-Vell all along. I appreciate their reimagination of the Kree Supreme Intelligence. I appreciate that by the time Avengers Endgame or any potential Captain Marvel 2 rolls around, Monica Rambeau will be old enough to be her own superhero as well. I appreciate all the little things connecting this movie to the first Iron Man, the first Avengers, and even to Infinity War itself. I also appreciated that their depiction of the Kree did not rule out the Agents of SHIELD versions existing! (That being said, I would have appreciated an explanation for why some Kree are blue and some are not!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cp /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot much else to report. The Arrowverse is limping along. Recent episodes of \u003cstrong\u003eSupergirl\u003c/strong\u003e have been great, I loved Jon Cryer as Lex Luthor, and I love how they\u0026rsquo;ve been able to adapt multiple comic book storylines this season such as \u003cem\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s So Funny About Truth, Justice, \u0026amp; the American Way?\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eAmerican Alien\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eRed Son\u003c/em\u003e. (Excuse me, red daughter.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn more sci-fi land, \u003cstrong\u003eThe Orville\u003c/strong\u003e has been fantastic, with their surprise twist to the Isaac storyline culminating in one of the best space battles portrayed on TV. \u003cstrong\u003eStar Trek Discovery\u003c/strong\u003e is not as good, but I still like it, as it feels a lot more classic Trek than S1 and the overarching S2 plot is more interesting to me too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext month is looking packed. The big headliners to look forward to are of course \u003cstrong\u003eAvengers Endgame\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eShazam\u003c/strong\u003e, and the final season of \u003cstrong\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

For every person, there likely exists a \u0026ldquo;tribe\u0026rdquo;, not necessarily all in one place, a community where that person would fit in. And in the modern age, the internet and social media make it all the more easier for such \u0026ldquo;outsiders\u0026rdquo; to connect with each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a power to this connection, to finding your tribe. It gives you strength and reinforces your beliefs and reassures you that you aren\u0026rsquo;t some strange outlier undeserving of connection. This is why nerd culture has become so popular lately. Traditionally seen as outcasts in the 90s and earlier, now more than ever it has become acceptable to have geeky interests like comic books, Star Wars, tech stuff, and so on. As the early adopters of the online community, nerd culture found its footing earlier than other subcultures, and they found that yes, there are a lot of us, and now the big businesses are starting to listen, seeing the \u0026ldquo;nerds\u0026rdquo; as a massive market to be served.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis connectivity has some downsides too though, since it does not discriminate. This means that even followers of fringe views such as white supremacists, flat earthers, antivaxxers, conspiracy theorists, and so on can connect to each other. If you can find your tribe, they can too. The more fringe the view, the more the worldwide connectivity can empower them. Whereas before a small community might have at most 1 antivaxxer, he would have no source of materials to support his fringe view thus finding it difficult to spread his views. But multiply that with tens of thousands of such communities connected globally online, and you have potentially tens of thousands of antivaxxers. With the internet allowing antivaxxers to reach out to each other and form Facebook groups and discussion forums and such, they can spread the word more easily reinforce their own suspicions about mainstream channels and try to convince other people to join their cause. This can apply to any fringe group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust take a look at the recent Christchurch massacre in New Zealand. The gunman livestreamed and uploaded a video manifesto online and the social media channels had a lot of trouble trying to block the spread of the video. Tens of thousands were re-sharing it, some even modifying the video to evade filters. Supportes in such violence might be rare in your local community, but online they are able to gather in the thousands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt feels like a fundamental weakness in freedom of speech. The traditional argument in favor of allowing all speech is that the best ideas rise to the top and the terrible ones are drowned out, that such fringe views would fall to the wayside in the light of superior arguments. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t take into account people being stupid and succumbing to their confirmation biases and ignoring anything that doesn\u0026rsquo;t support their world views. And as we can see with terrorism, fringe views don\u0026rsquo;t require widespread support in order to damage real lives. This feels like one of those instances, where we have to sacrifice a little bit of freedom for a little bit of security (and probably lose both).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t like it. Hopefully it\u0026rsquo;s something humanity will be able to figure out sometime soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I did a quick PoC in Python/Flask, with \u003ca href=\"http://www.tweepy.org/\"\u003eTweepy\u003c/a\u003e for accessing the Twitter API. I normally prefer Django for my webapps, but since this was just a small, quick app, I figured Flask would be ideal. That worked out fine, except that I had to use my personal access tokens to for all the API calls. This means that if many people were using the app, it was likely to hit Twitter\u0026rsquo;s rate limits!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a few months back. A couple of days ago, someone emailed me asking about an error he encountered using the app, and sure enough it was due to the rate limits. I had a couple of free hours last weekend, so I figured I\u0026rsquo;d update the app a bit. I decided to add a Twitter login requirement, that way we can use the individual user\u0026rsquo;s access token instead of using mine globally. This would allow the rate limits to be per user and thus less likely to be hit. Now, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried implementing OAuth login some years ago and it can be terribly complicated, but luckily I found out that there\u0026rsquo;s a nifty Python package called \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/singingwolfboy/flask-dance\"\u003eFlask-Dance\u003c/a\u003e that made it super easy to add Twitter OAuth to a Flask app. This also let me discard the Tweepy dependency, since the Twitter OAuth session let me query the API endpoints directly. I also did a bit of UI cleanup and error handling and deployed the changes quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe app is available online at \u003ca href=\"/apps/twitter\"\u003eroytang.net/apps/twitter\u003c/a\u003e. There\u0026rsquo;s a few other Twitter tools I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to build, so I\u0026rsquo;ll probably put them here too when I get around to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThe concept of a \u0026ldquo;meritocracy\u0026rdquo; has come to the fore again with the \u003ca href=\"http://time.com/5549921/college-admissions-bribery-scandal/\"\u003erecent college admissions scandal\u003c/a\u003e in the US, where wealthy parents bribed coaches and other professionals to get their kids into high-end universities with supposedly high standards. It\u0026rsquo;s put a lie to the idea that the students of these universities represent the \u0026ldquo;cream of the crop\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the best of the best\u0026rdquo;, showing that kids can get in not only due to their own talent, but also due to money. Of course, it was always open knowledge before that one could get their kid admitted to such universities simply by making a huge donation. The recent events apparently crosses some line because the \u0026ldquo;donation\u0026rdquo; was in the form of bribe money to individuals instead of the school itself, but even without them there was no true meritocracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to a specialized high school (and college) that had supposedly merit-based entrance exams as well, such that one could simply not get in without passing the exams. (Athletics-based admissions aren\u0026rsquo;t very popular in this country.) Even in such a system, rich kids still have a significant leg up of course - aside from growing up in an environment that favored them, their parents could also afford to send them to expensive review centers to prep for the exams. I was reminded of this due to a recent thread among my HS batchmates discussing how their kids had to prep for the entrance exams years early because it was much more competitive these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to be a strong believer in meritocracy when I was young (probably due to my educational background), believing it to be an ideal for society to aspire to. The idea is certainly attractive - that we should give the jobs and positions to those who would be able to use them most effectively, for the betterment of society. I later learned that the term orignated in 1958 as a condemnatory word by Michael Young in his work \u0026ldquo;The Rise of the Meritocracy\u0026rdquo;. I realize now that while a pure meritocracy would be nice, it would disadvantage people who are already behind in life due to poverty, sickness or other such challenges. I think that like many things, some sort of balance is better struck, with a \u0026ldquo;meritocracy at large\u0026rdquo; in effect for the most part, but with opportunities promoted for marginalized groups. That is, a meritocracy that favors the poor instead of the rich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll this meritocract quote reminds me of a quote from the Simpsons\u0026rsquo; villainous Mr Burns who tries to justify cheating in a contest during a company retreat, which gives us a different perspective:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Burns: Tell me, Simpson, if an opportunity arose for taking a small short-cut, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be averse to taking it, would you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHomer: Hmm, not as such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Burns: Neither would I. If you can take advantage of a situation in some way, it\u0026rsquo;s your duty as an American to do it. Why should the race always be to the swift, or the Jumble to the quick-witted? Should they be allowed to win merely because of the gifts God gave them? Well I say, \u0026ldquo;Cheating is the gift man gives himself.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHomer: Mr. Burns, I insist that we cheat!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Burns: Excellent!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n",

It didn\u0026rsquo;t help that it\u0026rsquo;s been 4-5 years since I played VLR, and that game already had an overly complex plot so I can barely remember the details from that game as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile it\u0026rsquo;s a story-based series, the gameplay largely consists of two parts: (a) escape rooms; and (b) decision-making. The escape rooms part are entertaining enough, nothing too difficult, but satisfying enough to solve everything. The decision-making part is used to unlock branching timelines, and the path to the \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; endings is determined by your ability to find the correct decisions to unlock the correct events. Not all decisions are binary or multiple-choice; some of the more important ones require text or numeric input, making it impossible to guess them. At multiple points, you will need to reference information learned from other branches of history (don\u0026rsquo;t worry, there is a story reason for why this happens).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTook me a couple of weeks of playing sporadically to finish the game. I enjoyed the game enough to spend a couple of late nights to finish it once I got really going. I will shamefully admit I did get stuck in one place and in my impatience I googled my way past it. Still, a platinum is a platinum:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#464ea2382226fa4e0d255676200af297-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2019/03/zero-time-dilemma/ztd-platinum_hud697a1a6556e2713bcac2e1fabb23b1f_93213_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"464ea2382226fa4e0d255676200af297-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2019/03/zero-time-dilemma/ztd-platinum.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"20 Mar 2019 5:56am\"\u003e20 Mar 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, given how old the first game is, it\u0026rsquo;s unlikely I\u0026rsquo;m going to get to complete the trilogy.
