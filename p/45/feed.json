I prefer incremental life improvements as NYRs, similar in scale to the above. Also consider: Instead of one resolution for the entire year, try 12 30-day challenges instead. The smaller scale makes the goal less daunting and a bit more achievable. Sticking to something for 30 days is way easier than a whole year.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Learning a new language not only helps when you\u0026rsquo;re travelling, but it unlocks different ways of forming thoughts in your brain, helping cognitive development (I may have made up that last part with absolutely no basis except my own speculation.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first language I tried to study using Duolingo was Spanish, mainly because back then we had an \u003ca href=\"/2015/04/europe-2015-barcelona-part-1/\"\u003eupcoming trip to Europe (including Barcelona)\u003c/a\u003e planned in 2015 so the Spanish would have helped. The Philippines also has a lot of history with the Spanish, so there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of words I could pick up easily. I figured there\u0026rsquo;s no reason to make things too difficult right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t finish the course before our trip, there was far too much content! At some point during the following year (2016), I did manage to complete all of the available Spanish courses though, so yay! The most challenging part was understanding the use of reflexive pronouns like \u003ccode\u003ete\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003eme\u003c/code\u003e, since using them changed the structure of sentences. I also had to adjust to male/female words, and the vast number of verb tenses. But otherwise, Spanish wasn\u0026rsquo;t too tough. At some point, Duolingo claimed that I was \u0026ldquo;50% fluent\u0026rdquo; in Spanish, but that seems ridiculous lol. This statistic no longer appears after a recent revamp, so they probably realised that too. I don\u0026rsquo;t consider myself anywhere near fluent, but I know enough Spanish to recognize a few words here and there when watching the Spanish scenes in \u003cem\u003eBetter Call Saul\u003c/em\u003e, so that\u0026rsquo;s a thing. Listening to spoken Spanish is much tougher than reading words off a screen. I suppose if I want to further my mastery of the language, I would need to listen to more Spanish convos or read more Spanish prose or such, but for now I\u0026rsquo;m happy with continuing the Duolingo lessons. They have since revamped the course and introduced more exercises, so there\u0026rsquo;s still quite a bit to learn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometime in 2017, I also decided to add a second language to my daily Duolingo exercises. Hard mode this time, I chose Japanese. The main reason being I\u0026rsquo;m a bit of a weeb lol. Japanese is a lot more challenging than Spanish because in addition to learning a whole new vocabulary and sentence structure, I have to learn new characters as well! I actually gave studying hiragana/katakana a go back in high school, when a friend and I tried learning Japanese to decipher some Japanese RPGs (maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll write about that someday). Whatever I learned there has largely faded though, but I did retain some minimum vocabulary from all those years of exposure to anime. It\u0026rsquo;s still very challenging - even up to now I\u0026rsquo;m still in the introductory sections learning hiragana and simple sentences, I find myself having to repeat lessons and exercises often and even up to now I\u0026rsquo;m still not super familiar with many of the hiragana characters. I should probably be doing some writing exercises as well (which Duolingo doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide) - the mechanical act of drawing the characters should help with recall - but I\u0026rsquo;ve been too lazy to get into that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuolingo is free to use. That of course means there\u0026rsquo;s stuff like ads and in-app purchases, which might annoy you if you dislike that kind of thing. I dislike them too, but I can kind of tolerate them I guess. The in-app purchases don\u0026rsquo;t really have any effect on what I want to be doing with the app anyway. Completing the lessons also earns you some in-game currency which you can use to unlock some extra lessons/exercises. I\u0026rsquo;ve never had to use them though, so I still have a ton of the in-app currency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuolingo has that nice feature where it tracks when you\u0026rsquo;re doing the exercises on a regular daily basis and tracks your \u0026ldquo;streak\u0026rdquo;, which is psychologically very effective on me. I often hold the streaks for months and then I accidentally break the streak for some silly reason like being too busy with work, then I\u0026rsquo;m sad and annoyed and I leave Duolingo alone for a couple of weeks so I can move on. Then I start over. I\u0026rsquo;m currently at an 86-day streak again. Duolingo is a rare example of a new thing I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to stick with for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne weird thing about Duolingo is that although it offers lessons/exercises on different platforms - web, mobile, tablet - the method of delivery is not consistent across all platforms. Web is more limited obviously, since they often won\u0026rsquo;t have access to a microphone. But I don\u0026rsquo;t understand why their mobile and tablet (IPad) versions aren\u0026rsquo;t consistent. The main inconsistency is the way they track in-app \u0026ldquo;experience\u0026rdquo;. The mobile version gives a \u0026ldquo;streak bonus\u0026rdquo; for maintaining a streak, while the IPad and web versions do not, so you can earn more experience when using the mobile version. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter to me - my daily targets are set such that I always need to do two sets per day (one Spanish and one Japanese), but I find it mildly annoying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all Duolingo provides a positive experience, and I\u0026rsquo;ll probably be using it for yearrs to come. I don\u0026rsquo;t really have any specific goals for why I\u0026rsquo;m learning Spanish and Japanese, both just seem like really good languages to know, or at least be able to partially understand. Who knows, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll even try to add a third language some day lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I was actually two seasons behind. This series is great, and I really enjoy Bob Odenkirk\u0026rsquo;s portrayal, but it might be just a bit overhyped for me. We already know where Jimmy/Saul, Mike, the Salamancas, and Gus Fring end up given \u003cem\u003eBreaking Bad\u003c/em\u003e, so that kind of takes away a bit of tension. Still, it\u0026rsquo;s a fine TV show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also got caught up with \u003cstrong\u003eThe Ranch\u003c/strong\u003e, which is a weird show for me to watch given how hillbilly it is, but I find the perspective strangely refreshing. Also, Elisha Cuthbert really helps. I was surprised that they had killed off Danny Masterson\u0026rsquo;s character (oops spoilers), apparently it was a #MeToo thing or such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInto the Spider-Verse\u003c/strong\u003e was great, especially for a fan of the comics.

I had low expectations, but the movie was a surprisingly fun spectacle.

To the tune of \u0026ldquo;Oh, did you know \u003ccode\u003eCharacter\u003c/code\u003e is actually \u003ccode\u003eVillain\u003c/code\u003e?!?\u0026rdquo;. Still, the movie was nice, exceeded my expectations. It expanded the Incredibles\u0026rsquo; superhero universe and there was even some surprise Bob Odenkirk!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also watched \u003cstrong\u003eSolo: A Star Wars Story\u003c/strong\u003e on Christmas eve (since we didn\u0026rsquo;t get a Christmas Star Wars film this year). We didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to finish it before we went to mass though, so I finished the movie myself a couple of days later. I had skipped watching this in the theater given the mediocre ratings, but now that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it, that\u0026rsquo;s a decision I\u0026rsquo;ve come to regret. It\u0026rsquo;s a reasonable movie with a servicable plot, especially given it\u0026rsquo;s basically meant to expound upon a couple of throwaway lines from the original trilogy. The plot even leaves some dangling threads that could have picked up in succeeding movies, had Disney not decided to scrap (at least for now) the Star Wars spinoff movies. The movie compares unfavorably to \u003cem\u003eRogue One\u003c/em\u003e, which had the far superior heist scheme. In both movies we expected many of the introduced characters to be killed off, but the Rogue One deaths were much better than the Solo ones. Still, it\u0026rsquo;s an okay addition to the Star Wars universe. I read that it also has some tie-ins to the various animated series, which I\u0026rsquo;m not too familiar with. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll get into those someday.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Thankfully, I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to hold myself back so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo help suppress such urges, I\u0026rsquo;ve also recently resumed private journalling, a practice I haven\u0026rsquo;t revisited for quite a while. Basically just a document where I can dump my own thoughts about things that are probably inappropriate for public consumption. So I get the benefits of writing my thoughts down without any possible privacy issues. So far the need for private journal entries has been few and far between. Between the blog and the private journal, it should be a lot easier for me to take a look back at what I was thinking at any given point in time, should the need arise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last time I did the private journalling thing was with a service called \u003ca href=\"https://750words.com/\"\u003e750 words\u003c/a\u003e, which was pretty good. It inspired me into a daily writing habit for a bit more than a year. I should probably go through those sometime and see if I can\u0026rsquo;t mine them for blog posts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for this blog and the daily posting thing, I have to admit the past week or so has been challenging. The week of Christmas is usually busy as there\u0026rsquo;s last minute gift buying and family visitors and holiday meetups and such so I don\u0026rsquo;t always have the time and/or energy to write posts. I thought about breaking the \u0026ldquo;daily posting\u0026rdquo; rule a few times, but somehow managed to keep it going. The problem with requiring myself to post every day is that it violates \u003ca href=\"/2018/10/you-dont-have-to-be-on-all-the-time/\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t have to be on all the time\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e. While writing this post, I considered loosening the commitment for the New Year, something like \u0026ldquo;post every day, unless you really don\u0026rsquo;t have time or energy\u0026rdquo;, but that\u0026rsquo;s pretty much how habits are broken. I do still find the practice fruitful, so I will continue it for the time being, as much as I can.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are some games I\u0026rsquo;ve purchased off Steam sales that seemed like a good idea at the time but still haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten around to after years and years. Ever since Steam introduced (cheaper) regional pricing, it\u0026rsquo;s been a lot harder to resist the sales\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHumble Bundles. I really enjoyed humble bundles when they first came out, they had some great indie games like Bastion and Braid. Recently their bundles have dipped a bit in quality, and there\u0026rsquo;s been a bunch of repeats, but I still get a bundle every now and then. Reviewing my previous bundle purchases just now, I\u0026rsquo;ve had some steam keys that I haven\u0026rsquo;t activated since 2010!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also decided to try subscribing to Humble Monthly some time this year, mostly to get Tales of Berseria (which unsurprisingly I haven\u0026rsquo;t played it yet). Getting a bundle of 6-8 games every month is a quick way to accumuate a backlog. I unsubbed after a couple of months because the quality of succeeding bundles wasn\u0026rsquo;t that high\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe major digital stores (Steam, GOG, Humble) also often have promotional giveaways throughout the year, so that builds up the backlog too\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eon the console side, I\u0026rsquo;ve been a Playstation Plus subscriber a long time, so I count that as part of my backlog too - there\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of PS+ games I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to get around to but haven\u0026rsquo;t yet\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the bundles also results in me getting some duplicate keys. To alleviate the backlog, every few years I even do a holiday giveaway of a few Steam games to friends and family on Facebook (sorry if we\u0026rsquo;re not friends there lol).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m trying to do better - this year I have been trying to work through my older gaming backlogs (I even \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/late-game-review-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/\"\u003ecompleted Skyrim\u003c/a\u003e after 7 years!) and minimize my game spending, though I still did buy quite a few games. \u003cem\u003e(Hmm, maybe it would be nice to do some data analytics of how many games I\u0026rsquo;ve bought/played on Steam year-on-year.)\u003c/em\u003e The lack of free time for gaming is a serious problem too, combined with a few other factors:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emy tendency to want to get all the achievements for a game often significantly increases the playtime per game\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003elong-term games that reward daily grinding (a more common theme these days) take up some of my gaming time as well. The most recent culprits are \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/\"\u003eEternal\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/mtg-arena/\"\u003eMTG Arena\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003enew games coming out that I want to play lol\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRealistically, I\u0026rsquo;ll never be able to got through my entire Steam collection in my lifetime, but I can try! Maybe I should do something like go through all the small games first, and just immediately stop playing if I find them not to my liking. (This is a bit difficult for me since I dislike giving up on things). Hmm, that\u0026rsquo;s an idea. What if I do a Twitch/Youtube channel where I feature and try out lesser-known indie games on Steam? I certainly have a whole lot of them! Something to consider for the future!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
