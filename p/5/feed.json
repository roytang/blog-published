I had only been going out in shorts when going to the grocery or the nearby pharmacy, but this week I had to do an errand at a hospital a bit farther away, so I figured it would be a good time to figure out where my pants were. Hospital protocols were strict, as expected. We had to wait in like 3 different waiting areas before we could get to our appointment. This hospital was one of the hotspots back in the early days of the pandemic, so their vigilance is reassuring.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePC died unexpectedly today. As in, lost power while I was using it and wouldn\u0026rsquo;t turn back on, power light just blinking. This has happened once before, towards the end of 2020. Back then I had tried unplugging the power supply and opening it up, then reconnecting to see what happened, and it just miraculously fixed itself. This time, I just unplugged the PS, then left it alone for a while. When I came back later and reconnected everything and booted up, it was fine. So I guess there\u0026rsquo;s some issue with the power supply? I don\u0026rsquo;t want to have to upgrade just yet, although this rig is already more than 5 years old, I\u0026rsquo;m hoping I can get a couple more years out of it at least.

(I also wanted to defer posting about it until after the Biden inauguration, in case more things of interest happen.) Here\u0026rsquo;s where I am now:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"trump\"\u003eTrump\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOk, so first Trump (or anyone) getting kicked off Twitter (or any service) for TOS violations (inciting violence etc). it\u0026rsquo;s kind of a free speech issue, except the censorship is being done by a private entity, so it specifically doesn\u0026rsquo;t violate the US first amendment. I think that without question, I agree that social media platforms have a right to pick and choose what they allow on their platforms (except those that they aren\u0026rsquo;t allowed to discriminate against, by law, like race, religion, etc). And Trump absolutely violated ToS by inciting the Jan 6 riots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople are thinking this is a free speech issue because being deplatformed feels similar to being escorted off and banned from a public square. Of course, if you were on a public square goading people to raid govt buildings and kill elected officials, a lot of people would you want you dragged away from there anyway. That being said, I think the bigger issue is why have we these tech companies/platforms that are being treated as de facto public squares in the first place. It feels like we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have allowed them to grow to this size/amount of influence in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re on the fence as to whether this was a correct decision, there is \u003ca href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/misinformation-dropped-dramatically-the-week-after-twitter-banned-trump/ar-BB1cOqVP\"\u003eresearch that says misinformation dropped drastically after Twitter kicked off Trump\u003c/a\u003e, so that as you will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ll circle back to social media platforms/public square stuff in a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"parler\"\u003eParler\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, Parler. In theory, Parler could have become a competing public square, in fact that\u0026rsquo;s one of the things it\u0026rsquo;s doing. But Parler itself has been deplatformed, not just by Google/Apple, but by the webhost, AWS. I don\u0026rsquo;t have any opinions either way about the app stores kicking them out (although I will say Apple is more egregious, since there\u0026rsquo;s no alternative to Apple\u0026rsquo;s app store on iOS), but AWS kicking them out seems more problematic. It is a bit analogous to a landlord kicking out a tenant from their building because they are doing illegal things, like maybe running a meth lab? So by that analogy it can be justified. Technically, the discussions on Parler aren\u0026rsquo;t directly violent, but they are planning violence. So, can a landlord evict a tenant because his space was being used to plot violence?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the landlord analogy, they could always just find another landlord, but few compare in scale and capability to Amazon. So this may be another case of monopolies being problematic. They could also just host the content themselves, build their own datacenter etc. It\u0026rsquo;s akin to saying you can just buy/build your own house if no one is willing to let you rent one. It\u0026rsquo;s true, but not very pragmatic in many cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gut is that AWS kicking Parler off was justified, because Parler wasn\u0026rsquo;t making a good-faith effort to manage harmful content on their platform, but it still leaves a worse taste in the mouth than the Trump/Twitter. scenario\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, it\u0026rsquo;s super dumb to be planning these things in public anyway! Why don\u0026rsquo;t they get private forums, those are still things right? Or even a private FB group. Can FB ban them for discussions in a private group? Maybe. Or why don\u0026rsquo;t they all join those QAnon forums or whatever?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"how-should-social-media-platforms-change\"\u003eHow should social media platforms change?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCircling back to my earlier assertion, I don\u0026rsquo;t think social media platforms should be liable for what their users post. To me, this seems sensible on its face, otherwise no one would bother hosting content posted by other people (which I don\u0026rsquo;t mind, I have a website.) I also think platforms are well within their rights to filter what is or is not allowed to be posted on their platforms. (See above.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(There\u0026rsquo;s a whole side discussion about section 230 of the US CDA where conservatives are thinking repealing platform protections provided by that law would step them from censoring people, but that seems completely wrong. I\u0026rsquo;m not an American though, so I don\u0026rsquo;t particularly care.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do think however, that platforms should be held responsible for promoting, recommending or otherwise broadcasting harmful content via their algorithmic \u0026ldquo;timelines\u0026rdquo;, as that is more of an editorial decision than anything else. Think of it in terms of, if I was a content curator who recommended stuff to my followers, and I started recommending or promoting things illegal things like child porn or criminal stuff, I should absolutely be held accountable. The less that platforms promote harmful material, the less likely they are to gather steam and influece. Don\u0026rsquo;t give harmful people megaphones! \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/hankgreen/status/1351736509095792640\"\u003eRelated twitter thread I read recently talking about this very same thing.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the platforms aren\u0026rsquo;t allowed to use recommendation engines, what then? I would suggest that strictly chronological timelines should be fine, with no judgment made by the platform as to whether individual posts should be seen outside of that order or by people who aren\u0026rsquo;t subscribed to those sources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor ads, I think platforms should be liable for what ads they allow to run. And information should be publicly available for whoever paid for the ad. If someone advertises something illegal in real life, law enforcement needs to be able to track them down. And probably we should avoid targeted advertising as well. I think showing ads depending on what topics the user follows might be ok, assuming the topics aren\u0026rsquo;t super specific. For example, if the user follows a lot of politics, showing political ads might be ok, as long as the user is exposed to all flavors of political ads (i.e. ads from all sides). Definitely something that can still be refined. (And it goes without saying, if the platforms can\u0026rsquo;t do targeted advertising, they would be less inclined to siphon off all your personal data? Or is that too naive?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think stuff like Twitter\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;trending topics\u0026rdquo; section is fine, as long as it\u0026rsquo;s not super localized, i.e. you get a sense of what everyone is talking about, not just people in your bubble or whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSide note: I will agree not all algorithmic recommendations are bad. I\u0026rsquo;ve been watching a lot of British TV show clips on Youtube recently, and YT keeps recommending more, so I watch more, and it\u0026rsquo;s fine, it\u0026rsquo;s entertaining. That said, I would willingly give up those recommendations in exchange for the above. After all, people can always curate and provide recommendations manually (and they can be held liable or banned if needed!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"regulation-and-monopolies\"\u003eRegulation and Monopolies\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately social media platforms aren\u0026rsquo;t likely to do the above changes on their own, as avoiding algorithmic recommendations cuts into their \u0026ldquo;engagement\u0026rdquo; or whatever BS metric they choose to use. So it would have to be enforced by some kind of government regulation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a lot of talk about regulating big tech in the US government, but most of it centers on splitting up larger companies like Facebook and Google. I think that while this is not necessarily a wrong approach, it won\u0026rsquo;t be super useful. The monopoly power these large companies have doesn\u0026rsquo;t come directly from the services they offer but rather from the size of their userbase. (Which admittedly, is influenced by the services they offer.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I would suggest instead is to cut into that userbase monopoly by requiring the platforms to implement open standards for external services to subscribe/follow publicly-available content published on their platform. It can be something simple like RSS or something a bit more complicated like how Mastodon implements ActivityPub. Private comms/DMs can be via open protocols too like XMPP. (Or email! Remember email?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea is, if I want to follow someone on Facebook, I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to be required to have a Facebook account. This is part of the reason why so many people find it hard to leave Facebook - a lot of the people they follow and want to keep in touch with are there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t believe it would be necessary to require platforms to do the opposite thing - allow their users to follow users on other platforms - because users would just naturally prefer any platform that does implement such a feature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRequiring open protocols would remove the whole \u0026ldquo;public square\u0026rdquo; problem because now instead of having 1 or 2 de facto public squares, we can have as many as we want. Official government feeds could be hosted on their own servers instead of being forced to publish via Facebook or Twitter, and the public could still follow them from the platform of their choice. Same goes for influencers, brands, companies, whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne might think this would make it easier to distribute harmful content and harder to censor it, but as we can see on the open web, the opposite is true: harmful content is difficult to stumble upon normally (you have to be specifically looking for it) and can easily be punished, which is why we don\u0026rsquo;t see a lot of openly operating child porn websites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"in-conclusion\"\u003eIn conclusion\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s a whole lot of words, but I don\u0026rsquo;t have a conclusion. Like I said, complicated issue. (And I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are some easy flaws in my assertions above, I haven\u0026rsquo;t spent more than an hour thinking these through.) But these are discussions we should be having, and at least some of what I\u0026rsquo;ve outlined are above are options that are worth considering, given how harmful and divisive we have found the current social media paradigm to be. I still believe in the promise of the internet in bringing people and the world together - but we need to be doing it in a smart and responsible way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"rrl\"\u003eRRL\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome other articles I\u0026rsquo;ve read lately, relevant to this topic:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.platformer.news/p/what-social-networks-could-learn\"\u003eWhat Social Networks Could Learn\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-start-fixing-social-media-196297eb6b71\"\u003eHow to Start Fixing Social Media\u003c/a\u003e (Warning: Medium)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2021/1/17/speech-and-publishing\"\u003eOnline Speech and Publishing\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",

I got a Kindle copy on sale on Amazon at the top of the year, figured it was a good way to kick off a year of hopefully reading more books. This is a short review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI figure it\u0026rsquo;s probably not a spoiler to tell you the book is all about how the universe ends. Or at least, the many possible ways it could end. The book gives a surface-level walkthrough of what we know about the nature, history and future of our universe through the lenses of physics and cosmology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me more than a couple of weeks to get through the book, as each chapter does discuss some challenging topics and I wanted to make sure I mostly got my head around it before continuing. I suspect those with less background in the sciences might have a bit of trouble with the text, but the author tries her best to not be too complicated (which can be challenging given the subject matter).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that the text or prose is boring mind you. The author spices things up with a few humorous jabs here and there, although it might depend on your sense of humor. The author\u0026rsquo;s wit reminds me a bit of British-style humor, like in The Hitchhiker\u0026rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy, so YMMV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are able to power through the book, you are rewarded with a fascinating view of the current state of our knowledge of physics and cosmology, of how far we\u0026rsquo;ve come and much we still don\u0026rsquo;t know and how much there is yet to be discovered. Perhaps those who have not much background in science will come away with a deeper understanding of how scientific theories are formed, improved, discarded, iterated upon, and so on. I came away with a better understanding of things like the cosmic background radiation, dark matter, dark energy, and so on. Fascinating stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend the book to anyone with even a passing interest in physics. And even if you didn\u0026rsquo;t have such an interest, you could try it anyway, and maybe that will change.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I think there\u0026rsquo;s still some space for fringe tastes out there, but it is true that pop culture has seemed monolothic recently. What hits me most from the article is the phasing out of rock n roll in favor of hip hop, because a more diverse crowd favors it.
