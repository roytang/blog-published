All in all about 3 hours for me on site, and I think it\u0026rsquo;s only because they had to start late? I imagine if your time slot was 11am, it\u0026rsquo;d be a bit quicker for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m writing this around 3 hours after I got the shot, feeling fine, no apparent ill effects, though they said to monitor for up to 6 hours after the shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMostly satisfied with how things were handled on-site, mostly because the past few days I\u0026rsquo;ve heard horror stories about chaos at some of the other sites, mostly because some sites allegedly allowed walk-ins. The staff at Pinyahan were handling things as well as could be expected, although the whole process felt a bit too redundant with all the checks. Here, when someone asked outside if walkins would be accepted, they were told that the doses available for the day were only those allocated for those who had booked online. Also, they did that annoying thing with the queues for people sitting in chairs where every few minutes you\u0026rsquo;d have to get up and scoot over to the next chair over, until you eventually got to the front of the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"online-registration-and-processes\"\u003eOnline registration and processes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least the on-site process was a bit better than the online registration, which was kind of a disaster. Basically, early on they said vaccinations would be handled via their Quezon City ID initiative, so people should sign up for that. I applied for mine digitally, while the parents submitted paper forms to the barangay, since someone came around the subdivision surveying seniors who wanted to be registered. My QC ID was approved after a couple of weeks, but up to now still no word on my parents\u0026rsquo; QC ID.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometime in March, they announced that there would be two ways to get vaccinated: one was to register via the \u003ca href=\"https://app.ezconsult.io/\"\u003eapp.ezconsult.io\u003c/a\u003e, or if you had a QC ID, you could wait for the LGU/barangay personnel to process the lists and give you an appointment. Second option felt like it might take a while, so I went ahead and created an account for myself on ezconsult. My plan was to create an account for the parents after I\u0026rsquo;d seen the process, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to successfully book a vaccine appointment because apparently I had registered too early and the integration hadn\u0026rsquo;t been enabled yet??\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater on, they announced ezconsult was available for everybody, so I proceeded and was able to book an appointment for april 27th, the earliest I had seen available. Weirdly, when I was searching for vaccination sites, it included sites in other cities like Las Pinas, who I assume also have an arrangement with ezconsult. I also created accounts for the parents and submitted them for review. When filling up the form expressing interest in vaccination, some of the fields still assumed you were a health worker, since this sytem was initially used for the A1 priority groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people online were reporting problems with the app saying the email was already taken; turns out they had batch imported some QC ID data and auto-created accounts for those people without informing them, so people had to reset passwords (something a nontechnical person wouldn\u0026rsquo;t think to try!). Since I had created my account before this import, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a problem. Then there also were reports of people being able to book vaccination schedules without being one of the currently allowed priority groups; apparently the site doesn\u0026rsquo;t validate for that. And because Sinovac, the only widely available vaccine in the country, was not advised for seniors, QC government had to advice seniors not to book yet since there were very few stocks of Astra Zeneca for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while my brother, who had previously registered the same slot as me on the 27th, mentioned he had been able to reschedule to an earlier slot, today at 9am. I was like, how did you do that? When I checked the app I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see any free time slots available earlier than the 27th. Checking online, a lot of people were reporting there were free slots, while others said they couldn\u0026rsquo;t see any, so I assume they were doing some kind of manual / batch updates to set free slots, I ended up having to check every few days. It was only last Thursday I was only able to reschedule my appointment to today. And at that time, my parent\u0026rsquo;s accounts were still under review!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen last Friday, the ezconsult app was down for most of the day for some reason. (So, I was lucky to rebook right before that!) Lots of complaints from people, of course. By Saturday morning they were back up, and thankfully, I found that my parents accounts\u0026rsquo; could now schedule an appointment! Except\u0026hellip; there were no slots available again! At this time, the QC government had to send out advisories telling people not to go if they weren\u0026rsquo;t among the priority groups, as apparently large numbers of such people were causing chaos at some of the sites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile in the queues earlier, I asked about the availability of AstraZeneca for seniors, but I was told they didn\u0026rsquo;t have any today and couldn\u0026rsquo;t say if it would be available until the day itself when they got their deliveries. A few days ago, the FDA had approved Sinovac for seniors, so the few senior citizens in the queues today were getting Sinovac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I got my shot, we were told by a doctor in the observation room that the system would send us an automated email about the schedule for the second shot, but we were told to DISREGARD IT and instead come back on the date specified at the back of the vaccination card. So, their automation wasn\u0026rsquo;t going well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, I can\u0026rsquo;t really blame the developers of the app for all the problems, I can only imagine the rapid pace of changing requirements they were subjected to, especially with the flip-flopping on whether seniors could go, or comorbids could go, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully all of the problems are just growing pains and such, and that the systems and processes get better and clearer as time goes on, since we definitely to ramp up and scale up vaccination in this country! Not to mention, they also need to provide alternative methods of registration/scheduling for non-technical people (probably requires legwork by barangay officials), as right now the process is largely inaccessible to the poorer sectors.\u003c/p\u003e",

Ok, so I guess that means they are a bit same-y, but on the other hand I am getting better at retention because I actually recognized it this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I went ahead and completed the re-read and proceeded to the next City Watch book, \u003cem\u003eMen at Arms\u003c/em\u003e. And this one was totally new to me, for sure. So, this is a bit of a double review. And maybe a review of the Discworld series as a whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ndash;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eGuards! Guards!\u003c/em\u003e we get Pratchett\u0026rsquo;s treatment of common fantasy tropes such as dwarves, dragons that can\u0026rsquo;t possibly be flying, and unknown heroes becoming king by slaying evil dragons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have the effrontery to be squeamish, it thought at him. But we were dragons. We were supposed to be cruel, cunning, heartless, and terrible. But this much I can tell you, you ape—the great face pressed even closer, so that Wonse was staring into the pitiless depths of his eyes—we never burned and tortured and ripped one another apart and called it morality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ndash; Terry Pratchett, \u003cem\u003eGuards! Guards!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eMen at Arms\u003c/em\u003e, Pratchett expands on the cast of the City Watch subseries, explores the guild structure of the city of Ankh Morpork, and expands the lore of races such as dwarves and trolls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.\nBut the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that’d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years’ time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.\nThis was the Captain Samuel Vimes “Boots” theory of socioeconomic unfairness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ndash; Terry Pratchett, \u003cem\u003eMen at Arms\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, yes, the Discworld books are maybe kind of same-y, but that\u0026rsquo;s kind of a good thing? You usually know what to expect. They\u0026rsquo;re light reading, they\u0026rsquo;re funny in a dry British humor kind of way, and Pratchett likes to attack and parody and deconstruct common fantasy tropes. I like the books, despite their sameyness, although I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if I\u0026rsquo;ll ever be able to work my way through the entire series.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The first-time experience wasn\u0026rsquo;t great; we had to buy from a different grocery (since our usual one wasn\u0026rsquo;t available), not all the regular items we needed were there, and some items were way more expensive. And worst of all, I ordered Tostitos cheese dip and they bought spinach dip instead!! The weird thing is, there were some other items that were out of stock that they called me about (even though I explicitly set that if there were missing items, just don\u0026rsquo;t buy them??), yet for the dip, they just went ahead and bought a different flavor. I ended up having a long convo with their customer support about how disappointed I was, and somehow despite saying there\u0026rsquo;s nothing they could do, they later ended up offering me P100 store credit as compensation. I guess it will be useful if ever we decide to try this again. Anyway, we ended up doing a supplementary grocery run yesterday to cover the items the online delivery didn\u0026rsquo;t get (and the cheese dip!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatching:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOnly one movie watched this week, continuing the James Bond run: \u003ca href=\"/2021/04/1a1ab3ad610478ba3b672b0a89c26333/\"\u003eOn Her Majesty\u0026rsquo;s Secret Service (1969)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupergirl\u003c/strong\u003e has started up again, carrying over baggage from the cut-short previous season, same as Flash.

Still, the daily counts kept rising, hitting record highs of almost 10k cases daily. Even before the dust has settled on the bubble response, they decided to announce last night a reversion to the stricter ECQ. Shades of last year, during the run up to the first lockdown announcement: rumors circulated via chat groups about the impending lockdown before the government finally made their announcement. As can be expected, memes quickly circulated about how we came back to ECQ more than a year after the first lockdown. The lockdown is imposed only for one week, during the Holy Week period, presumably to take advantage of the two holidays in the week to minimize economic impact.
