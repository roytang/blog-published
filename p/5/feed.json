I got a Kindle copy on sale on Amazon at the top of the year, figured it was a good way to kick off a year of hopefully reading more books. This is a short review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI figure it\u0026rsquo;s probably not a spoiler to tell you the book is all about how the universe ends. Or at least, the many possible ways it could end. The book gives a surface-level walkthrough of what we know about the nature, history and future of our universe through the lenses of physics and cosmology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me more than a couple of weeks to get through the book, as each chapter does discuss some challenging topics and I wanted to make sure I mostly got my head around it before continuing. I suspect those with less background in the sciences might have a bit of trouble with the text, but the author tries her best to not be too complicated (which can be challenging given the subject matter).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that the text or prose is boring mind you. The author spices things up with a few humorous jabs here and there, although it might depend on your sense of humor. The author\u0026rsquo;s wit reminds me a bit of British-style humor, like in The Hitchhiker\u0026rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy, so YMMV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are able to power through the book, you are rewarded with a fascinating view of the current state of our knowledge of physics and cosmology, of how far we\u0026rsquo;ve come and much we still don\u0026rsquo;t know and how much there is yet to be discovered. Perhaps those who have not much background in science will come away with a deeper understanding of how scientific theories are formed, improved, discarded, iterated upon, and so on. I came away with a better understanding of things like the cosmic background radiation, dark matter, dark energy, and so on. Fascinating stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend the book to anyone with even a passing interest in physics. And even if you didn\u0026rsquo;t have such an interest, you could try it anyway, and maybe that will change.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I think there\u0026rsquo;s still some space for fringe tastes out there, but it is true that pop culture has seemed monolothic recently.

It kind of died off, mostly because I haven\u0026rsquo;t been good about going through my backlog of feeds and sources to get much content for the section. I\u0026rsquo;m bringing it back here as a regular section (for now), so that (a) I force myself to go through all that stuff at least once a week; and (b) people who aren\u0026rsquo;t super interested in what\u0026rsquo;s going on with me have more stuff to read in these weeknotes. I also considered just having a separate weekly \u0026ldquo;linkblog\u0026rdquo; post with the links of interest section, but figured maybe I\u0026rsquo;d check first if I can keep up with the volume needed for that sort of thing? Also, a lot of these are available on my \u003ca href=\"/links/\"\u003elinks\u003c/a\u003e list, which I also share to Twitter/Masto as they come, so if you follow me there, you might have seen me tweet some of these, and this is just sort of a weekly recap.

Not bad for a kids\u0026rsquo; show, covers most of the mythos fairly well, though I\u0026rsquo;m disappointed at how Peter treats Gwen like a sidekick given in the comics she\u0026rsquo;s the love of his life. I\u0026rsquo;m only halfway through, maybe that changes later? I always felt Spider-man was better as a serialized TV series than the constant movie reboots. He has a lot of nice street-level villains and supporting cast that can only feature in a longer storyline than blockbuster movies can afford.

To help reinforce my book reading, I\u0026rsquo;ve switched up my evening meals reading from the day\u0026rsquo;s news to whatever book I have on tap at the moment.

It\u0026rsquo;s kind of annoying, like I slept on it wrong. I thought it would just go away on its own, but now I\u0026rsquo;m thinking maybe it\u0026rsquo;s one of those old age things where things just hurt randomly and you have to live with it?!?
