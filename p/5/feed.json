It\u0026rsquo;s one of the reasons why the \u003ca href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1275013/sinas-other-police-officials-in-mananita-to-face-criminal-case-palace\"\u003ebirthday mananita debacle\u003c/a\u003e was such a big deal to a lot of people. While these supposed \u0026ldquo;public servants\u0026rdquo; flaunt their privilege, the rest of us are deprived of things like seeing our friends and loved ones in person, celebrating milestones, or even the simple pleasures of eating out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve actually written quite a few of these \u003ca href=\"/tags/birthday/\"\u003ebirthday posts\u003c/a\u003e by now, though not as regularly as I\u0026rsquo;d have liked. I read through a few of them to help me decide what to write for today (didn\u0026rsquo;t really help). My favorite has to be the one with \u003ca href=\"/2016/08/thirty-eight/\"\u003ethirty eight lessons I’ve learned through the years\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it\u0026rsquo;s for the best, maybe even if I had gotten a few days off I still wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been able to come up with anything satisfying enough. I mean, the point of taking time off for myself was to get away from the world for a bit and be all introspective and to spend time with my own thoughts, but with this pandemic, I might have been doing far too much time doing that already. Perhaps that\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m not really complaining about the spike in busy-ness I\u0026rsquo;ve had over the past month or so. It\u0026rsquo;s sort of a welcome respite from all the self-reflection this pandemic time has given me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven that this is the first birthday after I quit Facebook, I am expecting much, much fewer birthday greetings this year. Interesting how a lot of people are probably dependent now on Facebook to tell them when other people are having birthdays. It is no big loss; the people who are important will remember. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean I\u0026rsquo;m not grateful and amazed if someone unexpected should remember. A couple of days ago someone I\u0026rsquo;d only known for less than five years actually remembered to greet me, except the greeting came two days early due to uncertainty about the exact date. It\u0026rsquo;s nice to be remembered, no matter how stoic we pretend to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost impulse-bought a Switch yesterday, luckily a friend talked me out of it.
