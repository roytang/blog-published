            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAs I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned \u003ca href=\"/2004/04/roy-goes-to-hk/\"\u003ebefore\u003c/a\u003e, I was sent to HK a couple of weeks back, for the rollout of a project I\u0026rsquo;ve been involved with for about a year and a half. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s right for me to be talking about the project here, so I won\u0026rsquo;t delve into any specifics. I will however, bore you all with stories from my first trip anywhere remotely far from home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, the plane trip. Economy class (excuse me, fiesta class) on a PAL Airbus from NAIA2 to HK International on Thursday night. Food was okay, I\u0026rsquo;ve had worse, not really enough to turn me off airline food. The PAL flight attendants, as I later discussed with a male coworker, were quite not-young and, well, not-hot. Heh, probably unfair but you get a certain expectation from media, you know? The flight was short (less than two hours) and uneventful, no dizziness or pukathons for me, thanks, unlike when I take the eight-hour bus ride to Bicol. This may seem boring to seasoned fliers, but I liked that little map that told me at what location we were currently flying over. Neat!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an engineering type, I also took notice of the plane itself. Is it normal that airplanes routinely jiggle and vibrate as the plane taxis? I understand that it\u0026rsquo;s unavoidable as things like cars and trains do the same; but shouldn\u0026rsquo;t things be a bit tighter on a plane? Still, didn\u0026rsquo;t really bother me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon landing, I got a glimpse of HK International Airport. I had heard it was huge, but didn\u0026rsquo;t get to look around much as I was greeted at the boarding gate by two of the HK staff. Nice people, one of them bought me dinner at McDonald\u0026rsquo;s although I told them I had already had the airline food. Afterwards, they took mo to The Peak, apparently a famous spot for tourists in Hong Kong. It\u0026rsquo;s a mall-type thing on top of a rather high mountain. From the observation deck, you could see most of Hong Kong. From there I could see that Hong Kong was a very urbanized area, a lot more than Metro Manila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter spending some time there, they drive me to the Staff Quarters near the HK office, where one of our RP staff has been staying for a month. The RP guy greets me, shows me upstairs, shows me the ropes, and I get some sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe office building is right next to the block where the staff quarters was, barely a five-minute walk. I spent most of my time in HK between the office and the staff quarters. Truth be told, the trip wasn\u0026rsquo;t really very exciting, as there was a lot of work to be done and not much time to goof around. I\u0026rsquo;ll just note some things particularly interesting about being in a foreign country:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePeople speaking in an unintelligible language all the time\u003c/em\u003e. Probably the biggest hurdle to anything, it took surprisingly little getting used to the fact that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t communicate perfectly with anyone, and with some people, not at all. On some occasions, I had to buy food or drinks through pointing and using hand signs to find out how much stuff was. When walking on the street, I\u0026rsquo;d turn my head whenever I hear someone speaking English, because it was quite unusual. Also, when dining out with the HK staff, I\u0026rsquo;d have to rely on them to order for me, since I can\u0026rsquo;t read the menus. Which brings me to\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eForeign food\u003c/em\u003e. Anyone who knows me knows I\u0026rsquo;m quite a picky eater. I don\u0026rsquo;t take to new foods very easily. But it\u0026rsquo;s hard to refuse when you\u0026rsquo;re a guest, so I got to taste more new stuff in my five and a half days in HK than I have for maybe the past three years. It\u0026rsquo;s ok, I don\u0026rsquo;t mind, even the veggies. The biggest problem was the fact that I have no idea how to use chopsticks, and almost every meal needs the use of chopsticks. At one point, I had to badger my co-RP staff to help me get food using the serving chopsticks. While I was there, I had some Taiwanese, Thai food, and of course, Chinese. Lots of Chinese. Oh, and an interesting side note: apparently foreign McDonald\u0026rsquo;s have no McSpaghetti.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eReligious issues.\u003c/em\u003e I was unable to hear Mass on Sunday. We had to work most of the day, but I got off around 4PM. I asked one of the HK guys for directions to a Church (we were in Kowloon, I believe), but when I explained that I was Catholic, he didn\u0026rsquo;t know what the term meant. (This is of course ridiculous to a Filipino; everbody knows what a \u003cem\u003eKatoliko\u003c/em\u003e is!) After saying that my faith is similar to another RP staff who he had also met before, he gave me some instructions on where to find a Church. I walked around a bit, following his directions. Which eventually lead me to a Mosque. Ooookay. So I walked around some more (quite a bit actually, went up and down the same road couple of times), I found a place called \u0026ldquo;St Andrews Church\u0026rdquo;, I guessed this was the place he was talking about. I walked in and asked around, found out they had a Mass around 6PM. So I waited for a bit. Around 5:45 I picked up a flier and noticed that it was in fact an Anglican Church (Is it a Protestant thing? Or something else? I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sure), and I it\u0026rsquo;s not the same so I went out looking again. I saw another Church, this time it was Lutheran. Around 6:30PM, I gave up, bought some dinner at McDonald\u0026rsquo;s and took a taxi home. The next day one of the HK staff who said he was Christian told me there was a Catholic Church beside the Mosque\u0026hellip; apparently it was a small one so I failed to notice it. From our discussion, I think there\u0026rsquo;s quite a distinction here between \u0026ldquo;Christians\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Catholics\u0026rdquo;; which is weird since I\u0026rsquo;m fairly sure Catholics are Christian. Anyway, I was wondering why it was so hard to find a Church in a place where\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThere are so many Filipinos.\u003c/em\u003e You can see \u0026lsquo;em everywhere, as you walk along the main streets. Mostly tourists and domestic helpers, I believe. I could hear Tagalog being spoken on the street more often than English. Of course, maybe I should\u0026rsquo;ve asked one of them where I could go to Church\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTaxis are discplined.\u003c/em\u003e This is of course, shocking to any Filipino! A sticker on the inside of every taxi tells you the rules: They can\u0026rsquo;t turn down fares, they have to issue a receipt when asked, they must follow seatbelt laws, etc. Every taxi is equipped with a receipt machine, and every one of \u0026lsquo;em is bright red so they\u0026rsquo;re easy to spot. Overall, while I still experienced traffic jams over there, their traffic situation is still hella lot better than ours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat else can I say? As I said, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have much free time. They were kind enough to give me half the day off on Tuesday afternoon (my flight home was Tuesday evening), and they recommended some places I could go visit. So I went to Quarry Bay, about 2 MTR stations away from the office. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what I was looking for, though, so I ended up mostly wandering aimlessly, not buying anything ‘cept for some food and drinks. I actually managed to walk all the way back to the office, and just decided to buy some chocolates from a supermarket to bring home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the flight home, PAL switched me to a much smaller plane, which sucked. :( I got to see more of HK Airport, and let me say\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s frickin\u0026rsquo; huge. I told the guys who brought me to the airport that NAIA2 is like a fourth of HK airport, but now I think it\u0026rsquo;s more like a sixth. I\u0026rsquo;m told they even have some sort of moving platform thing for people whose gates are so frickin\u0026rsquo; far. It took 30 minutes for our plane to taxi, that should say something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, got home around 11:30, bought some more goodies at the duty-free shop. Took a taxi home, arrived safe and sound. Told stories for an hour or so, then \u0026hellip;  zzzzzz.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

If you need to know where you\u0026rsquo;re voting, \u003ca href=\"http://www.findprecinct.com\"\u003efindprecinct.com\u003c/a\u003e is the place to start. Need help deciding? I used the \u003ca href=\"http://www.eleksyon2004.com/display.php?fld=sampleballot\u0026amp;art=index.php\"\u003esample ballot at the Eleksyon 2004 website\u003c/a\u003e to help me fill up those slots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding my choices, the Concilors are all allied with Lakas-CMD, hence they are part of Sonny Belmonte\u0026rsquo;s ticket, who really deserves not only another term but a term with people he\u0026rsquo;s chosen to ally himself with. For president, I chose Roco, ‘coz hell, if by some miracle he wins I don\u0026rsquo;t wanna miss my chance to gloat that I voted for the candidate who was right in every possible way. For the party-list rep, last time around I voted for Bayan Muna, but I don\u0026rsquo;t really like how they\u0026rsquo;re soft on the NPA, whether or not the military allegations are true. Akbayan, while still left-leaning (to balance the center-to-right preferences of most mainstream politicians), at least recognizes that the NPA Permit-to-Campaign fees are downright extortion and should be criminalized. For the Senators, the only unusual choice is Doc Hussin (more Muslim representation), but the rest should be obvious. I actually had only 11 senators listed before deciding on Hussin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what will happen to the country now? Who knows, for a while I was thinking of voting for FPJ just to see what kind of new crap our country can go through\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

How could I lose?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story is simple enough. Colin Farell plays James Clayton, a young man just out of MIT, recruited by CIA agent William Burke (Pacino). Clayton is obsessed with finding out what happened to his father, who was lost in an accident some fifteen or so years ago. Pacino taunts him by dropping the occasional hint about his father\u0026rsquo;s fate, and Clayton throws away the promising career he would have had in Engineering to join the CIA. The third entry to this little affair is Leila, Clayton\u0026rsquo;s batchmate at the Farm, a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echick who may or may not be a double agent, but definitely has the hots for him. The three of them expectedly get involved a complicated plot involving double agents, unofficial operatives and the standard amount of secret agent sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best parts of the movie involve the CIA training. We get a glimpse into the kind of psychological warfare business they teach the recruits at the training centre affectionately called \u0026ldquo;The Farm.\u0026rdquo; Here Al Pacino does what he does, drilling his principles into his students: \u0026ldquo;Trust no one.\u0026quot;; \u0026ldquo;Nothing is what is seems.\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Everything is a test.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weakest part has to be the character of James Clayton himself. The character of Leila puts it best: Why the hell does James feel like doing anything he can to please Burke? James never has any real motivation for following Burke like he was the Messiah. Aside from that mysterious star on the CIA wall at Langley (which may or may not be related to his father), there is nothing stopping James from just calling it quits and heading home. Hell, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have wanted to go through that training,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esecret agent or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall: Enjoyable enough, despite the predictability of the overall plot. Ending is a bit disappointing, but only a bit, as it leaves an important plot point hanging. I hope we see these characters again sometime\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Square stock will be bought out for Enix stock at 0.81 Square per 1 Enix. The Square president will be head of Square Enix, the Enix board remains in place, they\u0026rsquo;ll move into Enix headquarters in Shibuya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll currently announced releases will go on as scheduled. A FF/DW merger may be in the offing, but no definite plans, and probably only as a side release. No personnel will be let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquaresoft is: Final Fantasy, Chrono, Xeno, SaGa, Mana and assorted other titles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnix is: Dragon Quest/Warrior, Soul Blazer series, 7th Saga, Actraiser, Tri-Ace (Star Ocean, Valkyrie Profile), and a lot of stuff that never made it outside Japan. Enix also has a deal with GameArts on co-developing the Grandia series.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSony, one of Square\u0026rsquo;s major stockholders, will have it\u0026rsquo;s shares diluted to 8% of Square/Enix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNamco, another game company also has some stock in both Square and Enix, and is the publisher of Xenogears\u0026rsquo; prequel, Xenosaga.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquare also has a US publishing deal with EA, set to expire at the end of the year. (This last tidbit may not mean anything\u0026hellip; )\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquare also recently acquired the Quest team (responsible for Tactics Ogre series) and the rights to the Ogre Battle franchise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, what can we see?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst off, Enix will be in control, at least at first. Although the Square guy will be Pres, the Pres can always be overridden by the board, and the Enix board will remain in place until they hold a stockholder election thingy, whatever that\u0026rsquo;s called. You might think this is bad \u0026ldquo;Oh no, Enix is in control, that means FF is doomed!\u0026rdquo; Of course not. They\u0026rsquo;re not stupid. The fact is that Enix being in control of the company\u0026rsquo;s vision and direction makes more sense in light of Square and Enix\u0026rsquo;s overlapping powers. Square develops most of it\u0026rsquo;s products in-house, while Enix publishes a lot of products from other developers like Tri-Ace and Gamearts. Therefore, it makes more sense for Enix to be in control of administrative/business stuff, leaving Square staff to focus on what they do best — game development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what does this mean to us as gamers? In the immediate future, nothing really. All the currently announced projects are unaffected: we\u0026rsquo;ll still get FFXI, FFXII, FF:Crystal Chronicle, FFTA, Unlimited Saga, etc. The only thing I\u0026rsquo;ve found people to be questioning on message boards is whether FF1-2 (which still doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a definite announcement of a US release) will have an English version. This is a possible concern, as Enix didn\u0026rsquo;t even bother to release an English version of their own DW4. Who knows, maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll get a collection of DW4 and FF1-2? 😛 (Addendum: FF1-2 has been announced for US release.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut after the immediate future, what then? Square Enix will almost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecertainly continue the Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior lines. The future for the Chrono series also seems bright, as the original Chrono Trigger was a collaboration between Square and some of Enix\u0026rsquo;s creative staff. Stuff from Tri-Ace and GameArts will probably go on as before, seeing as these development studios are mostly independent of Enix anyway. And if we\u0026rsquo;re lucky, we\u0026rsquo;ll get another Soul Blazer trilogy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I worry about are Square\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;secondary\u0026rdquo; RPG series: SaGa and Mana. Now that Square Enix will have two \u0026ldquo;big\u0026rdquo; series under it\u0026rsquo;s roof, will they still have time to develop these still-young series?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough not really related to the merger, things also look bright for fans of FFTactics. Aside from the upcoming FFTA, Square\u0026rsquo;s acquisition of Quest and the Ogre Battle franchise means we\u0026rsquo;ll probably see more FFT/TacticsOgre type games coming from them. Combined with the unique gameplay perspective of Tri-Ace, who knows what interesting games will come out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been looking around on message boards after the news came out, and it seems a lot of people are worried about how Enix might screw up Final Fantasy, or Square screw up Dragon Warrior or anything like that. To this, again I say: They\u0026rsquo;re not stupid. FF and DW, although they have the same roots, are completely different series now, and their different styles again reflect how Square and Enix can complement each other\u0026rsquo;s strengths. Well, I guess DW will benefit the most, as it\u0026rsquo;s sorely lacking in FFs specialty: really good graphics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother concern that has been raised has been the possibility of a monopoly in RPG games. With this merger, a lot of the big RPG names are now under one roof. Won\u0026rsquo;t the lesser competition cause more lackluster RPGs to be put out? Maybe, but I doubt it. Square Enix still can\u0026rsquo;t afford to let up on the quality, as there are still a good number of other good up-and-coming series out there: Suikoden (Konami), Wild Arms (Sony?), Tales (Namco) and Breath of Fire (Capcom) all still have quite some following and good potential. In fact the above titles will probably slug it out for the Number 2 Console RPG Developer slot\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, the opinions I\u0026rsquo;ve read on the web are mixed: some are good, some are bad. My own personal take is that it\u0026rsquo;s good; mergers generally mean two companies wanting to capitalize on each other\u0026rsquo;s strengths, not share each other\u0026rsquo;s weaknesses. Let\u0026rsquo;s just wait and see, and hope for the best. 😛\u003c/p\u003e\n",
