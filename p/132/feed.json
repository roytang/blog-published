            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eI never really put much stock in certifications. I felt that they were no guarantee of knowledge or expertise, and that many people who did have knowledge or expertise wouldn’t necessarily have a certification to say so. Add to that it often seem overpriced to even apply for the certifications, so I didn’t have a high opinion of them. That being said, I have had the opportunity to take professional certification exams twice in my life (both luckily paid for by my employer at that time).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe first was the JITSE \u0026ndash; the Japanese IT Standards Examinations. This was back in 2004 when our company was planning to undertake some projects based in Japan. Luckily, the exam did not require us to learn Japanese. The exam mostly covered programming and computer science concepts. The scope was largely academic in nature, not really related to the actual practice of software development. At first I thought it might be a problem for me since I had no formal computer science schooling, but it turns out I need not have worried. We were able to find ample review materials / sample exams that gave us a good coverage of the scope of the exams. We even had like five thick textbooks full of review material to cover, which typically I didn’t end up going through (seemed like a bother), I felt like the sample exams were more than enough. And to add even further to my disdain of certification exams, a significant percentage of the questions during the actual certification were already in the sample exams we reviewed. So yes, easily passed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eOf course I should probably note ever since high school I have considered myself to be a fiend when taking multiple-choice exams. I am supremely confident when taking any sort of multiple choice exam, no matter the actual level of knowledge I possess. During the JITSE for example, I finished it very early. If I didn’t have any kind of shame, I would have submitted the AM exam a whole hour-and-a-half early just so I could get some sleep before the PM part. (Some people later told me they noticed me dozing off). Multiple choice exams are really easy to go through quickly, especially if there’s minimal problems solving involved. There’s no reason to linger at each question: you either know the answer or you don’t, and if you don’t you quickly decide on a candidate that looks the most likely. (If there’s some sort of problem solving or math involved then you go into that weird fuzzy logic where you try to figure out which choice is mathematically closest to the answer you got. Or yes, you could just redo your work, but don’t be afraid to assume that the exam itself can be wrong if you come up with the same answer three times)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe second time I took a professional certification exam was when I was asked to take a Java 6 certification exam for reasons I now cannot remember. This one I was more confident in \u0026ndash; by this point I had already been using Java for \u003cem\u003ethe better part of a decade\u003c/em\u003e and was pretty sure I knew it inside and out. That being said, you always find out about obscure language quirks when preparing for these exams. For example, I never had to use the keyword volatile so I really only learned what it was for while reviewing for the certification exam. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eBeing the exam-taking fiend I was, I took and easily passed the Java 6 certification exam, which of course led to jokes along the lines of \u0026ldquo;Hey, we don’t need a compiler anymore, Roy is now a valid JVM\u0026rdquo;. I never did get to use that certification for anything though. I took the exam and passed it (finally earning my Java certification) in Oct 2012, after 8 years of being a Java programmer.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eOver the years as I’ve dealt with a wider range of people across society, my disdain for certifications has dimmed a bit. The most important bit I have learned is that it’s very hard to evaluate software developers in terms of skill (a topic itself worthy of an entire series of blog posts), so certifications allow people in hiring capabilities (or any other capability that requires an assessment of a developer’s skill) to cheat a little bit. They save a little bit of effort because a certification basically says \u0026ldquo;this guy knows his stuff well enough to pass a certification exam\u0026rdquo;, which can be good enough depending on your specific purposes. Sure, it’s possible to pass a certification exam and have no real idea how to apply the topics covered in practice, but at least the certification gives them a bit more confidence in you, even if unjustified. It’s a bit like school diplomas and driver’s licenses: it doesn’t really guarantee that you know what you’re doing, but at least you were good enough to fool other people who evaluated you, so even if you turn out to be not so good, at least the evaluator is not alone in making that mistake. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAnd if you’re the sort of developer who’s all about the money, having certain certifications can be very good for your bank account. I’m pretty sure getting an in-demand certification like Oracle DBA or Cisco Networking stuff can get you a significant bump in pay grade. This also means that it can cost a significant amount of money to even apply for taking those certification exams \u0026ndash; it might be best to try to find a way to fool \u0026ndash; er, I mean persuade \u0026ndash; your current employer into paying for it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Typically each programmer in a team will not be doing the same task or even the same type of task, so in order to produce fair evaluations you will need some standard metric of program size to normalize any evaluation. For example, you could choose to use code quality (bugs) as a metric for programmer performance, but not every programmer is assigned to do the same complexity of programs and some modules may be more poorly designed than others resulting in more bugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLines of code is nice, until you realize that more lines of code does not necessarily mean a larger program or system, it may just mean your programmers don’t write particularly concise code.

There are other possible metrics, but they all have different flaws and none of them capture the complexities of program size particularly well. Function points for example are meant to determine program size based on functional complexity but does not take into account technical complexity. Agile teams will often used a fuzzy metric called story points formed by team consensus but these are notoriously inaccurate and may change in relative size from sprint to sprint and definitely change in relative size across teams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat complicates things even more is that even the best, most senior programmers can slip into poor program quality due to schedule pressure, unreasonable clients or requirements, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I would suggest (and probably is unavoidable) is instead a more subjective approach, combining multiple heuristics to get as fair an evaluation as possible. I would suggest something like the following combination:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHave the programmer define his own goals/targets for the evaluation period. At the end of the period, go over the goals with him and discuss how closely he came to meeting them. These may be quantitative targets or qualitative (“I feel like my code has been of reasonably good quality”). You can compare against the other feedback in this list if there’s any disagreement\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGet feedback from a technical perspective from a mentor or senior developer who has worked closely with the programmer. The feedback can answer some simple questions like “Is his technical skill adequate?”, “Can he be assigned more complex functions?”, “Has he been assigned the appropriate amount of work?”, ““Has he created any problems that someone of his skill level should not be expected to do?”, “How has he contributed to the overall team?”, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGet feedback from other people he has worked with. For people who haven’t worked that closely with him, the feedback will be leaning more towards soft skills rather than technical, i.e. how well he works with other people, how manageable he is, how helpful he is, and so on.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\"\u003eAll of the above are subjective, but in combination should give you a relatively good picture of how well the programmer is performing relative to his peers. You can combine it with whatever corporate-sanctioned metrics you need as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Someone on quora asked:\n What is a good way to measure how good a software engineer is?\n Evaluation of programmer performance is notoriously hard. There are no good, objective, universally accepted standard metrics.\nIt follows from the fact that there are no good, objective, universally accepted standard metrics for program size. Typically each programmer in a team will not be doing the same task or even the same type of task, so in order to produce fair evaluations you will need some standard metric of program size to normalize any evaluation.",

Here\u0026rsquo;s the deck I played at the last tournament: \u003ca href=\"http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=12828\u0026amp;d=274476\u0026amp;f=MO\"\u003ehttp://mtgtop8.com/event?e=12828\u0026amp;d=274476\u0026amp;f=MO\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m mostly fine with the main deck (except maybe Tamiyo, a bit weak, if I think of something better in that slot I might swap her out). I\u0026rsquo;m not playing Nahiri because I don\u0026rsquo;t have time to get them before Saturday, and also because I\u0026rsquo;m quite used to this build already and in Modern I prefer piloting the deck I already really know\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m thinking of tweaking the sideboard. No idea the meta to expect for this weekend\u0026rsquo;s WMCQ so I want to hit as wide a base as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePermission magic:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThinking of changing 1 Negate 2 Dispel to 2 Negate 1 Dispel to give better game against Tron\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCounterflux. This slot is really only good vs Storm, is it worth it? I figure vs Storm you just always stop the start of the storm chain instead of the end, so maybe not worth it?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnti-aggro:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2 Supreme Verdict or 1 Anger of the Gods + 1 Supreme Verdict? Or should I free up another slot and have 1 Anger + 2 Verdict?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eis Shatterstorm even good against Affinity or should I have 2 Stony Silence instead? (I don\u0026rsquo;t have the 2nd Stony yet though\u0026hellip;)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGY hate:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRelic or RIP? RIP turns off GY stuff forever while Relic is a one-off, but RIP is symmetrical so it turns off my own Snaps\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, is there some guide somewhere that tells me what\u0026rsquo;s the optimal number to choose for EE in various matchups? I just got this EE, so I\u0026rsquo;m not to used to boarding it in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny other suggestions? What matchups should I look out for? Thanks!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
