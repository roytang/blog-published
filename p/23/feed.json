I\u0026rsquo;m writing this early in the morning, so IDK yet how the church will adapt the usual fanfare to this whole pandemic thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe summer heat has begun to settle in during the last few weeks of quarantine. I can\u0026rsquo;t sit without a shirt or rest or my arms anywhere without sweat threatening to accumulate on the contact surface. Coincidentally around the first week of the lockdown, our aircon in the only airconditioned room in the house started making funny noises so we\u0026rsquo;ve stopped using it. At least we get to save electricty?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall this week much less productive than the last. I felt a stronger tendency to \u0026ldquo;veg out\u0026rdquo; as it were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t get to write any new blog posts this week (other than the weeknotes). It seems kind of difficult to get your thoughts together when your brain is constantly distracted by the state of the world. I mean, how could I ever finish a post titled \u0026ldquo;Things learned from a crisis\u0026rdquo; when things are moving so quickly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWork has gotten a bit busier this week, as there are some things a client is asking me to do that he says are urgent, but really is little more than just saving them a bit of effort by automating stuff. I will say however that I\u0026rsquo;m amazed how strong his business still seems to be going, given they\u0026rsquo;re an industry that I don\u0026rsquo;t really consider essential. Still, more work is fine, as it helps distract me from the prevailing mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe did two online quiz nights again. I even managed to win one of them! These are a fun distraction (even though there are no prizes!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"watching-lately\"\u003eWatching lately\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSeason 4 of Kim\u0026rsquo;s Convenience came out on Netflix. It continues to be an light, enjoyable and easy to binge show, though the season was only 13 eps long so it was over quickly.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also finished watching Star Trek: Picard S1, via Prime Video.\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt started off slow, and I was worried it would be one of those conspiracy theory shows where the conspiracy part dragged on forever (X-Files may have traumatized me a bit).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBut it wasn\u0026rsquo;t! It started picking up the pace around episode 5 or 6, as the elements behind the conspiracy came back into view.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnd while Picard\u0026rsquo;s new crew seemed so motely and largely unnecessary during the first half, they each ended up with satisfying character arcs and backstories\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cdetails class=\"spoiler\"\u003e\n    \u003csummary\u003e(Spoilers)\u003c/summary\u003e\n    although the reveal Rios\u0026rsquo; history that ties in to the whole synth issue seems awfully convenient.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cp /\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m glad we got to revisit old friends like Seven of Nine, Data, Riker and Troi, and even Hugh, just to see what they\u0026rsquo;ve been up to.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI must admit I felt a great deal of satisfaction when \n\u003cdetails class=\"spoiler\"\u003e\n    \u003csummary\u003e(Spoilers)\u003c/summary\u003e\n    Riker shows up near the end with a whole armada (although realistically it seems logistically impossible for Starfleet to have put such a large number of top-of-the-line ships together so quickly)\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cp /\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eonly 1 new movie watched this week, the first of the Hobbit trilogy.

If you like perusing people\u0026rsquo;s personal sites, this one is always fun to check out, and the current release has a ton of sites!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"gaming\"\u003eGaming\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew Humble\u0026rsquo;s Choice is kind of meh for me. I may pause again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLots of multiplayer gaming again this week. SC2 with my usual gaming group. Armello with my other gaming group. And now even my brothers are asking around if we all have Left 4 Dead 2 installed (but we haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten around to a session yet.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo progress on Megaman LC this week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI purchased Divinity: Original Sin 2 a couple of weeks ago in anticipation of an extended lockdown and finally started it up this week. I played a premade character first to get a feel of things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, this week was the start of spoiler season for the next MTG set, Ikoria. And it\u0026rsquo;s kind of crazy; they\u0026rsquo;re doing a crossover with Toho to feature Godzilla-themed alters for certain cards. There was a leak before that Godzilla would be in the set, which seemed ridiculous, but here we are! I think the set comes out in a week, and it looks pretty sweet, looking forward to playing it on Arena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonal projects: Thinking of finally adding a set of new trivia questions to the \u003ca href=\"https://triviastorm.net/\"\u003etrivia app\u003c/a\u003e. Mostly because our quizzing activity has kind of gone up while in quarantine (including random friends sharing quizzes etc.) A lot of the older questions/answers are kind of low quality too, so I want to implement some kind of weighted random selection so that newer questions are more likely to be picked. But first I need to cobble together a decent data set. Most of it will be movie and TV related I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecent site changes: Not much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s highly probably that our lockdown is going to be extended by at least a month. Sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten around to it yet, but I have looked at a few projects of interest. Preferably it\u0026rsquo;s something I use on an every day basis, so Firefox was one of my candidates since it was my web browser of choice. I decided to try it out last month; I followed the instructions on their site for checking out the source and building the code. I assumed there would be a lot of code, and that the build would be a nontrivial amount of time, but just checking out the source and creating a build took the better part of a day; I believe the build itself took somewhere around 4-6 hours (I didn\u0026rsquo;t really record how long it took, just left it running while I went out and did stuff.) I haven\u0026rsquo;t actually tried hacking on the code itself yet, because with that kind of build time, I don\u0026rsquo;t see how one can be productive. (I decided to run the build a second time as I write this post, maybe it speeds up on successive builds?) It\u0026rsquo;s kind of intimidating to get into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe point is: Drew is right, and modern browsers are massive pieces of software. The comparison to the Apollo or Manhattan programs may even be understated; even though your browser isn\u0026rsquo;t taking people to the moon or testing nuclear weapons, it\u0026rsquo;s probably using way more memory than those programs combined!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhat related: Great post recently over on the Cloudflare blog about the \u003ca href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-history-of-the-url/\"\u003eHistory of the URL\u003c/a\u003e. One can\u0026rsquo;t talk about the history of the URL without talking about the history of the internet of course, and this post let me learn a lot more about those early days of the internet. One of my key takeaways is that a lot of the design decisions around URLs and the early internet made by people like Tim Berners-Lee largely intended the web and the HTTP protocol to be used for serving text-based documents. It\u0026rsquo;s even in the name of the protocol: hyper\u003cem\u003etext\u003c/em\u003e transfer protocol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0026rsquo;s what it was in the early days. People put up documents and web pages, and other people read them and maybe posted comments or other input and that was it. But the modern web (and thus modern web browsers) have tacked on so much functionality onto the presumably text-based protocol. First we added the ability to serve images and videos, then whole applications, formerly the domain of native apps. Just looking at my commonly-used websites, the web browser is used these days for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efull-featured email applications (GMail, ProtonMail)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea complicated social media interface with multiple streams that automatically update (Tweetdeck)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewatching videos, tv shows and movies (Youtube, Netflix)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003einstant messaging with groups and voice chat (Messenger, Discord)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003erss feed reader (Inoreader)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003enote taking and productivity (Trello, Notion)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith systems like Google Stadia, you can even play AAA games via the web browser now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the early days of the internet, all of those would still be native apps running outside the browser but these days we overload the poor HTTP protocol to handle all of these functions. The modern browser these days is almost comparable to an entire operating system (and there are of course already ChromeOS and FirefoxOS to drive home this point).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand full well the benefits of overloading the browser and the HTTP protocol to handle all of these applications, but the scope creep is definitely unsustainable. The high resource usage of modern browsers and web pages even moreso. Imagine a new web browser that cuts off support for the evolving W3C specs at a certain point to compete on performance and stability instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow about one that\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;just a browser\u0026rdquo;, literally just for browsing documents. Maybe one without JavaScript support completely, if you open a page that has SCRIPT tags, it will prompt you to open the OS-level browsers like Firefox or Chrome? Many modern applications could probably work without JavaScript, except users would have to do without many of the bells and whistles we\u0026rsquo;ve come to expect from modern webapps. i.e. clicking \u0026ldquo;Refresh\u0026rdquo; instead of timelines auto-updating, clicking \u0026ldquo;Next\u0026rdquo; instead of having infinite scroll, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe never-ending scope creep reminds me of the never-ending growth pursued by late-stage capitalism; it can\u0026rsquo;t be sustainable in the long run, and maybe we need to start looking for different models other than \u0026ldquo;the browser does everything and will eventually become the OS.\u0026rdquo; (At that point, everything will have been subsumed by JavaScript)!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
