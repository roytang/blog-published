In life, you often come to a crossroads where you have to decide whether you are willing to settle with what you have and are comfortable with, or to go out to seek something better.

If you are too ambitious and always keep moving on looking for the next best thing, you run the risk of never being happy. If you find yourself happy where you are, you run the risk of settling for something less than what you could have had.

We had create a converter that would create the boilerplate java code (I work primarily in servlets/JSP) from the source of the legacy PowerBuilder system which was very challenging since C/S program stuff doesn\u0026rsquo;t always map cleanly to web-based stuff\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnother project had me building a generic workflow engine to support the various modules in a large project.

The size of the project meant our build and deployment processes had to be revamped otherwise the builds would slow to a crawl (at one point it was taking three or more hours to churn out a build, totally unacceptable at the rate we needed to integrate and verify fixes). \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI was also involved in a project that included a web portal that acted as messaging hub for a number of mobile apps.
