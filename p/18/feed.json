TBH sometimes I question why I still follow (most of) the shows. This has been CW\u0026rsquo;s problem with trying to make their superheroes shows more appealing to a mainstream audience, they end putting in a lot of nonsense and drama that often don\u0026rsquo;t make sense or just pad the runtime. It\u0026rsquo;s been a problem since Smallville even. This crossover in particular had a lot of things that felt like they were just there to pad the runtime to make sure we got to have five shows represented by one episode each. I feel like they could have covered what they wanted to cover with just four episodes. The Batwoman episode in particular was pretty weak, and the whole chasing Oliver around the afterlife into purgatory only for him to become the Spectre was pretty weak as well. I loved the Beebo bit in Legends, but that also felt inessential and was there just to pad the time and give the heroes something to do until the Big Bad showed up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe good: All the DC comics fanservice and shoutouts and callbacks and cameos, everything was great and made me smile every time. Personal highlights for me were the \u0026lsquo;89 Batman theme, Kevin Conroy speaking as Batman before appearing as Broken Bruce Wayne, Smallville Clark just yeeting the Kryptonite out of Lex\u0026rsquo;s hands, and of course, surprise Ezta Miller cameo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe execution and adaptation of the Crisis storyline itself is a mixed bag. While understandably they don\u0026rsquo;t have access to the whole multiversal cast of the comic book and had a limited budget, there are still some poorly explained points like why are these seven people the paragons? (Particularly Ryan Choi!). Lex Luthor even showed that the paragons are replaceable - he was not originally the paragon of truth! Couldn\u0026rsquo;t Pariah have sent more people to the Vanishing Point? Still, they did manage to hit the major plot points of CoIE:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003euniverses dying one by one\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eheroes assembled to fight the anti monitor\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eharbinger betrayal\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eshowdown at the dawn of time\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emultiverse reborn as a single universe (kind of\u0026hellip; they walked it back at the end!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rewriting of the Arrowverse as a single, shared universe was probably something they wanted to do as soon as Supergirl got adopted by the CW, but I can\u0026rsquo;t help think of what a mess this does to existing storylines. I suppose we\u0026rsquo;ll see when the shows resume, but there are so many questions raised, with Supergirl and Flash status quos being the ones that suffer the most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll flaws aside, we have to give it up for the CW Arrowverse for doing something that\u0026rsquo;s never been done on TV before. While technically only a crossover between 5 (maybe 6) shows, it also pulls in references to dozens of comics, shows and movies from the whole history of DC comics. It\u0026rsquo;s something that couldn\u0026rsquo;t have been done by a single show like Smallville or Justice League Unlimited, or a small set of films like the DCEU. Make no mistake, this is an accomplishment of Endgame proportions, even though it didn\u0026rsquo;t have Endgame\u0026rsquo;s budget and writing quality. If you\u0026rsquo;d asked me ten years ago, I would never have imagined that a Crisis on Infinite Earths adaptation is something that I would have seen in live action, small screen or no, and I\u0026rsquo;m glad to have been proven wrong!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking for a while about doing regular weeknotes. This is a type of post I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in some blogs where they recap the things that\u0026rsquo;ve happened to them during the past week. I\u0026rsquo;ve actually been doing these privately for a while, and now I\u0026rsquo;m going to try making them public. I think the advantages are obvious in terms of (a) having notes to recall what you were doing over a certain time period; and (b) guaranteeing regular writing output on the blog. One disadvantage over the private weeknotes is that in private I can usually include some more personal items (usually family visits and concerns, stuff like that), that aren\u0026rsquo;t part of what I usually make public. I may end up having both public weeknotes and private weeknotes? We\u0026rsquo;ll see. Another concern is for a lot of the examples of weeknotes I\u0026rsquo;ve seen, they usually write about work-related concerns/issues. I\u0026rsquo;ve never been inclined to be too specific about work-related concerns in public, mostly out of respect for my employers who usually don\u0026rsquo;t expect me to write openly for internal matters. In reality, I expect my weeknotes to lean less towards technical things, and more towards hobby stuff, movies and tv shows watched, and so on. Again, we\u0026rsquo;ll probably figure this out as we go along. Let\u0026rsquo;s get on with it then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast week, I was asked to give a presentation about a certain blockchain platform, mostly on the strength of me being a technical consultant on a previous blockchain project for a previous client. Two things were notable: (a) the audience was composed entirely of Chinese investors, mostly nontechnical people, so I had to have a translator, and I felt like most things I said went over their head, and it was weird being the only one in the room who didn\u0026rsquo;t understand what was going on when they did the Q\u0026amp;A in Chinese; I could tell that the Q\u0026amp;A wasn\u0026rsquo;t technical, and some of it was asking about my background; and (b) For some reason after the speech, the audience members all wanted to take photos with me, in groups, like a celebrity! It all felt a bit surreal. My contact who set up this talk said that happened with the previous project too, they always want to get pictures taken with the technical guy. I now consider this my first public speaking gig, which makes for an interesting story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis week I did my regular backup of my data from third-party services (mostly social media), some notes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFacebook has a decent data export tool, but one thing they don\u0026rsquo;t include is an export of photos I\u0026rsquo;m tagged in, which I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;d like to be able to keep if their service goes kaput or I get suspended or such. I had to use a Chrome extension (and I\u0026rsquo;m a Firefox user!) to export those pictures. The export isn\u0026rsquo;t in a format I\u0026rsquo;m too happy with, but I can worry about that later, maybe even modify the extension for my own preferences.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGoogle\u0026rsquo;s export was the largest as usualy, clocking in at around 38GB total, in 2GB chunks. (There was one whole chunk that was just \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf1JUqYd0ZA\"\u003eone Youtube video\u003c/a\u003e!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of Google, I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to taper off my reliance on them to \u0026ldquo;reduce my global surveillance capitalism footprint\u0026rdquo;, as I said to a friend. So this week I started a \u0026ldquo;great GMail exodus\u0026rdquo; to move my third-party services to another email instead of using my GMail account. I\u0026rsquo;ve been using the GMail as my primary since \u003ca href=\"/2013/09/377902329975930880/\"\u003eYahoo Mail became terrible\u003c/a\u003e, so this has been a bit of a daunting task, involving updating dozens of accounts on various services. (It\u0026rsquo;s scary how many don\u0026rsquo;t even have email confirmation.). I suspect this will take the better part of the year, and even then I\u0026rsquo;d have to be using both old and new emails heavily in parallel to make sure I don\u0026rsquo;t miss any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weeknotes also provide an avenue to log some recent website changes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOne of my regular blog readers (are there more than one?) complained about my paragraphs not being justified so I added in \u003ccode\u003etext-align: justify\u003c/code\u003e in the CSS. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure it looks better though? I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is something bloggers usually do, but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be accused to not be listening to my readership (no matter how small), so we\u0026rsquo;ll give it a try, and I\u0026rsquo;ll roll it back if/when I get annoyed with it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003egeneral revamp of the pages under the \u003ca href=\"/about\"\u003eAbout\u003c/a\u003e section. This includes a stats section. I love stats! As with everything on the site, this is an ongoing renovation. I\u0026rsquo;m generally thinking of adding more \u0026ldquo;static\u0026rdquo; pages to complement the \u0026ldquo;sequential\u0026rdquo; nature of the blog, since some things don\u0026rsquo;t align well with that model.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI added \u003ca href=\"/feed.json\"\u003eJSON feed\u003c/a\u003e support.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI imported \u003ca href=\"/source/miiverse\"\u003eentries from Nintendo\u0026rsquo;s now-defunct MiiVerse service\u003c/a\u003e. A lot of these are just random stamp images my niece posted, but whatever. Maybe someday I\u0026rsquo;ll run out of content from third-party services to import into this site, but not today!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA while back I got thinking about mortality again, and for some reason I decided that if something happened to me, I want this website to outlive me, so I set up on offsite mirror over on \u003ca href=\"https://roytang.github.io/\"\u003eroytang.github.io\u003c/a\u003e, in case I ever just forget to pay for the domain/hosting or something.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter discussing \u003ca href=\"/2020/01/my-top-tens-of-the-2010s/\"\u003emy top tens of the 2010s\u003c/a\u003e with friends last week, I realized I missed so many good movies over the past decade. I am planning on watching one movie per day this year, for a total of 366 movies. New movies, not any I\u0026rsquo;ve seen before. This effort hasn\u0026rsquo;t been going too well, as I\u0026rsquo;m only up to 4 movies so far, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem insurmountable. I\u0026rsquo;ll put up a list somewhere when I feel like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same friends also recommended I watch Kim\u0026rsquo;s Convenience, a sitcom about an Korean immigrant family in the US. I finished all 3 seasons on Netflix already, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty good. The great thing about sitcoms is that they\u0026rsquo;re easy to binge since you can usually watch them while doing something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis coming week I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/TherosBeyondDeath\"\u003enew MTG set\u003c/a\u003e dropping\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eArrowverse Crisis on Infinite Earths finale!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI feel like there\u0026rsquo;s some other new release/event this week I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to that I\u0026rsquo;m forgetting about. Law of surprise!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s it for now. I actually managed to write more than I expected!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I\u0026rsquo;m keeping only one slot per franchise, so I had to choose an MCU movies for this. Runner-ups for this slot were \u003cstrong\u003eGuardians of the Galaxy\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eCaptain America Winter Soldier\u003c/strong\u003e, and individually either one of those movies might be around the same or better than Endgame, but Endgame is the culmination of a decade\u0026rsquo;s worth of movies and gave me the most enjoyment as a comic book fan.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRogue One (2016)\u003c/strong\u003e. I really liked \u003cstrong\u003eThe Force Awakens\u003c/strong\u003e too, but Rogue One is easily the best of the Disney Star Wars era.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInterstellar (2014)\u003c/strong\u003e. The top ten discussions led to an extended debate about some of the science in this movie, all in good fun. It requires some suspension of disbelief is needed, but it\u0026rsquo;s still a pretty good sci-fi movie.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Martian (2015)\u003c/strong\u003e. This one was my favorite sci-fi movie of the decade though, I\u0026rsquo;ll read the book someday.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInception (2010)\u003c/strong\u003e. The fact that this movie spawned so many memes and so many debates and discussions was an indication of how good it was.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018)\u003c/strong\u003e. The MCU was a series of great movies based on comic books, but Spider-Verse was the best movie that really feels like a comic book. (I suppose the comparison is slightly unfair since Spider-Verse has the advantage of being animated!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOne Cut of the Dead (2017)\u003c/strong\u003e. This is a Japanese film I saw at Eiga-sai. If you can overcome the one-inch barrier of subtitles it\u0026rsquo;s easily one of the funniest movies I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in the past decade.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLogan (2017)\u003c/strong\u003e. Easily the best of Fox\u0026rsquo;s X-Men films, and among the top echelon of comic book films overall.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMad Max Fury Road (2015)\u003c/strong\u003e. This was my first Mad Max film, I really enjoyed the performances and the stunts and the ridiculous vehicle scenes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBaby Driver (2017)\u003c/strong\u003e.

I know it started before the 2010s, but this might be appropriate anyway since the show didn\u0026rsquo;t really pick up until the third season. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of other notable comedies of its class that I really enjoyed during the last decade, such as \u003cstrong\u003e30 Rock\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eCommunity\u003c/strong\u003e, but I tip the hat to PnR because I really like the characters of Ben Wyatt and Ron Swanson and Andy Dwyer. (Apparently I really like all the male main characters except for Tom lol)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrooklyn Nine Nine (2013-)\u003c/strong\u003e. B99 is just my kind of ridiculous, similar to PnR, super quotable, and so on.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYoung Justice (2010-)\u003c/strong\u003e. Young Justice is the true successor to the excellent JL/JLU of the 00s, with a deep plot full of conspiracy and betrayal, a large cast of characters\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDaredevil (2015-2018)\u003c/strong\u003e. The Netflix shows had great promise, and Daredevil seasons 1 and 3 were among the best of them. It\u0026rsquo;s too bad that they fell to the IP disputes of their time, but who knows maybe we get to revisit them again some time in the future.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoctor Who (2005-)\u003c/strong\u003e. The DW revival started in the 00s, but I only started watching it in 2012, when Matt Smith was already the Eleventh. There have been some weaker seasons and episodes, but overall I enjoyed the general campiness and sci-ifi silliness of the series.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBlack Mirror (2011-)\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;m actually still not caught up with the latest season, but I have greatly enjoyed the near-future what-ifs posed by this popular show. (It\u0026rsquo;s too bad we are unlikely to heed its warnings!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBreaking Bad (2008-2013)\u003c/strong\u003e. I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s generally regarded as one of the best series of all time right? I haven\u0026rsquo;t even bothered watching El Camino because for me the ending of BB was already prefect.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Orville (2017-)\u003c/strong\u003e. 2017 was a great year for Star Trek (-like) content, with the more serious \u003cstrong\u003eStar Trek Discovery\u003c/strong\u003e and more lighthearted The Orville both debuting. I enjoyed both shows, but the Orville\u0026rsquo;s sci-fi sitcom brought us something a lot more unique.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGame of Thrones (2011-2019)\u003c/strong\u003e. Say what you will about the quality of writing (or lack thereof) for the last couple of seasons, but this was a TV series that got people obsessed and following every episode and arguing about spoilers and forming fan theories, book readers or otherwise. It pretty much defined the decade of TV.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"my-top-ten-games-of-the-2010s\"\u003eMy Top Ten Games of the 2010s\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStarcraft 2 (2010-2015)(PC)\u003c/strong\u003e. Got all 3 parts on release, and still playing it to this day (mostly coop missions - I don\u0026rsquo;t really have the heart for the stress of ladder matches anymore!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Last of Us (2013)(PS3)\u003c/strong\u003e. There are games where you\u0026rsquo;re saddened that you can\u0026rsquo;t play them again for the first time, and the Last of Us was one of the best of those.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017)(WiiU)\u003c/strong\u003e. The defining Zelda of modern times. I loved the exploratory nature similar to the original NES LoZ and the cel-shaded graphics were fantastic. The sequel may yet convince me to get a Switch!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePersona 5 (2017)(PS4)\u003c/strong\u003e. Easily the best JRPG of its era (sorry, Final Fantasy XV!).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFallout: New Vegas (2010)(PC)\u003c/strong\u003e. Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s part of the Fallout franchise had much improved writing and questlines over it\u0026rsquo;s predecessor Fallout 3, good enough for multiple run throughs, and I even managed to finish all the DLCs as well!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Elder Scrolls: Skyrim (2011)(PC)\u003c/strong\u003e. I came late to this series with Oblivion in 2008, but it\u0026rsquo;s one of the few RPGs in this decade that I\u0026rsquo;ve replayed and finished multiple times.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt (2015)(PS4)\u003c/strong\u003e. Easily the best PC RPG of the past decade, and I haven\u0026rsquo;t even played the expansions yet! Runner-up: Divinity Original Sin.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUltra Street Fighter IV (2014)(PS3)\u003c/strong\u003e. Technically, the base game came out in the 00s, but all the later revisions came out in the 2010s. This game started a fighting game resurgence that\u0026rsquo;s going on to this today. I was never super good at it, but I sure played a lot of hours and bought multiple copies of each version that came out even. The next version, SFV, hasn\u0026rsquo;t been as well received, but the franchise and the fighting game resurgence is still going strong up to now.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEternal Card Game (2016)(Multiplat)\u003c/strong\u003e.

Been playing this series since \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/ancient-pc-gaming/\"\u003ethe olden days\u003c/a\u003e! Civ5 brought a pretty big change to the series with one unit per tile, and at 395 hours it\u0026rsquo;s still currently among my most played games on Steam.
