            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI found this great article the other week about \u003ca href=\"https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/\"\u003eWhy You Should Start A Blog Right Now\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole thing is absolutely worth a read, but my favorite part is at the start where he enumerates a list of reasons why he wrote particular posts, and it sent me down a rabbit hole again of evaluating why I write on this blog, and whether it was an endeavor worth continuing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresumably, having a blog has a lot of possible benefits, but the one important for me personally are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eit helps me clarify step through my own thoughts and understand my own thinking\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eit serves as an archive of my state of mind at the time\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eit helps me improve my own writing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresumably, you can also use a blog to advance your career, build a brand/reputation, finding an audience, etc. And those are fine, but for me they are only incidentals, nice-to-haves. Fundamentally, I still always write for myself first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf that\u0026rsquo;s the case, I said to myself, why write in public at all? If those three reasons are the most important, then something like \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/private-writing/\"\u003eprivate writing\u003c/a\u003e should already suffice. I even asked my self the very same question back in 2005 at the end of \u003ca href=\"/2005/11/why-do-i-blog/\"\u003ethis post\u003c/a\u003e, and at that time I had no answer. Today I do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI write in public because we as humans have so much in common, even if we aren\u0026rsquo;t aware of it. And while writing down one\u0026rsquo;s own thoughts or opinions or everyday happenings may seem like it would be entirely uninteresting to the average reader, there will always be some aspect of your stories that will resonate with someone else, somewhere, because of that shared human experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days, everyone can have a platform for writing, whether it\u0026rsquo;s in one of the social media silos or your own site like this one, so the whole \u0026ldquo;writing in public\u0026rdquo; thing isn\u0026rsquo;t so novel anymore. But even in this age, not everyone chooses to participate in social media, not everyone tweets or posts all the time, and that\u0026rsquo;s fine. I can accept that writing in public isn\u0026rsquo;t for everyone. But to have that voice, that ability to express yourself and share your human experience with others, to have stories to share and advice to dispense and objections to raise - to have it and not to exercise it in a meaningful way? For me that seems a waste. And so I write.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, I actually haven\u0026rsquo;t been writing much the past couple of weeks, aside from the \u003ca href=\"/tags/weeknotes\"\u003eweeknotes\u003c/a\u003e. I pumped out a couple of longish and in my mind pretty good posts early in the month (\u003ca href=\"/2020/02/old-web/\"\u003eTales of the Old Web\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"/2020/02/burnout/\"\u003eBurnout\u003c/a\u003e), but after that I found myself struggling to put some new ones together. Somehow in my mind I became trapped in the idea that I needed to have these long, profound, well-researched essays as posts. Browsing blogs like Alexey Guzey\u0026rsquo;s (author of the post linked at the start of this one) certainly hasn\u0026rsquo;t helped - on his \u003ca href=\"https://guzey.com/notes/\"\u003enotes page\u003c/a\u003e he mentions that some of his better posts take upwards of 100+ hours to write.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I kind of fell into the \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/comparison-is-the-thief-of-joy/\"\u003etrap of comparison\u003c/a\u003e and wanted to be writing thesis papers? Except that\u0026rsquo;s not really my style. I can probably churn out some longer pieces if they\u0026rsquo;ve been formulating in my head for a while, but for the most part, my regular blogging consists of thoughts-in-the-moment, a snapshot of where my thinking is at that time, to be built upon and to be evolved later on. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s fine, I think everyone has their own unique writing/blogging style and voice that they need to develop to see what works best for them. Maybe as time goes on, I will tend more towards longer-form posts, but for now I have to listen to my own advice and remember that \u003ca href=\"/2019/01/not-all-posts-have-to-be-profound/\"\u003enot all posts have to be profound\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the past few years or so, and especially since I got interested in this \u003ca href=\"/2019/11/indieweb/\"\u003eIndieweb stuff\u003c/a\u003e I\u0026rsquo;ve also been more on the lookout for interesting blogs to read. Personal blogs, none of that \u0026ldquo;professional blogger\u0026rdquo; crap. There\u0026rsquo;s still a lot of interesting sites out there, a lot of them long-running ones even. With the rise of social media silos, having personal websites and blogs hasn\u0026rsquo;t really gotten mainstream attention, but there\u0026rsquo;s still plenty of people writing out there. I think I\u0026rsquo;ve added more blogs to my RSS reader over the past 12 months than I have over the preceding 5ish years or so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt saddens me a bit that among people of my cohort I am one among very few who are (still) actively blogging. I have a large folder of RSS feeds named \u0026ldquo;people I know\u0026rdquo;, many of them have tried blogging at some point or another, and all of those links are inactive or even inaccessible. Friends: please write more! You can revive your old sites if you like, you don\u0026rsquo;t even have to explain!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still have a bunch of reorganizing my RSS feeds to do, but I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to put enough feeds into a folder called \u0026ldquo;blogroll\u0026rdquo; that seems suitable for sharing, so I created a new \u003ca href=\"/page/blogroll\"\u003eBlogroll page\u003c/a\u003e where you can see some of the blogs I follow. Very few of these are people I know IRL, mostly I just stumbled upon their blogs via some method or other. Many of them are tech-related though not all of them are. All are reasonably active. I thought about tagging or categorizing them somehow, but it\u0026rsquo;s rude to put people into boxes, so maybe it\u0026rsquo;s rude to do that for their websites too, just let people be people and let blogs be blogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to maintain an older blogroll back in the day, but it seems that has already been lost to the dustbin of history, so this one is brand new and built from scratch. (If I find the older one, I might put it on that page too as a record of history.) As with many other things on the site, the blogroll is perpetually under renovation, so if you find (or have) a personal blog that you think I might find interesting, feel free to tell me about it and maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll add it there!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Technical note: The blogroll listing is automatically imported from a JSON-formatted OPML file. I got the idea from \u003ca href=\"https://jlelse.blog/dev/auto-blogroll-hugo/\"\u003ethis post by jlelse\u003c/a\u003e, and coincidentally he is also on the blogroll.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: I\u0026rsquo;m having trouble writing long-form posts recently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso me: Hey, I wrote a thousand words on blogging without thinking about it!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

To get to the venue, I found myself walking through the old neighborhood again, the one where I grew up. It\u0026rsquo;s been a while since \u003ca href=\"/2013/02/unscheduled-trip-down-memory-lane/\"\u003ethe last time\u003c/a\u003e. Unlike last time where I only had a quick unscheduled glance, this time I went out of my way to walk down a few streets in the area, since I had the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe streets I walked were narrower and shorter than I remember - I guess in my head I still see them through a ten-year-old\u0026rsquo;s eyes. I recognize many of the houses I walk past, neighbors we never really knew. But I recognized their plants! One house still had a lot of greenery adorning their facade, same as I remember it. In the last post I wrote that our old lot had been replaced by three townhouses, but this time when I passed by I saw there were four identical ones side-by-side, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell which three replaced my grandmother\u0026rsquo;s house. Was the fourth one added later, or did I simply miss it the last time I was here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was also a KFC now along Anonas, to my left as I emerged from our old street. That used to be some kind of car repair complex, I think? Memories are hazy. I think to myself: \u0026ldquo;there should be a Google Maps version of the Wayback Machine, showing us what the streets looked like some time ago, for nostalgia\u0026rsquo;s sake.\u0026rdquo; I continue walking and take a break at a 7-11 across the street from \u003ca href=\"/2020/02/1228281070300299264/\"\u003ethe old bakery\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(As for the quiz, we won handily, though I suggested that dominating so much might discourage future quizzes in the same area. Eh, whatever.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/lists/2020/movies/\"\u003eThree movies watched this week\u003c/a\u003e, all of them very good. Aside from that, I\u0026rsquo;ve also been rewatching all of Rick and Morty. It\u0026rsquo;s a fun rewatch, but I\u0026rsquo;m mostly doing it because it\u0026rsquo;s a topic for a quiz next week, and it can be a very challenging show for that purpose, because most episodes are filled wall-to-wall with zany antics, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to tell what needs to be remembered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finished \u003cstrong\u003eTales of Berseria\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"/2020/02/1228114501179977730/\"\u003elast Friday\u003c/a\u003e! Well, the main story at least. I plan to still go for the platinum, though that\u0026rsquo;ll probably take quite a bit longer. So the blog post/review will have to wait a bit. I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m already way over the typical hours for the first run though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had one of my regular checkups this week. Bloodwork all came back good, but the annoying thing was mild coughs/cold I was experiencing since the start of the week. Probably exacerbated by the cold nights. Now is not a good time to be remotely Chinese looking and coughing/sneezing in public! My doctor prescribed a bunch of things, including some nasal spray and a pill I have to dissolve in a glass of water. Hopefully they help; the cold seems to have receded by now, but I still have the coughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSite changes this week:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003enot much in terms of blog posts last week. I did have some things in mind, just not the time or energy to sit down and fire one out\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edid some work on the import backend for tweets, pockets links, etc. Mostly a revamp needed for future enhancements that I want. Fixed some bugs. Imported links from pocket are automatically shared to Mastodon now.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003estarted work on the planned redesign. Lots of things to think about re: layouts and I\u0026rsquo;ll probably be trying out some CSS things. Referencing a number of blogs whose layout I like. I don\u0026rsquo;t wanna rush it, so it may take a while. I previously said it would be limited to the home page, but looks like scope is creeping up!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis week I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI have some actual work lined up.

They\u0026rsquo;ve even been \u003ca href=\"https://www.asiatimes.com/2020/02/opinion/the-death-of-a-chinese-whistleblower/\"\u003ecensoring news about the death of a doctor that sounded the alarm about the disease early on\u003c/a\u003e.

Well, it was a second place (i.e. first loser) finish, which meant we get to choose 2/3rds of the categories for the next league quiz, so hopefully we get the crown back in two weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis week I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eanother quiz night, in QC this time!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eworking on some more changes/fixes/improvements to my recent personal project and the backend for this blog.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIn the middle of 2015, after 12ish years of working at the same company, I said to myself \u0026ldquo;I think I\u0026rsquo;m burnt out.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember that after a few days of ruminating over it I finally decided and said out loud to myself \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s it, I\u0026rsquo;m done.\u0026rdquo; By the end of the year I had left the company. I didn\u0026rsquo;t write about the burnout then, out of respect for my former employer. But it\u0026rsquo;s been a while, I think the time has come to write about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do I know I was burnt out? I don\u0026rsquo;t believe there is any generally accepted consensus of symptoms for burnout, but I had a good set of indicators:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eexhaustion, both physical and mental. More and more often I found myself simply \u003ca href=\"/2016/08/some-days-you-are-tired/\"\u003etired\u003c/a\u003e of everything.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efrustration with all the problems at work and the projects I was assigned to, frustration that we kept running into the same issues again and again (mostly relating to scheduling and deadlines and resources), and frustration that any concerns I raised were not being addressed\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethinking about work all the time, even on my off hours I would be mentally considered the open Jira tickets, etc\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea feeling of helplessness in the face of overwhelming and seemingly never-ending project issues, re:scheduling, resources, quality, and so on\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea general feeling that that the effort I was putting in wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth it or wasn\u0026rsquo;t appreciated as much as I\u0026rsquo;d have liked\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003egeneral lack of free time, and even when there was free time, lack of energy to pursue anything productive\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epermanently broken sleep cycle (a problem I still struggle with to this day)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe work at my former employer had always been\u0026hellip; challenging, to say the least. Overtime was not uncommon, and many people often quit citing the heavy workload. And yet I was generally happy/content working there for the better part of a decade. I kind of enjoyed and thrived in the environment most of the time, especially when facing technical challenges. Things got worse for me personally starting around 2014ish I think. There were a variety of challenges during this time, some of them due to the company/environment and some due to my own personal shortcomings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnvironment challenges:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea large project with constantly changing requirements and overly aggressive schedules (due to sales/marketing push) and almost continuous crunch.

I realize this doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound like a negative, but it\u0026rsquo;d kind of a double-edged sword in that I take my duties as an employee very seriously and will sometimes sacrifice my own well-being if I think it is needed. For the longest time, one of \u003ca href=\"/2012/08/232395423602573312/\"\u003emy favorite quotes has been\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Death is lighter than a feather, but Duty is heavier than a mountain” - Japanese proverb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find this quote symptomatic of the \u0026ldquo;hustle culture\u0026rdquo; that tends to lead to burnout. That\u0026rsquo;s probably a topic for another time, but the gist of it is that most companies and projects are a never-ending well of work that needs to be done, so much so that oftentimes the reward for good work is often more work. i.e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2019/10/1185221831990464513/\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;The price for being the best is always having to be the best\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis \u0026ldquo;sense of duty\u0026rdquo; was so strong that even when I realized I was burning out, I still gave half a year\u0026rsquo;s notice for resignation, because I at least wanted to make sure everything was fine before I left. (Spoilers: it would take them a couple more years to actually finish the project). Someone reminded me recently that I expressed regret at leaving \u0026ldquo;in wartime\u0026rdquo; since the project got even further delayed and many of the issues were unresolved at that time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erelated to the above, I also had a strong sense of pride. I considered myself very good at my job (justifiably so, based on annual reviews etc) and somehow had the mentality that I needed to be able to carry the weight of the project by myself. Whenever there was a resource or scheduling problem, one of my first instincts was to be to offer to take on the needed load myself, no matter how busy I already was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhat related to the above, but I also had (and often still have) an obsessive-compulsive need to read and reply to all emails and messages and notifications immediately, even outside of work hours\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecoupled with my strong sense of duty is a lack of ability to say no. As an example, for some reason even after I realized I was burnt out and notified the company I was leaving, I agreed to go live in another country on-site for three months. While it was good to experience another country, the work-life balance while I was there was even worse because the time zone problem still existed (except in reverse, i.e. the dev team was now on the other end of the world), and now I became a bottleneck (since I was one of the only two people on-site) and had to dedicate more time to bridging the gap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs noted, I think many of these issues existed even before, but perhaps most of them were exacerbated by the fact that we now had to provide support across two time zones seven hours apart. That really took a toll on my work-life balance. Looking back at my emails during that period, I would often be replying late into the night or even early in the morning. I think it was really a question of energy and time being in short supply. I almost burnt myself out again in 2018, but at least I had the sense to recognize it faster and to step back as needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must point out that I bear no ill will towards my former employer or the people who worked there. There was a lot of room for improvement but everyone was just trying the best with what they were given. And I share some of the blame since I was kind of in a leadership position \u0026ndash; I should have pushed harder to make things better for everyone involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow to avoid burnout:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eset reasonable boundaries between work time and personal time. Having a strong sense of duty is probably fine, as long as you know where that ends and to prioritize your own well-being as needed. Guard your free time zealously. As much as possible, don\u0026rsquo;t accept calls/messages outside of agreed upon work hours. The occasional exception for an emergency is probably fine, but don\u0026rsquo;t let it become a regular thing. Having well-defined boundaries allows your brain to avoid overlaps - if you\u0026rsquo;re at home, you should get used to not thinking about work.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eunderstand your own value and your own limits. Having a good understanding of what you bring to the team and the limits of your own ability and capacity means you can more effectively allocate your time and energy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ealways be aware of the employee-employer relationship. It\u0026rsquo;s okay to have a good working relationship with your superiors and coworkers and even to be friends with them, but never lose sight of the fact that to the employer, you are an employee. You aren\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;family\u0026rdquo; no matter what the company says. You are being paid to do a job, and that job has limits. You don\u0026rsquo;t owe the company your personal time or your absolute loyalty. It\u0026rsquo;s a capitalist enterprise, not a nation. Remember that in the end, the company will need to look out for itself (especially for publicly-traded companies), so you will need to look out for yourself as well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003elearn to say no. This is coupled with the first two points above. If you know what your boundaries are and what your limits are, it will become easier to say \u0026ldquo;No\u0026rdquo; to unreasonable requests. And remember that your personal time is your own, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to defend or explain why you don\u0026rsquo;t want to work on weekends or such\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eregularly reflect on how things are going. Check your energy levels to make sure they aren\u0026rsquo;t constantly low and that you\u0026rsquo;re getting enough recharge time. If you think are starting to burn out, pull back, take some time off, and reassess how to move forward. Assess also how the company is addressing your concerns, and if they aren\u0026rsquo;t or are unwilling to do so, consider whether it may be time to move on.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor people in leadership/management positions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eunderstand the value and capabilities of your team and build them up. One of the best things about working in larger companies/projects/teams is that you have other people to back you up, to support you and handle things when you reach your limits. Understanding both your own limits and the team\u0026rsquo;s limits allow you to better allocate tasks to avoid burnout.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eit isn\u0026rsquo;t sufficient to simply be asking your team members \u0026ldquo;Are you still ok?\u0026rdquo;, because if they\u0026rsquo;re anything like me, they may not be aware that they are starting to burn out already. Pay attention to how they are performing and how much time, effort and energy they are putting them in, and don\u0026rsquo;t push them unnecessarily.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eif your team members raise a concern, make sure to not only listen but to make them know what is being done to address their concerns. Unaddressed problems lead to frustration.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, software development is a demanding industry, and it tends to attract people like me - industrious people who enjoy and take pride in their work. (Hence the famous quote about laziness, impatience and hubris.) Add to that the common difficulties in estimation, scheduling and planning, and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to understand why burnout is rampant in this industry. All the more reason for everyone involved to be aware of the risks of burnout and how to avoid it, and perhaps to somehow help reshape the industry to better avoid it.\u003c/p\u003e",
