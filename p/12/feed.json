I haven\u0026rsquo;t found much need to supplement the public weeknotes with private ones over the year, but that\u0026rsquo;s basically because (a) my other tracking systems have evolved this year to better capture more data, so less review was actually needed; and (b) this silly pandemic keeping me at home most of the year means there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much to report most of the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn short, I\u0026rsquo;ll be carrying the weeknotes practice into 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the past week, it was of course Christmas week, which went about as expected.

Well, there\u0026rsquo;s finally a post-Brexit trade deal, and Trump seems to be screwing over everybody as expected, and there\u0026rsquo;s a new Covid19 variant, and our government is still being dumb.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThis was the year when a lot of Christmas traditions were broken, due to the pandemic. There are \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/xmas-ph/\"\u003ecultural/country-specific Christmas traditions\u003c/a\u003e of course, but usually each person or family also has their own personal traditions that they do every Christmas. Here are some of mine:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eChristmas Eve dinner, or as it\u0026rsquo;s popularly known here in the Philippines, \u003ca href=\"/tags/nochebuena\"\u003enoche buena\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGrowing up, our immediate family/household unit usually celebrates Christmas Eve with a late noche buena, an extra meal that happened after dinner and starting at around midnight. Then we\u0026rsquo;d open presents, usually with one of the uncles taking the role of \u0026ldquo;Santa Claus\u0026rdquo; and giving out gifts. And as kids, it was one night of the year where we were allowed to stay up late and play with the presents for a while. As we grew older, this usually meant playing video games for a few hours in the early morning!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTypical noche buena food: some kind of bread, some kind of ham, some quezo de bola, some kind of pasta. Sometimes there\u0026rsquo;s other stuff too like barbecue or soup, but those seem to be the mainstays.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe kept this tradition when we moved out of my grandparents\u0026rsquo; house. This tradition only started changing recently, when my brothers all got married and moved out in the past 10 years. They still come to visit with the kids on Christmas eve, but we couldn\u0026rsquo;t have the noche buena very late anymore, because they would need to drive back home, and some of the kids had early bedtimes. So the noche buena kind of got merged into the Christmas dinner.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUsually we\u0026rsquo;d all be dressed in red and take a family photo in front of the Christmas tree\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThis year, as you can imagine, we couldn\u0026rsquo;t have that dinner together. Instead, my brothers came out on the morning of the 24th and we exchanged presents outdoors. It was the first time for the folks to see their grandkids in person a long while! We still had noche buena early (during dinner time), despite there only being three of us at home to celebrate.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMy mother\u0026rsquo;s side extended family usually has a reunion on Christmas day itself, the one time of the year we all get together.\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;re talking a few dozen people (best estimate, the number grew a lot over the years, as some of my cousins were very, um, productive). When we used to live at my grandparents\u0026rsquo; house, it was easy, because everyone else came to us. When that house was sold, one of my other uncles/aunts/cousins usually hosted (our house was way too small), but that usually involved driving out to some far corner of the Metro. Far for us, at least. (Driving across the Metro on Christmas day was tough, and there were some years where some of us had to get a taxi, that always took forever).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFor the get-together itself, there\u0026rsquo;s usually dinner, then some kind of party games or some cousins might be asked to perform, then presents exchange. We used to do the Santa Claus thing where one person stands in front of the tree and goes through the presents one by one and calls them out and the recipient comes forward and so on. But this didn\u0026rsquo;t really scale as the extended family grew and grew. Later on, the present exchange became more \u0026ldquo;underground\u0026rdquo;, with each household going around giving gifts to the others throughout the night.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA tradition started by my grandfather was the \u0026ldquo;pasabog\u0026rdquo; where there would be a surprise throwing of money (usually coins or small bills) over the party area and everyone scrambled to grab some. My uncles carried on this tradition when my grandfather passed away, and in recent years my dad and I have been doing the pasabog ourselves (since at this point all of my uncles have passed away as well).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe do a big family photo in this gathering too, but it\u0026rsquo;s usually much more challenging since there\u0026rsquo;s way more people.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eObviously this year, the get together could not happen.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI was also thinking the other day about how the people we greet on Christmas Eve/Day has evolved with technology.\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen I was young, we could only greet those people in our immediate household and sometimes the neighbors\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen cellphones became popular, people greeted each other through those. Usually people had limited SMS, so they\u0026rsquo;d only pick and choose who they could greet. And during those days in particular, network congestion was so bad, it would sometimes be hours before your messages got through. I got a cellphone late and was never much into SMS, so this period didn\u0026rsquo;t last long for me.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWith the ubiquity of instant messaging these days, people just send greetings online, mostly to group chats and some to specific people (who are probably more \u0026ldquo;special\u0026rdquo; for you\u0026rdquo;). At least this is one tradition the pandemic can\u0026rsquo;t take away.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully, our government manages to get its act together and get this pandemic under control as soon as possible, so we can resume our Christmas traditions next year!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

My brothers and I have been trying to hash out how to have the usual holiday gift exchange among the four households. In theory nobody will be coming inside the house, just parking outside and dropping off and picking up gifts, but they need to coordinate since they also need to exchange gifts with each other. They\u0026rsquo;re trying to see if they can synchronize their visits so that the exchanges can happen, we\u0026rsquo;ll see if that works out. Meanwhile, the usual family and extended family reunions will probably happen on Zoom, like many of my friends\u0026rsquo; recent company Christmas parties. Hopefully they go smoothly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of the pandemic and the holiday, cases continue to rise locally. This trend will probably carry on into January as a result of holiday gatherings. In pandemic related government screwups recently:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003erequiring face shields everywhere in public, even for joggers or bikers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea pilot for face to face classes in January because the education secretary says they are more likely to get infected at home anyway\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eapparently we could have had vaccines as early as the first quarter of 2021, but the health secretary dropped the ball during negotiations with pfizer\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGaming\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI guess they were working with some sort of backlog due to the holiday sales, but my local gaming store took an entire week to ship me my copy of Fire Emblem Fates. It finally arrived last Friday so yay! I haven\u0026rsquo;t started playing yet, beyond opening the package and checking that the cartridge works.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInstead this week, I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing a bit of achievement hunting in Civilization VI, since a new patch with balance updates dropped last week. I also tried resuming my Wasteland 2 game. It took me a while to get my bearings, but the game just seems so fiddly, I have a hard time getting into it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMTG: Kaldheim previews started this week! We don\u0026rsquo;t get any more until January though.

Discovery was so-so, but wow, the Mandalorian. What a fantastic season finale. I watched it around half a day after the episode dropped and I was very happy I wasn\u0026rsquo;t spoiled by the internet. The team behind the show are doing a great job with the Star Wars franchise. After the problematic sequel trilogy (which I still enjoyed), maybe the real future of the franchise is on episodic TV. Looking forward to all the new Star Wars content next year.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNew background binge watching: There\u0026rsquo;s new episodes of Jeopardy on Netflix!

Additionally, one of my old external hard drives had also started getting errors, so I ordered and got a new 1tb one, and spent some time trying to move old backup files across from the old drive to the new one. It was annoying because I couldn\u0026rsquo;t play any games that use a controller while this was happening, for fear of disturbing the long file transfers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m kind of looking forward to doing my year in review blog post for this strange and accursed year.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Though I was recently reminded of one particular incident that was a bit cringey for me personally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a bit more than 10 years ago I think. I was usually assigned to mentor new hires, which means fresh graduates who usually needed guidance with a Java (which was our primary programming language at that time) and with our in-house web framework, which could be a bit challenging to work with. That means a lot of my days are spent answering questions or guiding newbies through more complicated tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe incident I remember was with one particular newbie. After they completed a particular task, they asked me to check their work and everything was fine. I don\u0026rsquo;t have the actual wording of what I said but recall making an offhand in-jest remark congratulating them on getting an entire thing done with zero questions and no actual issues. I remember thinking almost immediately afterwards that it was a terrible thing to say since it implies that asking questions might be frowned upon. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of like the difference between just saying \u0026ldquo;Good job\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Good job, you didn\u0026rsquo;t screw this one up!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI might have been overthinking it a bit back then as I don\u0026rsquo;t remember any actual negative reaction to that particular remark. That\u0026rsquo;s not really a good metric though, especially when you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with newbies on their first job. There\u0026rsquo;s power dynamics to consider, so they may not think it appropriate to complain even if something makes them feel bad or uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a mentor, it\u0026rsquo;s important to actually encourage the mentees to ask questions when things are unclear or to raise conceerns when there are problems. It\u0026rsquo;s an essential communication skill that all developers (maybe arguably all people) should have. And it\u0026rsquo;s not enough to say \u0026ldquo;Hey, you can ask me questions any time\u0026rdquo;, but you also have to reflect that openness in your actions, your feedback, and your comments.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I\u0026rsquo;m hoping things clear up by mid next year for us here, but I\u0026rsquo;m not optimistic about it. It would be really sad if the pandemic restrictions reach next year\u0026rsquo;s holiday season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that people here seem to realize there\u0026rsquo;s still a pandemic going on, if pictures coming out of Divisoria are any indication. I get that not everyone has access to online shopping, but are there no other options for holiday gift shopping than walking through such dense crowds? This may be one instance where our generous gift-giving culture is bad for us, since people are still out trying to buy gifts when the pandemic is a perfectly good excuse for scaling back on the shopping. Capitalism ho!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe saddest part of this pandemic for me has that my brothers and their families can\u0026rsquo;t come over to visit, which means my parents don\u0026rsquo;t get to see their grandkids (and I don\u0026rsquo;t get to see the pamangkins). Sometimes we push back a bit on that envelope, but it\u0026rsquo;ll be a while before we all really get to see each other and enjoy company in person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGaming\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI managed to finish Batman Arkham Knight! The main story at least. Achievement completion seems unlikely, given the multiplayer achievements, and even some of the single-player ones seem a bit too challenging. I was able to enjoy the game despite the graphical issues I encountered early on. Lowering the settings helped a lot I think, though things still weren\u0026rsquo;t 100% good. I really take to these style of games where there\u0026rsquo;s an open world and you have a lot of things to collect and such.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI ordered Fire Emblem Fates for the Switch yesterday!

I think the show holds up better than some of its contemporaries such as How I Met Your Mother. I know the geek portrayals can be a bit exaggerated or patronizing, so a lot of geeks don\u0026rsquo;t like it, but for me it\u0026rsquo;s fine. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of doing a bad comic book movie marathon sometime this month, covering the ones I didn\u0026rsquo;t bother watching, stuff like Ben Affleck Daredevil, Michael B Jordan Fantastic Four, and the recently released New Mutants.

Improvements to that app\u0026rsquo;s feature set meant I could also take the time to do some digital housekeeping. That mostly means digging into a whole bunch old files to process their contents and possibly extract them the tracking app. Also regular maintenance things like backing up what needs backing up, deleting what can be deleted. It feels appropriate as a near-year-end activity to be going through junk from the past.

I believe I\u0026rsquo;ve had  my Steam copy for years now, well before I finished Arkham Knight, and  never got around to it. It\u0026rsquo;s not a particularly new game, so I figured  my five-year old PC could handle it fine. However I\u0026rsquo;m experiencing graphical  slowdowns, especially when dealing with bug groups of enemies. I\u0026rsquo;ve  already tried turning the graphics down to minimum settings, but still  experiencing some issues. My suspicion is that it may have something to  do with me currently using an AMD graphics card (the game does say it\u0026rsquo;s  optimized for NVidia when starting up). So maybe I should have gotten  around to it before my old GeForce card started having trouble. It\u0026rsquo;s  still mostly tolerable, and I did manage to get through some of the  quick-time event sections despite framerate drops. I\u0026rsquo;ll stick with it a  bit to see if I can crawl my way to the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatching Lately:\u003c/strong\u003e Finished the binge watch of \u003ca href=\"/2020/12/perfect-strangers/\"\u003ePerfect Strangers\u003c/a\u003e, and have caught up with Mandalorian and Discovery. I also blazed through S4 of My Hero Academia. I\u0026rsquo;d read the manga already, so just skipped ahead through the boring parts. I kind of want them to catch up with the current manga arc, as I want to see some of the more recent fights animated, but I guess that\u0026rsquo;s going to take a while.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eWhile digging through some old stuff recently I found a copy of the late 80s/early 90s US sitcom \u003cem\u003ePerfect Strangers\u003c/em\u003e and decided to binge through all 8 seasons of it (really more like 6 and a half, since seasons 1 and 8 were an abridged 6 episodes each).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grew up watching this series, on live tv even, before we had cable or Netflix or anything like that. During the binge-watch I remember a good number of the episodes from the first season all the way up to the end of season 7, which implies almost all of it was broadcast on local TV, kind of a rarity I think? Of course, given the primitive nature of broadcast tv (i.e. needing to be there at the time the show is on), a lot of the episodes were new to me too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar, the premise of the show is simple: Balki Bartokomous, an immigrant from the small Mediterannean island-nation of Mypos, comes to America to pursue his dreams and somehow convinces his distant-cousin-that-he-has-never-seen-before Larry Appleton, who himself has just moved to the windy city of Chicago, to take him in and let him live with him. The series largely relies on the contrast between the two leads for its humor: Balki is portrayed as a naive, unassuming foreigner, honest and open and prone to hugging strangers, while \u0026ldquo;Cousin Larry\u0026rdquo; sees himself as this street-wise, savvy guardian who must introduce Balki to the realities of modern American life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it turns out, Larry is actually terribly neurotic, deceptive and manipulative, even to his closest friends. He often gives Balki advice that gets both of them into trouble; he typically overreacts to the situations they find themselves in; he is prone to being taken over by his greed when the opportunity presents itself. And when he does get the two of them into some trouble, his first instinct to try to lie and cheat his way out of the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember enjoying the series a lot when I was young, and have a fond recollection especially of the theme song, which I consider one of the best TV show theme songs of all time:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"\u003e\n  \u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8vbnLYROCj8\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, the show isn\u0026rsquo;t particularly deep, as can easily be seen during a binge-watch. Most episodes will have a plot along the lines of:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBalki says/does something naive\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLarry says \u0026ldquo;Balki, Balki, Balki\u0026rdquo; and gives some advice or some other action that gets them into trouble\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehijinks ensue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOptionally: Larry overreacts to the hijinks and lies or something getting them into even deeper trouble.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;d say Larry is at fault maybe 80% of the time, though he does have some good/redeeming moments too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe show\u0026rsquo;s overall story arc follow the two cousins as they grow both in terms of careers and relationships; they start out working as clerks in a used furniture store, and later move on to jobs at the presitigious Chicago Chronicle. Along the way, they form relationships with a pair of flight attendants (with decidedely 80s hair) who live in their apartment building, whom they eventually marry and have kids with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat last part is a bit problematic for me, as I feel like Larry\u0026rsquo;s fiancee and eventual wife Jennifer deserves much better; Larry constantly lies to her and have put their group in mortal danger more than once. Although, once they are married, Jennifer does exhibit many of the same neurotic behaviors Larry has, including trying to lie her way out of bad situations, so maybe they deserved each other. I would guess this character arc is largely a product of its time, a time when society (and thus TV shows) focused on values such as building a career and a stable relationship and eventually a family (as opposed to the Friends era, where the characters would often be jumping across relationships constantly.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing I did learn during this binge-watch run (and the accompanying Wikipedia check) is that \u003cem\u003ePerfect Strangers\u003c/em\u003e spawned a spin-off show, \u003cem\u003eFamily Matters\u003c/em\u003e, that went on to be one of the longest-running shows on US tv. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that show ever aired on local tv.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, it was a reasonable binge-watch, good enough for watching in the background while doing other stuff. My nostalgia is not damaged, I never assumed it was a deep show. The best part remains the theme song, which I still somehow feel compelled to sing out loud with each episode.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "While digging through some old stuff recently I found a copy of the late 80s/early 90s US sitcom Perfect Strangers and decided to binge through all 8 seasons of it (really more like 6 and a half, since seasons 1 and 8 were an abridged 6 episodes each).\nI grew up watching this series, on live tv even, before we had cable or Netflix or anything like that. During the binge-watch I remember a good number of the episodes from the first season all the way up to the end of season 7, which implies almost all of it was broadcast on local TV, kind of a rarity I think?",
