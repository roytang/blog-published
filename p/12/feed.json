Haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten around to it yet, but I have looked at a few projects of interest. Preferably it\u0026rsquo;s something I use on an every day basis, so Firefox was one of my candidates since it was my web browser of choice. I decided to try it out last month; I followed the instructions on their site for checking out the source and building the code. I assumed there would be a lot of code, and that the build would be a nontrivial amount of time, but just checking out the source and creating a build took the better part of a day; I believe the build itself took somewhere around 4-6 hours (I didn\u0026rsquo;t really record how long it took, just left it running while I went out and did stuff.) I haven\u0026rsquo;t actually tried hacking on the code itself yet, because with that kind of build time, I don\u0026rsquo;t see how one can be productive. (I decided to run the build a second time as I write this post, maybe it speeds up on successive builds?) It\u0026rsquo;s kind of intimidating to get into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe point is: Drew is right, and modern browsers are massive pieces of software. The comparison to the Apollo or Manhattan programs may even be understated; even though your browser isn\u0026rsquo;t taking people to the moon or testing nuclear weapons, it\u0026rsquo;s probably using way more memory than those programs combined!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhat related: Great post recently over on the Cloudflare blog about the \u003ca href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-history-of-the-url/\"\u003eHistory of the URL\u003c/a\u003e. One can\u0026rsquo;t talk about the history of the URL without talking about the history of the internet of course, and this post let me learn a lot more about those early days of the internet. One of my key takeaways is that a lot of the design decisions around URLs and the early internet made by people like Tim Berners-Lee largely intended the web and the HTTP protocol to be used for serving text-based documents. It\u0026rsquo;s even in the name of the protocol: hyper\u003cem\u003etext\u003c/em\u003e transfer protocol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0026rsquo;s what it was in the early days. People put up documents and web pages, and other people read them and maybe posted comments or other input and that was it. But the modern web (and thus modern web browsers) have tacked on so much functionality onto the presumably text-based protocol. First we added the ability to serve images and videos, then whole applications, formerly the domain of native apps. Just looking at my commonly-used websites, the web browser is used these days for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efull-featured email applications (GMail, ProtonMail)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea complicated social media interface with multiple streams that automatically update (Tweetdeck)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewatching videos, tv shows and movies (Youtube, Netflix)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003einstant messaging with groups and voice chat (Messenger, Discord)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003erss feed reader (Inoreader)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003enote taking and productivity (Trello, Notion)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith systems like Google Stadia, you can even play AAA games via the web browser now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the early days of the internet, all of those would still be native apps running outside the browser but these days we overload the poor HTTP protocol to handle all of these functions. The modern browser these days is almost comparable to an entire operating system (and there are of course already ChromeOS and FirefoxOS to drive home this point).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand full well the benefits of overloading the browser and the HTTP protocol to handle all of these applications, but the scope creep is definitely unsustainable. The high resource usage of modern browsers and web pages even moreso. Imagine a new web browser that cuts off support for the evolving W3C specs at a certain point to compete on performance and stability instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow about one that\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;just a browser\u0026rdquo;, literally just for browsing documents. Maybe one without JavaScript support completely, if you open a page that has SCRIPT tags, it will prompt you to open the OS-level browsers like Firefox or Chrome? Many modern applications could probably work without JavaScript, except users would have to do without many of the bells and whistles we\u0026rsquo;ve come to expect from modern webapps. i.e. clicking \u0026ldquo;Refresh\u0026rdquo; instead of timelines auto-updating, clicking \u0026ldquo;Next\u0026rdquo; instead of having infinite scroll, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe never-ending scope creep reminds me of the never-ending growth pursued by late-stage capitalism; it can\u0026rsquo;t be sustainable in the long run, and maybe we need to start looking for different models other than \u0026ldquo;the browser does everything and will eventually become the OS.\u0026rdquo; (At that point, everything will have been subsumed by JavaScript)!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

But it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to find the energy to be productive about anything. It\u0026rsquo;s like the whole pandemic situation manifests as a lingering ball of anxiety in the back of my head. My parents are prayerful and hopeful that things get resolved quickly, but I\u0026rsquo;m not super optimistic - I think it\u0026rsquo;s likely to go long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy \u003ca href=\"/2020/03/covid19/\"\u003eCOVID19 Diary\u003c/a\u003e is still ongoing if you want more day-to-day thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen thinking about how the world is handling this pandemic, the words of one of my boardgame friends comes to mind:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Everyone\u0026rsquo;s playing like idiots!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s my excuse anyway, for no other posts this week. I did have some ideas for posts, but not the energy or clarity to write them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of my time this week went into:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003econsulting work (the show must go on)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003egaming: I started playing Stellaris again. New build has much better late game performance. I tried playing a Hive Mind race this time, and had a false start because apparently completing the Old Gods event and becoming spiritual breaks the hive mind. Second attempt I made it to a late game, waiting for final crisis to emerge. If I get impatient I\u0026rsquo;ll just conquer everyone else!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003egaming: friends who are also stuck at home means we\u0026rsquo;re trying more multiplayer stuff as well. Aside from the usual SC2, we\u0026rsquo;ve been doing Orcs Must Die 2 and are planning to do Left 4 Dead 2 and/or Monaco. (Shades of 5-10 years ago!).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003egaming: In lieu of this month\u0026rsquo;s Humble Choice, I got the bottom tier of Humble\u0026rsquo;s current Capcom bundle, mostly for Megaman Legacy Collection. I tried playing Megaman 1 for a bit, but it\u0026rsquo;s much harder than I remember and my hands are not so used to this controller stress and got tired quickly. Still, I might stream this in the future.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewatching: I took the opportunity to clear out the backlog of Jeopardy eps on Netflix (new sets not as good as the previous ones), and also finished up the back half of The Expanse S3. The Expanse still pretty good, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I like how Holden is becoming some kind of central messiah figure because of his connection to Miller. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how S4 goes I guess.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eside note: one would assume I would take this time to add some more entries to the \u003ca href=\"/page/lists/2020/movies/\"\u003e2020 movies list\u003c/a\u003e, but I really haven\u0026rsquo;t felt like it at all.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003equiz: in lieu of our regular quiz nights, two of our friendly quiz providers decided to try hosting online quizzes this week! They had different formats; one was via Zoom with people showing whiteboards at their cameras, while another was via Facebook Live with answers in the comments. Both had technical issues, but were fun nonetheless. A welcome respite and a little bit of online community interaction in these dark times.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonal projects: Minor movement and bug fixes on one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso took some time to clean up some stuff both physically (around the house) and digitally. The digital part mostly involves moving some of my notes off the online platforms I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying lately and into plain text files in Dropbox. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably write about those online platforms I tried and why I didn\u0026rsquo;t think they worked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSite changes this week: Not much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot sure what the next week will bring, but I\u0026rsquo;m hoping as we settle further into this new normal (however long it may last), we are better able to mentally cope with it and maybe even find some source of optimism for the days ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
