            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe World\u003c/strong\u003e: Somehow the week seemed to go by both quickly and agonizingly slowly, mostly because of the US presidential elections held this week. Slowly because after the initial burst of results on Tuesday night (US time), the remaining states\u0026rsquo; results trickled in very slowly. Quickly because much time was spent doomscrolling and refreshing election-related updates. I think the world collectively breathed a sigh of relief this weekend as the US networks finally called the race for former VP and now president-elect Joe Biden. Celebrations on the streets in many cities in the US, notably New York and Philadelphia. Trump still won\u0026rsquo;t concede and vows legal action, but that seems unlikely to go anywhere except make him look immature and pathetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiden isn\u0026rsquo;t even the best or most exciting candidate, and it\u0026rsquo;s still to be seen how he handles crises like the BLM and police brutality stuff and even healthcare, but at the very least the US will now have a coherent leader and hopefully will be able to address the pandemic better. I would guess that Harris as VP will ultimately end up the more historic win. But I imagine the celebrations are less about Biden winning and more about Trump losing. It must be weird to be a fanatic Trump supporter seeing all these people celebrating his loss. He still got a lot of votes - America remains a deeply divided nation, but at least under Biden there\u0026rsquo;s a chance of that being rectified at least a little bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have written a lot of words on this topic, considering I\u0026rsquo;m not an American. My stakes in this are a bit lower, but I still found myself glued to the ever-changing blue and red numbers. The US leadership affects the rest of the world of course, especially in terms of climate change and multilateralism moving forward, so it\u0026rsquo;s serious business. But I admit, I also enjoyed the drama and the memes. I had more than one chat groups where some of the members were living in the US, and let me tell you, they were super active during this week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy favorite part of all this drama has to be the whole \u003ca href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-four-seasons-total-landscaping_n_5fa6e08bc5b6f21920dc14f7\"\u003eFour Seasons Total Landscaping\u003c/a\u003e brouhaha. Basically, Trump announced his lawyers would have a press conferencce at Four Seasons in Philadelphia, then later corrected himself saying it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the Four Seasons Hotel, but rather Four Seasons Total Landscaping. Basically a parking lot in an industrial area, next to a dildo shop. It smacks of incompetence and miscoordination of the highest order. It\u0026rsquo;s the kind of comedy that TV shows just can\u0026rsquo;t make up, proving indeed that reality can be stranger (and funnier) than fiction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrump\u0026rsquo;s loss is a repudiation of his style of populist, lying leadership. I wish I could say I was as hopeful for similar positive change in my own country in two years, but that remains to be seen\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOk, back to my stuff lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eServer migration update:\u003c/strong\u003e Today, I\u0026rsquo;ve closed my account at the old hosting provider, so there is no more turning back!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGaming:\u003c/strong\u003e I started and finished Super Mario Odyssey! Just about a week, but that was main game only, finished with a bit over 400 moons. (I believe I can get up to 999 in the game?). Immediately proceeding into the post-game, since I only borrowed this game, so I want to get as close to completion as I can before I have to give it back. That being said, there are some moons gated behind annoying minigames like jump rope, RC racing, etc, which I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I\u0026rsquo;d have the patience to grind through, but we\u0026rsquo;ll see. After Odyssey, I\u0026rsquo;ll take it easy on the Switch games for a little bit, though I am already considering getting either Fire Emblem or the new Paper Mario. Would be good to get back to an RPG after all these platformers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatching Lately:\u003c/strong\u003e About halfway through The Boys season 2 now. More thoughts when I finish I guess? I thought about watching a Sean Connery James Bond flick when he died this week, but neither Netflix nor Prime had any, sadface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGot a new pair of glasses last Wednesday, but up to today my eyes still feel like they are adjusting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not start Nanowrimo. I started trying something else instead, not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s gonna go anywhere though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing I was anxious about last week never pushed through. I should care less about things!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLooking forward to:\u003c/strong\u003e Kaladesh Remastered comes out next week on Arena, so there\u0026rsquo;s that!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The choices were either gunicorn or uwsgi. Readings suggest minimal performance difference between the two. I did try setting up both, and found uwsgi\u0026rsquo;s setup much more straightforward and with more helpful step-by-step documentation: \u003ca href=\"https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html\"\u003ehttps://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNginx itself was pretty straightforward to set up. This \u0026ldquo;common pitfalls\u0026rdquo; article was helpful in resolving issues: \u003ca href=\"https://origin-www.wp.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/config_pitfalls/\"\u003ehttps://origin-www.wp.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/config_pitfalls/\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing I will note that\u0026rsquo;s not in the article above is that for static files to be served by Nginx, it was easier to just have everything be under /var/www, for permission purposes. I initially had static files in a different folder in my user root, but really there\u0026rsquo;s no reason for that since you\u0026rsquo;re going to serve them statically anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"setting-up-php-on-nginx\"\u003eSetting up PHP on Nginx\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed PHP since I had a few minor scripts/pages and a Wordpress install that needed PHP. For the setup on Nginx, I found this guide from askubuntu super helpful: \u003ca href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/134666/what-is-the-easiest-way-to-enable-php-on-nginx\"\u003ehttps://askubuntu.com/questions/134666/what-is-the-easiest-way-to-enable-php-on-nginx\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis guide from DigitalOcean was also helpful: \u003ca href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-nginx-mysql-php-lemp-stack-in-ubuntu-16-04\"\u003ehttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-nginx-mysql-php-lemp-stack-in-ubuntu-16-04\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was encountering some issues with fastcgi not mapping requests to the correct PHP script if the Nginx location block was aliased. This was with me using the default \u003ccode\u003esnippets/fastcgi-php.conf\u003c/code\u003e that was provided with the fastcgi install. I resolved the issue by adding an additional fastcgi_param to the php location block like so:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e    location /sample-path {\n        alias /var/www/sample-path;\n        # autoindex on;\n\n        location ~ \\.php$ {\n                include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;\n                fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME    $request_filename;\n                fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;\n        }\n    }\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe solution for this came from the Nginx common pitfalls article listed above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"wordpress-specific\"\u003eWordpress-specific\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Added 1/21/2021)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWordpress worked well enough for the most part.

It\u0026rsquo;s also mentioned in the \u003ca href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/nginx/\"\u003eofficial Wordpress docs\u003c/a\u003e , but buried in a bunch of other stuff so less helpful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"choosing-a-database\"\u003eChoosing a database\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI initially wanted to use PostgreSQL (since that\u0026rsquo;s what I was using locally) and set that up first. Then I realized I had a Wordpress install I wanted to carry over, and apparently Wordpress needs MySQL, so oops. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to have two databases running, so that was out. Plan out your database usage boys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"setting-up-mysql-for-django\"\u003eSetting up MySQL for Django\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI created the initial MySQL database with character set \u003ccode\u003eutf8\u003c/code\u003e, which apparently had the dumb implementation of only supporting 3 bytes for multibyte characters. This led to errors when I tried importing records into Django that had emojis and the like in text. Apparently the \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; character set to use is \u003ccode\u003eutf8mb4\u003c/code\u003e (mb4 -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;multibyte 4\u0026rdquo; I guess?). It\u0026rsquo;s kinda dumb that they had to invent a \u0026ldquo;more utf8 character set\u0026rdquo; because of their initial dumb implementation. It\u0026rsquo;s also dumb that I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize this when apparently the MySQL databases on the old server were already using \u003ccode\u003eutf8mb4\u003c/code\u003e! On the Django side, you need to specify the charset in the database settings. Helpful for resolving this issue was donturner\u0026rsquo;s answer on this SO question: \u003ca href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2108824/\"\u003ehttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/2108824/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter some initial testing, I also encountered a \u0026ldquo;MySQL has gone away\u0026rdquo; every so often. Turns out Django was holding on to connections for too long, so a timeout had to be set in the database settings as well. SO reference: \u003ca href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26958592/\"\u003ehttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/26958592/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit: I just encountered this a few hours after I wrote this post, when I tried to make the site display all times in Manila local time. Apparently, even if I set my Django app to be timezone, aware, additional setup needs to be done on the MySQL side so it knows what the actual timezones are (feels like they should really do this as part of the install!). Basically you need to run \u003ccode\u003emysql_tzinfo_to_sql\u003c/code\u003e to load the OS timezone info into the database. This is in the \u003ca href=\"https://django.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ref/databases.html\"\u003eDjango documentation\u003c/a\u003e and the \u003ca href=\"https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-tzinfo-to-sql.html\"\u003eMySQL documentation\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"misc-stuff\"\u003eMisc stuff\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used cron to set up most of the batch jobs I usually run (like the Twitter bots, etc). Initially I had problems where it seemed like cron wasn\u0026rsquo;t running the jobs, even though syslog showed me the cron daemon was actually running. I don\u0026rsquo;t have notes on how I resolved this, but mentioning it here so that if this happens again in the future, I know to actuall take notes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetting up log files for my cron jobs: I did it this way: \u003ccode\u003e0 * * * * /path-to-batch/hourly.sh \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /var/log/cron/my-log-file.log 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u003c/code\u003e. The \u0026ldquo;2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026rdquo; at the end is necessary so that stderr is redirected to the same file (otherwise you\u0026rsquo;d only get stdout).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLog rotation: these is the kind of thing you don\u0026rsquo;t realize you need to do when you\u0026rsquo;re managing your own server. Anyway, I found this guide helpful: \u003ca href=\"https://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/setup-log-rotation-logrotate-ubuntu/\"\u003ehttps://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/setup-log-rotation-logrotate-ubuntu/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed to set up AWStats on the new server (and migrate data from the old server). This guide was helpful: \u003ca href=\"https://larsee.com/blog/2020/06/awstats-on-ubuntu-20-04-with-nginx/\"\u003ehttps://larsee.com/blog/2020/06/awstats-on-ubuntu-20-04-with-nginx/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen migrating the old AWStats data files, the filename format from the oldserver was slightly different (new install needed to end with \u003ccode\u003e*.roytang.net.txt\u003c/code\u003e), so I learned a bit of bash scripting to do the batch rename:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003efor i in /path-to-tmp/awstats/*.txt ; do cp \u0026quot;$i\u0026quot; \u0026quot;/path-to-tmp/awstats/out/$(basename \u0026quot;$i\u0026quot; .txt).roytang.net.txt\u0026quot; ; done\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetting up Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt SSL on Nginx: \u003ca href=\"https://www.nginx.com/blog/using-free-ssltls-certificates-from-lets-encrypt-with-nginx/\"\u003ehttps://www.nginx.com/blog/using-free-ssltls-certificates-from-lets-encrypt-with-nginx/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"lessons-learned\"\u003eLessons learned\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect from the migration from shared hosting to a VPS is how much memory I\u0026rsquo;d need. My old hosting plan was only on 512MB ram, and the lowest DigitalOcean droplet had 1GB RAM, so I figured that was fine! But MySQL occasionally had out of memory errors on startup even at 1GB ram, so I bumped up to the next level (2GB RAM). I guess the database RAM usage didn\u0026rsquo;t count against my limits on the shared hosting! The next tier isn\u0026rsquo;t much more expensive and is still manageable for my casual/hobby hosting purposes, but I will probably try to look into more detail into the memory situation at some point to see what I can optimize.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Supposedly the \u0026ldquo;strongest storm of 2020\u0026rdquo; so far, typhoon Rolly made landfall earlier today and is currently battering many of the provinces south of Metro Manila. Storm signals are as high as number 5. As of this writing, weather is currently cold and nippy but not particularly rainy where I am. We expect stronger winds and rain to hit us as evening approaches as well. On top of everything, a second typhoon has entered the PH area of responsibility and is expected to affect us over the next couple of days as well. If those two typhoons get together, it may be very bad. Hoping for the best. (I thought about doing these weeknotes end of day\u0026hellip; but we might lose power, so here we go.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eServer migration update:\u003c/strong\u003e Migrating the final domain now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGaming:\u003c/strong\u003e I finished \u003ca href=\"/2020/10/1322214646221205504/\"\u003eLink\u0026rsquo;s Awakening!\u003c/a\u003e Full heart and seashell completion even! It was fun and a great throwback to classic games like Link to the Past. I never played the original on Gameboy, though maybe that\u0026rsquo;s for the best, as I liked how this one looked and my memory is not tainted by nostalgia over GB graphics. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t a particularly long game, especially compared to other Zeldas, but there is a custom dungeon feature (new to this remake) which probably adds some replay value, though I don\u0026rsquo;t have much interest in it at the moment. On to Super Mario Odyssey!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGaming:\u003c/strong\u003e I did terribly at the \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/review-eternal/\"\u003eEternal Card Game\u003c/a\u003e worlds LCQ, but I must admit their current celebration promo was super effective in getting me back into the game, as I\u0026rsquo;m now doing daily grinds in both Eternal and Magic Arena again. I managed to hit Mythic in Magic Arena before month end, but didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough time for Eternal, we\u0026rsquo;ll see if I can keep it up next month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGaming:\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0026rsquo;ve been enjoying games of \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/965580/Root/\"\u003eRoot\u003c/a\u003e with the Saturday gaming group. It\u0026rsquo;s a multifaction boardgame where each faction plays differently and has different ways of scoring victory points, and the factions will naturally clash with each other. The main challenge is finding a fine balance between advancing your agenda and interfering with the others. Disrupting the other factions might lose you some momentum compared to the others, but if no one keeps the others in check, someone might run away with victory! Pretty fun. And given that the game supports asynchronous games (up to 3 days per turn), the term \u0026ldquo;Saturday gaming group\u0026rdquo; is a bit obsolete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDone:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"/tags/inktober2020\"\u003ethe Inktober thing\u003c/a\u003e! I managed to get through the whole thing without missing a day! Doing daily drawings with a pen are hard for me, given my poor manual dexterity at this age (and it was never that good in the first place). My hands got tired so easily, and a lot of my lines were shaky. Still, I enjoyed doing a lot of the sketches, and while I don\u0026rsquo;t want to \u003ca href=\"/2016/03/sketching-daily/\"\u003ecommit to daily drawings\u003c/a\u003e again (at least for now), maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll warm up the old Apple Pencil every so often and do some digital stuff? Maybe?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatching lately:\u003c/strong\u003e I finished Season 4 of The Expanse. I didn\u0026rsquo;t enjoy it as much as the first 3 seasons, though the second half was better than the first. Things were ramping up too slowly, and a lot of things didn\u0026rsquo;t seem relevant to the what was going on with the Roci crew (and turned out to be mostly geared towards next season\u0026rsquo;s big crisis apparently?). As I said to a friend, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m here for the scifi protomolecule stuff not OPA terrorist or earth politics BS.\u0026rdquo; Still, looking forward to the next season. Also: Finished five seasons of NCIS (that\u0026rsquo;s all they had on Prime Video). In the queue: The Boys S2, Star Trek Discovery S3, Mandalorian S2. Where\u0026rsquo;s my Orville?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSkipped:\u003c/strong\u003e Hacktoberfest.

I do have some ideas rolling around in my head, but I also have some other stuff to do, so for now let\u0026rsquo;s say this is \u0026ldquo;low probability\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnxiety:\u003c/strong\u003e Low, most of it due to awaiting a call back about something that hasn\u0026rsquo;t pushed through yet, but I don\u0026rsquo;t really need?

I also don\u0026rsquo;t want to have to store all the pre-generated HTML files. It\u0026rsquo;s fine for a small site, but with the large number of posts here, there\u0026rsquo;s a large amount of unnecessary duplication, considering listing pages and such. That means reverting to a system where each page is generated on the fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to retain the current workflow of managing content via markdown files, so that rules out something like Wordpress. Still, I figured I needed some kind of database for indexing, so that things like listing and archive pages work properly. Given that we would be migrating away from a static site, I fully expect a performance hit, at least initially, but ideally it\u0026rsquo;s not too bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;d also like to retain the current content written for Hugo as much as possible. This means the new system will need to be able to parse the custom Hugo shortcodes I\u0026rsquo;d set up for the site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would also be migrating to a new server which I would be managing myself, which means I would need to set up the deployment myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"why-django\"\u003eWhy Django\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI naturally fell back on Django, it\u0026rsquo;s my ORM+backend framework of choice, and the one I\u0026rsquo;m most familiar with. Also, I already had a handful of small Django apps that I needed to migrate to the new server as well, so no matter what I needed to have a Django app on the server anyway. I also had a bunch of Python scripts that were doing already doing support functions for the site like search and ingestion of social media content, so that\u0026rsquo;s something to fold into the new backend as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"why-bother\"\u003eWhy Bother?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will fully admit I spent far too much effort unnecessarily doing this, but the realization is that it\u0026rsquo;s actually work I enjoy. This site is primarily a project for myself, and I enjoy the time working on it and learning stuff and improving things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, the effort wasn\u0026rsquo;t too much. There was a lot of code to reuse and migrate, so most of the effort was testing and making sure things worked. Most of the new code was for parsing the markdown files to render the hugo shortcodes as HTML; I basically wrote Django templates for each Hugo shortcode to be supported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"changes\"\u003eChanges\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe migration was largely done in-place: site design remains mostly the same, post URLs should be more or less retained. I did take the opportunity to make one nontrivial change: Photos are now under \u003ca href=\"/notes\"\u003eNotes\u003c/a\u003e category. I really only had a separate photos category before because in Hugo I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a way to query posts that have attached images. Even with everything under Notes, since I have a database now, I can do silly things like show \u003ca href=\"/photos/random\"\u003erandom photos\u003c/a\u003e. Also, now the notes section is closer to a microblog/tumblr-like feed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe source for the site content will still be \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/roytang/blog\"\u003eavailable publicly via Github\u003c/a\u003e, as it was before. Unfortunately, I am not ready to make public the source for this site, because (a) a lot of it is old code that I reused so it looks terrible; and (b) some level of security by obscurity I guess?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that the site needs to be secure; there isn\u0026rsquo;t actually any critical/important data being stored anywhere. But the fact that a database now exists means I need to follow some kind of security practices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe server is now hosted on DigitalOcean. Here\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://m.do.co/c/6c2e6b11b260\"\u003emy affiliate link\u003c/a\u003e. Since I\u0026rsquo;m on a self-managed VPS now, that means Github webhooks now work, so whenever I push new posts, they take less than a minute to now appear on the site. This is a vast improvement over the old system where it would take anywhere between 30-60 minutes depending on how Travis was feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of Travis, I set up a new mirror, Travis now publishes to \u003ca href=\"https://mirror.roytang.net\"\u003ehttps://mirror.roytang.net\u003c/a\u003e once a day, hosted on Netlify. The mirror is still generated using Hugo! I don\u0026rsquo;t know how long I can keep up having the content generate correctly for both builds, but we\u0026rsquo;ll see how it goes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"summary\"\u003eSummary\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this actually went out much smoother than I thought it would. Took less effort than expected, deployment was a breeze. The listing pages have slightly worse performance, but individual pages are hitting 100 on Pagespeed, so that\u0026rsquo;s mostly fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis post was just the overview of the site changes. There\u0026rsquo;s still a bunch of technical notes to be written up, so that\u0026rsquo;s stuff for a future blog post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last time I used a Django backend for my website was \u003ca href=\"/2008/12/roytang-net-site-update/\"\u003ewaaaay back in 2008\u003c/a\u003e, and that didn\u0026rsquo;t last more than a year before I switched to Wordpress. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how long this one holds out!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Luckily, most of the migration work to the new backend was already done, so I went ahead and switched over the servers. So this site is no longer plain-old deployed HTML, but rather powered by a Django backend. The site should be mostly the same, though I did take the opportunity to move some stuff around. There\u0026rsquo;s probably some bugs floating around, and maybe some secrets even. Probably need a longer blog post writing about the migration itself, though it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too complicated. I also have a bunch of notes about the server setup that I\u0026rsquo;ll also carve into a blog post when I have time. Things should be mostly done for this site, but I have one other domain I have to migrate, and I have scheduled that for the end of the month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat means that hopefully all my apps/domains will be on the new server after the first week of November. My account at the old webhost is paid until Nov 15th, and I\u0026rsquo;ve already indicated I don\u0026rsquo;t plan to migrate to whatever new system they have, so it\u0026rsquo;s just in time I think. Hoping things go smoothly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaming: I did \u003ca href=\"/2020/10/1318238520251621377/\"\u003ethe 120 stars \u0026ldquo;completion\u0026rdquo; for Super Mario Galaxy\u003c/a\u003e, although that\u0026rsquo;s really more like half of actual completion. I put down the Switch for a few days after that to cool down on it for a bit, as I have been playing it a lot since I got it. Still deciding whether to play Odyssey next or try Link\u0026rsquo;s Awakening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaming: I haven\u0026rsquo;t played \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/review-eternal/\"\u003eEternal Card Game\u003c/a\u003e in months, which meant falling behind on the collection as new sets came out and such. But they\u0026rsquo;re running an event right now where all accounts have access to all cards, and there are qualifiers for their worlds event. I figured why not and gave it a shot, running a deck I got from their recent tournaments, and \u003ca href=\"/2020/10/1319794495395745793/\"\u003emanaged to qualify for the LCQ on my first try\u003c/a\u003e. Eternal has always been a fun game, but the past few months I\u0026rsquo;ve preferred playing on MTG Arena. The timing of this Eternal event was pretty nice, as it came up just after Arena got a patch that severely downgraded the UX, with bugs being reported everywhere and general laggy performance. The Eternal client was, as always, snappy and had no issues. Arena dev team needs to get their act together!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill ongoing: \u003ca href=\"/tags/inktober2020\"\u003ethe Inktober thing\u003c/a\u003e. Still haven\u0026rsquo;t missed a day! This week is the final stretch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot ongoing: Hacktoberfest. I mentioned before that I was planning to do it, but\u0026hellip; I haven\u0026rsquo;t. Less than a week to go, so doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem likely I can get into it, especially since other things have come up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo my current webhost finally decided to give me a deadline, the long and short of it is that my new server needs to be ready by December the 9th, giving me a bit under a month to get things in order. I\u0026rsquo;m already in the middle of setting up the new server, so I think I\u0026rsquo;ll be ready by early November anyway. Most of the code to run the new blog is also mostly ready (who knows how many bugs there are though!) I am (re-)learning a lot about server setups though, so hopefully I\u0026rsquo;ll have quite a few blog posts to write the migration is done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching lately: Mostly old NCIS seasons still, and I\u0026rsquo;m just past the halfway point on The Expanse season 4. Slow going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am looking forward to November, and am awaiting the outcome of the US presidential elections with morbid interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
