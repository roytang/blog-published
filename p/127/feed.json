But for the most part I\u0026rsquo;ve restricted it to those channels and have tried to avoid posting about current events in the country on this blog (outside of my personal choices for the election), but I feel that now more than ever those of us who can speak out have a responsibility to do so whenever we can, for several reasons\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://2016.villageidiotsavant.com/2016/08/19/232-sanity-survival-strategies-for-the-next-six-years/\"\u003eVillage Idiot Savant\u003c/a\u003e says:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Third, write. But don’t write as you would for the consumption of social media, write instead to keep a record of these times. Write in long form, write reflections, write your frustrations, write with big words, write even if it appears you are rambling. Write with Art and with Irony. Because we will eventually emerge from this period of madness, hopefully to a season of sanity, and we will need to look back and remember, and if needed, to indict. Write because it will someday be history.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat last part resonated with me. \u0026ldquo;Write because it will someday be history.\u0026rdquo; It reminds me of where we are currently with the Marcos legacy, with an entire generation having been brainwashed to believe that Marcos was actually a hero and a positive influence on this country, all because in the intervening years since the EDSA revolution we (and by we I mean we the people, not just the government) grew complacent and believed that exile was sufficient and that we would not have to worry again about such a dark time in our society to come back and haunt us again\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet here we are again on a road, perhaps even a slippery slope, towards a dark future. Marcos is again being glorified, and the state is once again extending its reach with the similar excuse of \u0026ldquo;peace and order\u0026rdquo;. We do not yet know where this path ultimately leads, perhaps it won\u0026rsquo;t be the darkness many of us can foresee, perhaps we as a society are able to turn away from the brink before it is too late. There are those who believe it is already too late, that we are already in the darkest timeline\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if our country falls under a shroud of darkness, like the darkness of Martial Law it will also eventually pass and hopefully we emerge on the other side stronger and wiser as a country. In the hopes of that light beyond the darkness, we must write. We must take our voices and speak out against what ills we see. It often feels futile, with many of our countrymen already having surrendered their wills to the violence. Many are unwilling to listen, many treat the current leadership as if they are infallible demigods who could do no wrong. Maybe there is really no one listening and you are but a lone voice crying in the wilderness. It is not for them that we need to write, but for those of us who still hope for a better future. And for those in the future to recognize and learn from the mistakes of our time\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe must write and speak, while we still can. We don\u0026rsquo;t know whether we will still be able to speak up tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, we should write to spite those who would silence us for our opposition. For many of the administration\u0026rsquo;s supporters, anyone who speaks out is an open target for harassment and accusations most vile, as one of Rappler\u0026rsquo;s correspondents recently found out:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eChastising Duterte is not mutually exclusive with supporting De Lima.

Not everyone has the liberty to speak up. Not everyone can afford to sacrifice time nor ego to the possibility of a horde of online trolls pouncing on you. Not everyone can afford to be stressed out over this. Not everyone has the temperament to be willing to offend other people or risk losing friendships. All the more reason for those of us who are able to speak up to keep on going and to persist in the face of overwhelming ignorance and hypocrisy. The ones who cannot afford to speak, we speak for them too\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the reasons I didn\u0026rsquo;t write about this too much on this blog is that I didn\u0026rsquo;t want this channel to become about politics. But it feels like so much more than just politics now. Despite what some fanatics may have you believe, we do not voice opposition simply because we believe in another camp or because we want to destroy the current administration. We voice opposition because we want the best for our country, and we believe that these issues \u0026ndash; the continuing demonization of human rights and due process, encouragement of a culture of killing and violence, intellectual dishonesty and willful ignorance, and so on \u0026ndash; are issues worth raising up and discussing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am sure I have friends and family who are tired of me bringing up such subjects. At least one person has unfriended me already without explanation, although circumstances dictate it was about \u0026ldquo;politics\u0026rdquo;. For my friends and family, I apologize. If you are tired of me speaking up, please trust that I am tired too\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Simmons introduces new concepts and the history of his universe and human society quickly and unapologetically. Even the prologue bandies around the terms Hegemony and Ouster with little explanation save what we can glean from context. Most of it is expounded upon and elaborated in the short stories which comprise the majority of the book.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe short stories tell the tales of each of the pilgrims making their way to the far off world of Hyperion to face their death before a time-defying god. It seems that each story follows and develops a different aspect of Hyperion\u0026rsquo;s universe: the first one tells us about religion and space travel and colonisation, the second talks about military life, and so on. My favorite was the scholar\u0026rsquo;s story: although the preceding parts of the story make the ending especially predictable, how he gets there is told incredibly well and you can feel the sadness and despair of his situation\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe disappointing part of the book however was the ending, which seemingly just drops the story like a rock. The last story to be told doesn\u0026rsquo;t even explain why the pilgrim wanted to return to Hyperion, and we do not get the climactic meeting the rest of the book has been leading up to. I understand that the story was actually split into two books, and that I would have to read the succeeding book Fall of Hyperion to get any payoff, but I wish it had been handled better\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn spite of that, I liked it. And maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll pick up the sequel too.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI like to say that software development is a challenging career because no two projects are ever the same and there are always new challenges to face and new concepts to learn, but the truth of the matter is a bit more complex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWriting software is about breaking down large problems into a series of very small technical problems for which we already have solutions.\u003c/strong\u003e Examples of small enough technical problems include list sorting, comparison, arithmetic operations, path traversal, string concatenation, returning a string as an HTTP response, rendering text to the screen, retrieving submitted parameters from an HTTP request, and so on. Any given non-trivial software project will be broken down into thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands of such small tasks, some occurring more often under different contexts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe job of the software developer designed to implement such a program or some part of a program is to identify all those tiny tasks and the order in which they need to be done, then actually do it and put it all together in a way that satisfies the software\u0026rsquo;s requirements. Finding out the proper arrangement of tasks is a form of design in and of itself, separate from the design of the software requirements. This is why many programmers will tell you that coding itself is both design and implementation \u0026ndash; the coder still has to make numerous small decisions, rearranging code and tasks until he finds the correct arrangement that works to satisfy your needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInvariably, practically all of these tiny tasks are either trivial to implement (based on knowledge the programmer already has), or have already been implemented somewhere else by some other programmer. This is why Q\u0026amp;A sites such as \u003ca href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/\"\u003eStack Overflow\u003c/a\u003e are very useful for the modern programmer \u0026ndash; you simply dip your pool into the communal knowledge of the programming community and most of the time the programmers who have solved the same problem before will tell you how they did it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Practically all\u0026rdquo; means in the rare instance, you will still encounter problems that as far as you can tell have yet to be solved by anyone else in the world. I am unsure if there is anything quite as depressing to the programmer as finally finding a single Google hit about that one problem he was unable to solve only to find that it was a link to his own unanswered Stack Overflow question from months before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften this happens when you are doing something or some combination of things so obscure no one else has tried it before, or when you are legitimately blazing new ground. It largely depends on the field you are working in \u0026ndash; if you are using proven frameworks to build your 10th web application, most likely 999 out of every 1,000 problems you have are already solved. On the other hand, if you were maybe writing drivers for a new piece of hardware, or maybe writing a new framework to be used at the same time as the first application using it, that number shoots up considerably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat to do when faced with such a situation where all the sources you consult \u0026ndash; mentors, experts, textbooks, the internet, and so on \u0026ndash; are unable to help you solve the problem and it stops you from moving forward? Well, if you can sense that trying to solve the problem on your own or brute forcing it in some manner may waste a lot of time that you can\u0026rsquo;t afford, you should remember what I said above: **Writing software is about breaking down large problems into a series of very small technical problems for which we already have solutions. **This means your first choice should be to check first if there is an alternative arrangement of tasks for which that particular problem could be avoided (that is, \u0026ldquo;re-design your code to work around the problem\u0026rdquo;). You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t box yourself into a particular sequence of steps, be willing to \u0026ldquo;think outside the box\u0026rdquo; to look for other solutions that while not immediately obvious, may be more feasible (i.e. \u0026ldquo;already solved\u0026rdquo;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis method of iterating the arrangements of parts until the software works might seem a bit clunky, but I\u0026rsquo;ve found it useful to think in this manner \u0026ndash; it makes even the impossible problems seem feasible. Now, if only problems with humans could be solved just be rearranging things\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",
