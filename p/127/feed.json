You have to be willing to cut your losses and quit early, and just come back and finish the work the next day, when your productivity isn\u0026rsquo;t shot by tiredness and the general crankiness of the long hours. When the whole team is still in the office at 3AM waiting for new builds, every delay or new defect is met with a drop of morale and increase in grumpiness, no matter how small\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaying too late quickly hits a point of diminishing returns too. For one thing, working too many hours leads to poor quality and sloppy work. Ted Mosby famously said \u0026ldquo;Nothing good ever happens after 2AM\u0026rdquo;, that\u0026rsquo;s mostly true for software development too. More than once I\u0026rsquo;ve gone to work the next day and saw how I screwed up something the night before. Mistakes made during toxic overtime affect the next build too, and the one after that, and those problems cascade into more overtime. They all compound in one vicious cycle. It\u0026rsquo;s better to just do the work in the morning when you have a clearer head to hopefully not continue the cycle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose are just the productivity and quality downsides \u0026ndash; there\u0026rsquo;s also the problem of high overtime levels leading to increased absenteeism, lower health levels, and higher turnover rates\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe realities of business and schedules and deadlines don\u0026rsquo;t always let us avoid overtime, but hopefully every time we\u0026rsquo;re forced to do so, we learn from those instances and figure out how to plan better next time (or to get the client\u0026rsquo;s understanding to be more flexible with scope and schedule)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAlmost six years ago, \u003ca href=\"http://roytang.net/2010/11/randomly-amazed/\"\u003eI had to undergo minor surgery and had to endure the pain of being administered spinal anesthesia\u003c/a\u003e. I was reminded of this recently because a loved one with an even lower pain tolerance than I did recently had to undergo a similar procedure\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a pretty low tolerance for pain myself. I tried to spin it a bit positively in the blog post linked above, but there\u0026rsquo;s no question many times during the procedure I felt miserable and in lots of pain. Even just the process of being put on a dextrose was pretty uncomfortable for me, and laying there on the operating table hunched in a fetal position waiting to be administered spinal anesthesia was far worse. I even had to undergo anesthesia twice because I went back into the OR after some complications!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I\u0026rsquo;ve written before, one of the worst things is \u003ca href=\"http://roytang.net/2005/12/the-left-half-of-my-mouth-is-numb-thanks/\"\u003ethe mental anticipation of pain\u003c/a\u003e. Those few moments waiting for the inevitable pinprick that will start an avalanche of pain. There\u0026rsquo;s a balance you have to strike between bracing yourself for the pain that you know is coming and not letting your fear of the coming pain somehow amplify it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor things like spinal anesthesia, or dextrose being hooked up, or blood samples being taken from your arm, you just have to pretty much grin and bear it. If you can\u0026rsquo;t avoid these scenarios you might as well just get through with it as quickly as possible. That\u0026rsquo;s why for medical problems, I prefer just doing what needs to be done, even if it means some measure of pain and discomfort. It\u0026rsquo;s better than letting discomfort linger and possibly reoccur and become more complicated\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrior to that operation, the most pain I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced was \u003ca href=\"http://roytang.net/2004/12/i-get-bored-easily/\"\u003ea toothache back in 2004\u003c/a\u003e. (Apparently I write about pain a lot). Toothaches are also pretty bad because unlike the pinpricks described above, they\u0026rsquo;re continuous pain. I only wanted to mention this part because I remembered that my dentist happened to read the blog post linked in this paragraph and gave me a frowny face over email when she read about me complaining of the pain haha\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look forward to the day that medical science advances quickly enough that pain relief is fast, easy, and painless, though that may take a while: apparently \u003ca href=\"http://io9.gizmodo.com/how-does-anesthesia-work-doctors-arent-sure-and-her-1592809615\"\u003ewe don\u0026rsquo;t even completely understand how anesthesia works\u003c/a\u003e, we\u0026rsquo;re just glad that it does. Until then, we just grit our teeth and think happy thoughts and power through the pain\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",
