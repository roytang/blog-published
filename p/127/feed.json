Marcos also wanted to know the consequences of declaring Martial Law. The result of their study stated that, “while Martial Law may accelerate development, in the end the Philippines would become a political archipelago, with debilitating, factionalized politics.” Almonte recalled that their findings led to the conclusion that “the nation would be destroyed because, apart from the divisiveness it would cause, Martial Law would offer Marcos absolute power which would corrupt absolutely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource:\nJose T. Almonte and Marites Dañguilan Vitug, Endless Journey: A Memoir (Quezon City: Cleverheads Publishing, 2015), p. 77.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e=+=+=+=\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe attitude \u0026ldquo;That country should not instruct us on human rights because look at what they have done / are doing\u0026rdquo; is stupid. That\u0026rsquo;s like saying \u0026ldquo;why should I follow the rules when no one else does?\u0026rdquo; Or \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s easier for me to go to mass instead of not being an asshole to other people\u0026rdquo;. This is exactly what is wrong with the entire country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e44 years ago on September 23, 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos declared Proclamation 1081, placing the Philippines under Martial Law. My father was the very first lawyer to challenge the act before the Supreme Court and questioned its legality under the 1935 Philippine Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, the 1987 Constitution safeguards our institutions from a repeat of Marcos’ Martial Law regime. The Supreme Court is empowered to review all official acts to determine if there has been grave abuse of discretion. Congress cannot be padlocked. Martial Law is limited in duration and effects, even if contemplated by a president. (Source: Section 18 of Article VII)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you really love our country, regardless of political beliefs, invest in it. Give it your love, your forgiveness, your righteous and civil dissent. Obey it\u0026rsquo;s laws even if you feel stupid doing so because no one else will. Hold your head high when people tell you \u0026ldquo;masyado ka kasing honest\u0026rdquo;. Do good work, fall in love, live with honor. Be the best Filipino you can be. And above all, cherish the freedoms that were bought so dearly by so many. Do not abuse them. The Filipino is worth living for, and worth living here for. We are worth changing for, worth loving despite our many frailties. We are worth it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe many will someday stand bravely with the few, though we may have to re-learn our lessons because we always had aborted, personal, and unfinished revolutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are impatient as a people and as a culture, perhaps we need an evolution - the slow quiet unsung work of true development - more than a revolution. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s what change means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHope, prayer, vigilance, strength, and honor. This is our challenge and our overwhelming responsibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Every time you add a new person to the team, he comes with a lot of overhead such as the need to learn the project details, responsibilities of other team members, who to consult when there\u0026rsquo;s trouble, custom project procedures, and so on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a reinforcing cycle too. As overhead increases, the team imposes more processes and restrictions to make sure everyone is doing the right thing and there are no screw-ups. More processes means even greater overhead when new team members join. And the cycle repeats\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs team size increases, mistakes become more costly too. When you\u0026rsquo;re a team of two or three developers all in the same room, you can barrel ahead quickly and when there\u0026rsquo;s a problem you can quickly figure out who broke the build. But when there\u0026rsquo;s like eighty of you split over two floors, it becomes a tedious exercise. And every broken build and every critical bug now costs a lot more man-hours because it affects a lot more people. So everybody needs to be even more careful, and yeap even more overhead. You end up introducing more coordinators, reviewers, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn so many words, the above is simply a restatement of the famous \u0026ldquo;Mythical man-month\u0026rdquo; quote:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdding more people to a late project makes it even later\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn practice though, I find that people who are aware of this quote find themselves falling into the trap of \u0026ldquo;this won\u0026rsquo;t happen to me\u0026rdquo;, so a more nuanced discussion of the problems of scale might need to be had. Management typically responds more to qualitative costs, so maybe there are some metrics that you team could find? Something like \u0026ldquo;for every N developers, we need an additional X amount of coordination work\u0026rdquo; and so on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe it\u0026rsquo;s one of those myths we are doomed to relive again and again\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

So often there will be people who don\u0026rsquo;t like to speak up when they think something is wrong, either just tolerating it or hoping someone else will take it up. A software dev in another company once told me that he felt like he was complaining so much that he was looking like a bad guy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is of course, a bad attitude to have. If no one speaks up about the problems we see, how would we ever improve? Someone has to do it, it might as well be you. And often there will be benefits too to speaking up, for one thing you might get credit for raising something no one else has thought of. As they say, the squeaky wheel gets the grease\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, you should of course pick your battles. Don\u0026rsquo;t complain too much about the little things, but be sure to raise your voice when there\u0026rsquo;s an important battle to be fought. This will give you a reputation such that when you do raise something, people will pay attention. Having a balanced approach is a lot more helpful than complaining about every little thing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, and of course if someone is doing something wrong, try not to be combative but be a bit diplomatic. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to offend anyone, you just want to do things the right way. And question the action instead of the person so that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like a personal attack. \u0026ldquo;Hey, is that really how it should be done?\u0026rdquo; will be received better than \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not how to do it, you idiot!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to be unreasonable every so often. As George Bernard Shaw famously said \u0026ldquo;The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n",
