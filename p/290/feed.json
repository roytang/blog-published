Sad face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pool I registered was terrible, no money rares and felt a bit short on playables, but the pool I got passed was better (not really in terms of constructed \u0026ldquo;value\u0026rdquo; cards, but pretty good in terms of playability). I think Scars limited lends itself well to monocolor decks with vast majority of the support provided by artifacts, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t just had dragon-class bombs in separate colors, so black-red it was.

At least I can say this was the first time I lost a tournament match to poision counters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound two\u003c/strong\u003e was a breeze, and marked the first time I won a tournament match using poison counters. And I did it with Skittles, the only Infect guy in my deck. Hey, my opponent kept gaining life, luckily I had a viable alternate plan of attack. Won 2-0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound three\u003c/strong\u003e, the guy was all cool and had three colors of basics, plus a bunch of mana myr, it\u0026rsquo;s like he was doing nothing exciting, then all of a sudden brings out a \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Liege%20of%20the%20Tangle\" target=\"_new\"\u003eLiege of the Tangle\u003c/a\u003e on me!

I lost game two to a quick \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Tangle%20Angler\" target=\"_new\"\u003eTangle Angler\u003c/a\u003e with \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Darksteel%20Axe\" target=\"_new\"\u003eDarksteel Axe\u003c/a\u003e after stalling on lands due to a poor keep \u003cem\u003e(True Magic Confessions episode 17: I don\u0026rsquo;t mulligan aggressively enough)\u003c/em\u003e.

Ha!

Won 2-1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound four\u003c/strong\u003e, my opponent was UR. In game one neither of had much gas and had to resort to trading blows with our 1/1 mana myrs, but I pulled out ahead after he drew too many lands and I had 3 mana myrs to clock him with. Game two, he tapped out for \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Saberclaw%20Golem\" target=\"_new\"\u003eSaberclaw Golem\u003c/a\u003e and I was thinking of taking it out with a non-boosted G-Blast, but for some reason thought it would be better to do so on his turn. Of course when he untaps he already has \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Stoic%20Rebuttal\" target=\"_new\"\u003eStoic Rebuttal\u003c/a\u003e ready, a card I already saw in game one and hence should have been aware of! I went on tilt a bit and subsequently blocked the Golem looking to trade creatures, but then he just smiled and paid the red mana to give it first strike. Facepalm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did the mental Saito faceslap and toughened up my focus for game three. I stayed in control all game, making only a minor mistake of unnecessarily untapping the \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Rust%20Tick\" target=\"_new\"\u003eRust Tick\u003c/a\u003e at one point, but was well ahead in life totals anyway and finished him off with 2 \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Galvanic%20Blast\" target=\"_new\"\u003eGalvanic Blast\u003c/a\u003es.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo anyway I fail to make 4-0 for the nth time in a row. I haven\u0026rsquo;t 4-0\u0026rsquo;d since Time Spiral I think. It\u0026rsquo;s fine, Prereleases should be very casual events anyway so I have a tendency to maybe play a bit looser than I would at a PTQ for example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrize packs did not contain anything exciting. Well, a \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Genesis%20Wave\" target=\"_new\"\u003eGenesis Wave\u003c/a\u003e but that\u0026rsquo;s more of a fun, casual card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTLDR\u003c/strong\u003e; Went 3-1 at my local Scars of Mirrodin Prerelease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExtra discussion topic\u003c/strong\u003e: A friend and I were talking about how newbie-unfriendly Prereleases can be, even though it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be pretty much a \u0026ldquo;casual affair\u0026rdquo;. There are always a bunch of guys who are at their first sealed event and they take a while to register, and a lot of them don\u0026rsquo;t know that the registered pool won\u0026rsquo;t necessarily be the one they\u0026rsquo;re going to play and get to take home. And where I play, most of the Prereleases will have the local \u0026ldquo;sharks\u0026rdquo; playing, they will usually play multiple flights. I try to keep a friendly atmosphere, but many of them are always dead serious even though it\u0026rsquo;s just a prerelease, making new tournament players or young kids a bit nervous. Of course it has to be that way because there are prizes on the line, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy friend suggested a separate type of prerelease event where entrants are guaranteed some small token prizes (maybe two packs), regardless of their win-loss record, and some trophy prize (like a t-shirt) for going undefeated. Rules enforcement might be looser \u0026ndash; maybe no longer requiring deck registration or pool swaps. This would make it more casual and less appealing to \u0026ldquo;sharks\u0026rdquo;, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how popular it would be. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking maybe we need some more casual events here like gunslinging or Intro Pack duels thing that WOTC staff sometimes talk about \u0026ndash; we don\u0026rsquo;t usually have that sort of thing in local events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, we couldn\u0026rsquo;t come up with a clear solution to make Prerelease events easier for new guys, but it\u0026rsquo;s worth a thought, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n",
