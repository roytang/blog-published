Here are some other annoyances I encountered (just a quick brain dump):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Comelec BEI and volunteers may be uncoordinated. I went to a waiting room at the first floor and got a number and was told to wait for my batch of 10 to be sent to the voting room at the second floor. After about an hour, we found out the voting room wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware numbers were being given out and had let some people start voting already. We went upstairs flailing like an angry mob and were fortunately given priority.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePeople (i.e. idiots) keep trying to get ahead of people who were there before them, adding to the confusion. I was especially annoyed at a bunch of senior citizens who pushed ahead of us in line and saying they should be first because they were almost fainting from the heat. I understand that old people deserve some consideration, but even after they were told that they would be processed after the current people in line (about five people, including me) they still went ahead and basically forced the Comelec people to process them.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBecause there were a lot of idiots trying to get ahead, and of course the people in line being angry about the idiots, the Comelec BEI were quite flustered and themselves frustrated at the situation. They\u0026rsquo;re not used to handling this many people \u0026ndash; I remember during previous elections it would take us twenty minutes tops to get in, fill up the ballot and be done. This time it took me about an hour once I actually got into the voting room.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAs a software engineer, I hate inefficiencies and there were quite a number in their procedures. The \u0026ldquo;book\u0026rdquo; of voter registration records for each precinct was needed in two queues \u0026ndash; the one for getting the ballot and the one for putting the thumb print and indelible ink. So if you were in one queue and the voter book for your precinct was being used in the other queue\u0026hellip; you\u0026rsquo;d have to wait! It seems they also\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePCOS machine glitches \u0026ndash; happened twice, once before I went into the voting room and once while I was in line to put my ballot in. Apparently the machine only needed to be rebooted.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall it took me around 2 hours, including the stupid waiting period caused by #1. I cast the 26th ballot in my clustered precinct, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how it\u0026rsquo;s possible to finish 1,000 voters at this rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite all the problems, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to thank the Comelec staff once you\u0026rsquo;re done, they\u0026rsquo;re overworked and underpaid, they could use the boost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood luck to those who have yet to vote, may your experience be smoother than mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eFor President, I\u0026rsquo;m voting \u003cstrong\u003eDick Gordon\u003c/strong\u003e, because I believe that the Philippines should be a meritocracy where people are chosen as leaders based on the strength of their accomplishments and qualifications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Vice President, I\u0026rsquo;m voting for \u003cstrong\u003eMar Roxas\u003c/strong\u003e, as he\u0026rsquo;s simply the most qualified and with the strongest history of government service. The E-VAT thing is actually a plus for him, as it shows he has the capacity to make difficult decisions if needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Senators:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSonia Roco:\u003c/strong\u003e I believe she will live up to the advocacies espoused by her husband the late Raul Roco (whom I voted for in 2004). Focus: Education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRisa Hontiveros:\u003c/strong\u003e A solid history of advocacy and support for pro-people legislation during her two terms as AKBAYAN party-list representative. Focus: Healthcare, Women\u0026rsquo;s Rights\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNeric Acosta:\u003c/strong\u003e Former teacher and three-term congressman of Bukidon, with legislative history focusing on environmental concerns. Focus: Environment\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMartin Bautista:\u003c/strong\u003e A successful doctor in the US, decided to come back to the Philippines to offer to serve the country. Focus: Healthcare, including reproductive health\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlex Lacson:\u003c/strong\u003e I have to admit, I\u0026rsquo;m only voting for him because of his book \u0026ldquo;12 Little Things A Pinoy Can Do To Help His Country.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m a sucker for anyone who is able to point out to Filipinos that change has to start with ourselves, even with little things. It\u0026rsquo;s good to have new faces in the Senate instead of just the same old trapos. Focus: education, employment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdel Tamano:\u003c/strong\u003e Originally I wanted to avoid voting for any NP candidates, given how ticked off I am by MV. But unlike the presidential race which is all-or-nothing, I prefer giving other parties some space in the senatorial race so that the Senate won\u0026rsquo;t be a rubber stamp of the administration. Tamano is a good choice, he\u0026rsquo;s another former educator (was head of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila) and adds representation for Mindanao\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePia Cayetano:\u003c/strong\u003e The only other NP senator I\u0026rsquo;m voting for. Her advocacies include health, education, environment, youth and women\u0026rsquo;s empowerment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMiriam Santiago:\u003c/strong\u003e A lot of people don\u0026rsquo;t like Miriam for various reasons (\u003cem\u003eluka-luka, madaldal\u003c/em\u003e were some of the reasons people cited), but I\u0026rsquo;m not the sort of person to dismiss someone just because she doesn\u0026rsquo;t follow social conventions. Miriam has been around a while and doesn\u0026rsquo;t take any BS from anybody. Her presence in the Senate will keep people honest because she likes to call a spade a spade. At the very least, it will keep the Senate interesting. Focus: ???\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m stopping at eight senators for now. None of the others particularly appeal to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Mayor/Vice Mayor of Quezon City, I\u0026rsquo;m going with \u003cstrong\u003eBautista/Belmonte\u003c/strong\u003e, mostly because I trust that Sonny Belmonte wouldn\u0026rsquo;t choose idiots to take over after his well-respected term as mayor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Congressman and District councilors, I\u0026rsquo;m abstaining. I don\u0026rsquo;t know who the candidates are, and even worse, I\u0026rsquo;m voting in a different district than where I\u0026rsquo;m currently residing, I have no right to decide the fate of district 3.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor party-list, I choose \u003cstrong\u003eAGHAM\u003c/strong\u003e party list (same one I voted for last time). It\u0026rsquo;s sad that they are supporting Villar, but I\u0026rsquo;ll just overlook that since I\u0026rsquo;m strongly leaning towards their Science and Technology advocacy. S\u0026amp;T; isn\u0026rsquo;t usually a concern of ordinary Filipinos, but that\u0026rsquo;s something that has to change as it\u0026rsquo;s one of the ways we can climb out of where we are now and attempt to become an industrialized country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhew, composing this post took a while. I have to admit some of my choices were rushed (particularly for Senator), as most of my decision-making energy was spent researching the Presidentiables. Although things can still change between now and Monday, this will probably be close to my final ballot.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
