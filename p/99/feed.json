Lots of funny gags and one-liners\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI felt like some of the character/background development stuff was pushed a bit too hard as well\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe movie\u0026rsquo;s plot also felt a bit thin and straightforward. I mean, you could see some of the major plot points coming a mile away. Maybe from the trailers even\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStar Lord was ok. Gamora/Nebula felt poorly written. Rocket was a bit annoying. Drax and Mantis were ok, although the space they have for Mantis\u0026rsquo; character overlaps with Drax a bit. I\u0026rsquo;m still not super happy with how Drax and Gamora are characterized in the MCU.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m less happy with this movie\u0026rsquo;s soundtrack compared to the first one\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMagugustuhan ba ni Mama: Certainly not. In fact, she chose to derp around the mall instead of coming with me and my cousin to watch.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIMAX or not: Some visuals used the 3d effect, but nothing too exaggerated or critical. I\u0026rsquo;d say IMAX optional, but it definitely adds something to some scenes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere are five extra scenes near the credits (one of them is right before the credits roll, so I can\u0026rsquo;t really say \u0026ldquo;post-credit\u0026rdquo; screens). Most of them are just setting the tone for the inevitable GOTG3\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdditionally, just pay attention to the background of the credits roll as well, it\u0026rsquo;s great\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhile I felt the movie was ok, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of just more of the same of what we got with the first movie, which felt a lot stronger overall\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpoilers follow:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt would have been silly to expect Ego the Living Planet to have his Marvel comics appearance of a planet with a face, but guess what, we actually got it!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStallone as Starhawk and Yondu being officially a member of the \u0026ldquo;original Guardians\u0026rdquo; team was great. Oh and apparently Michael Rosenbaum was Martinex!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Stan Lee cameo here was really meant to push the \u0026ldquo;Stan Lee has been playing the same character in all his cameos\u0026rdquo; narrative\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGiving Peter a Zune was a cruel joke on Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s expense, but sets us up for more music (maybe from later decades even!) for the 3rd movie\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLots of random other Marvel fan-service cameo appearances too: Watchers, Cosmo, Howard the Duck, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure I missed/forgot quite a lot more\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",
