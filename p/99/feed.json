But when there\u0026rsquo;s a local Grand Prix, oldies like me crawl out of the woodwork and try to believe we can still do well in a tournament with minimal prep. Grand Prix Manila 2017 was to be Standard format, held on June 2-4, 2017, at the SMX convention center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the start of the year I already knew I would be playing in this year\u0026rsquo;s GP Manila, but since I hadn\u0026rsquo;t played Standard for well over a year, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really know what I would be playing. But I started keeping track of what decks there were in the metagame. Sadly, the meta was not so good, with an oppressive combo deck dominating the field. Like many others, I assumed there would be a ban at some point, which means I couldn\u0026rsquo;t commit to a deck too early.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI only decided on a deck after the B\u0026amp;R announcement shortly before the release of Amonkhet. At that point, looking at the available cards we had, I settled on trying to put together the Temur Marvel deck. It took me a couple of weeks to put the deck together, then I ran it through an FNM and a couple of other smaller tournaments. I was satisfied enough to play it for the grinders on Friday, Day 0 of GP Manila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#243872face3074cb118385fc24ba20f9-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2017/06/grand-prix-manila-2017/content_ulamog__ceaseless1_hu3c722e712e3ec2690195359d25ceb843_65428_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"If you\u0026#39;re playing Standard this year, you\u0026#39;re familiar with this guy\" title=\"If you\u0026#39;re playing Standard this year, you\u0026#39;re familiar with this guy\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re playing Standard this year, you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with this guy (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"243872face3074cb118385fc24ba20f9-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2017/06/grand-prix-manila-2017/content_ulamog__ceaseless1.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re playing Standard this year, you\u0026#39;re familiar with this guy\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"15 Jun 2017 4:22am\"\u003e15 Jun 2017 4:22am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDay 0 \u0026ndash; Friday, June 2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I\u0026rsquo;m from Quezon City, the venue is quite far, and to be honest I was a bit stressed out at the idea of commuting to SMX three days in a row. But still I went. I started out determined to play as many Standard grinders as a I could on Day 0, both to up my chance of earning byes for the GP and to give me more familiarity with my deck. Unfortunately, things did not go so well. I ended up 2-6 for the day, not even earning any prize points. I played quite a few mirror matches, something I hadn\u0026rsquo;t been able to do in my previous tests. It gave me some insights so even though I came home late that night, I stayed up late tweaking the main deck and the sideboard based on what I learned during the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDay 1 \u0026ndash; Saturday, June 3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI woke up early and took the train.

opposing side. I also dropped down to 3 Ulamogs because it felt like I often got stupid hands with 2 or 3 of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadly, most of my tweaks didn\u0026rsquo;t matter much as I performed terribly. Here\u0026rsquo;s my day 1 record:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR01 1-2 LOSS vs UR Kefnet Both games he won, he had the turn 3 Kefnet which I had no answer for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR02 1-2 LOSS vs RB Hazoret. This deck is great and fun, and the matches were really close, but eventually I ran out of Marvel spins\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR03 1-2 LOSS vs UW Flash. I had a Marvel, but it ran into a Spell Queller. In desperation I tried to kill the Queller while he was tapped out, spun into a second Marvel, spun again into nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR04 2-0 WIN vs Monoblack Zombies\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR05 0-2 LOSS vs Temur Marvel. Made the mistake of spinning on my turn when he had 6 energy. My ulamog died to his ulamog\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDROP\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like I didn\u0026rsquo;t make any particularly bad plays during the first 3 rounds. The Marvel spins just didn\u0026rsquo;t work out for me. I may have been already starting to feel the lack of sleep during round 5 so that\u0026rsquo;s a thing. (I immediately went home to sleep after dropping.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir decks did seem particularly tuned towards beating Marvel. That\u0026rsquo;s one of the big downsides of just netdecking the dominant deck \u0026ndash; everyone\u0026rsquo;s gunning for you. The lack of prep time was really hard on me too. The last time I did well in a Grand Prix was \u003ca href=\"/2015/02/grand-prix-manila-2015/\"\u003eGP Manila back in 2015\u003c/a\u003e, and that time I had been playing Jeskai for months before the GP. Unfortunately I had been caught between a rock and a hard place \u0026ndash; if i had assembled a deck months before it likely would have been Saheeli combo (since I used to play Twin in Modern), which meant I would have been the victim of the bannings. Ah well, can\u0026rsquo;t dwell on the past too much. Have to note it for next time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill there be a next time? On the bus ride home I was so dejected at the poor performance I wondered if I was just done with Standard forever. But I suppose it depends largely on the metagame; Marvel was pretty bad whether you were playing it or against it. In any case, I\u0026rsquo;m also somehow qualified for Nationals this year, so at the very least I\u0026rsquo;m playing Standard again in September. (Mostly because I want the promo Inkmoth Nexus)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDay 2 \u0026ndash; Sunday, June 4\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to come back to just play for some prizes in side events (and also because I had to return some cards I borrowed). Day two had one of my favorite side events: Chaos Sealed! I played this after scrubbing out of \u003ca href=\"/2015/06/gp-singapore-2015/\"\u003eGP Singapore 2015\u003c/a\u003e, so this may become a day two tradition for me lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Chaos Sealed, I got dealt the following boosters: EMA, MMA2017, BFZ, SOI, Dissension and Torment. I think I got a pretty good pool, value-wise:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#17cf8a76d3dc0e759d722d4850666fb5-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2017/06/grand-prix-manila-2017/I_guess_my_chaos_sealed_pool_was_okay__mtg__gpmanila_hud1c15aeffeabc6a49464075149c8e929_72157_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"(No, I didnt dare play or shuffle the FOW)\" title=\"(No, I didnt dare play or shuffle the FOW)\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e(No, I didnt dare play or shuffle the FOW) (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"17cf8a76d3dc0e759d722d4850666fb5-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2017/06/grand-prix-manila-2017/I_guess_my_chaos_sealed_pool_was_okay__mtg__gpmanila.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e(No, I didnt dare play or shuffle the FOW)\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"15 Jun 2017 4:22am\"\u003e15 Jun 2017 4:22am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy pool was kinda light on removal, but I had like a Llanowar Elf and some basic land search and three signets, so I decided to just ramp into some Eldrazi! A number of people were shocked that I decided to run the Ulamog, and a friend even told me I\u0026rsquo;d never be able to cast it. I sent him a picture of that Ulamog ready to attack for lethal on the first game in the first round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went 3-2 with my pool. My losses were to a Deadeye Navigator (that guy is a nightmare to get rid of) and to a deck that was almost entirely removal (I died to a Control Magic\u0026rsquo;ed Benthic Infiltrator. More like InfilTRAITOR amirite?). Not bad. I won enough points to split a box with some guys, and the FOW/ Ulamog meant I came out ahead value-wise. The sad thing about these events is that they\u0026rsquo;re among the last to finish, so the prize wall is kinda cleared out by then and we weren\u0026rsquo;t able to get a Kaladesh box, had to settle for Amonkhet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#91d9d85a479bafb614db4966a5ecd0dc-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2017/06/grand-prix-manila-2017/_hu36b6b4b16628ee0116560a8cc1f7ad73_105963_7ddfc9cb433678dba257f6bfe832323d.jpg\" alt=\"GP Manila Loot\" title=\"GP Manila Loot\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eGP Manila Loot (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"91d9d85a479bafb614db4966a5ecd0dc-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2017/06/grand-prix-manila-2017/gpmanila_loot._Maybe_next_time_I_should_stick_to_side_events_lol__mtg.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eGP Manila Loot\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"15 Jun 2017 4:22am\"\u003e15 Jun 2017 4:22am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCompetitively the GP was a bust for me, but at least I came away with some swag and some packs.

But when there\u0026rsquo;s a local Grand Prix, oldies like me crawl out of the woodwork and try to believe we can still do well in a tournament with minimal prep. Grand Prix Manila 2017 was to be Standard format, held on June 2-4, 2017, at the SMX convention center.\nAt the start of the year I already knew I would be playing in this year\u0026rsquo;s GP Manila, but since I hadn\u0026rsquo;t played Standard for well over a year, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really know what I would be playing.",

I\u0026rsquo;ve only been here twice, but I could imagine myself living here for an extended period of time. It solves my top three problems with Metro Manila: overly hot weather, poor transportation options, and poor internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth visits I found the temperatures to be within the generally agreeable range of around 5-25 degrees celsius. The low end is slightly too cold, but manageable. Of course, I haven\u0026rsquo;t experienced actual Japanese winter, so it\u0026rsquo;s probably colder then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTransportation is great and easy! There\u0026rsquo;s like twenty lines of trains or such _(OK, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really count, but there\u0026rsquo;s a lot!) _and a lot of buses too. The great thing is that the trains and buses run on very exact schedules. At trains stations or bus stops you\u0026rsquo;ll see a list of times \u003cem\u003eto the minute\u003c/em\u003e telling you when the next train or bus will arrive. That kind of thing would be unheard of in Metro Manila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the downsides is that the train lines can get a bit confusing. They\u0026rsquo;re not all interconnected either \u0026ndash; there\u0026rsquo;s some lines that are part of the Tokyo Metro, while some are part of JR (Japan Rail), and so on. It can cause some confusion for example some places might have both a Metro station and a JR station, and they might not be connected. The staff are always very helpful in the train stations though, feel free to ask them how to get to a particular station. They will try their best to help even if their English isn\u0026rsquo;t the best. Most stations will also have helpful signage showing maps and routes and stuff, and the trains themselves will have announcers telling you what the next station is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#11d3f8bbfdd13f862ba1e9dae7e6c197-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2015/11/10154222289158912/_hu319931c2e543c418fa0fa1eb79b01977_85598_bd5d9f53df750d5f0e836fa32b6a9590.jpg\" alt=\"Even though most signs aren\u0026#39;t in English, they should be fairly easy to understand\" title=\"Even though most signs aren\u0026#39;t in English, they should be fairly easy to understand\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eEven though most signs aren\u0026rsquo;t in English, they should be fairly easy to understand (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"11d3f8bbfdd13f862ba1e9dae7e6c197-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2015/11/10154222289158912/12299236_10154222295183912_2882233159207648588_n_10154222295183912.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eEven though most signs aren\u0026#39;t in English, they should be fairly easy to understand\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"13 Jun 2017 1:30am\"\u003e13 Jun 2017 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2015/11/10154222289158912/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eFor paying your transportation fares, there\u0026rsquo;s a few options, but for me the best one is to use an IC card \u0026ndash; these are reloadable cards that you can use on any train or bus in Tokyo. _(I have no idea what IC means.) _You can get one at the airport when you arrive \u0026ndash; there\u0026rsquo;s two providers, it\u0026rsquo;s either Suica or Pasmo and you can reload them at any train station. There\u0026rsquo;s also an option to get a 2-day or 3-day unlimited metro pass, which is a great idea if you plan to travel around Tokyo many times within a short period, but it only works with Metro lines which can be a bit restrictive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInternet in Tokyo is obviously very good of course. If you\u0026rsquo;re staying at an Airbnb, try to get one that provides you with a mobile wifi unit you can use while wandering about.

            "title": "Review: Persona 5 (You Never Saw It Coming)",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eMy first Persona game was Persona 4 Golden on the Vita \u0026ndash; a fantastic game. After that I dived into Persona 3 Portable and eventually the spin-off games Persona 4 Arena (and Ultimax) and Persona Q on 3DS. So it was no surprise that one of the game releases I was most looking forward to this year would be the next numbered game in the series: Persona 5 on the Playstation 4.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike P4G before it, the focus is on the school life of a young man forced into a new environment, interspersed with some good old JRPG dungeon crawling. You meet a ragtag group of misfits and somehow band together to save all of Japanese society from itself. Or something to that extent. This is just an excuse to dump some screens of P5, so let\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"#resources\"\u003eget that out of the way\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe JRPG side streamlines a lot of the problems from P4G: the main story dungeons are hand-built JRPG style dungeons and there are save points in between to make dying not so much of a pain. Even on normal difficulty, I still managed to die a few times \u0026ndash; notably to those Angel enemies that tend to suicide when low on life. And they brought back Persona negotiation! I didn\u0026rsquo;t appreciate this too much in \u003cem\u003eShin Megami Tensei IV\u003c/em\u003e as it felt a bit obtuse there, but here the Persona\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;personality\u0026rdquo; is shown which makes it easier to figure out the \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be leading a team of thieves there\u0026rsquo;s also a bit of a \u0026ldquo;stealth system\u0026rdquo; while dungeon crawling. It\u0026rsquo;s not a very deep stealth system, basically just hide behind corners and ambush enemies to gain battle advantage. The only problem is that the camera and the controls don\u0026rsquo;t always agree with your stealth plans, and sometimes the wrong button press can lead you to disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Phantom Thieves story is okay, although most of the plot is telegraphed ahead of time. I kind of liked P4G\u0026rsquo;s big murder mystery where you had to figure out who among your confidants was a big ‘ol bad guy. Here in P5, it\u0026rsquo;s painfully obvious who sold you out, even if you hadn\u0026rsquo;t noticed his \u0026ldquo;mistake\u0026rdquo; early on. That being said, there is a surprise twist near the end that caught me by surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompared to P4G, Persona 5 comes out at the height of social media, so while I like the P4G\u0026rsquo;s battle theme a bit better, P5\u0026rsquo;s battle music has managed to become a meme of its own:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"\u003e\n  \u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WUWQFnC2zqU\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI must\u0026rsquo;ve seen this video at least 50 times now due to some of my friends (you know who you are).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing I dislike about the Persona series is that because of the time management aspect of the game, a lot of things are missable. Since I tend to play RPGs without any guides or walkthroughs the first time around, it\u0026rsquo;s problematic for me. This means that on my first run through I missed completing the Confidants/Social Links, even though when I started the run I told myself I\u0026rsquo;d prioritize them over other activities. Definitely need a second run for the platinum. (Of course, I have yet to platinum P4G either due to a mistake I made during the second run~)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion: Despite (or maybe because of?) it\u0026rsquo;s ridiculousness, Persona 5 is a great game. Story is tight, and the dungeon crawling has been streamlined a lot. That being said, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely not a game for everyone, mostly because of the style. If you dislike Japanese stuff or anime or anything turn-based, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely not for you. Go play Call of Duty or something. For everyone else, enjoy one of the year\u0026rsquo;s best JRPGs (sorry FF15!)\u003c/p\u003e\n",
