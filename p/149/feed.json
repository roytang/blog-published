This leads to the Senate race getting less attention and comparably less information is available about the senatorial candidates. The senators matter too, since they affect the legislative agenda and may also run for higher office in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was thinking that maybe we as a community might help put together some information on the candidates to help us voters decide who to include in our ballots come election day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s what I propose: I\u0026rsquo;ll post a comment below for each of the senatorial candidates, along with a short summary of what party they are running under and what positions they have held previously and a link to their wikipedia article, if any. Feel free to upvote candidates you support, but please don\u0026rsquo;t downvote candidates you dislike (that\u0026rsquo;s not how the ballots work after all!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen let\u0026rsquo;s reply to each comment with more information about each candidate, whether pro or con. Please note that some positions may be held which are pro for some voters yet con for others. Please be respectful of the others\u0026rsquo;  opinions! I have to admit I don\u0026rsquo;t have too much information yet about many of them, but I\u0026rsquo;ll try to add what I can as well!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit: Whew, ang effort ilagay lahat, over 50 candidates! I had a script to generate the comment for each one but it turns out I had to edit individually dahil sa reddit formatting. Sana hindi masayang ang effort hehe.

The mods tried setting the thread to contest mode (so that the scores aren\u0026rsquo;t visible), but sadly nagka-issue where nung enabled ang contest mode, hindi na visible lahat ng comments, which was a worse outcome.

Senate standing committees to conduct inquiries in aid of legislation and led the Chamber in opposing the Executive Order No. 264 which prohibits the Members of the Cabinet from going into the hearings of the Congress, the Senate in particular without permission from the President and in opposing the Proclamation No. 1017 which imposes state of national emergency in the country\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(During Aquino\u0026rsquo;s time) He likewise primarily authored a law that creates an oversight body of all government owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) which would check them from incurring financial excesses and as well as ensuring their financial stability and makes them fiscally responsible . On 2012, after Senator Ralph Recto stepped down as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means, Drilon as its Vice-Chairman took over as its new Chairman and worked firmly for the enactment of the Sin Tax Law that would impose higher taxes on the cigarettes and liquors. Drilon proudly called it as \u0026ldquo;anti-cancer law\u0026rdquo; for he firmly believes that the law would discourage the people from taking cigarettes so that they will not suffer lung
