Not only is change coming, change is already here. The campaign period has changed our country, and the change is for the worse. His supporters openly and proudly threaten violence against anyone who disagrees with their opinion. There are even reports of others being threatened or harassed in real life simply for harassing other candidates. They either knowingly spread misinformation and half-truths, or can\u0026rsquo;t be bothered to verify the information they\u0026rsquo;re spreading.

I would like to hope that he would not push our society further in the direction of violence and authoritarianism. I would like to hope that the supporters do not become even more insufferable in the wake of victory. I would like to hope that we can move past the level of vitriol and toxicity throughout this campaign peri\u003c/p\u003e\n",
