For me, the term invokes the names Frank and Joe before the Matt and Jeff of WWE fame. We had a fairly wide collection of the blue-hardcovered books of those days. And I believe I made the effort to read every single book in that particular series, through borrowing and such. I think I was successful, but I can\u0026rsquo;t be sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case , that meant this article piqued my interest:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/01/reading-hardy-boys-nostalgia-disappointment-racism/581071/\"\u003eThe Knotty Nostalgia of the Hardy Boys Series\u003c/a\u003e\nWhy one writer still reads the wildly popular books with a mixture of love and disappointment, 60 years after they were revised to remove racist content\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReading the series as a child, I never felt any serious racist undertones, probably because the versions I had were already torn down. Or more likely, because as a child I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any real concept of race. Sure, Frank and Joe were depicted as white kids on the book covers, but that meant nothing to this brown kid from Asia, even though I was certainly aware of caucasians and blacks by then. As far as I was concerned, I could have been mixed in with their crowd with no issues. I even remember specifically the Hidden Harbor book mentioned in the article, there were some characters who spoke with a southern accent, I guess they were meant to be black? But I never imagined them in my head as any different from their northern visitors. (There was this one character named Grover who in my head looked like a blue muppet\u0026hellip;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur copies of those Hardy Boys books are long gone, but like the article\u0026rsquo;s author I still look back at them with a tinge of nostalgia. I did learn a lot from those books, from vocabulary to American culture to different kinds of hobbies. I think the main charm of the Chet Morton character mentioned in the article is that with every book he always had a new, different hobby, and in that way the teenage readers could learn about some new field or possible area of interest. Later on, we also encountered softbound books of a later Hardy Boys series \u003cem\u003eThe Hardy Boys Casefiles\u003c/em\u003e, which was more dark (one of the character\u0026rsquo;s girlfriends got killed), but they lacked the charm, templating or formularity of the old ones, and we never got more than a few books from that series.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if these books are still available locally, I don\u0026rsquo;t recall seeing them in bookstores. I think they would still be pretty good reading for young boys these days - the Hardy Boys seem like they\u0026rsquo;d be good role models, they\u0026rsquo;re smart, they do well in school, they\u0026rsquo;re friendly and accepting and they obey the law and perhaps most importantly, they exhibit a sense of curiosity and adventure about the world around them, something many kids these days seem to lose as they grow up.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Between the ages of 10-12, my reading diet consisted almost exclusively of the teenage-targetted detective series The Hardy Boys. For me, the term invokes the names Frank and Joe before the Matt and Jeff of WWE fame. We had a fairly wide collection of the blue-hardcovered books of those days. And I believe I made the effort to read every single book in that particular series, through borrowing and such. I think I was successful, but I can\u0026rsquo;t be sure.",

In fairness to old me, at that time the IDEs didn\u0026rsquo;t support a real dark mode - only the editor area had the dark background and light text, while the rest of the application\u0026rsquo;s chrome still sported the OS default (but you could change the OS default I believe).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure when it happened, but sometime over the next few years I had a change of heart and started defaulting to dark mode themes whenever possible, and not just for programming IDEs.

I recently found the stylesheets and such for my old django-powered blog from circa 2008-2009, and recently there\u0026rsquo;s been this \u0026ldquo;10-year challenge\u0026rdquo; meme where people show how they\u0026rsquo;ve changed over the past 10 years. Tt felt like a pefect opportunity to reconstruct that old version and also capture an image of the current version for posterity\u0026rsquo;s sake.

I used to pretty hyped for superhero movie trailers, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t bother watching this one yet. MCU still has two more movies coming out before this one, and I\u0026rsquo;m already hyped enough for those, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I have hype to spare for a third one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brother was complaining to me about the trailer, saying he was spoiled about some elements. Specifically, he wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware that [actor] was in the movie playing [villain]. I keep up with comic book news, so that wasn\u0026rsquo;t news for me, but I can see how disappointing it might be. Also, this seems to be typical - I check the first trailer for \u003cem\u003eSpider-Man Homecoming\u003c/em\u003e and it did show Michael Keaton\u0026rsquo;s Vulture. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to avoid the villain info, few people consider it a spoiler, it\u0026rsquo;s usually right there in the IMDB page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do think that trailers these days show too much though. During the past few years, I\u0026rsquo;ve been avoiding watching any trailer beyond the first one that comes out. Although given that I follow comic book news, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to avoid spoilers from succeeding trailer. Starting with the new Spider-Man I\u0026rsquo;m considering not watching any trailers at all (at least until I\u0026rsquo;m forced to watch one before an actual movie).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might also be a problem with these comic book movies that they come from an established IP - so someone familiar with the source material like me basically already has an idea of what stuff might happen. The title alone of \u003cem\u003eAvengers Infinity War\u003c/em\u003e gave me an idea of what happens in the movie after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think the perfect trailer for a completely new franchise gives you a taste of what\u0026rsquo;s to come without giving you details of the major conflict and so on. The \u003cem\u003eCaptain Marvel\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eShazam\u003c/em\u003e trailers have been pretty good in this regard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a sequel, the perfect trailer for me would be the first trailer for \u003cem\u003eAvengers: Endgame\u003c/em\u003e, which basically acted as a \u0026ldquo;story so far\u0026rdquo;, giving no new info that we didn\u0026rsquo;t know from \u003cem\u003eInfinity War\u003c/em\u003e. Other than the actual movie\u0026rsquo;s title at least, which I had been anticipating for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

(I should really learn the names of cards). Selesnya is also pretty good - they have access to both Knight of Autumn and Wildgrowth Walker, so it\u0026rsquo;s kind of a nightmare. And then of course there\u0026rsquo;s those control decks that have Absorb AND \u0026ldquo;Gain 3 life draw a card\u0026rdquo; AND Moment of Craving.

Golgari\u0026rsquo;s advantage is that your creatures are generally of higher quality and will win over theirs (except maybe for Chainwhirler). Find, Vivien, Karn, and even small Vraska are good for getting your second wind and refilling your hand after stabilizing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also run 1 Brontodon in the main, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think I can cut the reapers, as I\u0026rsquo;ve won a few close fights just by chump blocking with creatures to draw cards and find my answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I think the matchup overall is about 50-50, maybe 55-45 in Golgari\u0026rsquo;s favor, and your win rate goes up if you get at least one life gain off Wildgrowth Walker. The 3 out of the 4 games I lost I either didn\u0026rsquo;t have access to one color, or never got off 2 lands. (I might need to mulligan better or add more duals - I\u0026rsquo;ve been saving my rare WCs so I only have 3 shock 2 check)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve played both decks on Arena; red has some explosive hands, but has a tendency to run out of steam. If they get the nut draw, there\u0026rsquo;s not much you can do, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be down to 6-8 before turn 4.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving wildgrowth isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary to win - 2 out of my 4 wins I didn\u0026rsquo;t draw one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ideal opening hand has 2-3 explore creatures (ideally two 2-drops, squire is preferred over branchwalker and a jadelight) to ensure a steady flow of lands. On turn one you play an elf if you have it, even if you have to use a shock, because they\u0026rsquo;ll bolt it everytime, and 2 \u0026lt;= 2-3. I kind of wish I had been tracking who was going first - I suspect it matters a lot, I\u0026rsquo;ll do that tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want to play creatures on turns 2-3 and just assume they\u0026rsquo;re going to die. You want them to waste their burn spells on your creatures. Play wildgrowth last, but if he\u0026rsquo;s your only guy, it\u0026rsquo;s okay to run him on 2 (especially if you have Find to get him back later).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen exploring during the early turns, send to the graveyard Tyrant, Karn, big Vraska, or Vivienne, those won\u0026rsquo;t be much help. Getting more creatures is better, just make sure you can play them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0026rsquo;re going to stabilize at around turns 4-6, with around 6-10 life, and hopefully the red deck\u0026rsquo;s hand is spent. 6 life is scary - you\u0026rsquo;re basically hoping he doesn\u0026rsquo;t have two bolts, but it happens. Stay scared, never attack without leaving a blocker for a hasted 2/2 mage. You\u0026rsquo;re hoping he doesn\u0026rsquo;t draw LUtS, Risk Factor or Frenzy (frenzy is the worst for him, light up is the best)\u003c/p\u003e\n",
