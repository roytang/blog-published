            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not a big fan of theme parks. I think for the most part they are overpriced and not worth the time, effort or money. And I\u0026rsquo;d probably never go to one by myself or without one of my nieces/nephews. I understand the impetus of bringing kids to a theme park of course, they really enjoy it. Prior to this trip, I\u0026rsquo;ve only ever been to a theme park once, and that was in Unversal Studios Singapore with my brothers back in 2015.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time we went to Disneyland in Anaheim and Universal Studios Hollywood. The kids with us were the nieces, 9yo and 3yo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously, the kids loved Disneyland. We got a 3 day pass and spent the first day in Disneyland Park and the next 2 days in California Adventure. The kids had been to the Asian Disneylands before, so there was more new stuff for them in the California Adventure side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisiting Disneyland reminded me of what a cultural tour de force Disney is in general. Kids from all the over the world come visit Disneyland and they instantly recognize and respond to all of these characters. When the nieces spot one of the mascots walking around they just shout out in glee and run up and wave to them. Yes, even the older niece. It\u0026rsquo;s not just the major Disney characters like Mickey and Minnie and Donald either. Kids respond well even to the minor characters or the obscure ones from random Disney channel shows. Disneyland really is for kids. (On a less Disney-branded note, I was also amused by how kids everywhere react the same way to bubbles being blown their way.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome highlights of the 3 days at Disneyland:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea short play re-telling \u003cem\u003eTangled\u003c/em\u003e. Well, I only note this because I haven\u0026rsquo;t watched Tangled before and only now found out its story\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe Disneyland parade that happen at the main central area. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty long, and the music can get repetitive and earwormy, but I liked how they highlighted a bunch of their properties like Aladdin, Little Mermaid, etc., though there were some weird choices there too\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOn the California Adventure side, the best thing was the live action \u003cem\u003eFrozen\u003c/em\u003e play at the Hyperion theatre. It\u0026rsquo;s a one hour re-telling of the movie (with a few liberties taken), with all the songs and everything. The performances were great, and the entire show in general was a masterful use of the stage, props, lighting, projectors, holograms, etc. It\u0026rsquo;s not the sort of show they could stage at just any theatre either. Having two nieces I have of course seen the movie a few dozen times so one would think I\u0026rsquo;d be tired of it by now, but I was very entertained.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethere was also this nice Toy Story-themed game/ride where you used a virtual gun to shoot at targets like in a carnival, it was fun. If you only had time for one ride in California Adventure, this is the one I\u0026rsquo;d recommend\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe did quite a number of other simpler rides (just the ones where you\u0026rsquo;re sitting and there\u0026rsquo;s a show going on around you), and picture taking with various characters. I don\u0026rsquo;t have many pictures handy to show here, but here\u0026rsquo;s me with Captain America:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#ef882e40c2c830cfa503b50c25f4608d-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2019/06/us-2019-theme-parks/disney-cap_huc09fd31ce9bb786d1041f70ffa59556f_765953_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"ef882e40c2c830cfa503b50c25f4608d-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2019/06/us-2019-theme-parks/disney-cap.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"9 Jun 2019 5:56am\"\u003e9 Jun 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn\u0026rsquo;t do anything like roller coasters or that new Guardians of the Galaxy which goes up and down and stuff. The kids don\u0026rsquo;t like it, and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I could either, tbh. There was also a lot of wandering around the mechandise shops of course, I\u0026rsquo;m sure they make a lot of money off all the toys. I ended up buying something my brother requested for my nephew, only to find it available again at another place for a cheaper price. Lol, I should learn never to buy stuff at theme parks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Anaheim, we took a short train over to LA, and we went to Universal Studios Hollywood. This theme park is not as kid-focused as Disneyland was, so the 3yo didn\u0026rsquo;t have as much of a good time, though she did enjoy seeing characters like the Simpsons, Harry Potter, and so on. The rides are also for bigger kids mostly - they\u0026rsquo;re the sort of rides that are full of high-speed movement, jumping and jerking around, some falling and so on. I only did the Transformers ride (which was the same as the one in Singapore) and the Minions ride, I already got a bit dizzy just from those two. I suspect the Harry Potter one was more intense (just based on the warnings), but there was like an 80 minute wait for that so we didn\u0026rsquo;t bother. I did enjoy walking around the Simpsons area and seeing all the references and the characters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also did the Studio Tour, which is really for movie geeks than anyone else, so again the kids didn\u0026rsquo;t enjoy it as much. The first part was a bit boring, just showing us the exteriors of the sound stages (basically just looking at warehouses). Things got a bit more interesting when they showed us some exterior locations, and there were a few parts where we got to experience a bit of a show . The \u0026ldquo;shows\u0026rdquo; were basically projected into a tunnel while our trams moved around. One was a Skull Island themed scene where King Kong was fighting a t-rex or such, and another was Fast and Furious themed which involved a high speed chase and jumping off bridges and such. There was also a special effects part where we were in a subway tunnel when an earthquake strikes, and there\u0026rsquo;s fire and suddenly the tunnel is flooded. I think the studio tour was the highlight for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also attended the special effects show, a 30-minute show demoing various special effects. Again, the 3yo didn\u0026rsquo;t like it so much, especially in the parts where they pretended to saw off a volunteer\u0026rsquo;s hand or send the volunteer flying through space. It was fun for me though, and a bit informative as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had also been planning to go to Legoland near San Diego, but it turns out the trip would\u0026rsquo;ve cost a bit more than we\u0026rsquo;d like, and online reviews said we might be disappointed especially coming from Disneyland, so we ended up not going. Instead we wandered around Hollywood boulevard and went to a few exhibits there - namely Ripley\u0026rsquo;s Believe it or Not, Guinness Book of World Records, and the Hollywood Wax Museum. The Guinness one was the best of the three, as there were a bunch of interactive games and exhibits that we enjoyed. The 3yo didn\u0026rsquo;t like being in the Ripley\u0026rsquo;s or the Wax Museum as she was a bit scared of some of the exhibits. Ripley\u0026rsquo;s had some creepy and weird stuff, including a couple that made the 9yo scream and run in surprise. I did like some of the displays, like the model of Minas Tirith made entirely of matchsticks, or the Darth Vader made out of car parts. The Wax Museum was nice, but didn\u0026rsquo;t have much and was over too quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, the theme park experience was fun. Still not changing my view that they are overpriced, and since I don\u0026rsquo;t have kids, I may never go to a Disneyland ever again, but it\u0026rsquo;s probably good that I got to experience it at least once so I know what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I always find it difficult to sleep on planes, so long hauls are difficult, but I\u0026rsquo;m sure I managed to get a few short bursts of sleep here and there. I suspect the Fitbit is not very well suited to measuring that sort of sleep especially when seated upright in an airplane seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, that is my excuse for not being able to write much. It\u0026rsquo;s likely that this first week will have been the most exhausting part of the trip, this is where we scheduled the California theme parks after all (more on that in the next post). It is of course a net positive that I am walking so much, since this is pretty much the only exercise I get these days. I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about whether I would be able to maintain this level of walking (or even half as much!) when I get back home after the trip, as I have been slacking off on the walking the past few months. Hopefully I can find a way.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

At that rank, I started having trouble with Gruul decks and 4c Dreadhorde decks. I switched to a slightly suboptimal Dreadhorde build (I didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough WCs to get all the Tamiyos), but even then I was frustratingly oscillating between Diamond 3 and Diamond 1 for as long as a week. I finally decided to try the new Golgari LD deck that came out recently (I only built it today!), and it finally let me make that leap from D1 to Mythic.

            "title": "Civilization, Liberal Democracy, and Authoritarianism",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI remember when playing the original version of Civilization \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/ancient-pc-gaming/\"\u003eback in the day\u003c/a\u003e, the \u0026ldquo;most advanced\u0026rdquo; form of government was Democracy, with the only downside of it being you can\u0026rsquo;t declare war (because you had a senate that would stop you.) The other available forms of government were typically not very useful, but Democracy massively increased your trade output, so most often I would build the Pyramids (a wonder which allowed switching to any government immediately and without penalty), and spend the rest of the game toggling between Democracy and Despotism (for when I wanted to go to war).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis made the game heavily slanted in favor of Western-style democracies, which was understandable for that time period. Around that era, the Soviet Union had just fallen, and the liberal democracy practiced by the United States, the one remaining superpower, became the shining example of a successful government that brought propserity to its citizens. I think that having grown up in this era and having been exposed to a lot of American culture (via TV and games and so forth) has led to my general bias in favor of liberal democracy and the values associated with it - freedom, equality, civil liberties, human rights, due process, checks and balances, separation of powers, and so on. (I cannot say the same is true for other people in my generation).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days, the modern versions of Civilization have matured in terms of how they handle governments, recognizing that modern governments have different approaches that are not necessarily represented by \u0026ldquo;democracy\u0026rdquo;. Civ 6 presents three choices for modern governments: Democracy, Communism, and Fascism; Civ 5 lets you choose between ideologies: Freedom, Order, or Autocracy. Perhaps this is a reflection of modern geopolitics, where not only is the United States teetering on the brink of authoritarianism, despite being the lone superpower, but those daring to challenge its hegemony are leaning more towards authoritarian governments as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from America\u0026rsquo;s traditional enemies like Russia and Iran, the starkest challenge comes from China, the juggernaut of Asia. Perhaps the ultimate counterexample to the idea that liberal democracy is the key to prosperity, China has been able to bring an economic boom to its citizens, leveraging the weight of a billion-person size market, all while retaining the trappings of power centralized in the state instead of the people. Censorship, propaganda, and adherence to the party are the norm, and those who dare speak out against the party are punished viciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was thinking about all of this after a recent discussion with some Duterte supporters over at \u003ca href=\"https://reddit.com/r/philippines\"\u003er/PH on reddit\u003c/a\u003e. The arguments in favor of the Duterte administration seem to stem around seeing him as a leader that \u0026ldquo;gets things done\u0026rdquo; (in quotes because I\u0026rsquo;m not sure quantifiably that he is getting things done more than other presidents), without regard for the damage to liberal values such as human rights, due process, checks and balances, and so on. Indeed even during the 2016 elections you could see some internet commentary stating that the problem with the country was that we had \u0026ldquo;too much freedom\u0026rdquo;, as if freedom were not an ideal to be aspired to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this light, the tendency of this admin to capitulate to China has an ideological angle as well, because China is the epitome of getting things done despite the cost to civil liberties, and of the state accumulating all power onto itself. It is disturbingly a trend not only in the Philippines, but even in a number of Western nations, where far-right parties with tendencies towards extreme nationalism and authoritarianism are gaining steam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve always been of the opinion that the world mostly exists in a state of trying to find balance; most trends wax and wane, trying to find the optimal equilibrium in which to settle. I worry that perhaps liberal democracy\u0026rsquo;s peak days have come and gone, and we are now on the brink on an era where authoritarianism gains ground. I had always hoped that our future was somehow leading to something like a Star Trek-like utopia, but there are plenty of other potential sci-fi future scenarios, not all of them pleasant. We can only hope that things get better before they get worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(I\u0026rsquo;m not a political science expert or anything, so probably I\u0026rsquo;m not exactly using some of these terms accurately, feel free to educate me in the comments if you like.)\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I remember when playing the original version of Civilization back in the day, the \u0026ldquo;most advanced\u0026rdquo; form of government was Democracy, with the only downside of it being you can\u0026rsquo;t declare war (because you had a senate that would stop you.) The other available forms of government were typically not very useful, but Democracy massively increased your trade output, so most often I would build the Pyramids (a wonder which allowed switching to any government immediately and without penalty), and spend the rest of the game toggling between Democracy and Despotism (for when I wanted to go to war).",

I\u0026rsquo;ve written about that separately \u003ca href=\"/2019/05/game-of-thrones/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the US TV series also ended their runs in May. Arrowverse show seasons were littered with poor writing as usual. I rank the seasons in this order:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ebest is \u003cem\u003eLegends of Tomorrow\u003c/em\u003e season 4. The reason Legends is the best is that they\u0026rsquo;re not afraid to be outrageous. My favorite moment was from before the midseason break, Puppets of Tomorrow!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esecond best is \u003cem\u003eSupergirl\u003c/em\u003e season 4. I don\u0026rsquo;t like that Supergirl always felt very preachy about modern-day issues like feminism and diversity and immigration, and this season amped that up a lot, but I still enjoyed it because (a) Lex Luthor was great; and (b) they adapted a couple of my favorite DC Superman storylines, namely Manchester Black and the Elite and Red Son (Red Daughter in this case).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethird best is \u003cem\u003eFlash\u003c/em\u003e season 5. Cicada was a terrible villain and the rules of when and how the dagger works were just screwy, but I\u0026rsquo;m glad Eobard gets to come back in the ending (though I still don\u0026rsquo;t know why he has Wells\u0026rsquo; face)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003elast is \u003cem\u003eArrow\u003c/em\u003e season 7, just poor all-around writing, including an episode where Roy Harper flat out murders two innocents and everyone else on Team Arrow is like \u0026ldquo;Huh, okay, we\u0026rsquo;ll cover this up so the police don\u0026rsquo;t find out\u0026rdquo;, and a poorly explained road to Star City\u0026rsquo;s future. The season finale tellss us that Oliver dies during the upcoming Crisis of Infinite Earths. Arrow had a good run, but a few of the seasons were really week. It didn\u0026rsquo;t get as many seasons as Smallville did, but it has a legacy of its own (and arguably Smallville lasted a couple of seasons too long as well). More on this when Arrow\u0026rsquo;s abbreviated eighth and final season finishes later this year.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite all my complaints, I\u0026rsquo;m still looking forward to this year\u0026rsquo;s Crisis crossover!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of DC TV series, \u003cem\u003eGotham\u003c/em\u003e also ended its 5-season run, and although the show diverges significantly from the traditional Batman mythos, I still liked it. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t spectacular or anything, but there were some nice portrayals of many Batman characters and events. We never get to see Bruce don the cape and cowl, although it is heavily foreshadowed in the last episode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Big Bang Theory also had its series finale, and I liked it. Overall as a series it had its flaws, and at many times promoted smart-shaming and nerd stereotypes, but its a sitcom, so I don\u0026rsquo;t take it too seriously. I think the ending of Sheldon getting his nobel prize (with Amy) and finally acknowledging how difficult he has been as a friend is an appropriate ending for the series.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my attempt to watch/read more \u003ca href=\"/tags/manga/\"\u003emanga\u003c/a\u003e/anime again, I started watching \u003cem\u003eBoku no Hero Academia\u003c/em\u003e on Netflix a few months ago, but only got two episodes in. This month I finally binged the rest of the anime and for good measure caught up with the manga as well. This series feels like some cross of One Punch Man (for the superpowers and the modern society) and Naruto (for the kids being supervised by adults), except I\u0026rsquo;d say the depth of the lore so far is not that much, more OPM than Naruto. Still a fairly enjoyable read/watch, since I usually enjoy shonen manga/anime, and it got me thinking that Marvel should make a shonen version of an X-Men comic someday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot much movies-wise this month, though I did do a rewatch of \u003cem\u003eWinter Soldier\u003c/em\u003e the other day, mostly because I had watched some videos ranking the MCU movies now that Endgame is done. Winter Soldier was always in my #1 slot, and the rewatch basically affirmed that. I had only meant to watch a little bit before going off to do something else, but the pacing of the movie was so great I just ended up watching it to the end. I think the themes of freedom vs security also really resonate with the liberal in me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s it for this month! Next month I\u0026rsquo;ll be travelling, so who knows what I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to watch! I\u0026rsquo;ll have access to US Netflix!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAfter a much-maligned eighth and final season, HBO\u0026rsquo;s Game of Thrones is done. Unmarked spoilers follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eighth season was so notoriously bad, we got petitions asking for rewrites. Here\u0026rsquo;s how I explained it to a friend after the notorious episode 5:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s not about characters being killed, it\u0026rsquo;s about bad writing because they\u0026rsquo;re cramming. The writers were determined to finish the show in 2 smaller seasons so they\u0026rsquo;re skipping a lot of necessary character development and characters just do stupid things because the plot demands it. The most recent episode (spoilers follow, no apologies) has Dany do something really bad and out of character. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been so bad if they had spent maybe 5-6 episodes building up to it, but there\u0026rsquo;s nothing, she just decided out of nowhere, fuck it, let\u0026rsquo;s do this. The show was already very simplified compared to the books, which had a lot of plot threads and character arcs that never carried over to the show, which is understandable given the volume, and season 8 basically dumbs it down even more so they can hit their target number of episodes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final episode aired today, and I was mostly whelmed. A big meh. It\u0026rsquo;s always challenging to finish in a satisfying manner an epic story with many intersecting character arcs, especially something this popular. You are almost always not going to please everybody. Some endings made sense, some I could see that GRRM was probably planning for all along, some came out of nowhere (Arya the Explorer comes to mind). Like many things about season 8, so much of it feels crammed and unearned. The season might have been better received if they had stretched things out more. As it is, they had to do things like have Tyrion justify Dany\u0026rsquo;s madness in a speech to Jon after the fact, instead of building up to it organically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExperiencing the series as a book reader was interesting, since we knew what was going to happen for basically the first five seasons. I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;m not the only book reader who was excited to see how TV viewers would react to things like the execution of Ned Stark and the Red Wedding. Once the series overtook the books, we then fell into this weird position of having the show spoil the books. Not that we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t still read the books, but the show leaving out certain elements changes their importance in the books. For example, the absence of the Lady Stoneheart and Young Griff in the shows implied those plot threads were actually irrelevant to the show\u0026rsquo;s ultimate ending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I think the poor writing in season 8 makes me look forward to the books more, if only to see if and how GRRM is able to deliver a better and more satisfying ending. I think the ending for the Starks is probably what he had in mind all along (or very close to it); in his initial outline for the entire series, it was always about the Starks. Whether he sticks to that plan or pivots after seeing the reactions to the show, we shall see. I read a \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/dsilvermint/status/1125856091261136896?s=21\"\u003egreat thread on Twitter\u003c/a\u003e describing GRRM as a \u0026ldquo;pantser\u0026rdquo; kind of writer, i.e. he writes by the seat of his pants, letting the characters and events drive the story forward instead of strictly following an outline. It makes for good narrative, but is probably also why he\u0026rsquo;s taking forever to finish. And we hope he will finish! Maybe someday, when the books are done, we eventually get a better and more faithful remake series (cue the \u0026ldquo;Game of Thrones: Brotherhood\u0026rdquo; jokes).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall though, I think history will look kindly on the entire series of Game of Thrones for what it did. It brought epic fantasy to the forefront of pop culture. People talked excitedly about every episode as it came out and speculated about what would happen. Even my dad got into it, even though I often had to explain some bits to him, and he didn\u0026rsquo;t like watching the show without subtitles. They failed to stick the landing, so they don\u0026rsquo;t belong in the same conversation as series like \u003cem\u003eBreaking Bad\u003c/em\u003e, but there were a lot of epic moments and some very good television in those eight seasons, and the show ultimately deserves its places in the cultural zeitgeist. Because of this show, we are getting other epic fantasies as TV series moving forward. I\u0026rsquo;m most looking forward to Amazon\u0026rsquo;s upcoming \u003ca href=\"/2019/05/wheel-of-time-new-spring/\"\u003eWheel of Time\u003c/a\u003e series, hopefully they don\u0026rsquo;t screw it up. (That one would take maybe two decades to finish!)\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "After a much-maligned eighth and final season, HBO\u0026rsquo;s Game of Thrones is done. Unmarked spoilers follow.\nThe eighth season was so notoriously bad, we got petitions asking for rewrites. Here\u0026rsquo;s how I explained it to a friend after the notorious episode 5:\n It\u0026rsquo;s not about characters being killed, it\u0026rsquo;s about bad writing because they\u0026rsquo;re cramming. The writers were determined to finish the show in 2 smaller seasons so they\u0026rsquo;re skipping a lot of necessary character development and characters just do stupid things because the plot demands it.",
