When we first planned the trip a few months back, only Spain and France were on the itinerary. But due to a last-minute change in circumstances, we decided to add Italy to the trip. We had also acquired a railpass and were planning to travel by train between Spain and France, but given the change of plans we decided to refund the railpass (up to 85% of the cost can be refunded) and we literally booked inter-Europe flights during our layover in Singapore at the start of the trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had booked all of our inter-Europe flights on Vueling, a Spain-based budget airline. I was a bit apprehensive about it since internet searches led to some stories of people having trouble with lost baggage, but luckily they were able to get us and our luggage to Rome safely and without incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon arrival at the Rome airport, we went to a tourist information kiosk to get some maps and whatnot. While we were there, this Italian man kept wanting to talk to us, offering free information about a shuttle service from the airport. We already had instructions on how to get to the hotel by train, so we ignored him at first and tried to figure out ourselves where to go. Eventually we gave up and just took the shuttle service with a few other travelers. We were the last to get off the shuttle, so we got something of a preview of the different places in Rome as the other passengers were dropped off at their hotels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were dropped off on a cobblestone sidewalk in front of a four-or-five-story building with a 12-foot tall metal gate in front. We walked in cautiously and found ourselves in a short hallway with a doorway at the end. The old lady who popped up from behind the doorway told us we needed to go up one floor when we told her we were looking for our hotel called \u003ca href=\"http://www.agoda.com/migdal-palace/hotel/rome-it.html\"\u003eMigdal Palace\u003c/a\u003e. Another large door on the right side of the hallway led to a stairwell. At the bottom of the stairwell was an old-timey open-air elevator made up of rusty metal bars. We only needed to go up one floor, but what the hell. We rode the small elevator up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the reception desk, we were greeted by a pretty Italian lady named Alina who spoke with accented yet clear and understandable English. She was very friendly and told us there was a room ready but we would have to wait a bit for the beds to be set up. We had not yet had breakfast at this point, so we asked her the most relevant question: was there a nearby place where we could eat some good pasta?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe directed us to a small restaurant at a corner a few blocks from the hotel, the Montecarlo, saying that she ate there all the time. We were a bit early for the lunch hour so we had to wait a few minutes for them to be ready. We were seated at an outdoors table; I ordered some carbonara, since Marco from Freehostels had recommended it, while my two companions ordered cacio e pepe, recommended by Alina at Migdal Palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile waiting for the meals to be served we pored over the maps to plan out our Rome trip. We only had 3 days in Rome, so we allocated today for walking around a bit and seeing nearby things, then the next day we would visit the Vatican, and on the third day the Colosseum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#71d80861d9d5fee7d269c8b28918b928-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/carbonara_hu301a6dbcd81308ee96142c836b27a3f0_1605606_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Carbonara!\" title=\"Carbonara!\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eCarbonara!

I also had a few bites of my friends\u0026rsquo; cacio e pepe and it was a strange combination of tastes but also very good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter eating we headed back to the hotel where the beds had already been set up. We rested up for a bit before heading out to explore the city a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe made our way through the city, passing by a couple of plazas with small fountains surrounded by a maze of irregularly-arranged cobblestone streets. Rome was easily way more crowded than Barcelona and was very much a tourist city, made obvious by the abundance of shops and street stalls peddling magnets, keychains, miniature roman helmets and other random souvenirs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe visited the Pantheon (an ancient Roman circular domed structure adorned with various exhibits including the remains of the ninja turtle Raphael), the church of Saint Ignatius de Loyola (which would turn out to be the first of many well-decorated churches we would visit) among other places. We made our way to the well-known Trevi Fountain, but unfortunately for us, it was undergoing renovation at this time and was drained of water. We walked around a bit more and late at night we ended up eating at this kinda fancy Italian restaurant which charged us an extra 5 euros for the tablecloth (or at least that what the chef\u0026rsquo;s gestures looked like when we asked him to explain the bill)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot too much detail to talk about here, but here are some pictures I shared via Google Plus: \u003ca href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/DHC1ba4c85S6SAUf7\"\u003eWednesday afternoon in Rome\u003c/a\u003e.  (You might need to be logged in to Google to access, I have no idea how this works)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThursday March 12th\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext day we availed of the free breakfast served by Migdal Palace, which consisted of bread, croissants, eggs, goat cheese and no meat, which ranks it below the breakfast from Free Hostels. Nonetheless we had our fill before heading out for the day\u0026rsquo;s walking around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe made our way west towards the Tiber river, then followed it north until we crossed the river at the Angel Bridge towards the Castel Sant\u0026rsquo;Angelo. From there we walked westward along the Via de Conciliazone which would bring us right in front of Vatican City.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we approached the Vatican, a blonde lady started walking with us and offering us details about a tour package she was offering. I wanted to ignore her, but my companions started listening to her so we stopped to hear her spiel. The way she told it, the tour involved us paying 46 euro each and included a 26 euro entrance fee for the Vatican Museum and the tour groups would also have access to a special passage from the Sistine Chapel to the Basilica of St. Peter. While there was no entrance fee for the Basilica, going with a tour group would allow us to skip the ridiculously long line of the tourists waiting to enter the Basilica. However, the fee the lady was offering seemed too rich for our blood so we passed on it and carried on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached the border to Vatican City and stood there for a while contemplating how to proceed, and we were approached by another person selling tour packages. This time it was a man of South Asian descent who reminded me of Community\u0026rsquo;s Abed.

While we were contemplating it, we also met with a couple of Filipino expats who were referring people to a nearby souvenir store they were involved with, and they told us the price Abed was offering was already pretty good. After some discussion, we decided to go with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were introduced to our tour guide Angelica and handed phone-sized receivers with earphones that we could use to listen to her while she talked about stuff on the tour. We started in front of the Basilica, joined by some white people, and Angelica described to us the history of Rome and Italty and Vatican City and Pope Francis and all that jazz. Pretty informative stuff, but nothing I need to repeat here. After a bunch of these introductions, we would go over to their tour office to pay the fee before heading off to the Vatican Museum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we were walking towards their tour office, I saw Abed calling me over away from the group, and I walked over to him and he told me that the white people that were part of our tour group had been given a higher price so that we should avoid mentioning how much we are paying. Felt a bit shady, but I guess we were getting a better deal so we ran with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter paying at the tour office, we headed over to the Vatican Museum. At that point we found out that the Vatican Museum entrance fee was actually only 16 euro, so I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why both the blonde lady and Abed said it was 26 euro. Whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Vatican Museum was filled with exhibits featuring statues depicting Roman emperors and other events from Roman history, including statues of Roman gods (which I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect from a Catholic institution). There was also a section filled with Catholic-focused murals and ceiling paintings. Angelica would stop at various exhibits to give us a brief background and history. We stopped at a corner of the pinecone courtyard so that Angelica could give us a briefing on the history of the Sistine Chapel \u0026ndash; apparently they were not allowed to give briefings inside the Sistine Chapel itself. Naturally she had to give us the joke about the missing first fifteen chapels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterwards we went into the Sistine Chapel itself. No photography was allowed inside so we spent most of the time staring upwards at Michaelangelo\u0026rsquo;s masterpieces on the ceiling (being a tourist in Rome apparently meant looking up a lot).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the Sistine Chapel, Angelica took our group through the secret passage reserved for tour groups. It brought us to the front entrance of St. Peter\u0026rsquo;s Basilica where the tour ended. Angelica gave us some last words and left us to take a look at the Basilica at our own leisure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m finding it difficult to find the words to describe the Basilica itself, I guess the most appropriate word to use is \u003cem\u003egrand\u003c/em\u003e. We spent one hour walking separately around the Basilica just looking at things (although I did spend some time sitting down since we had been walking through the Vatican Museum for around 3 hours before this). There\u0026rsquo;s just a lot of history and statues and paintings and chandeliers and tombs and relics. As a Catholic it was well worth the visit. On our way out we took some pictures with some Swiss Guard standing by one of the side entrances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe left the Basilica at around 3pm and had a late lunch at a restaurant along the Via de Conciliazone. After that it was still early so we spent a couple more hours walking around checking a few more sites and running into some weird yet entertaining street art. We wanted to visit the Villa Medici, but it was closed on this day. Eventually we got tired and decided to take a taxi back to the hotel and rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome pictures from this day: \u003ca href=\"/2015/04/thursday-in-rome/\"\u003eThursday in Rome\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo be continued\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was hoping to cover all of the Rome leg in one post, but this post is already long enough as it is. It may take at least three more posts to cover everything else, I hope the audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t get tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I say \u0026ldquo;well-known\u0026rdquo; but I\u0026rsquo;ll be the first to admit that my culturally-ignorant self had not heard of him before, but he\u0026rsquo;s kind of a big deal in Barcelona with many souvenir shops sporting some thing reminiscent of his works. My travelling companions seemed to know what they were doing, so I generally deferred to them when we planned out the day during breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe park was some 4 to 5 kilometers north of our hostel by foot, though as usual we took a more leisurely pace. One of the interesting things we saw along the way was a park-like area near a major thoroughfare where we found a number of old men (and one young man apparently playing hooky on what should be a school day) playing some sort of game which involved tossing metal balls around in a sand-covered lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#86aca36476bc98e652de788d7b72d1ee-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/petanque_hu344958b007412dda4fbc23c0a6f109bb_451985_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Googling \u0026#34;barcelona street game where old men throw metal balls\u0026#34; tells us this is called Petanque. -- Photo credit: Ryan Liwanag\" title=\"Googling \u0026#34;barcelona street game where old men throw metal balls\u0026#34; tells us this is called Petanque. -- Photo credit: Ryan Liwanag\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eGoogling \u0026ldquo;barcelona street game where old men throw metal balls\u0026rdquo; tells us this is called Petanque. \u0026ndash; Photo credit: Ryan Liwanag (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"86aca36476bc98e652de788d7b72d1ee-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/petanque.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eGoogling \u0026#34;barcelona street game where old men throw metal balls\u0026#34; tells us this is called Petanque. -- Photo credit: Ryan Liwanag\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"12 Apr 2015 2:33am\"\u003e12 Apr 2015 2:33am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eThere were benches nearby so we sat there for a while observing the game and trying to figure out the rules. As far as we could tell, first they toss a smaller ball that then acts as a target, and they have to lob the larger metal balls as close as possible to the target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter watching the games for a while, we decided to continue our trek. From this point on the path we were following (provided by Google Maps) started to tread uphill and I started to get a bit tired. Eventually while my two companions were taking a break and looking at something I vanished for a while as soon as I saw a supermercats so that I could buy a bottle of water and recharge a bit. Supermercats are something like a combination of a small grocery store and a convenience store (they\u0026rsquo;re everywhere, and they don\u0026rsquo;t have 7-11s), and they seem to be often run by people of South Asian or Arabic descent. Whenever I see a supermercat, the name makes me visualize some combination of a cat superman who is also half-fish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe continued along the uphill route, through winding paths and eventually up three flights of stone steps at a 45 degree incline, by which time I was pretty tired and was complaining a lot. I was told we were close, so we trucked on and eventually we turned a corner and found a series of outdoor escalators that would have saved us a lot of effort with those stone steps. I glared at the person guiding our route before we all laughed out loud. The entrance to the park area lay just ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe climbed up a hilly area that afforded a good view of the city of Barcelona before eventually coming upon a tourist area overlooking a sealed-off area that was actually the roof of the columned area of the park. The park was the first tourist attraction we would pay for, and though my stingy self balked a bit at paying 8 euro for the entrance, it would turn out to be one of the cheapest tourist spots we would enter anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have not much to say about the Park itself, given my lack of architectural and artistic vocabulary. There\u0026rsquo;s a large columned area where the roof is lined with what I could describe as shattered plates, an impression which would turn out to be typical of Gaudi\u0026rsquo;s work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#ff2b87fc016a51d5c56a96e57400792d-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/park-guell-roof_hud73151781bff8be7b9fc5ac46dfcdf8d_417669_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"The roof of the columned area looks like shattered plates -- Photo Credit: Ryan Liwanag\" title=\"The roof of the columned area looks like shattered plates -- Photo Credit: Ryan Liwanag\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eThe roof of the columned area looks like shattered plates \u0026ndash; Photo Credit: Ryan Liwanag (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"ff2b87fc016a51d5c56a96e57400792d-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/park-guell-roof.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eThe roof of the columned area looks like shattered plates -- Photo Credit: Ryan Liwanag\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"12 Apr 2015 2:33am\"\u003e12 Apr 2015 2:33am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe columned area is surrounded by a gardens area on one side and on the other side an overhang held up by a series of earthy stone columns one of which is carved in the shape of a washer-woman (which took us a few minutes to find).

However as our first lesson of how European restaurants actually work, we found out that we were too early as the place would only open at 7:30 pm. This would turn out to be typical in Europe \u0026ndash; most restaurant type places would only be open a few hours during lunch time and again a few hours during dinner time, which was bad news for us since we tended to skip some meals and eat at irregular hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUndaunted, we walked around a bit for an alternative before settling on a small bar that advertised paella at less than 10 euros each.

Paella is a Valencian dish although it\u0026rsquo;s also common in Catalonia, so I went with Paella Valenciana (okay, it\u0026rsquo;s also because I eat meat and not seafood)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#057bc24a336b89785497170bcd880dc4-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/paella_hu2c7c8c667a769ae4786f1acd7613fcac_1612166_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Yummy paella!\" title=\"Yummy paella!\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eYummy paella!

One of them is a Japanese woman who speaks clear English; she often brings in fruits from the nearby supermercats during breakfast time. She\u0026rsquo;s apparently a frequent traveler who would be visiting a few other European countries before heading back to Japan. Another person we got to know was Marco, the owner of the hostel. He\u0026rsquo;s a talkative Italian man and upon finding out where we\u0026rsquo;re from and our travel plans he talks to us about how he plans to visit Boracay soon and gives us some tips for visiting Rome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe headed out Tuesday with the intent of visiting the Sagrada Familia and not much else planned. This meant a leisurely walk along the Diagonal road, one of the major thoroughfares running across Barcelona.

There are almost a dozen buildings lining a central plaza dotted with orange trees. Each building has a different facade, though all in the same style, designed by the Catalan architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner. There was some sort of media event going on though, and we were only able to visit a few of the buildings.

One of the first things I noticed (aside from the brownness of the buildings as the train rode into the city proper) was the vast amount of colorfully-lettered graffiti that can be seen on many walls as the train passed by. This sort of graffiti would turn out to be common not only here but in Paris and Rome as well (though not as much)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the station our hostel would be a short walk, but first we hunted around the Sants station for a place to eat. We looked at some signs for the McDonald\u0026rsquo;s inside the station before deciding we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be having any American fast food for the duration of our trip. We ate at the adjacent restaurant instead, taking in an assortment of breakfast foods on some sort of combo plates. We didn\u0026rsquo;t have too much language trouble even though the staff spoke no English. Although the local language is Catalan, most of the locals will speak or understand Spanish, and we spoke and understood a bit of Spanish ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stepped out of the station to a crisp windy afternoon, with the temperature a bit under 10 degrees. I was worried that my hoodie might not be able to handle the expected cold Europe weather but I held up fine so far. We walked around a bit a midst crowds of skateboarding, rollerblading and scooter-riding youths before figuring out where we were supposed to go for the fifteen minute walk to our hostel. We walked through what a quaint area with a wide open space in the middle of the road for pedestrians \u0026ndash; such a thing seemed impossible back in crowded Metro Manila. Many of the storefronts were closed, probably for the weekend, with their metal security grills lined with the same style of colorfully-lettered graffiti I saw from the train.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this leg we would be staying at \u003ca href=\"http://www.freehostelsbarcelona.com/\"\u003eFree Hostels Barcelona\u003c/a\u003e. The lady at the reception was very friendly and her English was quite good. She answered most of our questions and handed us a few tourist friendly maps that highlighted many of the places we could visit in the city before showing us our rooms. It was a dormitory-type room with four beds and storage units, a bathroom and not much else. One of the beds was already occupied, she said, so the three of us would be sharing a room with a stranger that night. (Spoiler: we did not get murdered in our sleep)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter resting up for a bit, we went out to spend the afternoon taking in a bit more of the city. We made our way towards the nearby Plaza España; the friendly hostel reception lady told us the mall there would give us a good view of the city from the top floor.

Breakfast was cold cuts of ham and sausage, slices of cheese, bread and croissants with various spreads and some juice. Nothing too fancy (i.e. no bacon), but there was lots of food for us to enjoy. The spread would be the same every morning, and it meant we could load up on breakfast so that we don\u0026rsquo;t have to spend too much on lunch and dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Sunday and as a Catholic I was planning to hear English mass. As far as I could tell from the internet, the only place to do that was the Parish of Mary the Queen at 10am.

There weren\u0026rsquo;t too many attendees, maybe around 50 people at best, which is less than I would have thought given the large Catholic population in Spain, though I guess most of them hear mass in the local languages. Most of the attendees seemed to be locals instead of expats; for some reason I was expecting a larger Asian/Filipino presence, maybe based on when I heard mass in Hong Kong or Singapore. The priest was very friendly and would greet each mass-goer as they left after the service. He even gave me a \u0026ldquo;good job!\u0026rdquo; with thumbs up as I went out, not sure why 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriends know I \u003ca href=\"/2013/03/scenes-from-a-quiz-night/\"\u003eenjoy a good quiz night\u003c/a\u003e, and my travelling companions were no different. So for Sunday night, we planned to attend an English pub quiz at the Black Horse Pub, roughly an hour\u0026rsquo;s walk from our hostel. We met up again late into the afternoon and headed out on foot (we liked walking, apparently). Along the way we enjoyed the fancy-looking buildings that lined the major roads. There are apparently no skyscrapers in Barcelona, most of the buildings we saw were maybe five or six stories high at most, with most of them being old-timey buildings lined with fancy ornate facades and some with random minarets or towers at the top. Any time we passed by an obviously modern-style building it looked hilariously out of place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe decided to walk along the Via Laietana, a thoroughfare famous for buildings with different kinds of fancy architecture (I am too ignorant to name them). Aside from the buildings and their architecture which I am surely unqualified to describe, the street itself had a wide middle island for pedestrians, the island lined with trees that looked like they were groomed to look similar in branch structure, recovering from winter. The middle island held a number of outdoor seating areas for the nearby restaurants, a common thing in Barcelona. We debated having some paella right there, since that\u0026rsquo;s the famous dish in the region, but the menus here were a bit pricy so I suggested in Tagalog that we look for some cheaper alternatives later near our hostel. As chance would have it, one of the restaurant staff we passed by overheard us and I heard him say behind us we walked away \u0026ldquo;Mura dito!\u0026rdquo;, leading me to comment about the innate ability of Pinoys to find one another when in a foreign land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was night time by the time we found the pub among a maze of side streets, and the friendly British proprietor welcomed us for their quiz night. The questions were recited out loud in both Spanish and English (leading to one of my companions translating the Spanish instead of paying attention to the English one!). We took an early lead since we used our joker early, but fell behind when it came to the music-related categories (not an uncommon result for our quiz nights!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#d129dc452927a8be7a61d54d74f16850-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/quiz-night_hu3391d40cbbafc24ad913803c77f7f59e_2275406_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Our quiz night results -- who knows what place we finished\" title=\"Our quiz night results -- who knows what place we finished\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eOur quiz night results \u0026ndash; who knows what place we finished (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"d129dc452927a8be7a61d54d74f16850-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/quiz-night.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eOur quiz night results -- who knows what place we finished\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"9 Apr 2015 5:43am\"\u003e9 Apr 2015 5:43am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the pub quiz, we decided to take a cab home since it was late.

            "summary": "My previous post only skimmed my trip to Europe. I did not want to write too much, partly because I was uncertain at how many would be interested to hear the sordid details and partly because while I was writing the post, the words did not flow as freely as I would have wanted. Despite this, I have received good feedback and more than one person had asked for more details.",
