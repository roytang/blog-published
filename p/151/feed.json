Namely, many of the apps are now basically unusable and almost always crash with \u0026ldquo;Unfortunately, [app] has stopped\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried checking it before but couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any obvious problems (like lack of disk space, etc). I also tried installing an app to check the system logs (I believe it was named CatLog) but couldn\u0026rsquo;t find anything relevant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the past couple of days, the problem became significantly worse. The tablet would always pop an alert \u0026ldquo;Unfortunately, Contacts has stopped\u0026rdquo;, and after you dismiss it with [OK], the alert pops up again, repeat ad infinitum. The tablet is practically unusable now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComplicating things is that it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to get the thing to even boot. If I restart it, it loads into a black screen with the Asus logo and a spinning loading icon and stays there forever. Image for reference: \u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/NBhvZ2T.jpg\"\u003ehttp://i.imgur.com/NBhvZ2T.jpg\u003c/a\u003e. My mom says she can get it to boot sometimes but only after restarting several times (I don\u0026rsquo;t have the patience for it, I\u0026rsquo;ve never gotten it to boot)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve already managed to back up her relevant data, so I suggested that I do a factory reset. So I hold Power and Volume Up during startup and boot into the following menu: \u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/Anb5Kjl.jpg\"\u003ehttp://i.imgur.com/Anb5Kjl.jpg\u003c/a\u003e There\u0026rsquo;s an error message there, IDK if it\u0026rsquo;s relevant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the Droidboot Menu, I choose \u0026ldquo;Recovery\u0026rdquo; and it reboots again. This time it boots into a screen with a dead Android mascot and the text \u0026ldquo;No command\u0026rdquo;. Here\u0026rsquo;s a shitty cameraphone image for reference: \u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/QgOvHkm.jpg\"\u003ehttp://i.imgur.com/QgOvHkm.jpg\u003c/a\u003e At this point, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how to proceed. The Volume buttons are unresponsive. Tapping Power does nothing. If I leave it in this state for a while, it proceeds to try to boot and gets stuck again at the loading icon I showed in the first image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny advice as to how I can get this tablet back into a usable state?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

A president elected with a relatively weaker mandate (say, 25-30%) will have a much tougher time with controversial issues and will be facing a much more independent senate (many of whom will be elected by more voters than the president)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strength of the mandate even affects those who don\u0026rsquo;t win - Erap placed second in 2010 showing himself to still be a strong political force which leads to his still being influential today\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe comparison to the US low voter turnout is interesting, since the voter turnout for their primaries this year is significantly higher compared to 2012 mainly because both parties have significant anti-establishment candidates (Sanders for the Dems, Trump for the Reps) which would lead one to believe that their historically low voter turnout is precisely due to a lack of good candidates, an opportunity which Sanders and Trump can potentially take advantage of. That is the same message that a significantly large abstention (although unlikely) could send - not saying it will, but it\u0026rsquo;s a possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not saying abstention is some magic thing that will send a message (although it\u0026rsquo;s a possibility if enough people do so), but that people shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be ashamed to abstain if they don\u0026rsquo;t find the options palatable. Even if your reason is something as simple as \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t decide\u0026rdquo;, that\u0026rsquo;s fine, your abstention still has meaning since it indicates that you consider none of the candidates outstanding enough to support\u003c/p\u003e\n",
