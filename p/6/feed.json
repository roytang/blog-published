            "title": "Thoughts on Vue.js",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not big on modern frontend JavaScript frameworks (mostly because I think web pages should use as little JS as possible), but when I do find the need to use one, my weapon of choice is \u003ca href=\"https://vuejs.org/\"\u003eVue.js\u003c/a\u003e. I dislike React, but mostly because (a) my first experience with React was with mobile development using React Native for \u003ca href=\"/2020/09/mobile-app-dev/\"\u003emobile app development\u003c/a\u003e, which I generally don\u0026rsquo;t like; and (b) I don\u0026rsquo;t like Facebook, which backs React. I have no opinion on Angular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite being my frontend framework of choice, I don\u0026rsquo;t actually have that much experience with Vue beyond a few small projects each with a minimal number of screens / pages. That being said, I do have some thoughts, coming mostly from the POV of a developer \u003ca href=\"/2020/02/old-web/\"\u003emore used to the old-school ways of Javascript and web development in general\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entry point of course, is the \u003ca href=\"https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/\"\u003egetting started guide on the Vue website itself\u003c/a\u003e, which walks you through most of the framework features. I have no concern about most of these; the features are explained well and I find most of the documentation quite good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy issue is with how the site recommends to beginners to set up their Vue projects: via a script include from a CDN. When I first saw this guide, I assumed this was the standard, recommended way to build a Vue project, so this was how I did it for my first small project, a small demo site I needed to produce in a few days. Due to the short timeframe, I had decided to learn as I go. The component registration section of the guide also gives no guidance or recommendation on how to structure your components or projects, so I ended up with most of the components set up in a single JS file. (Admittedly, as a person with more than a decade of web dev experience, I should have at least split it up into several files, but time was short.) A technical person reviewing the code commented that I had implemented the frontend \u0026ldquo;in a very strange manner\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt gets worse when you try to install third-party components, which is a big feature of the ecosystem of these frontend frameworks. In my experience, most third-party components will only give instructions for installation via \u003ccode\u003enpm\u003c/code\u003e and a JS module system, neither of which are covered nor recommended by the beginner sections of the guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few projects later, and I now know that I vastly prefer developing Vue projects as Node projects built using the scaffolding provided by \u003ca href=\"https://cli.vuejs.org/\"\u003eVue CLI\u003c/a\u003e, with the components implemented as standalone \u003ccode\u003e.vue\u003c/code\u003e files. The usage of these tools and methods are covered in the \u003ca href=\"https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html\"\u003eInstallation section of the guide\u003c/a\u003e (which the \u0026ldquo;Get Started\u0026rdquo; link skips over) and the \u003ca href=\"https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html\"\u003eSingle File Components section under the Tooling section\u003c/a\u003e (which seemed like an advanced section a beginner is not likely to get into.) This method also makes installing third-party components much more straightforward. It\u0026rsquo;s not even necessary to cover what tools like Webpack or Babel are doing, since those are largely abstracted away by the scaffolding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically my main complaint is that the guide doesn\u0026rsquo;t do a good job of transitioning from the introducing the beginner to the language specifics to introducing a recommended approach and tools for organizing more intermediate or complex projects. The method of using a script include seems suitable for little more than a single-page todo list webapp. I suppose the perceived shortcoming might be attributed to my background at least partially - I still tend to think like a developer using jQuery, and I don\u0026rsquo;t default to thinking about Node applications when doing webapps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, I am overall happy with Vue.js and it\u0026rsquo;s still my choice of frontend framework moving forward (should a frontend framework even be needed!) Although, maybe I should at least consider trying out / evaluating Angular so I can pretend to make a fair comparison?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Not casually or without thought, but carefully: a premeditated murder of minutes. The violence comes from a combination of giving up, not caring, and a resignation that getting past it is all you can hope to accomplish. So you kill the hour. You do not work, you do not read, you do not daydream. If you sleep it is not because you need to sleep. And when at last it is over, there is no evidence: no weapon, no blood, and no body. The only clue might be the shadows beneath your eyes or a terribly thin line near the corner of your mouth indicating something has been suffered, that in the privacy of your life you have lost something and the loss is too empty to share.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; Mark Z.

There\u0026rsquo;s so few opportunities for bands to make a living from their art at this point. But it terrifies me to think about a future where music is created to please some cold-blooded algorithm. And there\u0026rsquo;s just like something uniquely gross about that to me, when I think about how music is something that humans have been making for literally 1000s of years. It\u0026rsquo;s something that\u0026rsquo;s sacred, and, you know, not to pretend that it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been commodified in a variety of different ways for decades, or maybe even centuries. But this feels like a new frontier. That type of automated commodification of something that should be about humans and not robots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarvel released what is basically a sizzle reel for the MCU\u0026rsquo;s next 3 years worth of movies: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdpxoFcdORI\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdpxoFcdORI\u003c/a\u003e.

Supposedly it\u0026rsquo;s fully effective about two weeks after the second dose, although studies show the efficacy is rather low. But some protection is better than none. Some better vaccines are starting to come in, we are supposedly due to get (a small amount of) Pfizer soon. I reckon since I\u0026rsquo;m hunkered down at home most of the time anyway, I\u0026rsquo;m okay with the weaker Chinese vaccine and don\u0026rsquo;t mind if the more effective vaccines go to the masses that have to go out and mingle for work.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStill \u003ca href=\"/albums/sketchbook/\"\u003esketching\u003c/a\u003e, although I\u0026rsquo;m a couple of days behind due to the aforementioned alleged busyness.
