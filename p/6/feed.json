Not all of it applies to the site, since I do have a bunch of image content around as well, but enough that I was spurred to apply many of the points and also include some additional changes I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to do. Secondary objectives include: improving site performance, accessibility, and code output; and hopefully making the site menus more organized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLayout changes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSimplified top header content. V-card and some other stuff moved to the footer.

Most of the sidebar links for my own use/benefit anyway, and not for the potential blog reader. Most of the content has been moved into the home page, footer, and the new explore page.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdded submenus to most listing pages.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStandardize display of page title/description where possible\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdded support for \u0026ldquo;prefers-color-scheme: light\u0026rdquo;.

It\u0026rsquo;s currently fine for text-heavy blog posts, but I guess I can\u0026rsquo;t avoid a higher score for image-heavy content since the crawler they use ignores the fact that I lazy load the full-size images and they are initially hidden.

Minifying HTML/CSS was a possibility, but that just makes it harder for me to debug things, and really feels like something too serious for a hobby site like this.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScripts and cookies:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe site already uses minimal JS in a few places: there\u0026rsquo;s a captcha for comments, and the \u003ca href=\"/locations\"\u003elocations page\u003c/a\u003e requires JS, and some of the stat pages load data remotely via JS, but that should be it. 99% of the pages of the site should be JS free.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also don\u0026rsquo;t use any cookies myself. But I do have Cloudflare enabled on the site, and they do add a \u003ccode\u003e__cfduid\u003c/code\u003e cookie, supposedly to detect bots. This \u003ca href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/deprecating-cfduid-cookie/\"\u003ecookie is being deprecated by May 2021\u003c/a\u003e though, so by then the site should be cookie-free.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat should be it! I had some other features in mind to implement (never ending scope creep when you have a personal project really), but I\u0026rsquo;ve already spent too much time on this and need to work on my other shenanigans as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne last thing: attaching some images so that I can compare to the future look of the website:\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIt took me more than three weeks to get through Gibson\u0026rsquo;s influential work Neuromancer, a book that pioneered the cyberpunk genre and even introduced terms like cyberspace, ICE and \u0026ldquo;the matrix\u0026rdquo; into popular lexicon. It\u0026rsquo;s not because the book is bad or anything, it\u0026rsquo;s just that Gibson tends to describe everything very vividly, and almost all of it from the POV of our lead character Case, who is sometimes in the real world, sometimes in cyberspace, and sometimes simply just drunk or high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found myself taking time with each scene to visualize where Case was and what was going on. In later parts of the book, it became even more complicated because Case gained the ability to see the world from the POV of his ally, the cybergirl Molly. So for many chapters the POV would consistently shift between Case in the real world, Case in cyberspace, Case looking through Molly\u0026rsquo;s eyes, and so on. Some of it even takes place in space / low-gravity scenarios, so the perspectives being described can be challenging to imagine. Throw in a lot of high-tech / near-future slang and Rastafarian accents and it can make for a challenging read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made it to the end, somehow, though every step of the way I doubted whether I understood what was really going on. In fact, I had to read a plot summary afterwards to confirm that yes, I did in fact understand the story and I was not being dumb. Hard to tell without spoiling anything, but it\u0026rsquo;s really the sort of thing you\u0026rsquo;d expect from a cyberpunk story anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did enjoy the book, though I suspect I would have liked it more as a movie, as that would have been easier to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Whenever I\u0026rsquo;d play any of the old-school DND RPGs like Baldur\u0026rsquo;s Gate or Neverwinter Nights, I\u0026rsquo;d find my main character almost always being a Lawful Good Paladin goody-goody type. This was back when I was younger and more idealistic and a stronger believer in \u0026ldquo;rule of law\u0026rdquo;-type principles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the years have gone by, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that my alignment has shifted considerably. Part of it is a strong disillusionment with the \u0026ldquo;law\u0026rdquo; part of lawful. As I\u0026rsquo;ve become more immersed with events in my country and the world, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that adherence to law and order isn\u0026rsquo;t always in the best interest of people or society. The imperfect men implementing the laws can always be corrupted or can find ways to abuse or circumvent the law, while staying within the purview of legality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd even in the ideal case where a society is able to consistently \u003ca href=\"/2019/11/laws-not-men/\"\u003eapply the laws over the whims of men\u003c/a\u003e, the laws in place can still be disadvantageous to the progress or greater good of society. Laws in place have a tendency to be used to preserve the status quo, which in many cases means reinforcing inequality or imbalanced power structures, favoring the entrenched and the elite over the greater majority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still largely advocate for following the law and obeying the authorities, but only where it makes sense. In order for society to progress, we must be willing to shake off old norms and challenge the law and authorities where applicable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe original online alignment quiz is no longer available on the current Wizards/DND site, but there are some that have \u003ca href=\"http://easydamus.com/alignmenttest.html\"\u003ereplicated it elsehwere\u003c/a\u003e. I recently took it again to confirm what I\u0026rsquo;ve know for a few years now (image result attached). My current alignment is \u003cstrong\u003eNeutral Good\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://easydamus.com/lawfulgood.html\"\u003eDescription of Lawful Good\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"http://www.easydamus.com/neutralgood.html\"\u003eDescription of Neutral Good\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe DND Alignment system is of course an imperfect and vastly oversimplified method of ascertaining one\u0026rsquo;s personality (after all, very few people would openly accept being called \u0026ldquo;Evil\u0026rdquo; on this scale), but I find it can sometimes be helpful as an abstraction of a person\u0026rsquo;s general outlook on life, as long as you know the model\u0026rsquo;s limitations. Individual moments or actions of course, are not obliged to follow one\u0026rsquo;s given alignment, and as it can see here, alignment can easily shift over time. The alignment system is probably roughly as useful as Myers-Briggs.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",
