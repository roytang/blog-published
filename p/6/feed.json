(\u003ca href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/\"\u003eOfficial statement\u003c/a\u003e). People were alarmed and worried about the future of what is the last major independent browser and the open web, bit it looks like it isn\u0026rsquo;t that bleak. Most of the layoffs were to teams other than those working on Firefox, things like the experimental browser engine Servo, devtools, and MDN. The core Gecko team seems to be unaffected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that these things aren\u0026rsquo;t important. MDN, if you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar, is a set of documentation of web standards and browser support, \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\"\u003eavailable online\u003c/a\u003e, that is one of the best resources for web developers working on cross-platform things. Mozilla no longer funding it\u0026rsquo;s maintenance is a big deal, it means it\u0026rsquo;s less likely to be kept up-to-date, even though community work can still continue. Peter-Paul Koch, writer of \u003ca href=\"https://quirksmode.org\"\u003equirksmode.org\u003c/a\u003e, which was the original resource for cross-browser compatibility back in the heyday of the browser wars, wrote an article about Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s problems titled \u003ca href=\"https://quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2020/08/the_cult_of_the.html\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;The Cult of the Free\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e where he argues that it\u0026rsquo;s time to step out of this mentality that all these resources must be maintained for free by \u0026ldquo;the community\u0026rdquo;, but that we as consumers must get used to the idea of paying or donating to support these resources. Expecting \u0026ldquo;the community\u0026rdquo; to step in and maintain these resources \u003ca href=\"https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2020/08/i_love_mdn_or_t.html\"\u003ealso devalues the work of technical writers.\u003c/a\u003e Trying to get more people to support these \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; resources is a good idea, but I worry it goes against the grain of years of internet culture which has conditioned people to expect online content for free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of contributing, a while back I had considered looking for open source projects I could contribute to, and preferred projects that I actively use. Given that I\u0026rsquo;d been using Firefox \u003ca href=\"/2004/10/firefox-1-0-on-november-9/\"\u003esince before version 1.0\u003c/a\u003e, one of the projects I considered was Firefox. I went through the whole rigmarole of \u003ca href=\"https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/windows_build.html\"\u003etheir instructions to set up my machine for the Windows build\u003c/a\u003e, and just the setup process, which involved setting up and checking out code took more than an hour. That was fine for initial setup, but actually building and running Firefox itself took an additional hour or so. Might have been more than that even, it was a while back so I don\u0026rsquo;t clearly remember, but I do remember thinking that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have time for these hour-long build times. The whole set up also took up a nontrivial amount of my SSD disk space (imagine how much worse the build time would have been if I had used my non-SSD drive!), which I am always dangerously low on. These 2 factors led me to shelve the idea for the time being; perhaps I could revisit the idea of contributing to Firefox when I upgraded my computer or had more SSD space available. (TBF, I kind of gave up real quick after the first build, maybe the builds get faster on succeeding runs?). So that\u0026rsquo;s my personal \u0026ldquo;contributing-to-Firefox\u0026rdquo; story, for now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sheer size of the codebase and the long build times just drive home the point of how much modern browsers are these large complex beasts that are doing so much. They are pretty much an OS of their own since they host a ton of features and web applications and JIT JS and all of that. This means it\u0026rsquo;s really difficult for independent browser efforts to hit feature parity with modern web browsers - even just working with JS and CSS standards, there are so many to implement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew DeVault laments that \u003ca href=\"https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/13/Web-browsers-need-to-stop.html\"\u003eWeb browsers need to stop\u003c/a\u003e with all these new functionalities and APIs that add scope and complexity, and maybe focus more on performance, efficiency, etc. I do agree - if I was contributing to Firefox, I would want to find a way to reduce the massive memory footprint it always has. I don\u0026rsquo;t even use that many tabs, and I already feel burdened by Firefox\u0026rsquo;s memory footprint. (Pretty sure Chrome is pretty bad in this regard as well.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy care about Mozilla/Firefox at all? Why not just use Chrome, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty good right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, no, Chrome is not necessarily \u0026ldquo;pretty good\u0026rdquo;, given how it props up a surveillance capitalsm engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, even if you didn\u0026rsquo;t dislike Google, having a browser (engine) monoculture is not a good thing. I \u003ca href=\"/2020/02/old-web/\"\u003egot my start in web development\u003c/a\u003e at around the height of Internet Explorer 6\u0026rsquo;s dominance, and I\u0026rsquo;d rather not find my way back there. Granted, one of the issues back then was that IE6 was a stagnant platform that upstarts Firefox and eventually Chrome left behind. No such problem exists now, since Chrome is still in active development and still pushing new web standards forward. And the fact that Chrome is an open-source platform means in theory someone could just fork it if ever Google goes off the rails or such. (And people have already built indie browsers on top of Chrome of course!) But it\u0026rsquo;s still dangerous for a single company and/or codebase to be the sole major implementer of web standards. A single company dictating the future of the web isn\u0026rsquo;t a good thing, and is the very opposite of the idea of an \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo; web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSide note: Maybe I should try building Chromium too, just for comparison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, that\u0026rsquo;s all my ranting for today. In conclusion: reduce your surveillance capitalism footprint and support the open web, use Firefox.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThese weeknotes are coming in late in the day because of reasons. (The reasons being laziness and procrastination.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve been kind of phoning in the weeknotes over the past few weeks, they\u0026rsquo;ve mostly been \u0026ldquo;hey, I\u0026rsquo;ve been busy, so nothing of significance happened, but here are some things I watched/played.\u0026rdquo; Supposedly one of the side effects of writing regular updates is that you tend to look out for more interesting things to do so you have something to write about, even on an unconscious level. In the past few weeks, that has been problematic because (a) as mentioned, I\u0026rsquo;ve been busy with some things, so my excess time is devoted to less mentally taxing things like just watching movies/shows or destress with games; and (b) we are still in the middle of a pandemic!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of the pandemic, I read this piece recently on the Financial Times: \u003ca href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32d79c87-1ade-4b63-8d14-7af1a553d963\"\u003eWe won’t remember much of what we did in the pandemic\u003c/a\u003e, about how the sameyness of our days in quarantine means our brains compress that data since so little of it is meaningful, affecting our perception of time. When 99% of your activities take place in the same environment, in your room during a zoom call, everything just tends to blur together. And I guess that reflected in the weeknotes too! (For that reason, I\u0026rsquo;m switching up the weeknotes format today to be more freeform prose, we\u0026rsquo;ll see if it sticks.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of the pandemic part 2, one thing I have been doing since the pandemic started is writing a regular series of notes, first as \u003ca href=\"/2020/03/covid19/\"\u003eone long post that I kept updating every couple of days or so\u003c/a\u003e then later I transitioned to regular weekly update notes, on the same day as these weeknotes. The idea was that in the future I could just browse the \u003ca href=\"/tags/covid19/\"\u003ecovid19 tag\u003c/a\u003e on the site and I could recall what things were like during the days of quarantine and the quality of the government response. And this was fine during the start, since things happened and unfolded quickly. But these past few months, the updates have fallen in the quagmire of sameyness as well: I only went out once every 1 or 2 weeks, everything was always getting worse, cases were always going up, government response was always terrible, and so on. One thing the last few months has made clear for me is that the government has no clear plan on controlling this thing and so I am highly pessimistic that things will change anytime soon. For that reason, I\u0026rsquo;m just going to pause on doing the covid19 update notes for now, unless some drastic change happens.(I have no expectation of Russia\u0026rsquo;s vaccine having any effect on our status quo anytime soon!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, so how was my week? I wrapped up the things causing my busy-ness towards the middle of the week, so I expect to be less busy/stressed during the coming weeks. At the very least, I should be able to write on the blog more, and maybe do some work on some of my other side projects. I actually thought about writing some posts already last week but I was like you know what, I\u0026rsquo;ll just relax and watch things and play things and leave the writing to next week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are the things I\u0026rsquo;ve been watching and playing the past week:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMarvel\u0026rsquo;s Agents of SHIELD had their series finale last Thursday. I enjoyed the first half of this season, but the second half and the finale were just ok, maybe slightly meh. Still, the series finale was pretty good, wrapping things up nicely with a big bow. This series had a lot of haters, I think mostly because of mismatched expectations, because people wanted it to be more directly tied-in to the MCU movies, but that was never going to happen (maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll get that more with the coming Disney+ series). But I like it, it had a lot of fans, and it had a pretty good run. And it had Ghost Rider!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOne things I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing a bunch is Amonkhet Remastered, which came out on Magic Arena last Thursday. I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing drafts over on \u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy\"\u003ethe twitch channel\u003c/a\u003e, and archiving them to \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsD8jNRlYkw\u0026amp;list=PLmU0vkKslGXg6Pdu3_kaKx5oumTwftUUe\"\u003ethis playlist on the Youtube channel\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s fairly fun, though I need to play better. Watch me on Twitch/Youtube, or like and subscribe, all that jazz, if you like.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOh, I also finally finished \u003ca href=\"/2020/08/1293051269129486337/\"\u003eDivinity Original Sin 2\u003c/a\u003e! I really dragged out that last act for a few months, but I finally got there.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also \u003ca href=\"/2020/08/1294146833359364097/\"\u003etried out Fall Guys on PS4\u003c/a\u003e (free on PS+!). It\u0026rsquo;s fun but kind of frustrating, I guess this is why I don\u0026rsquo;t really play these battle royale kind of things.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePlayed a little bit Street Fighter x Tekken because of a reddit thread and am once again disappointed that (a) it was such a missed opportunity; and (b) up to now it\u0026rsquo;s still not available on Steam in SEA.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so one of the reasons I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing these \u0026ldquo;watching/playing lately\u0026rdquo; posts and segments is because I want to track what I have been watching/playing at any particular point in the past. And maybe I can have like a widget on the site with things like \u0026ldquo;Recently played\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Last movie watched\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;d also want to be able to search/query for things like \u0026ldquo;what year did I watch so-and-so movie?\u0026rdquo; (Helps with trivia quizzes!) I feel like I need to be recording these detail in more of a machine-readable format or a database in order to do those kinds of things. Maybe some kind of Goodreads-like system? It\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;d need to figure out how to implement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOk, this is already longer than I thought it would be. More things will be posted to the blog (hopefully!) later this week!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

While these supposed \u0026ldquo;public servants\u0026rdquo; flaunt their privilege, the rest of us are deprived of things like seeing our friends and loved ones in person, celebrating milestones, or even the simple pleasures of eating out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve actually written quite a few of these \u003ca href=\"/tags/birthday/\"\u003ebirthday posts\u003c/a\u003e by now, though not as regularly as I\u0026rsquo;d have liked. I read through a few of them to help me decide what to write for today (didn\u0026rsquo;t really help).

Perhaps that\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m not really complaining about the spike in busy-ness I\u0026rsquo;ve had over the past month or so.

Interesting how a lot of people are probably dependent now on Facebook to tell them when other people are having birthdays. It is no big loss; the people who are important will remember. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean I\u0026rsquo;m not grateful and amazed if someone unexpected should remember. A couple of days ago someone I\u0026rsquo;d only known for less than five years actually remembered to greet me, except the greeting came two days early due to uncertainty about the exact date. It\u0026rsquo;s nice to be remembered, no matter how stoic we pretend to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost impulse-bought a Switch yesterday, luckily a friend talked me out of it.
