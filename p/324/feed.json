The E-VAT thing is actually a plus for him, as it shows he has the capacity to make difficult decisions if needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Senators:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSonia Roco:\u003c/strong\u003e I believe she will live up to the advocacies espoused by her husband the late Raul Roco (whom I voted for in 2004). Focus: Education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRisa Hontiveros:\u003c/strong\u003e A solid history of advocacy and support for pro-people legislation during her two terms as AKBAYAN party-list representative. Focus: Healthcare, Women\u0026rsquo;s Rights\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNeric Acosta:\u003c/strong\u003e Former teacher and three-term congressman of Bukidon, with legislative history focusing on environmental concerns. Focus: Environment\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMartin Bautista:\u003c/strong\u003e A successful doctor in the US, decided to come back to the Philippines to offer to serve the country. Focus: Healthcare, including reproductive health\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlex Lacson:\u003c/strong\u003e I have to admit, I\u0026rsquo;m only voting for him because of his book \u0026ldquo;12 Little Things A Pinoy Can Do To Help His Country.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m a sucker for anyone who is able to point out to Filipinos that change has to start with ourselves, even with little things. It\u0026rsquo;s good to have new faces in the Senate instead of just the same old trapos. Focus: education, employment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdel Tamano:\u003c/strong\u003e Originally I wanted to avoid voting for any NP candidates, given how ticked off I am by MV. But unlike the presidential race which is all-or-nothing, I prefer giving other parties some space in the senatorial race so that the Senate won\u0026rsquo;t be a rubber stamp of the administration. Tamano is a good choice, he\u0026rsquo;s another former educator (was head of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila) and adds representation for Mindanao\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePia Cayetano:\u003c/strong\u003e The only other NP senator I\u0026rsquo;m voting for. Her advocacies include health, education, environment, youth and women\u0026rsquo;s empowerment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMiriam Santiago:\u003c/strong\u003e A lot of people don\u0026rsquo;t like Miriam for various reasons (\u003cem\u003eluka-luka, madaldal\u003c/em\u003e were some of the reasons people cited), but I\u0026rsquo;m not the sort of person to dismiss someone just because she doesn\u0026rsquo;t follow social conventions. Miriam has been around a while and doesn\u0026rsquo;t take any BS from anybody. Her presence in the Senate will keep people honest because she likes to call a spade a spade. At the very least, it will keep the Senate interesting. Focus: ???\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m stopping at eight senators for now. None of the others particularly appeal to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Mayor/Vice Mayor of Quezon City, I\u0026rsquo;m going with \u003cstrong\u003eBautista/Belmonte\u003c/strong\u003e, mostly because I trust that Sonny Belmonte wouldn\u0026rsquo;t choose idiots to take over after his well-respected term as mayor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Congressman and District councilors, I\u0026rsquo;m abstaining. I don\u0026rsquo;t know who the candidates are, and even worse, I\u0026rsquo;m voting in a different district than where I\u0026rsquo;m currently residing, I have no right to decide the fate of district 3.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor party-list, I choose \u003cstrong\u003eAGHAM\u003c/strong\u003e party list (same one I voted for last time). It\u0026rsquo;s sad that they are supporting Villar, but I\u0026rsquo;ll just overlook that since I\u0026rsquo;m strongly leaning towards their Science and Technology advocacy. S\u0026amp;T; isn\u0026rsquo;t usually a concern of ordinary Filipinos, but that\u0026rsquo;s something that has to change as it\u0026rsquo;s one of the ways we can climb out of where we are now and attempt to become an industrialized country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhew, composing this post took a while. I have to admit some of my choices were rushed (particularly for Senator), as most of my decision-making energy was spent researching the Presidentiables. Although things can still change between now and Monday, this will probably be close to my final ballot.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
