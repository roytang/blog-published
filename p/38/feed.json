I outgrew scheduled television maybe more than a decade ago. I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of this because I was going through some old disks and found burned episodes of stuff like \u003cem\u003eSmallville\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eHeroes\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe Simpsons\u003c/em\u003e, various anime, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose were from the days before streaming though. These days an abundance of content is available online via the streaming services, no need to store all those episodes yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI first tried out Netflix during my three-month London stint back in 2015 (which I now realized I never wrote about). Netflix wasn\u0026rsquo;t available in the PH yet, so I took the opportunity to take a free month trial which led to binge watching of shows like \u003cem\u003eHouse\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe Office\u003c/em\u003e when I had the opportunity to work from home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few months after I got back from the trip, Netflix became available in the PH, January 2016! I initially figured it might not be feasible at all given how terrible the internet here was, but it performed well enough even with our old 4Mbps BayanDSL. The content library was as expected, a lot smaller than the US one was, but it was a pretty good start. It meant a lot of the Netflix original content, including the Marvel shows, were available to me on demand so it was great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people like to use a VPN so they get access to a larger library, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried that. Honestly, there is already so much content in Netflix PH anyway, and if there\u0026rsquo;s any non Netflix content I wanted to watch, there are other ways rather than a VPN. (The old ways still worked of course.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, Netflix is a staple in our household, even my nontechie dad uses it a lot, thanks to the LG smart tv we bought a while back. And the kids section helps entertain the nieces and nephews whenever they\u0026rsquo;re over. For me personally, aside from the old movies and shows I\u0026rsquo;m happy with a lot of the standup content and original shows. I think even with the limited content library, Netflix PH is still pretty good value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot content with Netflix though, I also subbed to Amazon Prime around six months back. Well, back then my primary goal was to get Twitch Prime in order to get some \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/\"\u003eEternal\u003c/a\u003e loot (LOL), Amazon Prime was a nice bonus. I haven\u0026rsquo;t used it too much though. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen the new Jack Ryan series, it was \u003ca href=\"/2018/10/october-2018-watching-lately/\"\u003epretty good\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;ve also watched a few old movies there, and they have a bunch of comedy series I like such as Community, The Office, Parks, etc. I\u0026rsquo;m coming up on six months for my sub though, which means I\u0026rsquo;m about to lose the discounted new subscriber rate. I don\u0026rsquo;t use Amazon Prime nearly as often as I do Netflix, so I\u0026rsquo;m not yet sure whether I should keep it around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s definitely still a lot of holes in the streaming content available locally though - we don\u0026rsquo;t have Hulu for one thing. And the new services like DC Universe and Disney+ probably won\u0026rsquo;t be available here for a while. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping those companies choose to have Netflix distribute internationally in the meantime. For the regular network shows like the Arrowverse shows, I still have to use traditional less legal methods to keep up weekly. Hopefully we\u0026rsquo;re moving towards a future where international viewers have the same legal streaming options available as the Western world does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(I really should cut down on my TV shows though\u0026hellip;)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Don\u0026rsquo;t expect that you will be able to easily navigate the codebase quickly after just a few days of studying it. Familiarity will come with experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome things that can help:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDon\u0026rsquo;t try to understand everything all at once. Figure out what is interesting to you and focus your efforts there\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFollow the path of data. Easiest way to see how the program works. For example, if I were studying a web application that processes request parameters to generate a search result, I would trace how the program captures the parameters from the requests object, formulates it into a search query, sends it to the database, receives the results, formats the results, then sends it back to the browser. Looking at the typical paths through which data traverses the system can give you a good overview of where everything is. \u003cem\u003ethis may be a problem if you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with the technology or framework the codebase is using, as some of the details may have too many layers of abstraction to trace. In that case, better to brush up and have a basic understanding of the tech first.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTry to fix a bug or implement some sort of change. If it\u0026rsquo;s an open source project, this is probably the best way to familiarize yourself with the codebase \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e get more involved at the same time. I\u0026rsquo;d suggest starting with minor UI bugs, those tend to be easiest to figure out since a text search of the source will often point you to where the correction needs to be made. For example, if the bug is that a particular error message is being shown under the wrong conditions, you can use a text search to find where the error message is declared, then trace all the code points that generate that message, figure out which one you need to update (probably by trial and error) and fix accordingly\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-can-you-read-and-study-a-large-software-project-source-code/answer/Roy-Tang\"\u003eLink to the original answer on Quora\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "title": "Ranked Ladders",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAs I\u0026rsquo;m writing this, I\u0026rsquo;ve been grinding \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/\"\u003eEternal\u003c/a\u003e\u0026rsquo;s ranked ladder, trying to beat the end-of-month ladder reset and hoping to make Master rank again. Since this morning, I\u0026rsquo;ve been moving up and down the threshold of the Diamond I, the rank just below Master, hence frustratingly there has been little progress, less than 24 hours before the ladder reset. I usually do manage to hit Master rank a bit earlier than this, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been a bit busier this month for some reason, so my daily Eternal grinding had been reduced to the token one win per day. I decided to step away from the game for a while and instead write the next day\u0026rsquo;s blog post (this one, obv).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrinding ranked ladders can be a bitch. You basically need to be able to get into a long win streak or have a burst of short win streaks, enough to push you over the next threshold. On average, even good players will win only a bit more than half the time in any decent ranked ladder (since presumably you are matched close to people of your own skill level), so such streaks can sometimes be frustratingly hard to come by. Ranked ladders do reflect one\u0026rsquo;s play skill, at least as long as you are at a rank where you have a significant skill advantage. Once the skill gap narrows, there comes into play a significant element of getting lucky due to win streaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy earliest experience with ranked ladders was Warcraft III back in the early 2000s, but I don\u0026rsquo;t remember taking the ladder there too seriously. Maybe because back then they didn\u0026rsquo;t have the concept of ladder rewards - end of season rewards based on where you finished for that season. They didn\u0026rsquo;t have the whole lootbox/cosmetics/collectibles economic model for online games back then, so there weren\u0026rsquo;t really much rewards to be given out. These days I still have the RTS ranked ladder option via Starcraft II, but somehow online Starcraft is much more stressful for me now and I\u0026rsquo;m getting on with the years, so most likely my ranked ladder grinding will be focused on the less dexterity-reliant genres like CCGs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from Eternal, the only other game I regularly play ranked on these days is \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/mtg-arena/\"\u003eMagic Arena\u003c/a\u003e. Eternal is the one I\u0026rsquo;m currently grinding to Master every month though, as the Arena ladder feels a lot harder to climb. That may change in succeeding months with Wizards\u0026rsquo; recent eSports push, as doing well on the Arena ladder may give a path towards playing in high-level tournaments. Of course, I may also consider cutting down to one regular CCG instead of two, as the ladder grinding can be time-consuming on some days. In such an event, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry Eternal, but Magic is my first love among CCGs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully by the time this post goes up tomorrow I\u0026rsquo;ll have managed to hit my Masters rank target in Eternal. I am of course aware that this grinding is totally unnecessary - there is no significant life penalty if I don\u0026rsquo;t make Masters this month. At worst I miss out on a premium legendary which I don\u0026rsquo;t really need. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m really just grinding to Masters out of habit. It should be okay, as long as I don\u0026rsquo;t stress out over it too much though.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It\u0026rsquo;s basically \u003cem\u003eStar Trek\u003c/em\u003e for a newer generation, but with a different (and sometimes more interesting) mythos and history and so on.
