            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eMany of the manga series I used to follow from long ago have since ended, the only ones still running now are One Piece and Hajime no Ippo. So I thought I\u0026rsquo;d follow some newer ones. Here are some short reviews:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Promised Neverland\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up this one due to a strong recommendation from someone I follow on social media. The premise starts out with some super smart kids who grew up in an orphanage without any knowledge of an outside world. Suddenly they find out that not all is as it seems and that they are actually captives in some kind of human farm for strange \u0026ldquo;demons\u0026rdquo; to consume. The first arc consists of the oldest kids trying to figure out a way to outsmart their captors and escape and find out the truth of what is happening in the outside world. (The previous two sentences aren\u0026rsquo;t too spoiler-y, this setup is pretty much established in the first issue.) The 3 oldest kids are supersmart, so much of the tension lies in them trying to stay two steps ahead of their captors who suspect they know the secret, and at the same time trying to figure out a way to escape with more than 30 kids, some of them toddlers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome spoilers for the second arc follow:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails class=\"spoiler\"\u003e\n    \u003csummary\u003e(Spoilers)\u003c/summary\u003e\n    The second arc after they manage to escape involves them trying to survive in a world that they find to be mostly populated by demons, some of them cunning like humans, and some wild and savage, all of them much stronger than humans. Sometimes writers won\u0026rsquo;t know what to do after their initial premise, but \u003cem\u003eThe Promised Neverland\u003c/em\u003e handles it well; after the initial \u0026ldquo;Prison Break\u0026rdquo; story arc they successfully transitioned into a \u0026ldquo;Wilderness Survival\u0026rdquo; arc that reminds me a lot of Claymore. During the course of their journey to find a safe haven they learn the truth of why the world is like it is which eventually leads to a \u0026ldquo;Revolution\u0026rdquo; arc (currently ongoing) where the protagonists are trying to change the nature of this world. There were some fantastic battle scenes against overwhelming odds in the second arc as well, especially against Lewis and the other demons at Goldy Pond.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cp /\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Promised Neverland\u003c/em\u003e is currently at 130 issues and I enjoyed it a lot. The writing is good, the artwork is not too complicated yet dynamic and flowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr. Stone\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember reading about this one a couple of years ago about promising new series in \u003cem\u003eShonen Jump\u003c/em\u003e, but at that time I chose to start \u003cem\u003eRobot x Laserbeam\u003c/em\u003e instead, which didn\u0026rsquo;t last too long. I didn\u0026rsquo;t start this one back then because I honestly wasn\u0026rsquo;t a fan of the art style, but I gave it another shot last week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe premise is that sometime in 2015 (?), a mysterious petrification beam turned every human being (and swallow) on earth into stone. The protagonist Senku is a genius-level science nerd who manages to keep his consciousness alive for the 3,700 years that it takes until he is freed from his petrification by a mysterious liquid. By this time, human civilization has collapsed, and all that remains is the preserved stone statues of the humans (and swallows). A firm believer in science, Senku resolves to use his analytical skills to restore human civilization, his first task being to study the mysterious liquid that freed him and use it to free some other nearby humans - the first one being his friend Taiju, who has unnaturally high endurance making him suitable for doing the hard labor neded to support Senku\u0026rsquo;s science. While they are in the process of attempting to free a third human, they are beset upon by wild animals and have to run. They have no choice but to use their depetrification formula to free a nearby human who turns out to be a super-strong and athletic fighter who can defeat wild animals with his bare hands, Tsukasa. (All of this happens in the first three issues.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter things settle down, Senku finds out that Tsukasa hates the modern world and does not want to bring everyone back, and he starts smashing statues of older people. Fundamentally disagreeing on the way forward, this sets up the first major arc for the series, with Tsukasa taking control of the depetrification formula to establish his own empire, and Senku vowing to start a Kingdom of Science to advance human civilization and overcome Tsukasa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interesting thing about this series is how focused it is on science, detailing the steps needed to do complicated things like formulating chemicals or building complicated devices like a crossbow or a battery. The series is only 100 issues long so far, but thanks to Senku being ridiculously knowledgable, science advances quickly even in this \u0026ldquo;Stone\u0026rdquo; age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails class=\"spoiler\"\u003e\n    \u003csummary\u003e(Spoilers)\u003c/summary\u003e\n    By the 100th issue, Senku has advanced the cause of science enough to be able to create (with the help of a whole village of people) such advanced devices as mobile communicators, a steam engine-powered boat, and even a carbon-fiber tank.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cp /\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI must admit I can\u0026rsquo;t follow the science myself too closely (since I\u0026rsquo;m not that well-versed in chemistry), so I can\u0026rsquo;t vouch for its accuracy, but I enjoy how it is presented and how Senku explains things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of these series feature superoptimistic protagonists who are hypercompetent and very resolved to save everyone (sometimes even their enemies), no matter the ridiculous odds. A bit trope-y, but I enjoyed both series nonetheless, and both are still ongoing, so I have new manga to look forward to every week!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

From there, I got to a link which said that the \u003ca href=\"https://speedcurve.com/blog/web-performance-page-bloat/\"\u003eaverage page size nowadays is at least 3MB\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis led me to check the performance of this very blog/site. Initial load of the home page clocks in with 13 requests weighing around 140KB total. This is not bad, in fact it would be a significant improvmenet since \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/site-migration-from-wordpress-to-hugo/\"\u003eI migrated to a static site using Hugo\u003c/a\u003e. The homepage of the old Wordpress version of the blog comes with 44 requests totalling a bit over 500KB. And the new homepage lists way more posts too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe page for individual posts leaves some room for improvement however, coming at 62 requests totalling more than 2MB. The main culprit is Disqus which I use for commenting. At least Disqus uses delayed loading, so the content renders immediately, but that\u0026rsquo;s still a lot of bandwidth that could be saved. Leaving aside the question of \u0026ldquo;Do I really need comments?\u0026rdquo;, I did a quick search if there were pre-existing solutions for optimizing Disqus loading on static sites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best hit so far was \u003ca href=\"https://css-tricks.com/lazy-loading-disqus-comments/\"\u003edisqusLoader\u003c/a\u003e, which avoids loading Disqus until the comment area actually scrolls into view. It\u0026rsquo;s a neat idea, but I encountered some JS errors when I did a quick test with it. I\u0026rsquo;ll revisit this again later when I have more time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn alternative of course would be to write my own JS-based commenting engine to rival Disqus, which seems to have no competition in its particular niche. I like building things so this option naturally came to mind, but in all likelihood I don\u0026rsquo;t have time to do that, and there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance it may end up as heavy as Disqus anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeed to think about this some more.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

That of course eventually led me to traipse through the internet archive\u0026rsquo;s wayback machine again, especially looking back at some of my older websites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like having the ability to dig through time and find old content I\u0026rsquo;ve written or created. (Which is only one of the reasons why I advocate \u003ca href=\"/2019/03/export-your-social-media-data/\"\u003ebacking up your social media content regularly\u003c/a\u003e). That\u0026rsquo;s why I like this blog, it means I can easily look through the past and figure out what I was doing, say, in 2011. In fact, I still have a lot of old files to dig through and organize and such. One of my goals is that any old material I find that can safely be made public would be made available through this blog/site. This content is probably of interest only to myself, but that alone is good enough reason to keep them around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are, however, a bunch of things that regretably I can no longer access due to circumstances, such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efiles I had from my college days at EEE. I remember having backed up stuff to a CD before, but I cannot find that CD now\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMy Geocities content from before 2002. I had written somewhere that I was on Geocities since 2000, but the only archive I have is from 2002 (and the wayback machine only goes back that far), and the 2002 archive is only a placeholder that links to other free hosting I had back then. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there was an older version of the site that was mostly a Final Fantasy and Rurouni Kenshin fansite that I probably got rid of because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too happy with it. It\u0026rsquo;s possible that the older version was on one of the \u0026ldquo;neighborhood\u0026rdquo;-style Geocities URLs, as my wayback machine search is only for the \u0026ldquo;username\u0026rdquo;-style URL. I can\u0026rsquo;t recall if I did have a neighborhood-style URL, but if I did, I don\u0026rsquo;t remember it anymore.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYahoo Messenger chat archives. Yahoo Messenger was officially discontinued on July 2018. They provided an export tool that supposedly would have worked until November 2018, but \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/roytang/status/1048949973801267200\"\u003eI had no luck with it\u003c/a\u003e. I read somewhere that they actually lost the old database from before 2011 or such, so there was no way of recovering it at all. I was a bit active on YM back in the day, so that\u0026rsquo;s a big loss.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eold emails from Edsamail and Softhome (basically before Yahoo Mail and Gmail). It is unlikely these still exist in the cloud somewhere, as the norm back then was to delete the emails from the server to save space. It\u0026rsquo;s possibly I have an old hard drive here somewhere that has MBOX files to be parsed though.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that I have access to a scanner, I also wish I had kept old analog stuff like old school notebooks and such. Not because I was really good at notes, but I filled those things with off topic stuff like sketches, plans for building my own games, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThinking about this reminds me of a recent \u003cem\u003eThe Orville\u003c/em\u003e episode where the starship\u0026rsquo;s 25th century computer is able to analyze a smartphone from 2015 and create a simulation of the life of the woman who owned the phone, based on her message history and all that. I doubt if such technology is truly feasible - the data stored in emails and messages and social media is only one aspect of modern life after all - but it\u0026rsquo;s nice to imagine that as long as we archive things successfully, some version of us can still exist in the far future.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Maybe someday I\u0026rsquo;ll lose my privileges I do enjoy so I should take advantage of them while I can. And not worry so much, even if did manage to somehow get into financial ruin, I\u0026rsquo;m skilled and employable enough that I can still live comfortably even then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot to be preachy or anything, but all of this also reminds me of a quote from Matthew 6:26:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously the analogy isn\u0026rsquo;t perfect, because you know, birds can die and be hunted easily, but the point remains. Many are able to live their lives with much less than what I have so I should be grateful and not worry so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0026rsquo;t worry, be happy\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I worry about a lot of things. Recently with the planning for the US trip, the worry that comes to mind is financial: this trip is expensive, should I be cutting back? Can I afford this Airbnb? Can I afford going to Disneyland with my nieces? etc.\nAll this worrying is silly of course. I already know I can well afford the trip, but the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s so expensive triggers the spendthrift in me to worry that I might be spending too much and I might be on a slippery slope to financial ruin.",

I visited the dentist Friday last week and warned her as such. I knew from a years-long ago check up that I had several teeth that would need to be pulled but never followed up. And last week\u0026rsquo;s checkup confirmed that. I scheduled a second visit today to get some of them pulled. I\u0026rsquo;m writing this post before the visit, so if I don\u0026rsquo;t write a post tomorrow, maybe I died from the procedure or something. Does that happen? Do people die from teeth pulling?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously I\u0026rsquo;m not looking forward to the visit, but it\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;ve put off for too long. I\u0026rsquo;m not fond of visiting the dentist (who is?) even though I should know better about how it\u0026rsquo;s necessary. I especially don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of getting my teeth pulled. I have a pretty low tolerance for pain, and there\u0026rsquo;s always the anxiety before the actual visit. There was one time I made a \u003ca href=\"/2004/12/i-get-bored-easily/\"\u003eblog post about an eternity of pain due to a toothache\u003c/a\u003e, and my dentist happened to read the post and jokingly (maybe?) complained to me about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot taking care of my teeth is probably one of my worst regrets in life. It often makes it difficult for me to chew! I know we have a lot of urgent world problems that science could help us with, but if I was allowed to selfishly genie-wish for one scientific innovation to suddenly occur it would be the ability for medical science to regrow human teeth PAINLESSLY. Sure, civilization would probably collapse due to climate change and resource scarcity, but at least I\u0026rsquo;d have my teeth back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpdate: I\u0026rsquo;m alive! The procedure was a lot less uncomfortable than I thought it would be. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m misremembering how bad previous extractions were? Or maybe dental anesthesia technology has advanced since then? In either case I am grateful, yet I have to go back again next week so that more of my teeth may die.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

And yet the very subject invites some to ask why we should even care about the feelings of rapists or murderers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s why we need to care. We need to care because our justice system demands it. Regardless of where we stand on the appropriateness of a death penalty, we must agree that the administration of any punishment must be done in the absence of passion or cruelty. Whether we\u0026rsquo;re putting someone to death, locking them up for shoplifting, interrogating them in a criminal case or holding them while we determine their legal residency status, we must be adamant in our commitment to do so in a way that\u0026rsquo;s free from resentment or rage… or amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy is this so important? It is important because when we allow anger and apathy to seep into our justice system we begin to do unjust things. We keep prisoners in tents whose temperatures reach 114 degrees. We lock them in solitary confinement and laugh as we watch them die of a seizure. We surround them at a traffic stop and kick them in the stomach and face while they lay handcuffed and helpless. We end up with a Supreme Court justice who erupts in a blind rage when his fitness is questioned. We end up with a president who admonishes police not to \u0026ldquo;go so easy\u0026rdquo; on suspects when apprehending them, a president who leads cheers of \u0026ldquo;lock them up\u0026rdquo; whenever he brings up a political opponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe lose our way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe very existence of a criminal justice system is an agreement where the public allows its government to suspend – or even eliminate – some of the rights outlined in our constitution. In doing so we expect our government to exercise this power with the utmost care and respect, even for those accused or convicted of the most serious offenses. Because to do otherwise invites vengeance into our system. Vengeance and justice cannot coexist; one will always replace the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m reminded of how in our country, there are politicians advocating for the death penalty in response to the supposed drug menace, when there has generally been \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/04/30/theres-still-no-evidence-that-executions-deter-criminals/?utm_term=.55ee4ef75738\"\u003eno evidence to show the death penalty deters crime\u003c/a\u003e. The last time we had the death penalty, only one convict was ever executed, the country did not have the stomach for it. I imagine (based only on the perceived behavior of our politicos) that those advocating for the death penalty do not really have deterrence in mind, but rather punishment - they wish to cruelly punish the offender to satisfy the bloodlust of the populace. i.e. Vengeance, not justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eFamily\u0026rsquo;s been planning a US trip this year, and while I wasn\u0026rsquo;t originally planning to join them, they convinced me to go. I was like, why not? My schedule is flexible, I\u0026rsquo;ve never been there, and going to the US meant adding a whole new continent to my experiences. Getting a US Visa was a good idea anyway, in case I ever decided to travel there for some other reason (i.e. I miraculously get a slot in a MTG Mythic Championship or something), and it was a good chance to spend some time with family for a while. It might also be the last time my parents are able to take such a long trip, so might as well take the chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe US Visa screening process has a reputation for being a bit difficult, with many stories of being rejected for random reasons, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too worried. In the end, it turned out easier to get the US Visa than to get \u003ca href=\"/2015/03/europe-trip-2015/\"\u003ethe Schengen visa for the Europe trip\u003c/a\u003e a few years back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe process is actually pretty straightforward. For the Philippines, there\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"http://www.ustraveldocs.com/ph/index.html?firstTime=No\"\u003ea website to help\u003c/a\u003e guide you, all the instructions are there, you just have to follow it. You can do most of the things except for the personal interview online as well. The steps I did were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFill up and submit the online form. This includes uploading a photo to be used in the visa, they have some guidelines to follow. I considered using a webcam photo, but apparently that was a bad idea. Go to a photo studio, they know what kind of picture you need, ask for a digital copy so you can upload it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMake an online payment (they have a couple of options, I did BPI Online). The fee is like $160 for a tourist visa.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSchedule an interview appointment. The first available slot may be weeks out, but sometimes slots open up earlier for some reason. During one of my earlier checks I thought I\u0026rsquo;d have to wait til May to get a slot, but by the time I actually submitted the form and made the payment, there was a March slot freed up.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePrepare any supporting documents you want to bring to the personal interview. You are not actually required to bring any documents, but the website above will give you a list of suggested documents to bring, depending on your visa type and purpose of visit. Everyone I asked actually said the documents they brought weren\u0026rsquo;t needed, but better to be sure of course. I ended up preparing bank statements, certificate of employment, payslips, and tax returns.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOn your scheduled date, go to the US Embassy in Manila for your interview\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interview itself was straightforward, but before you get even there, there\u0026rsquo;s at least six different queues you have to go through:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewaiting outside the embassy for applicants in your time slot (there will be around 50 applicants per time slot)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003equeueing at the embassy entrance so the staff can inspect your appointment papers and tell you where to go\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003equeueing in a holding area outside the processing building. There\u0026rsquo;s seats, and they\u0026rsquo;ll let people proceed to the next step one row of seats at a time. There\u0026rsquo;s snacks and water you can buy here, but it felt awkward to buy because you don\u0026rsquo;t know when your row might suddenly be called to go ahead. Also, this is the last time you get to stay seated for the entire process, once you go in you might have to stand in line(s) for about an hour\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e(step 1) pre-screening. A Filipino embassy staff member will review your documents and your photo. If you didn\u0026rsquo;t upload a photo when you submitted the form online, they\u0026rsquo;ll ask you to go to a photo taking area and get a photo taken and come back to their counter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e(step 2) biometrics. There\u0026rsquo;s a helpful American at this window who will take your fingerprints\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e(step 3) interview. An American will be asking you questions and they will pass or fail your visa application on the spot.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people take a lot longer than others at step 3, and it can make you a bit anxious when you can see the person in front of you being grilled intensely. One lady in a window in front of me was asked how long she planned to stay, and she said \u0026ldquo;one to five months\u0026rdquo; and the interviewer seemed irritated at the vagueness of the reply. \u0026ldquo;Which is it, one month or five months, those are completely different!\u0026rdquo; Another lady and her son said they wanted to visit a sick relative and they had to present a certification from the doctor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy interview was pretty straightforward, I didn\u0026rsquo;t even need any of the documents I prepared. The guy asked me about my purpose of travel, where I had travelled before, and what kind of work I did. He drilled down a bit into the work question, asking me what kind of software I did, which I suspect was just to make sure I wasn\u0026rsquo;t BSing him about being a dev. Overall my time at the window didn\u0026rsquo;t take more than five minutes I think, and he said \u0026ldquo;Ok, I\u0026rsquo;m approving your application and you\u0026rsquo;ll get your visa in a week.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think you don\u0026rsquo;t have anything to worry about as long as you\u0026rsquo;re honest about your reasons for travelling (no intention to deceive) and you\u0026rsquo;re confident (don\u0026rsquo;t look sketchy, which should be easy if you\u0026rsquo;re honest!). I would imagine being able to communicate well in English also helps a lot, that\u0026rsquo;s a bit elitist, but such is life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt worried me a bit that I left without any proof that I had left my passport with them, like a receipt or such. What if they lost it and claim they never had it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, that\u0026rsquo;s just my unnecessary worrying. My passport came back to me by courier three days after the interview, with the visa approved, ten years multiple entry. I\u0026rsquo;m going to the US!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

These days my morning newspaper consists mostly of Flipboard articles, then the local newspaper during lunch and dinner if I am at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from mealtime readings, I also regularly take breaks to check what is going on in social media and my RSS reader. I am, to invent a word, hyperinformed. As soon as something happens, I like to know about it. A bus exploded on EDSA the other day and I told my parents about it before it came up on local news TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis may be a bit of information overflow. And some even say that for the sake of our own mental health, we should avoid consuming the news too regularly. Especially these days, when the news is full of negativity: natural disasters, politicians being stupid or corrupt, crimes and atrocities, invasions of privacy, hatred, racism, war, poverty, and so on. The world can be dark, and news tends to highlight the negative, and consuming it too regularly may begin to affect our worldview.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a desire to stay informed of course, I still consider that a duty as a responsible citizen. To know what issues are being faced by people in our country and in the world, so that we may help craft the decisions to solve those issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut perhaps regular consumption is not so necessary. It might be a good idea to shift to some kind of weekly or monthly schedule of news consumption, instead of daily. The problem would be finding sources that can sum up the past week or month\u0026rsquo;s news, distill it into those things important to know. This might be challenging, especially for local news. But maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll start looking around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then what would I read during breakfast?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I appreciated how they re-told the \u0026ldquo;Carol getting her powers from an explosion\u0026rdquo; and Mar-vell still being there. I appreciate the surprise that Annette Benning was Mar-Vell all along. I appreciate their reimagination of the Kree Supreme Intelligence. I appreciate that by the time Avengers Endgame or any potential Captain Marvel 2 rolls around, Monica Rambeau will be old enough to be her own superhero as well. I appreciate all the little things connecting this movie to the first Iron Man, the first Avengers, and even to Infinity War itself. I also appreciated that their depiction of the Kree did not rule out the Agents of SHIELD versions existing!

The Arrowverse is limping along. Recent episodes of \u003cstrong\u003eSupergirl\u003c/strong\u003e have been great, I loved Jon Cryer as Lex Luthor, and I love how they\u0026rsquo;ve been able to adapt multiple comic book storylines this season such as \u003cem\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s So Funny About Truth, Justice, \u0026amp; the American Way?\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eAmerican Alien\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eRed Son\u003c/em\u003e.

The big headliners to look forward to are of course \u003cstrong\u003eAvengers Endgame\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eShazam\u003c/strong\u003e, and the final season of \u003cstrong\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

For every person, there likely exists a \u0026ldquo;tribe\u0026rdquo;, not necessarily all in one place, a community where that person would fit in. And in the modern age, the internet and social media make it all the more easier for such \u0026ldquo;outsiders\u0026rdquo; to connect with each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a power to this connection, to finding your tribe. It gives you strength and reinforces your beliefs and reassures you that you aren\u0026rsquo;t some strange outlier undeserving of connection. This is why nerd culture has become so popular lately. Traditionally seen as outcasts in the 90s and earlier, now more than ever it has become acceptable to have geeky interests like comic books, Star Wars, tech stuff, and so on. As the early adopters of the online community, nerd culture found its footing earlier than other subcultures, and they found that yes, there are a lot of us, and now the big businesses are starting to listen, seeing the \u0026ldquo;nerds\u0026rdquo; as a massive market to be served.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis connectivity has some downsides too though, since it does not discriminate. This means that even followers of fringe views such as white supremacists, flat earthers, antivaxxers, conspiracy theorists, and so on can connect to each other. If you can find your tribe, they can too. The more fringe the view, the more the worldwide connectivity can empower them. Whereas before a small community might have at most 1 antivaxxer, he would have no source of materials to support his fringe view thus finding it difficult to spread his views. But multiply that with tens of thousands of such communities connected globally online, and you have potentially tens of thousands of antivaxxers. With the internet allowing antivaxxers to reach out to each other and form Facebook groups and discussion forums and such, they can spread the word more easily reinforce their own suspicions about mainstream channels and try to convince other people to join their cause. This can apply to any fringe group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust take a look at the recent Christchurch massacre in New Zealand. The gunman livestreamed and uploaded a video manifesto online and the social media channels had a lot of trouble trying to block the spread of the video. Tens of thousands were re-sharing it, some even modifying the video to evade filters. Supportes in such violence might be rare in your local community, but online they are able to gather in the thousands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt feels like a fundamental weakness in freedom of speech. The traditional argument in favor of allowing all speech is that the best ideas rise to the top and the terrible ones are drowned out, that such fringe views would fall to the wayside in the light of superior arguments. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t take into account people being stupid and succumbing to their confirmation biases and ignoring anything that doesn\u0026rsquo;t support their world views. And as we can see with terrorism, fringe views don\u0026rsquo;t require widespread support in order to damage real lives. This feels like one of those instances, where we have to sacrifice a little bit of freedom for a little bit of security (and probably lose both).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t like it. Hopefully it\u0026rsquo;s something humanity will be able to figure out sometime soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

(Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s just my pack rat personality.) I\u0026rsquo;m not claiming my content is fantastic mind you, but it\u0026rsquo;s a matter of having self-determination. Having it existing only on another person\u0026rsquo;s server means all those bits may be lost at the whim of another party. Ideally I\u0026rsquo;d have a backup of my social media content on a server that I control (in addition to on my own computers). Perhaps in the future I may consider importing all those social media posts and back-importing them into this blog even.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI personally try to backup my social media stuff maybe every three months or so, that seems a reasonable rate.
