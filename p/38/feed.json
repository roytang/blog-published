            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eSomething I haven\u0026rsquo;t done in a while: travel with my parents to Bicol to pay respects to our ancestors during the \u003cem\u003eundas\u003c/em\u003e long weekend. In fact, the last time I made this trip was \u003ca href=\"/2004/10/getting-away-from-it-all/\"\u003eback in 2004\u003c/a\u003e, 15 years ago!

But instead of heading there directly, we went first to Naga City in Camarines Sur, where we had relatives and family friends to visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"10-hour-bus\"\u003e10 Hour Bus\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe overnight bus ride from Manila to Naga is longer than the one to Daet, at an estimated 10 hours. We booked a \u0026ldquo;lazyboy\u0026rdquo; Amihan bus, which meant we would be getting a ride at the Cubao Busport that was newly-opened a couple of years ago. My parents were super-impressed with the busport when it first opened, comparing it to an airport terminal. It was my first time using the busport, and I was mostly underwhelmed. I will say it\u0026rsquo;s nicer than other bus terminals in the country, but that\u0026rsquo;s a low standard and nowhere near an airport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#8ee8b97763ced0a4f23ede57e860c975-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/20191029_171737_hu1850e6ec956155ef1a1d4296057d059f_1216801_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"The Araneta center busport\" title=\"The Araneta center busport\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eThe Araneta center busport (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"8ee8b97763ced0a4f23ede57e860c975-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/20191029_171737.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eThe Araneta center busport\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"4 Nov 2019 12:00am\"\u003e4 Nov 2019 12:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 10-hour bus ride was expectedly miserable; I probably got little more than 2-3 hours of shallow sleep (Fitbit didn\u0026rsquo;t even register any sleep at all, although as if to compensate, it gave me an extra 4000 steps for the next day\u0026hellip;). Comparing it to plane rides (which are also generally miserable), the bus ride had more legroom (yay!) but was way more turbulent (impossible for me to read anything). Level of discomfort with the seat back and difficulty sleeping was about the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSide note: I am generally pessimistic about bus rides, because growing up, these trips to Bicol were a lot more common, and I was lot more prone to motion-sickness while on the bus, especially as some of these Bicol roads are exceptionally curve-y. My mom often had to provide me with a barf bag, because me puking due to motion-sickness on these rides was the rule rather than the exception. Thankfully, I\u0026rsquo;m better able to handle it these days. That, and I have bonamine now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"naga-city\"\u003eNaga City\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy uncle picks us up at the Bicol Central Terminal in Naga, and we have a quick breakfast at the local McDonald\u0026rsquo;s. We drop our bags at his house and rest for a while, after which he takes on a few quick stops around the town. It\u0026rsquo;s my first time in Naga (or at least, the first time in adult memory), so everything is new to me. Apparently, the town is well-known for the Penafrancia festival, something akin to Quiapo\u0026rsquo;s Nazareno festival, a religious festival involving pilgrimage from one religious site to another. Except this one uses a water route somehow (?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst stop is the Jesse Robredo Museum. Disclaimer: I\u0026rsquo;ve never met the former Naga City Mayor/DILG secretary or his wife, the current VP, but we are indirectly related through in-law-ness. My uncle here in Naga is married to Jesse Robredo\u0026rsquo;s sister, making him the Vice-President\u0026rsquo;s brother-in-law, I think? Is that how it works? Anyway, for this reason, the current VP is highly regarded on the father\u0026rsquo;s side of the family, despite the country\u0026rsquo;s divisive politics. The museum itself was ok, highlighting J.Robredo\u0026rsquo;s career highlights and accomplishments. It\u0026rsquo;s not super large (I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine that a museum dedicated to a single politician can be), and a visit is probably 30-45 minutes long (including a short AV presentation).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#81f271719a457caa65701bf431b750b9-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/20191030_110729_hu3e0e29eb884911ebc3971284069254c2_1109802_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Jesse Robredo Museum\" title=\"Jesse Robredo Museum\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eJesse Robredo Museum (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"81f271719a457caa65701bf431b750b9-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/20191030_110729.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eJesse Robredo Museum\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"4 Nov 2019 12:00am\"\u003e4 Nov 2019 12:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eMy uncle drove us around town a bit, pointing out this or that. One thing that struck me was that small-town feel of \u0026ldquo;everybody knows everyone\u0026rdquo;, since he would often point to a building/business as we drove past and say it was owned by the son of so-and-so and my dad would be like, \u0026ldquo;ah, the one who went to X school?\u0026rdquo; and so on and other stuff like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLunch-time we visited this restaurant my dad liked, Jimmy and Tang\u0026rsquo;s (no relation, though jokingly they claim to be cousins). Given my peculiar dietary tastes, I\u0026rsquo;m not much for Bicolano food, but my dad loves it of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfternoon was some free time, so I decided to wander around SM City Naga. Having a mall in Naga is not a new thing, I\u0026rsquo;m told SM City Naga has been there since the late 90s. Still, the mall was quite small, and there\u0026rsquo;s the distinct lack of dedicated stores that I like to visit: Comic book stores, gaming stores, bookstores (National doesn\u0026rsquo;t count!). I imagine it must be difficult to have geeky interests in the provinces. In the evening we had dinner at Robinson\u0026rsquo;s Place Naga, which was the newer mall in the area, and quite a bit bigger than the SM. After that we visited the house of my dad\u0026rsquo;s childhood friend and spent the night there. I pretty much just turned it early due to being tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond day in Naga was more restful than anything else. Lunch time we visited the house of some of my folks\u0026rsquo; CFC friends. They served some beef salpicao (among other things I wasn\u0026rsquo;t inclined to eat) that turned out to be quite good but also quite spicy. That\u0026rsquo;s Bicol for you I guess. After we got back we checked in at the CBD Plaza Hotel opposite the bus terminal where we\u0026rsquo;d be leaving for Daet the next morning. The hotel room was a bit cramped, but it was fine for sleeping (and also had wifi so that\u0026rsquo;s good enough for me.) We rested up at the hotel for a bit before I decided to go around and walk the early evening streets for a bit. Dinner was at the SM City Naga food court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"daet\"\u003eDaet\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the morning we had the free non-buffet hotel breakfast, then checked out of the hotel and got on a bus for Daet. It was a mostly uneventful two-hour ride, though I did see an \u0026ldquo;IPOT FOR SALE\u0026rdquo; roadside sign that I wish I had taken a picture of. My aunt who lived in Daet met us at the terminal and brought us to the Canimog Hotel where we\u0026rsquo;d be staying for the night. The owners of the hotel were friends of the family, which is why my folks chose this place to stay at, but we were the only guests for some reason. Apparently the hotel had seen better days, there was a bit of a creepy vibe lol. But also there was fiber internet (Converge), so all good I guess? During all of my other prior trips to Daet, we had stayed at my grandmother\u0026rsquo;s old house, but that was sold off a few years ago, so now we have to stay in a hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#f6d6372950bc3c876ce7e9b94570d979-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/20191101_121422_hu97f2acfc4be18c45b4863959ebd9252a_1111851_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Canimog Hotel (Daet)\" title=\"Canimog Hotel (Daet)\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eCanimog Hotel (Daet) (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"f6d6372950bc3c876ce7e9b94570d979-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/20191101_121422.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eCanimog Hotel (Daet)\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"4 Nov 2019 12:00am\"\u003e4 Nov 2019 12:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter leaving our stuff at hotel, we immediately went out for lunch at a nearby place called KSarap (I had some yummy chicken cordon bleu), then headed straight for the cemetery afterwards, as it was already the first of November. My grandparents were buried at the Camarines Norte Chinese Cemetery, where each family had like a small mausoleum type thing to house their dead.  Ours housed my grandparents, and also an uncle and aunt who had also lived in Daet. We paid our respects by doing the Chinese thing with the incense sticks and the bowing and the putting them into the bowl. My mom and I left earlier because it was blistering hot and wanted to rest. My dad and aunt and cousin stayed behind to man the mausoleum and greet any visitors and such. Because of that small-town \u0026ldquo;everybody knows everybody else\u0026rdquo; thing, there\u0026rsquo;d often be random people who knew the family coming in to visit and pay respects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#f8677f1e7d4edc1e5e0133d90b5d22d7-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/20191101_135509_hu825b9b50ed4b0c6feeb601bea014e15a_1111036_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"My grandparents\u0026#39; mausoleum (Is that the proper term?)\" title=\"My grandparents\u0026#39; mausoleum (Is that the proper term?)\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eMy grandparents\u0026rsquo; mausoleum (Is that the proper term?)

I believe the house belonged to my dad\u0026rsquo;s aunt, which meant her siblings were my second cousins (?) is that how it works lol. Pretty big family too. Anyway, many of them remembered me from when I was little, but I had little recollection of them, though I tried to get along of course. I did enjoy their stories of Daet and how things have changed along the years, and there was more of that \u0026ldquo;everybody knows everybody else\u0026rdquo; feeling when they were talking about old neighbors or friends who had passed away, or what happened to old buildings or businesses in town, and so on. My dad also enjoyed the food quite a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"anticipated-mass-and-more-thoughts-on-daet\"\u003eAnticipated mass, and more thoughts on Daet\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter lunch we mostly rested up at the hotel and then went out for anticipated mass (it was Saturday the 2nd) in the early afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I had visited Daet many times during my childhood, I find that I don\u0026rsquo;t really have a good \u0026ldquo;mental model\u0026rdquo; of the town, unlike places that I\u0026rsquo;ve visited as an adult. When I was young, we were mostly limited to my grandmother\u0026rsquo;s old house, and the beach, and maybe went out a few times to some other places, but never really enough for me to grasp the size or layout of the town. The big difference now is that internet is ubiquitous, which means I have Google Maps as a reference. The Globe signal can be spotty in some places, but still generally workable. This is a huge contrast to my 2004 visit where I had to go to \u003ca href=\"/2004/10/posting-from-the-boondocks/\"\u003ean internet shop to do internet things\u003c/a\u003e. Even my aunt and cousin have fiber internet here. So now during this visit I at least know the major road names and have some idea of where places are relative to other places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything feels a bit more modern now too. In my last visit, I complained about having to flush the toilet manually with a bucket. Not only is that a thing of the past now, but all of the places we stayed at now had bidets! Ah, bidets, the symbol of modern living. In general, Naga and Daet feel like they could be suburbs of Metro Manila; there aren\u0026rsquo;t any tall skyscrapers like in Makati or Ortigas, but looking at the streets and the shops and so on, it would be hard to differentiate from some of the more far-flung residential QC areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also found it interesting whenever my dad would converse with other people in Bicolano. I don\u0026rsquo;t speak the dialect, but it\u0026rsquo;s close enough to Tagalog that I can often get the gist of what\u0026rsquo;s being discussed. (Closer than something like Cebuano at least.) It\u0026rsquo;s a weird feeling listening to a language that\u0026rsquo;s almost familiar but not. Maybe this is how Spanish people feel when hearing Catalan, or such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"going-home\"\u003eGoing Home\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the mass, we had a fast-food dinner at Greenwich, then went back to our hotel to checkout and then on to the bus terminal. We would be taking a DLTB \u0026ldquo;lazyboy\u0026rdquo; bus from Daet to Cubao, a trip estimated at around 8 hours. The DLTB bus had a bit more legroom than the Amihan bus, but the seats were a bit slippery and any attempt to sleep led to me slipping down into an uncomfortable position. So again, miserable bus trip with little sleep, as expected. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t get motion sickness again this time, so that\u0026rsquo;s something. The bus trip was fairly quick as well - we arrived an hour earlier than I expected. When we got off the bus, we took a grab home and I was glad to be back in my own bed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole trip was worthwhile, it\u0026rsquo;s always good to connect with your roots, no matter how distant they may have gotten. And stepping away from Metro Manila and all its problems was a welcome thing as well (though I did miss my desktop PC). Given my parents\u0026rsquo; age, there is a nontrivial chance that I never get to visit Bicol again; I certainly wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go by myself after all. So it was better to take this opportunity while it was there. Well, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll go again next year? We\u0026rsquo;ll see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore photos from the trip at the \u003ca href=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/\"\u003ephoto dump\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It\u0026rsquo;s not a super good story or super original, but I did enjoy the challenge. Basically, I started out with a small group of adventurers (initially 2, but later 3 characters) in a dungeon for some reason, and followed them as they tried to get out of various dangerous situations. I also consider my handwriting quite atrocious, so I tried to avoid having to write too much text. (There was one drawing where I tried putting drawings in speech bubbles instead to get around this.) The sketchpad I was using was fairly small, and my manual dexterity is not so good these days, so a lot of my lines are shaky, since I don\u0026rsquo;t have the advantage of digital sharpening etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe challenge usually came when I had to find a way to link the prompt to the current situation they were in, and to \u0026ldquo;advance the story\u0026rdquo; a bit every time, shall we say. I ended up having some days not have a single drawing, but rather a more comic-book style sequence of smaller panels. I think on average my ink drawings weren\u0026rsquo;t as detailed as they were in previous years, but I did enjoy the challenge of having to string them together to form some semblance of a plot and also doing the panel layouts. The challenge was pretty fun, although stressful at times. I would only look ahead on the prompt list a few days of a time, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a beginning-to-end plan or anything like that, but I did have some anxious days where it took me forever to figure out a way to somehow meet the prompt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made these drawings on a 152mm x 229mm sketchpad, using a Uni pin fine line pen I got a few years back. Many of them had pencil sketches first (especially those that were more complicated or challenging, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t really erase the pencils thoroughly so you can still spot them on most of the drawings. There was also one day where I tried using some colored markers I found around the house to add some color, but the lines ended up way too thick so I was unhappy with it and didn\u0026rsquo;t use them again. I had uploaded this series to \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/roytang0400/\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e as square images (since that\u0026rsquo;s what Instagram accepts), but the original scans were mostly of full rectangular sketchpad page, so I present them here for your viewing pleasure. (Note: I\u0026rsquo;m not claiming these are super good works or anything!) You can also view the original individual posts with captions via the \u003ca href=\"/tags/inktober2019\"\u003einktober2019\u003c/a\u003e tag on this site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I enjoyed the challenge so much, I\u0026rsquo;m hoping this can set me back on my daily sketching routine. Though I\u0026rsquo;ve already missed the first two days of November due to being out of town, but that\u0026rsquo;s not something unrecoverable, hopefully!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eActually watched something in the cinema this month: \u003cstrong\u003eJoker\u003c/strong\u003e. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t originally sure if I wanted to see it, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t hyped for it at all in the months prior. But as the showing date came nearer, there was a lot of buzz around it so I decided to go anyway. I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like it lived up to the hype and the warnings about promoting incel stuff, but at least it\u0026rsquo;s one of the higher-grossing DC movies, so maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll have more to come in that vein. MCU movies all have kind of same-y tone and feel, so probably DC can differentiate itself by doing these heavier movies with a different kind of style. My spoiler-free review of this movie is \u003ca href=\"https://roytang.net/2019/10/1180086308963618816/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter watching Joker and also reading Scorsese recent comments about \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/04/martin-scorsese-says-marvel-movies-are-not-cinema\"\u003eMCU movies not really being cinema\u003c/a\u003e, I decided to watch one of his movies and decided on \u003cstrong\u003eGoodfellas\u003c/strong\u003e. (The only other one I had seen prior to this was \u003cem\u003eShutter Island\u003c/em\u003e, which for a long while I thought was a Nolan flick.) Goodfellas was pretty good, definitely nothing like an MCU movie. They are obviously different kinds of \u0026ldquo;cinema\u0026rdquo; altogether, with the MCU movies leaning more towards the \u0026ldquo;popcorn\u0026rdquo; side of the spectrum. I did find it a bit hard to take Joe Pesci seriously here since I only really knew him from \u003cem\u003eHome Alone\u003c/em\u003e. I believe this is also the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen Ray Liotta in a film, so now I know who he is. I definitely enjoyed the \u0026ldquo;slice-of-life\u0026rdquo; look into the old-school gangster lifestyle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also watched \u003cstrong\u003eStuber\u003c/strong\u003e, mostly because this movie kept being advertised when I was in the US and it reminded me of Deadpool and that taxi driver friend of his. I was only expecting Batista, but Karen Gillan is also here (briefly!), so there\u0026rsquo;s a tiny GotG reunion there. Indian taxi driver dude was cool, the movie was ok, moderately funny, nothing too genre-busting. More popcorn movies for scorsese to snub his nose at, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatching up on my backlog of DC animated films, I decided to watch \u003cstrong\u003eWonder Woman: Bloodlines\u003c/strong\u003e. Plot spoilers, it\u0026rsquo;s basically a gaggle of WW villains (Silver Swan, Doctor Poison, Doctor Cyber, Cheetah, Giganta) plotting to invade Themyscira, I suspect to make them more well-known among the DC animated viewers. Coincidentally, I had also recently read the WW Rebirth story arc where a gaggle of WW villains tried to trick her into revealing the location of Themyscira, so I had a fresh point of comparison. In the comic book arc, everything was masterminded by Veronica Cale, a pharmaceutical CEO who had been created in the early 2000s with the intent of being the Lex Luthor to WW\u0026rsquo;s Superman. In the movie Cale works with WW for a while, and along I was waiting for the reveal that she was behind everything, but that never came. I would guess they have some bigger plans for Veronica Cale down the line in the DC animared film-universe. Otherwise, the movie was ok. Nothing too spectacular, missable, but also good enough to watch. EDIT: I found out after I wrote this that Bloodlines had a mid-credits scene where WW figures out Cale was behind everything all along!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTV-wise, not much to say right now. The fall shows are back, that means the Arrowverse is in full swing again (except for Legends, they\u0026rsquo;ll be back in January). The \u0026ldquo;science\u0026rdquo; on \u003cstrong\u003eFlash\u003c/strong\u003e is still ridiculous. The flash forwards on \u003cstrong\u003eArrow\u003c/strong\u003e are still boring (I don\u0026rsquo;t understand why they want to make a spinoff for Mia Smoak!), \u003cstrong\u003eSupergirl\u003c/strong\u003e is also a bit meh. I\u0026rsquo;m really only looking forward to the Crisis crossover this season (and of course, \u003cem\u003eLegends of Tomorrow\u003c/em\u003e.) Haven\u0026rsquo;t watched Batwoman yet, maybe I should since she has one of the five Crisis episodes. Also been following some of the regular stuff: The Good Place, Modern Family, etc. There\u0026rsquo;s also a lot of superhero shows still on the backlog, some of which I may never get to watch: Runaways, Cloak and Dagger (cancelled!), Krypton (cancelled!), Legion (finished!), Doom Patrol, Titans S2, etc. Maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a point where there\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003etoo much\u003c/em\u003e content for comic book fans? Lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNetflix: I saw that Jenny Slate has a standup special out and I tried watching it, but eh, not for me, found it very boring and stopped about a third of the way through. I also found myself re-watching the end of \u003cstrong\u003eFull Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood\u003c/strong\u003e, mostly because I was envious of a friend who was watching it for the first time. Was surprised to learn the anime is 10 years old as of this year! Still held up well, possibly my favorite anime of all time. The final confrontation and fight scenes were great, although the epilogue episode was a bit anticlimactic and awkward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s it for this month. Maybe next month we manage to dent the ever-growing backlog? Maybe?\u003c/p\u003e\n",
