Down by 410 lol. I started writing answers on Quora last year a bit out of boredom but my interest kinda tapered out. I still answer on occasion.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProgramming languages/frameworks learned: I\u0026rsquo;ll say 5. I did projects with Node.JS and React Native. I was also involved in a non-trivial PHP project for a while, so I\u0026rsquo;ll count that as well (my previous exposure to PHP was only small scale.) Not really a PL or FW, but I also learned usage of \u003ca href=\"/2017/04/marklogic-nosql/\"\u003eMarkLogic NoSQL database\u003c/a\u003e which also gave me an opportunity to learn XQuery. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll write a more detailed post about these later on\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOther countries visited: 2 (Japan and Singapore). Probably 0 next year.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMTG GPs attended: 2 (Manila and Singapore). Did not do too well this year.

(up 48! Most of that is due to a humble bundle I got that had 30 games; (3 PS4 retail, 1 Wii U retail, 21 Steam, 1 from a GOG Pinata, 41 from Humble Bundle; maybe I should scale back a bit lol)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGames \u0026ldquo;finished\u0026rdquo; (story/campaign completed OR achievement complete): 8 (FFXV, KH2, P5, BotW, One Piece:PW3, Stardew Valley, Persona Q, Ori and the Blind Forest).

            "title": "My Coding Approach",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI was thinking about my typical approach to coding. When writing a new feature, I tend to implement in the direction of where the data flows, starting from the user interface then to the backend and back to the frontend and wherever else that goes. I will build incrementally, using debugging tools or console printouts to ensure that each step is working correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an example, here\u0026rsquo;s how I did a recent web-based function:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe user needs to see a new button on the screen, so I add the HTML for that button and just have the click handler be an alert confirming the button has been clicked.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe button needs to open a modal dialog. I write the HTML for the modal dialog, then add the code to the button to launch the modal.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOn load, the modal dialog needs to fetch some data from the server. I write the Javascript to make the ajax call on launch of the modal.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOn the backend, I map the URL route used by the above ajax call to a controller method. The controller method simply outputs a debug message to the console. I refresh the page on the front end, click the button to launch the modal and verify on my server\u0026rsquo;s console that the controller method has been called.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI modify the controller method to call a method on the relevant model. I write the stub method on the model with a dummy return value, which the controller method then outputs to the console. I verify the entire flow again.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI write the retrieval logic in the controller method. I verify the entire flow again, using server console output to verify the correct data is being returned to the controller.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI have the controller write the returned data to the response as JSON. I go back to the frontend and modify the success handler of the ajax call to log the response to the Javascript console. At this point, I also update the error handler to do whatever is appropriate. I verify the entire flow again, this time confirming that the correct data is displayed in the browser console.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe user needs to see the data from the response, so I write the Javascript and HTML to render the response inside the modal dialog. I verify the entire flow again, this time confirming that the correct data is shown in the modal dialog.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if this is the best approach, but it works for me. It feels incremental, systematic, methodical, and easy to see where things go wrong (which they inevitably do). As kind of an upside, I also strangely feel compelled to not stop until I have working complete flow. Of course the downside is that if I have to stop at any point, I now have a nonworking UI component, but at least that\u0026rsquo;s a clear indicator of where I need to pick up next time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realize that a lot of modern software engineering advocates recommend some kind of test-driven approach. I imagine with such an approach start with the smallest iota of functionality, write a test for it, then write the actual code, then work outwards from there, building more complexity on top. So for the example above, maybe I should have started with the retrieval logic on the backend then work my way outwards from there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do that sometimes but I find that as a full-stack engineer my natural tendency is work my way across a new feature in this manner \u0026ndash; from user interface to backend and back. Combined with the difficulty of writing code to test UI/HTML/JavaScript, this means I rarely get into the mindset of test-driven development. It\u0026rsquo;s not something I ever got used to. Maybe someday a switch will click and I will get it and my mind will be blown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy approach does have some benefits though, in that I\u0026rsquo;m defining the interfaces first before diving into the guts of the logic. In that sense it\u0026rsquo;s kind of \u0026ldquo;test-driven\u0026rdquo; except all my testing is manual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do think having such a systematic, incremental method of implementation is a good skill for the junior programmer to learn though. My experience is that many younger programmers (especially those fresh out of college) tend to write huge chunks of code/logic/functionality then get surprised when the very first thing breaks down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecently when sitting down with a junior to help them walk through some problem I often show them how I debug problems this way. I trace the entire flow from start to end, adding debug messages as I go, to help identify at which step the process goes awry. I also try to describe my proposed approach for complex new functions this way. I\u0026rsquo;ll prototype a small part of it from frontend to backend, writing debug messages all the way, and it conveniently leaves the junior with a template for writing the rest of the functionality. (Although I am as of yet unable to attest to the efficacy of this approach)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been writing code for a long time, and while I wasn\u0026rsquo;t self-aware enough back when I started out to document how I was writing software, I like to think I\u0026rsquo;ve improved a lot since then. And for sure there\u0026rsquo;s still a lot to learn. Maybe some years from now I\u0026rsquo;ll look back on this blog post and chuckle about how naive I was and write a new blog post detailing an even better approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
