I\u0026rsquo;m no Computer Science graduate, but I did manage to fake it well enough to pass theÂ \u003ca href=\"http://www.jitse.org/\"\u003eJITSEÂ \u003c/a\u003ecertification exams. I code because I find that I\u0026rsquo;m fairly good at it.

I passed the ECE board exams in 2002, but have never practiced as an Engineer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScientist : Does having a Bachelor in Science degree allow me to consider myself a scientist? What about graduating from the premiere science high school in the country? A naturally geeky curiousity that tends to overanalyze everything?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCritic : No wait, that last one from \u0026ldquo;Scientist\u0026rdquo; goes here. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m only somewhat of a critic. Or maybe what I really meant at the time was that I enjoy criticizing things. ðŸ˜€\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGamer : Well, just by reading this blog you know I\u0026rsquo;m into games. Card games, board games, console games, computer games, psychological games, you name it. Regarding electronic gaming, I started with the Atari 5600 that my parents bought in the US, and only during the PS2 era have I started to slow down. At one point or another I have been addicted every major genre: strategy, RPG, action, FPS, puzzle, whatever. Well, except for Dance Dance Revolution and the like. I\u0026rsquo;m really sucky at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDreamer : I dream of a lot of things, and not only when I sleep. There are a lot of things I want to do, and more things I want to be. Off the top of my head, I want to be a published game developer, a published writer and world-famous. And those are just the three most probable ones :p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKid-at-heart : I guess you have to be a kid-at-heart to dream the dreams that I do. I really want to expound on this, and the \u0026ldquo;Dreamer\u0026rdquo; part, but I\u0026rsquo;m afraid that would entail entirely separate entries. ðŸ˜€\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eYeah, I haven\u0026rsquo;t been posting lately. I still have a lot of thoughts running around my head, and often throughout the day I find myself thinking, \u0026ldquo;I should post an entry about this.\u0026rdquo; But at the end of the day, I\u0026rsquo;m tired and I\u0026rsquo;m exhausted from thinking about two hundred different issues and juggling twenty different priorities, so I don\u0026rsquo;t post about it. I note it somewhere and sooner or later it becomes irrelevant and I forget why I wanted to post it in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remarked to one of my coworkers that I often find myself remembering dozens of things in my head simultaneously and he of course reminded me of the popular notion that human beings can only remember seven things at any one time. It\u0026rsquo;s the concept of limitation in humans\u0026rsquo; short-term memory or RAM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is probably mostly true, but as I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten more and more used to this multitasking mode of mine, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that the seven most important things stay on top, but the rest don\u0026rsquo;t really disappear. They fall away for a while, swallowed into your subconscious, only to rear their ugly head again later once you have some free RAM again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy current role at work forces me to be locked in this mode for most of the day. As one of the senior technical guys, I typically field dozens of technical questions from junior developers during a single day and when somebody\u0026rsquo;s problem can\u0026rsquo;t be solved quickly I physically get up from my desk and go walk them through it. And that\u0026rsquo;s just the queries regarding concerns outside my own project. Aside from that I often have to worry about scheduling, technical risks, physical designs and of course the occasional invitation to go down and buy some food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeveloper multitasking is generally looked-down upon in the tech world I know; people are encouraged to work directly on one task at a time to give them focus. Maybe most people have some short period of time at the start of the day to reply to emails and address issues raised by other people. I wish I could have that sort of luxury, but it seems to me that every issue or problem raised to me needs to be resolved five minutes ago. People can\u0026rsquo;t continue coding unless I help them. Schedules can\u0026rsquo;t be finalized until I give my input. Developers can\u0026rsquo;t write program specifications until I hand in the database design. I literally have dozens of dependencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, how do I cope? Simple, I cope the only way I know how. By instinct. This would be a terrifying revelation to anyone I actually work with, but during working hours I\u0026rsquo;m typically buried under so many issues, my only recourse is to dismiss as many as I can as quickly as possible, and that requires a whole lot of working from my gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, my gut has gotten really good at this. But I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure all the people who are incredibly organized and have moleskin notebooks and stuff would tear their hair at such an unorganized method (or is it madness?). And I know, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to get organized, I really am. I have to-do lists, a couple of dozen that tell me what I should be doing. I have log files that theoretically tell me what I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing all day. I try to turn off my email client sometimes, even though I will inevitably have people coming up to me and asking if I\u0026rsquo;d seen the mail they just sent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I can\u0026rsquo;t help it. That\u0026rsquo;s the role I play. People expect me to help them, to provide them guidance. I\u0026rsquo;ve projected myself as being open to consultations, and the company and all of my coworkers appreciate that. And even then I still have my own tasks to perform. I\u0026rsquo;m considering suggesting to the company that I never be considered working on a project for more than a 50% allocation. The other 50% should be allocated to my on-the-fly firefighting tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the day, especially during the past couple of weeks, I\u0026rsquo;ve found myself mentally exhausted. I have a very easy time separating work from personal life, because by the time I step into the elevator after logging out I\u0026rsquo;m already too tired to even think about work issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that I have a bad job, mind you. It\u0026rsquo;s awesome. But I guess sometimes I toss myself into it a bit too much. When my personal load is light, I can easily handle everything tossed at me and people go \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re awesome!\u0026rdquo; and I nod and address the next crisis. But when my load is heavy, well, then things really get exciting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forgot what my point was now, as I unconsciously launched into a narrative of how my typical day goes. I\u0026rsquo;m still getting by with my gut, but I know from experience that gut instinct only gets you so far. Sooner or later, something\u0026rsquo;s gonna give and I\u0026rsquo;ll need to find some way to make sure I can carry this level of awesome-ness to the next level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, and yeah I changed layouts.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Any serious gamer worth his salt knows about it \u0026ndash; whether he plays turn-based strategy games or not. And the fourth installment was eagerly awaited in our home \u0026ndash; two out of four brothers were eager to play the latest update.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Civ4 is in many ways the same game all over again. The basic premise is still there \u0026ndash; explore, build cities, research technologies, kick other civivlizations while they\u0026rsquo;re down, race to space, etc. But several other new features have kicked in, many of them adding a new layer of management complexity to the already complex strategy game. Great Persons, National Wonders, cultural expansion, luxury resources\u0026hellip; well, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if some of these are new since Civ3 \u0026ndash; I didn\u0026rsquo;t play that one much. The most important change has to be the streamlining of the interface such that it becomes easy to tell at a glance what a city is building and how long it takes for it to grow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, as expected, the game is still incredibly engrossing. I sat down yesterday morning to \u0026ldquo;just give it a try\u0026rdquo;, and after what seemed like a few short turns found myself contemplating whether to nuke the Arabians in the early 17th century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo yeah, awesome Civ4 gameplay, as expected. I finished two games in short order, one took me 4 hours because the silly Germans and Spanish kept trying to declare war on me, and I had to be satisfied with a Time Victory. The second took less than two hours \u0026ndash; full peace/diplomacy, science/culture all the way, never entered a state of war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I\u0026rsquo;m not playing it again. Why? Because the game\u0026rsquo;s performance is crap-tastic! You can play smoothly found maybe 5-10 minutes before the game starts slowing to a crawl. Going to the lowest possible settings and quitting all running programs doesn\u0026rsquo;t help at all. Apparently I\u0026rsquo;m not alone, as I\u0026rsquo;ve seen numerous message board posts lambasting Firaxis for the terrible performance of the game regardlesss of the system running it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a testament to both the addictiveness of the gameplay and how much patience I\u0026rsquo;ve gained recently that I was able to finish two games at all. But as it is, I\u0026rsquo;m not playing it again until some radical performance improvment happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I can still find a copy of Civ3\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Paolo Santos carried Magasin surprisingly well, and Superproxy was just the right track for Francis M. Radioactive Sago\u0026rsquo;s Alcohol is hilarious, and I like the way Orange and Lemons mixed a little bit of Julie Tearjerky and Tikman in Huwag Kang Matakot. I also think I actually like CueshÃ©\u0026rsquo;s version of Hard To Believe better than the original. My least favorite track on the album is Kitchie Nadal\u0026rsquo;s Ligaya, (cute laugh on the \u0026ldquo;inaahit\u0026rdquo; bit notwithstanding) as I really prefer the more upbeat original.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish more bands had contributed to the effort though, as the â€˜heads probably deserve it. According to my brother, the participating artists were all from the same recording studio (I don\u0026rsquo;t really pay attention to studios, so yeah I\u0026rsquo;ll just agree here.) Still, it would\u0026rsquo;ve been nice to hear some renditions from â€˜heads contemporaries like Rivermaya and Parokya ni Edgar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, awesome album.

She grew up knowing only one language \u0026ndash; body language. Her mind processes human motions as fluently as ordinary people speak their native tongue. She can see moves before they happen or read a person\u0026rsquo;s intentions simply by following their movement patterns. She was an experiment to create the ultimate human fighting machine. At the age of eight, she made her first kill. Then she ran away. She wound up in Gotham, under the tutelage of the Dark Knight. She has become Batgirl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI read through the current 70 issues over the weekend. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty good. Batgirl almost always faces up against normal people \u0026ndash; goons, thugs, mafia and whatnot. She\u0026rsquo;s not metahuman either, but her superior abilities allow her to dodge bullets and kill with her bare hands (Not that she does kill mind you, but she CAN.) The fact that she\u0026rsquo;s illiterate and basically ignorant of how to interact with the rest of society makes the comic all the more interesting and provides a lot of room for her to grow as a character.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing I don\u0026rsquo;t like about trying to follow a single comic series \u0026ndash; crossovers. You read an issue, and suddenly there\u0026rsquo;s several other comics you need to read to get the whole picture. I can see why they do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
