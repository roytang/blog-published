More likely, it\u0026rsquo;s going to die to a common like Oblivion Ring. However, Ajani is still pretty good in limited, due to that very nice special move: you play her on turn 4 with 2-3 creatures on the board, pump them once, then swing. Next turn, play another creature or so, pump, swing. Sooner or later, all your guys are bigger than his guys. Also, if you\u0026rsquo;re dying to some stupid 1/1 evasion guy, just gain 2 life a turn.

More likely you would play him on a later turn, with counter back-up. A simple Constructed application would be to use his special move 3 times, but that\u0026rsquo;s just a bad Harmonize. The other two abilities require you to build your deck around them \u0026ndash; you\u0026rsquo;re not going to use that finisher unless you\u0026rsquo;re actually a mill deck, and the normal ability smells of Owling Mine to me.

The special move on the other hand, pulls out all your other bombs from your deck (hope you had a few!) The normal move is meh in both Limited and Constructed \u0026ndash; paying 5 for a repeating single discard effect isn\u0026rsquo;t really that good.

If not\u0026hellip; wow, more free Beasts! I\u0026rsquo;d use him this way in either Limited or Constructed. In fact, I can build a green deck just starting with 4 Call of the Herd 4 Garruk Wildspeaker\u0026hellip; that\u0026rsquo;s at least 20 creatures right there. Another application would be to use the normal move to accelerate into early 6-7 casting cost threats, butI like 3/3s better. The finisher is decent, and pretty good in Limited. It has a disadvantage over an actual Overrun in that your opponent can see it coming, but if you\u0026rsquo;re planning to use it then you\u0026rsquo;re probably winning anyway; in a defensive board the 3/3 beast is a better idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I got a copy of six of the books from an officemate a couple of months back, and I\u0026rsquo;ve just finished the seventh book today. I don\u0026rsquo;t usually go through books that quickly, so it\u0026rsquo;s a sign that I\u0026rsquo;ve really enjoyed this series.

The later books branch from the original, with the Speaker for the Dead arc leaning towards philosophical meanings of life in outer space, while the Shadow series of books focus more on political and strategic stuff on Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Speaker for the Dead branch (Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, Children of the Mind), Card\u0026rsquo;s characters are usually placed in a series of moral and ethical dilemmas presented by the various sci-fi elements presented: metaphysical discoveries, sentient alien races, etc. The reader is really drawn in to the character\u0026rsquo;s situations, making the books quite the page turner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Shadow branch (Ender\u0026rsquo;s Shadow, Shadow of the Hegemon, Shadow Puppets, and I have yet to read Shadow Giants) focuses less on the moral decisions, but more of political or military-related issues in a world divided after the defeat of the alien invaders. The story focuses on what happens to Ender\u0026rsquo;s companions after they return to Earth, and seem to be leading up to how Ender\u0026rsquo;s brother Peter eventually became the leader of the world. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit disappointing that Peter is so stupid in Shadow Puppets though, I hope he\u0026rsquo;s better in the next book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe series is awesome overall, and I look forward to the continuation; supposedly Card is writing a sequel that will tie both branches together.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Obviously, the black was too strong to be just a small splash as I wanted. Maybe green should have been the splash? I often ended up boarding +2 swamp +1 sudden death +1 dark withering -2 forest -1 citanul woodreaders -1 thallid germinator. I really like that sliver linear I had going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst round was against a guy playing UGR, he had Call of the Herd which was annoying. He had in both games one and three, and I practically lost to it. Game two I won the back of turn two Gemhide, turn three Bonesplitter and he missed the third land drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1: 1-2 loss vs UGR Call of the Herd\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond round was against a famous local player who won a very big tourney recently (yeah, I try to avoid mentioning names). We were playing the same colors, but I had more removal (obviously). I even had to kill a clockwork hydra twice in two turns. I won in two. This guy eventually made top eight though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2: 2-0 win vs BGR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird round was against a teachings deck. He had a lot of fun instants to teach for \u0026ndash; Dead / Gone, Piracy Charm, Cancel. And Mystic Speculation gave him a way to find the cards he really needed. He stabilized early in game one and won. In game two, I was at 5, he had three creatures (Bogardan Rager, the blue Harrow spellshaper and Firefright Mage) on the board, and had cast Mystic Speculation three times during his turn, so there was a good chance he had what he needed to take me down. He was at 15, I took something like 5-10 minutes with two-headed sliver, sedge sliver, a morph (Gathan Raiders, I have 1 card in hand) and 4 kobolds, computing if I had enough to kill him with Tromp. I knew he had a dead/gone in hand (he tutored for it) and had 3 mana open. I cast Tromp. It resolves. He\u0026rsquo;ll probably bounce the Sedge, that leaves me with a total of 22 damage versus 7 toughness on the board \u0026ndash; just enough to kill. I swing. He blocks. I unmorph the raiders. He counts, then counts again, then shuffles up for game 3. Game three was a heartbreaker \u0026ndash; I had aggro\u0026rsquo;d him down to 2 before he stabilized, and I had around three turns to draw the Orcish Cannonade that would end the game, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t. I tried playing the Scourge to finish him, but he had the Cancel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3: 1-2 loss vs RU Teachings\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a good start in a six-round tournament. :/\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound four was against a guy I was sitting with during deck construction. I knew his deck had a ton of removal, but I also knew he had a vulnerable land mix. So I just had to aggro early to win. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the details, but I lost game 1 and my game 2 notes show I took him down from seventeen in one swing O_o\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: 2-1 win vs RB control\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound five against green/red. Game one I\u0026rsquo;m about to win so I try to Death Rattle a Baloth. I realize it won\u0026rsquo;t work though, and hold off. But my opponent calls a judge on me. The judge rules that I need to choose another legal target, the only one being my own Sedge Sliver. I believe that this is an incorrect ruling and to avoid it, I will always declare my targets first before paying costs next time. I shrug and set it aside, and he stabilizes and I lose the game. I\u0026rsquo;m a bit ticked off of course, and he loses the next two games to my merciless aggro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5: 2-1 win vs RG\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m number ten! A win brings me into the top eight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound six vs an old-time Magic player. He\u0026rsquo;s always around at tournaments and generally a nice guy. His deck is black/red and chock-full of removal, creatures basically don\u0026rsquo;t stay long on our board. I lose game one, no obvious misplays. Game two, I\u0026rsquo;m ahead on racing, but then he drops a Kaervek the Merciless! All I have in hand is a Dark Withering\u0026hellip; but that can\u0026rsquo;t touch Kaervek. I draw a Dustwasp and take the five damage, going down to four, hoping the flyer will be enough to raise him. Next turn he Dread Returns an Emberwilde Augur and plays another creature. I can\u0026rsquo;t race those guys, so I just pass the turn. During his upkeep, he tosses the Goblin at me and shows the Ghostfire. GG.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake his hand and wish him luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6: 2-0 loss vs BR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finish 16th, winning 3 PLC packs, of course with nothing spectacular in them.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThis weekend was the first of three \u0026ldquo;Pre-Lorwyn Triple Treats\u0026rdquo; at Neutral Ground, featuring Saturdays with three tournaments: one each of Standard, Block Constructed and Legacy. I tried preparing a deck for block but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t come up with anything consistent enough. Lazily, I just picked up the Standard Rakdos deck the day before the tourney, tweaked the sideboard for the inevitable TarmoRack decks (-4 Bottle Gnomes +4 Dodecapod). I lacked a 15th sideboard card, so I toss in a random Seize the Soul. (I need to go to the office really early in order to be able to play)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound one was a guy I never met before (it happens). I can tell from his sleeves and the Akroma life counter that he\u0026rsquo;s no newbie though, so I set aside any assumptions and sit down to play. He wins the roll and leads with a plains. Turns out he\u0026rsquo;s some sort of B/W midrange deck. I remember he had Necrotic Slivers, I forget what else. He has land problems and I burn him out quickly game one, and while sideboarding for game two his comments are all \u0026ldquo;Grabe, keso deck!\u0026rdquo; I haven\u0026rsquo;t actually heard anyone refer to burn as \u0026ldquo;keso\u0026rdquo; for a while now, and I guess he\u0026rsquo;s not familiar with the current metagame where Rakdos is popular. We start game two and I hit an early Cyroclasm, giving him further land troubles, and I burn him out again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1: 2-0 win vs B/W midrange\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound two is against one of the local judge/players, so I expect a tough match. He\u0026rsquo;s playing GWb, some sort of beach house variant. The Loxodon Hierarchs are annoying and lost game one to a Troll with a Hammer. I don\u0026rsquo;t have Rain of Gores, so my board is just Cryoclasms and Slaughter Pacts. Game two I keep him on the ropes, but he starts to gain control. Eventually he thinks he\u0026rsquo;s stabilized at 9 and goes for the aggro, dropping a Watchwolf and a Troll on the same turn. End of his turn, I calmly put the fourth charge counter on my Molten Slagheap. Untap. Draw. Play a land. Demonfire for 9. Game three he mulligans to five, but opens with the annoying Llanowar Reborn into 4/4 Watchwolf, all I have is a random 2/2 dork. He takes me down to 8 before laying a Hierarch. End of turn: Hit, he sacrifices the Watchwolf. I play a Solifuge and have it standby to block. He declines to attack with his Hierarch. My turn, I char it and swing for six. He draws and has nothing. I draw a second Solifuge and win the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2: 2-1 win vs GWb midrange\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound three was vs Red/Green Greater Goyf. I figured it to be a bad matchup, I was right. I lost 2-0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3: 2-0 loss vs R/G Greater Goyf\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound four was U/B Teachings. I had playtested with this guy during the Philippine Open, where we both had the exact same decks. I won that time, and I won this time too, despite getting hit by a Haunting Hymn for four. U/B control is a dog to Rakdos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: 2-0 win vs UB Teachings Control\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finished my round quickly so I took a look at the top tables. The guy who beat me last round was beating up another Rakdos player. The Rakdos guy lost, and I found myself paired against him in round five. I brought up the Greater Goyf matchup. We agree that it\u0026rsquo;s really bad, as even the common Mogg War Marshall is already a disadvantage for Rakdos. We shuffle up and get going. The Rakdos mirror is mainly luck-based, it depends on whose deck decides to be more consistent. I\u0026rsquo;m glad I\u0026rsquo;m lucky, topdecking Solifuges in both games to get the win. His Solifuges never made an appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5: 2-0 win vs BR Rakdos\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound six we sit at the table and pass our decks for the cut when one of the judges stops us. \u0026ldquo;Table 24? Deck check.\u0026rdquo; Wow, my first deck check. We get our decks back without incident and get a five minute time extension. Not that we\u0026rsquo;d need it. Turns out my opponent is playing BG TarmoRack. I get beat up in game one and we proceed to sideboarding. I smile knowing that I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to use those Dodecapods I boarded in at the last minute. I control the second game on the back of the awesome Seize the Soul and a Withered Wretch keeping his Goyf down. He tries to stabilize with a Smallpox when I only have a Rakdos Guildmage, but I show him the Dodecapod. Game three he mulligans down to five but has the Rack + Goyf start. We trade creatures and eventually get into a state where we\u0026rsquo;re both low on life and on topdeck mode. Again, glad I\u0026rsquo;m lucky as I draw the Demonfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6: 2-1 win vs BG TarmoRack\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound seven, I\u0026rsquo;m 3rd in the rankings. No point playing as the prize is the same for first to fourth place (Lorwyn Prerelease Pass), so I offer the ID. He declines, says he hopes to get his friend into the top four. I shrug and start shuffling up. He starts with Island. I cheer inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 7: 2-0 win vs UB Pickles\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal record: 6-1, and I finish first. Yeah, feels good to be winning, even if there were only around forty players in the Standard portion hehe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get to play in the Prerelease for free 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "This weekend was the first of three \u0026ldquo;Pre-Lorwyn Triple Treats\u0026rdquo; at Neutral Ground, featuring Saturdays with three tournaments: one each of Standard, Block Constructed and Legacy. I tried preparing a deck for block but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t come up with anything consistent enough. Lazily, I just picked up the Standard Rakdos deck the day before the tourney, tweaked the sideboard for the inevitable TarmoRack decks (-4 Bottle Gnomes +4 Dodecapod). I lacked a 15th sideboard card, so I toss in a random Seize the Soul.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eYeah, I actually did play at the Standard Open at Trinoma Mall a couple of weekends ago, but my performance was so piss-poor I didn\u0026rsquo;t bother writing a report. Long and short of it, I played Rakdos, but didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to look for Rain of Gores for the board. They would have really helped against the two Angelfire losses I got in rounds 3 and 5, including the one where the opponent drew all four Lightning Helixes :/ The decks record against Angelfire decks is something 1-3 I believe. Good ol\u0026rsquo; Dark Confidant even dealt me 20 damage in one game. I think I had the Hit/Run + Dark Confidant thing happen to me twice. Anyway, after an additional rounds 6 loss to MGA, I just packed it in and went home to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this report is not about that disaster at the Philippine Open, this is about a tournament I actually believed I was better suited for. GPT Bangkok \u0026ndash; the format is Time Spiral block Sealed Deck. Since Invasion Block, I\u0026rsquo;ve always been more of a casual limited player (isn\u0026rsquo;t that weird?), opening boxes and playing drafts with some friends in a casual atmosphere usually punctuated by random late-night trips to Wendy\u0026rsquo;s. And I\u0026rsquo;ve always loved Sealed Deck, because it\u0026rsquo;s a lot more \u0026ldquo;casual\u0026rdquo; than draft where in addition to the usual skill-testers of deck construction and actual gameplay, there\u0026rsquo;s the added pressure of having to choose what cards will be in your pool! Sealed deck is nice and easy. I heard one player remark that Sealed Deck is more luck than skill, since how well you perform largely depends on what bombs you open. That\u0026rsquo;s more or less true, but I\u0026rsquo;ve developed a special ability I like to call \u0026ldquo;the ability to win without bombs.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI came to the tournament with my usual lack of sleep and a bit of a cold, which would only get worse as the day worsened.

instead of the main, but what can I say? I missed it, and I really should have gone eighteen lands, as I knew well and good that missing the 3rd land drop was akin to death in this format. Every game, I boarded in +1 Sudden Shock +1 Swamp for -1 Merfolk Thaumaturgist, -1 Dunerider Outlaw. I was so used to it that in one game where my opponent was at one life, I cast Teachings hoping to finish him off with the Sudden Shock, only to realize it was still game one and the burn spell was still in the board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound one I\u0026rsquo;m paired with one of the few female players in the local Magic community, sporting a black/red deck. Game one, she only has a Keldon Halberdier suspended on turn 2 and nothing else. I hit my drops, use the Midnight Charm on the Halberdier and take the game easily. She dominates a long game two with a Sengir Nosferatu. I decide to save the Sudden Shock for that bat. Time is called for game 3, but by then I\u0026rsquo;ve already stripped her hand with a backbreaking Haunting Hymn for four and I have dominating fliers on the board, and I win on turn 3 of extra time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1: 2-1 win vs BR Sengir Nosferatu (yeah, I name decks by their bombs)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2, my opponent was red/white and his bomb was Angel of Salvation (everyone has a bomb except me). Game 1 is me going \u0026ldquo;Haunting Hymn for the win!\u0026rdquo; Game 2 I see his bomb for the first time and proceed to get squashed by it. Game 3, I manage to off the Angel, having just enough swamps to Tendrils for five (including a Swamp created by the Cyclopean Giant) I squeak off a win in game 3 after we were both in topdeck mode and I drew a flier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2: 2-1 win vs RW Angel of Salvation\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3 is versus a guy with what appears to be a four color deck. His deck is solid, but he played a friend of mine in the previous round, so I know what his bomb is \u0026ndash; Oros the Avenger. I win game one on the back of Haunting Hymn again, and game 2Oros makes his first appearance. I was prepared though, and immediately locked him down with Second Wind. I\u0026rsquo;m on the defensive end for a bit, but I pull out the win eventually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3: 2-0 win vs BRUw Oros the Avenger\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy this time, my cold is starting to get really bad and I seriously need to get more tissues. The airconditioned mall is also badly affecting my health despite the large crowd. My round 4 opponent is one of the higher-ranked limted players in the country. I\u0026rsquo;ve played against him several times before and have never won. Game one we got into some confusion as to who actually played or drew. He said he\u0026rsquo;d draw, but proceeded to lay a Plains before my first turn. I shrugged and just let it go, which was a mistake. Now that I think about, he probably effectively played and drew in that game. By game two, I\u0026rsquo;m wondering if he thinks all my nose-wiping with my hand towel is really icky. Anyway, I lost to his bomb in two games \u0026ndash; Sacred Mesa. I have no answer in my colors, but I listed the Saltcrusted Steppes and the Molder in my sideboard because I wonder if I should have just boarder an off-color answer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: 0-2 loss vs GW Sacred Mesa\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finished early so I wander around for a while. One of the local judges, apparently bored, has been trying to figure out how to make an origami paper crane, to no avail. We laugh a bit as his badly-mangled piece of paper. Another player tries to help but frankly, I think his attempts are closer to making a Vampire Bat than a crane, lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound five and I\u0026rsquo;m at 3-1. Need two more wins for shot at top eight. I play against a red-green deck, and my Infiltrator goes the distance in both games, carrying me to victory. Wheneverhe finally draws an answer to the Infiltrator (usually an Assassinate) he smacks it down hard in annoyance. Sorry man, them\u0026rsquo;s the breaks. I knew from watching previous rounds that his bomb was Sprout Swarm, but it never came up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5: 2-0 win vs RGB Sprout Swarm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the match, I notice the judge who was previously doing the paper crane on our table, this time trying to build a card castle from basic lands. He must be really bored. Apparently the head judge challenged him to do it. Out of frustration, he gets some scotch tape and starts using it while the head judge isn\u0026rsquo;t looking. Sadly, he can\u0026rsquo;t get a tall enough castle stable even while cheating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore round six, standings are posted, which means the tournament is actually only six rounds instead of the seven I assumed. The standings put me at #4, and I\u0026rsquo;m paired with the #2 guy. We ID into the top 8.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYay! My first GPT top 8. Top eight draft starts and it\u0026rsquo;s my first time drafting TPF irl. And now my weakness is revealed to the Magic community: I completely suck at physically opening boosters. I need to borrow a pair of scissors from the judges table. Obviously, I\u0026rsquo;m stupid at drafting, and the guy to my left doesn\u0026rsquo;t have time to play so he\u0026rsquo;s just rare drafting. Despite my newbness (and trying hard not to be a Nosy Goblin), I manage to scrounge together a servicable G/R draft deck (Too lazy to list it here)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound seven starts and I\u0026rsquo;m paired against a local player/judge. Game one, I start off slow, but a Herd Gnarr powered by some Cyclical Evolution eventually drops him to six. He goes all in with his creatures next turn, dropping me to five and leaving only a Watcher Sliver to block. I topdeck into my third forest and play the Groundbreaker in my hand, going in for ten points of damage, six of it trample. He has no outs, so we shuffle up for game two. At this point, one of the judges stops the match and informs my opponent that his registered deck is only 35 cards. That\u0026rsquo;s a game loss, so I immediately win the round. I feel really bad about this win \u0026ndash; the reason my opponent had misregistered is that the judge saw that I had finished registering early (I always finish early) and was rushing my opponent so the match could be started. I guess it wasn\u0026rsquo;t my fault but still, not a fun way to win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTop four, everyone agrees to split the prize packs. That would give me half a box of Future Sight \u0026ndash; not bad for a day\u0026rsquo;s work\u0026hellip; er, play. The remaining matches need to be played out to see who gets the 3 byes to GP Bangkok. Since (a) I\u0026rsquo;m a nice guy and (b) I\u0026rsquo;m not likely to go to Bangkok just to scrub out and (c) I really wasn\u0026rsquo;t feeling very well at that point and wanted to go home, I just accepted the half a box and scooped to my top four opponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is still my best finish ever, and it follows the historical trend \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;ve still never won more than five matches in a tournament. Still, it felt good to place well, especially after my recent string of bad Constructed performances. There are more GPTs this month, but they\u0026rsquo;re on Sundays, and I don\u0026rsquo;t like playing on Sundays, so probably I will try my luck again in Constructed until Lorwyn prereleases roll around.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Yeah, I actually did play at the Standard Open at Trinoma Mall a couple of weekends ago, but my performance was so piss-poor I didn\u0026rsquo;t bother writing a report. Long and short of it, I played Rakdos, but didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to look for Rain of Gores for the board. They would have really helped against the two Angelfire losses I got in rounds 3 and 5, including the one where the opponent drew all four Lightning Helixes :/ The decks record against Angelfire decks is something 1-3 I believe.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eMost of the time, my work involves mostly run-of-the-mill information management systems. Lately however, I\u0026rsquo;ve been asked to look into some new tech, and that got me interested in what\u0026rsquo;s called Rich Internet Applications (RIAs for short). The primary platform for RIAs is Flash, which apparently is already owned by Adobe and Macromedia is no more. Yeah, I never really paid attention to Flash, like most people I assumed it was only for making amusing movies and annoying ads. Also, Flash has always been a tool oriented towards people who are more design-oriented, not engineers or programmers like me. I mean, I load up Flash 8 and I have no idea how to do anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLately however, Adobe has released a product called Flex, which is basically a programming API for generating SWF files using XML and the Flash scripting language, ActionScript. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty cool, and I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a few really nice demos of web applications done using Flash, some of which I highlighted in \u003ca href=\"http://roytang.net/blog/2007/07/links-for-2007-07-28/\"\u003erecent links\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried out Flex for a few days, and really it is SO AWESOME. There are some UI stuff that you can do that would be ridiculously difficult with traditional HTML/Javascript and those things are so easy using Flex. (Just one caveat: some of the demos I\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far are quite the resource hogs\u0026hellip; )\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe real power of Flex is the fact that it generates files that run on Flash Player, one of the most ubiquitous platforms on the web. I\u0026rsquo;m betting that Flash Player has a larger install base than Internet Explorer. So it\u0026rsquo;s really hard to compete with Flash as a web platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop people from trying however. Lately, Microsoft announced \u003ca href=\"http://silverlight.net\"\u003eSilverlight\u003c/a\u003e, a .NET-based RIA SDK of some sort. The screenshots seem to denote that it can do really cool things as well. Gee, it would be nice if I could experience it directly, but here\u0026rsquo;s what I got when I tried to install the runtime:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#686eed3e2f219a4486e95157ebe664a8-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2007/07/rich-internet-applications/screenshot_hu41cf75f6e18db1b222206f4c6b61dff3_20498_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"686eed3e2f219a4486e95157ebe664a8-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2007/07/rich-internet-applications/screenshot.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"28 Jul 2007 8:50pm\"\u003e28 Jul 2007 8:50pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGee, way to challenge Flash: make it difficult to install the runtime. I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure if I really don\u0026rsquo;t have Admin privileges on this machine, and you know what? I don\u0026rsquo;t care about Silverlight enough to find out. With Flash Player, sometimes people don\u0026rsquo;t even \u003cem\u003eknow\u003c/em\u003e it\u0026rsquo;s being installed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Flex existed, the ability to create Flash-based webapps was mostly limited to developers who were patient enough to understand the Flash authoring tool. Flex opens up that platform to any developer with decent programming knowledge. Will this change the face of the internets? We\u0026rsquo;ll see\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

There were several other people there waiting for taxis but she had been there first. She finally managed to hail a cab and had already gotten in the back seat when an MMDA traffic guy \n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnotebase-1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e\n stopped her and told her that he had hailed that taxi for two women nearby that he pointed to. C said she was the one who had hailed the taxi, but the traffic guy politely but firmly insisted that she get out of the car. Indignant, C took note of the traffic guy\u0026rsquo;s name plate and went on her way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as she got to the office, C composed a letter of complaint to the MMDA director and faxed it to their office as soon as she was able. Having coursed her complaint through several different offices, it was promptly handled and a hearing with the traffic guy was scheduled during the next week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC and I talked about it several times during the week before her hearing. She had asked me before sending the complaint whether it was a good idea or not, or if she should just let the incident go. I said no, she should proceed with her complaint. The traffic guy was clearly in the wrong, and she at least deserved an explanation regarding whether or not MMDA traffic guys are allowed to hassle people who are getting into taxis. Some people were worried that the traffic guy might be vindictive and might try to get back at her in some way. C is a pretty strong and brave woman though, and she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t back down even if that was a likely possibility. What did concern her was whether her complaint might cause someone to lose their job. I told her not to worry, at worst he\u0026rsquo;ll be asked to apologize and explain, and that will be that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day of the hearing arrived, I wanted to go with her to the MMDA office since I was curious how things would proceed, but I had a meeting an hour or so afterwards and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to risk being late, and besides she already had her boyfriend with her for support. I\u0026rsquo;m told that the traffic guy made some lame excuse that there was some sort of emergency and that\u0026rsquo;s why the two women needed the taxi. But he apologized to C anyway and promised to be more circumspect in the future. C got a written apology and came away satisfied, having fought city hall and won, sort of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe asked me if I think she wasted her time. I told her that what she did was a good thing; every so often someone has to complain against people who may or may not be abusing their position, if only to keep such people honest. And she got to witness firsthand how the government handles things, if ever she gets into a more serious situation with the government later on, she has this experience to draw upon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy take? I\u0026rsquo;m guessing the two women were friends/acquaintances of the traffic guy and they were impatient to get a cab. In true macho Filipino fashion, traffic guy offers to help them out. And that would have been fine, really. That is, until he started harassing another commuter to get it done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m glad I wasn\u0026rsquo;t there at the hearing though. If I had heard that lame excuse I might have done my best Phoenix Wright impression and shout \u0026ldquo;Objection!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Players were grouped in Flights of 32 people each (previous prerelease tournaments had 48-people flights), each win gets you an Xth booster pack and the top 2 of each flight (the ones who went 4-0) get something extra. Apparently the extra prizes were stuff like a bag, a shirt and a big (cardboard) Kamahl card box. I of course got the crappy box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I went 4-0. I\u0026rsquo;m not too surprised. Since a release tournament is more \u0026ldquo;casual\u0026rdquo;, the competition is not very fierce. Usually things get tricky in the last two rounds. Anyway, I won all 4 rounds, not even giving up a game loss. My sealed pool was awesome, lots of removal and acceleration. Beacon of Destruction and Mobilization are bomb rares, with Cone of Flame and Overrun as bomb uncommons. Awesome deck, good on tempo and usually giving quick wins (gave me time for lunch)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the Sealed portion (and assembling my crappy box), I was in a fighting mood so I signed up for an 8-man draft. This was more serious competition, and the prize for the top 2 places was an additional promo foil Reya Dawnbringer (and a couple of packs). I won the first match 2-0, got my first game loss in game one of match 2 won two games in a row to make the top 2. Yay!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe art for Reya Dawnbringer is quite the awesomeness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal record: 6-0-1 matches for the day. 12-1 games. Not bad at all.

I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to take down Calciderms and Spectral Forces without losing my shifter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLlanowar Reborn may be the best or 2nd best of the uncommon FS lands.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWillbender is awesome in the GW Goyf matchup \u0026ndash; mostly because their removal (Temporal Isolation/Bound in Silence) is so effective on their own creatures. And their Griffin Guide is so nice on mine.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDraining Whelk is stupid here. I think it should be in the board, coming in against RG mana ramp decks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, yeah I scrubbed out in the quarterfinals. At that point I was really tired and just wanted to go home. My deck also annoyed me in the last game. I cast all 3 foresees trying to find and answer to an 8/9 flying Tarmagoyf but I didn\u0026rsquo;t find any. I picked up my prize for the top eight finish (seven packs)\u0026hellip; I was a bit disappointed as well since I fought through so many rounds and only got seven packs, I was hoping maybe 10-12. Well, I\u0026rsquo;ve never had a top 8 finish before so maybe I was expecting more stuff :p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn my way home I was thinking about quitting Magic. I started to play \u0026ldquo;seriously\u0026rdquo; about a year ago, and all I have to show for it so far was a PTQ top 8. Playing Magic is so fucking hard. Let me rephrase: playing Magic is easy. Being good at Magic is so fucking hard. You need to pay attention to everything, you need to have the best deck, you need to know how to sideboard in all the matchups. At some point it stops being fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s going to become harder since most of the guys I grew up playing the game with are either no longer playing or out of the country. And I\u0026rsquo;m too cheap to pay for more stuff on MTGO. Many of the Magic players in the office have migrated to playing WoW CCG.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAm I going to quit? Am I burned out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNah, that was just the tiredness talking. Magic is fun, despite the competitive pressure. I just need to be able to reconcile two things: \u003cstrong\u003eI have to be the best\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eI can\u0026rsquo;t lose sight of the fun.\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, it\u0026rsquo;s fun to win, so that makes it a bit easier. It\u0026rsquo;s fun to have a face-down Willbender in play when your opponent\u0026rsquo;s Ancestral Vision is about to resolve. It\u0026rsquo;s fun to beat down using your opponent\u0026rsquo;s Griffin Guides. It\u0026rsquo;s fun to come back from one life to win the game. It\u0026rsquo;s fun to win, and it\u0026rsquo;s also fun to play. And playing against some of the best players in the country, I\u0026rsquo;m almost there. Am I good enough yet? We\u0026rsquo;ll see soon enough\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit: Oh noes! \u003ca href=\"http://www.neutralgrounds.net/results_contents.php?id=7\"\u003eMy picture is on the internets\u003c/a\u003e!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit 2020: Above dead link \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070712144753/http://www.neutralgrounds.net/results_contents.php?id=7\"\u003erecovered from archive.org\u003c/a\u003e.

I guess I should have mulliganned the 2nd game when I didn\u0026rsquo;t have either a Crypt or the Leyline, as I died to 20+ zombies on turn 4.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2: Game 1, I went down to 1 he had four racks down and I had three cards in hand. Over the next few turns I brought him down to zero from eighteen while at that precarious state. \u003ca href=\"http://www.down-to-one.com\"\u003ewww.down-to-one.com\u003c/a\u003e. Game 2 went fast for him, taking me out with fast discard. Game 3 sees him keep a one-lander. I transmute for Persecute and name black, obviously. Mishra and Korlash walk across and end the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3: This deck is very good against aggro. At least the normal Gruul aggro that has like 33% creatures and 33% burn. My opponent here was more like 50% burn. Four Tendrils simply can\u0026rsquo;t keep up. His deck is an autoloss to Paladin en-Vec + Worship, but it has game over mine. I made a play mistake here in that while I was getting trounced in Game 2, I showed him Korlash (which didn\u0026rsquo;t show in game 1) in a desperate move to stave off the loss. I lost anyway, and now knowing that I had the Korlash, he boarded in Dead/Gones to handle him in game 3. In the 3rd game, I actually had a naked Cloister on the board for four turns, hoping to draw a Tendrils \u0026ndash; I had not drawn any of the four yet at that point. I drew eight cards over four turns from a library of maybe forty cards and didn\u0026rsquo;t see a single Tendrils. :(\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: He went first, playing Ication Javilineers. I yawned inside. Easy match. I was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5: We were 5 turns into game 1 and I hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen any Lotus Blooms so I was thinking it was some sort of R/U counterburn, and held back on the Rise / Fall until I knew what was going on. Then I died. Game 2, I had the Rise / Fall on turn 2. But I was thinking, \u0026ldquo;Gee, I don\u0026rsquo;t wanna waste it and hit lands, I\u0026rsquo;ll wait for him to play a couple more lands.\u0026rdquo; Then I lost. Stupid, stupid, stupid play against what should have been a favorable matchup. In my defense, I was really tired and pissed-off at my 2-2 (now 2-3) record. Yeah, bad excuse. Must\u0026hellip; stay\u0026hellip; in\u0026hellip; top\u0026hellip; mental\u0026hellip; form\u0026hellip; (and think about adding Stupors to the board).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6: Most people need to read the Epochrasite when I play it, so I was surprised when the guy just went \u0026ldquo;Ok\u0026rdquo; after I played mine on turn 2. it turns out he had some of his own. He had a few Tombstalkers as well, but no Korlash in sight. Easy win once I got out a pair of Cloisters to stop the discard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 7: Blowout. Sorry if he reads this, but his deck isn\u0026rsquo;t very good. I get to four Epochrasites early in the first game, then back it up with Arrows to take out the rebels. Game 2 was fun, with me at 2 life and no blockers, he swings with a Phyrexian Totem. Tendrils for 9. Ouch, your board is wiped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 8: Again, blowout. The matchup is pretty much as Flores describes it, block with Epoc during early turns, trade one of your legends for card advantage, then climb back quickly with either Korlash or Mishra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal record: 5-3, finishing 42nd. Despite my game win ratio, I had the worst tiebreaks of all 5-3s (since I climbed back from a 2-3 deficit). At least it was better than my disastrous 1-4-drop Regionals record \u003ca href=\"/2006/06/magic-regionals-2006/\"\u003elast year\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandom mistakes I made:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTapping Academy Ruins for mana when I should\u0026rsquo;ve used it to get back Chromatic Stars (Mishra was in play)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePlaying a Graven Cairns first turn when I had a shockland\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNot being aggressive enough against Dragonstorm\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRandom boarding mistakes \u0026ndash; I need to keep better track of my sideboard.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn playing net decks: This was the first time I had brought to a tournament a deck that someone else built. Maybe I was growing up. :p Despite my love of being a rogue deckbuilder, I have to admit I haven\u0026rsquo;t been really successful at it. I realize now that one way to get better is to play some well-designed decks that other people have built so I can learn from their design. I was already playing a Korlash deck prior to this, and had heard of variants that splash blue for various reasons. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think I would have ever been able to think of this current design \u0026ndash; the deck is just crazy. It plays very solidly and randomly gets blowout draws. I will probably play it for at least one more tournament and hope that I actually play a lot better than I did today.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Probably due to the fact that I actually went to work before going to the tournament (which meant I had a lot less sleep\u0026hellip; ), I made too many bad plays in the first two losses. There\u0026rsquo;s an \u003ca href=\"http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/academy/41\"\u003earticle today\u003c/a\u003e on magicthegathering.com about how you should avoid racing aggro and avoid taking damage as much as possible\u0026hellip; I think I basically violated every single principle in that article during those losing matches. Yes, even the lone control matchup \u0026ndash; I didn\u0026rsquo;t kill a Hellkite thinking I would just race it with Korlash, but the Bust on his turn sealed my fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe GW aggro loss hurt \u0026ndash; I lost the last game because I was at three, he had a Saffi, all I had was a 9/9 Korlash with a Temporal Isolation on it and I didn\u0026rsquo;t notice my opponent had a Vitu-ghazi and I thought I could survive one more turn with one life. If I had just taken out his Saffi with the Demonfire I had in hand instead of waiting to burn him to 0\u0026hellip; I would have drawn a House Guard next turn, transmute for Tendrils, swing with Korlash, stack damage and cast Tendrils on Korlash for an 18-point life swing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe round 6 loss really broke my spirit, I was in such a bad mental state that I played badly in the round 7 zoo matchup. Not that having perfectly tight play would have helped \u0026ndash; he had the zoo god draws both games, I was down to eight before I even had Damnation mana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLessons learned:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNever, ever try to race with damage.

I should always take out threats until I can stabilize with Tendrils.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI need to become mentally stronger, so that play mistakes from previous losses don\u0026rsquo;t affect succeeding games.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing as how the local metagame is maybe 60-70% aggro, I\u0026rsquo;ll also probably tweak the deck to make the maindeck stronger against aggro and move some of the control hate to the board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext stop: Regionals.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
