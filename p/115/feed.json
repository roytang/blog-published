You can always go back and edit it later if you want! I often do this with the daily sketches \u0026ndash; I try to stay on theme and at the same time find something interesting or clever to draw. But I\u0026rsquo;m not always successful, and I sometimes don\u0026rsquo;t have enough time.

You might think \u0026ldquo;Doesn\u0026rsquo;t that just mean I\u0026rsquo;ll have more hard stuff to do later?\u0026rdquo; Yes, yes it does, but also means that hard stuff will have a whole lot of easy stuff already written to support it, which can make things easier.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e**Use random content generators. **There\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of them on the internet!

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI was in a meeting once with my boss (literally the CEO, a Malaysian) and some representatives of another company (Americans) where we were discussing the technical details of a possible future partnership. At one point, one of the Americans said to my boss that he was pleasantly surprised that I was openly speaking up independently of my boss and willing to correct him on some points when he didn\u0026rsquo;t quite get the technical details right. It seems they were used to working with some Indian outsourcing firms, where due to cultural differences, the tendency was for the Indian guys to accept everything the Americans asked for without question and delivered it exactly as requested, even if there were obvious problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concept is called \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_distance\"\u003ePower Distance\u003c/a\u003e, where cultures with a higher power distance are more likely to just accept without question the authority of \u0026ldquo;higher-ups\u0026rdquo;. While in cultures with lower power distance, people feel less of a gap with people of \u0026ldquo;higher\u0026rdquo; status, and are thus more willing to speak up openly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI believe that I live and work in a country with a high power distance. It is typical of workers here to have an exchange like:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Why are we doing this, isn\u0026rsquo;t it kind of dumb?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Because the boss says so.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Oh, ok\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot just with people in \u0026ldquo;higher\u0026rdquo; positions, but especially with foreigners. I witnessed this first hand when I first observed how other people behaved when they first had to work with our project managers who were based in another country; many would be hesitant to raise their concerns directly with the foreign counterparts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an industry where users and clients and management often do not really understand the finer technical details of what exactly they want to happen, being able and willing to raise concerns regardless of differences in position or status is not only a distinct advantage, it may very well be an important aspect of the job. All the best developers I\u0026rsquo;ve worked with are the ones who are willing to call out problems, and it\u0026rsquo;s a trait I personally encourage in anyone I work with.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
