I promised myself I would be posting regularly, so I had to have one today. But after a couple of failed attempts that just couldn\u0026rsquo;t come together, I had to stop and ask myself what was wrong. I just wasn\u0026rsquo;t in the mood for any of the other serious topics I wanted to write about so I said screw it, I\u0026rsquo;ll just write about mental blocks!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e**Phone it in. **If you\u0026rsquo;re unfamiliar, the expression means \u0026ldquo;just do the bare minimum you\u0026rsquo;re allowed to do.\u0026rdquo; Just power through the work with as little effort as possible. You can always go back and edit it later if you want! I often do this with the daily sketches \u0026ndash; I try to stay on theme and at the same time find something interesting or clever to draw. But I\u0026rsquo;m not always successful, and I sometimes don\u0026rsquo;t have enough time. So I\u0026rsquo;ll just draw whatever that barely makes the theme and send it in.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you have some time, step away from the work for a bit.\u003c/strong\u003e Take a shower. Poop. Argue with people over the internet. Watch some \u003cem\u003eBrooklyn Nine Nine\u003c/em\u003e. Play some _Skyrim. _Just get your mind off the work. It gives your subconscious mind a chance to work on the problems in the background and later you can come back to the work with fresh eyes and hopefully better ideas.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCheat.\u003c/strong\u003e Find someone who\u0026rsquo;s done something similar before and copy, er I mean, draw inspiration from her work!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMake a long list of ideas\u003c/strong\u003e. Just random, stupid, ideas, as many as you can think of, as soon as they pop into your head. You\u0026rsquo;re throwing spaghetti at the wall and trying to see what sticks!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo the easy stuff first, then get back to the hard stuff later\u003c/strong\u003e. I did this during \u003ca href=\"/2016/12/nanowrimo-2016-post-mortem/\"\u003emy Nanowrimo this year\u003c/a\u003e! Whenever I had too much difficulty writing a scene, I would set it aside for a while and choose some other scene that I had already mostly plotted out in my head. You might think \u0026ldquo;Doesn\u0026rsquo;t that just mean I\u0026rsquo;ll have more hard stuff to do later?\u0026rdquo; Yes, yes it does, but also means that hard stuff will have a whole lot of easy stuff already written to support it, which can make things easier.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e**Use random content generators. **There\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of them on the internet! For writing, I sometimes use random name generators to help me out. There\u0026rsquo;s also random plot generators and random dialogue generators and so on. Most of the time you\u0026rsquo;ll get nonsense, but just clicking through those nonsense options can give you an inspiration for your own creative needs.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e**Change it up. **If you\u0026rsquo;re drawing, try drawing in a different style than you usually do. If you\u0026rsquo;re writing a story, try to throw in a random scene that\u0026rsquo;s a completely different style and makes no sense. If you\u0026rsquo;re blogging, write a post about something you\u0026rsquo;ve never written about before, or in a style you\u0026rsquo;ve never used. Like a listicle!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e**Ask for help. **In software development, there\u0026rsquo;s a concept called \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;Rubber Duck Debugging\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e, or sometimes simply \u0026ldquo;Rubber Ducking\u0026rdquo;.
