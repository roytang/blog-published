Mediocre meaning I had neither Adarkar Valkyrie nor Ohran Viper. Nonetheless, I got lucky at just the right times, and made quite a few good plays. Vanish into Memory is awesome, especially with Panglacial Wurm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround 8am I was struggling to keep myself awake awaiting the sixth round when we got a short power failure. Power came back up in ten minutes, but my internet connection did not. That pissed me off. Since I\u0026rsquo;m also going to the office this afternoon, I have no fuirther chance to win the CS release championships. I think I\u0026rsquo;ll lay off Magic until the Time Spiral prerelease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike, if you read this, are we buying a TS box?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Spell Snares are reserved for Jittes and Hands of Cruelty. I take a beating in game 2, come back in game 2, and lose game 3 by a close fight despite an Azorius Guildmage holding down the board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 1-2, Game record: 0-1 (not a good start)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2: vs Owling Mine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLost game 1, as I was expecting Vore after the turn 1 Sleight of Hand. Siding in Repeals, Seed Sparks and Arbiters, I easily took games 2 and 3. First-wings provide excellent aggro, but Seed Spark saprolings provide the win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 3-3, Game record: 1-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3: vs Ghost Husk\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHah! Complete and utter domination. There is nothing in black-white aggro that my deck can\u0026rsquo;t answer. His card advantage pales in comparison to the might of Court Hussar! Game 2 I side in Repeals out of courtesy (if I didn\u0026rsquo;t board he might think I wasn\u0026rsquo;t taking him seriously! And Repeals are instant-speed removal\u0026hellip; better than Fetters against Husk), but they never show and I still win easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 5-3, Game record: 2-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: vs R/G/W Fatties\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst game, he never showed any creatures, I won easily with him stuck at 4 land. I was wondering if I would bring in the Wraths, given that I saw R/G/W from the lands. I decide to not board anything and just see what his deck brings out. Turns out he\u0026rsquo;s playing medium-huge creatures: Burning-Tree Shaman, Firemane Angel, Rumbling Slum. These are the types of decks Faith\u0026rsquo;s Fetters is made to handle. I win with 10 life to spare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 7-3, Game record: 3-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5: vs Firemane Control\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorror of horrors\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ve now faced variations on two decks that I played before in Nationals Qualifiers. Unfortunately, Firemane Control was not a matchup I was anticipating\u0026hellip; and it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty bad matchup for me as well. I have no way to stop the recurring Angels / Shard Phoenix (no Azorius GMs show up to save the day), and my creatures are too small to overtake his awesome lifegain. This deck packs Isperia the Inscrutable!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 7-5, Game record: 3-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6: vs \u0026ldquo;Equipment Deck\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no idea what this deck is called. Basically relies on Godo, Bandit Warlord, Firemane Angel and Sunforger searches to win. I won game 1 due to my awesome weenies. Game 2 our life totals were 21-37 when the round ended\u0026hellip; he had a Godo, an Angel, 2 Sunforgers and Tatsumasa out, but the board was locked by a single Azorius GM backed by around 17 lands. Best play: he manages to draw a helix to hit my GM, and I had no cards left in hand. I cast Remand and draw a card. He casts the Helix again, the GM dies and he passes the turn. Then I show him the GM I drew from the Remand\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 8-5, Game record: 4-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill have a chance to win packs! (Probably not the invite though)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 7: vs B/W aggro\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeh, I dominate this guy even more than the Ghost Husk from earlier. I win so quickly I forget to pick up an Ensaymada I had brought to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 10-5, Game record: 5-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 8: vs Sea Stompy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis U/G/R aggro-control deck is simply awesome. The guy I\u0026rsquo;m fighting also beat me in Eastwood the week before, and I still don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do against his deck! The deck relies on cheap and quick threats (Kird Ape, or BoP into Ninja of the Deep Hours), and always leaves two mana open at the end of each turn for Mana Leak, Remand or the ever-so-awesome Plaxmanta. He takes game 1 quickly; I side in Wraths for the first time, then manage to win Game 2 after a bit of dragging out. Game 3 we trade blows and counters for a while. But eventually he manages to get out a Jitte\u0026rsquo;d Rumbling Slum which I pitifully chump block with a few Heralds before giving up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 11-7, Game record: 5-3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finish at 35th place\u0026hellip; not bad, but not enough to get an invite. I\u0026rsquo;m wondering if I\u0026rsquo;m still going to play at next Saturday\u0026rsquo;s qualifier\u0026hellip; which is the last chance for me as I don\u0026rsquo;t plan to go to Baguio to play. But, how can I tweak my deck further to win?\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I was busy this weekend with Magic: The Gathering. Four of us from the office played at a Nationals Qualifer today at Galleria. I played a custom-built aggro-control blue-white beauty called Azorius-12. Considering that I threw it together at practically the last minute, I think I did fairly well (but not enough to get the Nationals invite). Large turnout; rumor has it more than a hundred and thirty players participated, and NG quickly ran out of chairs and tables to use.",

Since Saturday morning, this computer I have in my room has been flaky, occasionally refusing to boot into either Linux or Windows, and occasionally not even turning on at all. My brother and I suspect a loose video card, and if were just a little less lazier we could easily confirm it by swapping the video card here with the PC in the other room.

It got me thinking about my own job. I work at a foreign-based software development company that caters to clients outside the country. These days, I work mostly on JSP-based web projects. My starting salary, three and a half years ago, was higher than the average presented in this graph. Obviously, I\u0026rsquo;m earning a lot more than that now. I always assumed I was earning more than average; it feels nice to have it confirmed by some data, even if from across the internets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I started out in the current job, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have thought it likely that I would stay as long as have. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, I enjoy what I do as a software developer; I\u0026rsquo;ve never been close to humble, so I don\u0026rsquo;t mind saying I\u0026rsquo;m pretty good at what I do as well. But I\u0026rsquo;m the sort of guy who always dreams of walking his own way, not just being a regular joe employee like everyone else. Such that every so often I get this craving to jump ship and search for a different fortune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that it\u0026rsquo;s a bad job mind you. Just the opposite in fact, above average pay and work I enjoy doing (most of the time). Sure, it gets stressful at times; especially since I\u0026rsquo;m currently serving as technical lead on one of the larger projects, such that I often get overwhelmed by technical requests. But somehow I\u0026rsquo;ve grown used to it here. For lack of a better term, I\u0026rsquo;ve grown some roots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yesterday, I was promoted. I haven\u0026rsquo;t been briefed on the details yet, but I know from others that it\u0026rsquo;s not a salary increase thing, more of additional benefits. Still, it\u0026rsquo;s good to be recognized, even if I was expecting it (people were kidding me for months that I was already past due for it\u0026hellip; ) Even though I was expecting it, I still failed to gather my usual wordiness and basically stammered a couple of thank you\u0026rsquo;s as my speech. Hey, I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect to have to talk to two hundred people!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMan, now it\u0026rsquo;s gonna be even harder to resign\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

So much for my first constructed outing in 10 years\u0026hellip; not a very good outcome for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI played 4-color Firemane Control\u0026hellip; no permission, but lots of life gain and 4 Wrath of Gods packed maindeck, a specifically anti-aggro build. I was anticipating lots of Gruul beats and Orzhov aggro decks, and I was ready to beat them to the ground. Unfortunately, I faced not a single one of those decks. :(\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1 vs Wildfire/Vore\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew this was a loss as soon as he boomerang\u0026rsquo;ed a Temple Garden on the second turn. First game went fast, I lost to Niv-Mizzet. Second game, he brought out the early Blood Moon, but I had a Hinder ready. The second Blood Moon made it through, so for the rest of the game I only had a Simic Signet providing me with colored mana. Keiga got killed by another Keiga, and he had two cards left in hand. I had two Angels in the ‘yard, but no white for removal and no permission in hand. I said, what the heck, and played the Zur\u0026rsquo;s Weirding. He shows me Magnivore and Wildfire in hand. Oh crap. The 7/7 Magnivore took 4 swings to kill me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2 vs The Masterpiece\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was my first time seeing the Masterpiece and action, and to be honest, the first few turns weren\u0026rsquo;t very impressive. We traded Hierarchs, creatures were killed by spot removal, it was an even game. Then he plays an Arena, and I realize \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s over.\u0026rdquo; I can match him threat for threat, but he\u0026rsquo;s drawing a lot more than I am, and I don\u0026rsquo;t draw into the maindecked Stomphowler. Game 2 goes pretty much the same way, except I get hit by Persecute \u0026ndash; White\u0026hellip; and the secret of this deck is 80% of my spells are white! I go down to one card in hand. He Cranials the 4 Wrath of Gods and the 4 Firemane Angels\u0026hellip; and there\u0026rsquo;s no recovering from that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3 vs Owling Mine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would\u0026rsquo;ve thought this was a bad matchup, but the first game went surprisingly well. The extra card draws were great for me, and even when he played an owl, two Angels in the ‘yard kept the damage down. Eventually, he ran out of life to give and we started sideboarding. I knew exactly what to board, brought in 3 Grand Arbiters and 3 Hide/Seek. 2nd game went really well for him, Owl on 2nd turn, Boomerang a land, exhaustion, game went fast. Game 3 took a lot longer, he played 3 Owls in one turn, but I had two Hide/Seeks in hand. I kept on tapping out to play threats, hoping he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t draw into an exhaustion. With one turn before I kill him, he amps up the card drawing and gets me to 11 cards in hand, planning to toss two Sudden Impacts at me. But he realizes he\u0026rsquo;s one short \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;m at 23 life. Besides, I have a helix in hand which forces him to scoop. Finally a win!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4 vs The Masterpiece AGAIN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, same story here. I think my mistake was I keep shooting down Fetters instead of Arenas\u0026hellip; but eh, the deck is really far superior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5 vs Greater Good\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, my back is starting to ache by now. One of the guys I came here with managed to get a monoblock chair with a back\u0026hellip; oh what I would give for that. Oh yeah, the game. I ate a lot of Kokushos and Yoseis, that\u0026rsquo;s what I remember. And he kept using the Top every turn. After a while I stopped caring and didn\u0026rsquo;t even check whether he was cheating me with the Top or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, it was about 5 PM at that time, and there were 3 rounds to go. But I figured I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make it anyway, and I had to catch up on work, so I said goodbye to the guys and went back to the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost important lesson learned: Next time, just play aggro. With an eight-round tournament, playing a control deck is likely to give you a migraine by round four or five. And the metagame is so wide, it\u0026rsquo;s useless trying to prepare for everything anyway, so just throw caution to the winds and send your creatures in the red zone. Oh yeah, a Gruul deck which I helped prepare (the base of the deck came from me) did a lot better than me\u0026hellip; his record was 3-2 by the fifth round.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

First things first: First thing I do when I get passed a Ravnica Block sealed deck is to check the decklist to see if I got passed a shockland. Incredibly, I was passed not just one, but two! That in itself paid for the registration fee, but I still wanted to get a decent finish in the PTQ. Unfortunately, aside from the Temple Garden and the Blood Crypt, I didn\u0026rsquo;t get that many \u0026ldquo;wow\u0026rdquo; cards. Unable to resist what good cards I had, I actually played all five colors: I put in black for removal, put in blue for Helium Squirter (that thing is insane), green for beats, splashing white for Pollenbright Wings and splashing red for Ogre Savant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately as I realized later, I was so elated by having two shocklands and was in such a hurry to play that I forgot to check my curve. It readily became apparent in later games that I was playing with a sort of negative curve \u0026ndash; most of my good cards were in the 5 to 6 mana range. On hindsight, I suppose I should have put in the Boros weenies. This proved my undoing in both matches that I lost to quick creature rushes. One match ended in a draw, but I just gave the guy the win anyway. (Note to self: Never do that again. Mercy is for the weak!) I went home not just a bit sleepy (having woking up at 5:30 am) with a 2-3 record.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMust practice more.

First things first: First thing I do when I get passed a Ravnica Block sealed deck is to check the decklist to see if I got passed a shockland. Incredibly, I was passed not just one, but two! That in itself paid for the registration fee, but I still wanted to get a decent finish in the PTQ. Unfortunately, aside from the Temple Garden and the Blood Crypt, I didn\u0026rsquo;t get that many \u0026ldquo;wow\u0026rdquo; cards.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eSuikoden V is hands-down the best game in the Suikoden series.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn almost all respects, it beats out the previous best game of the series (Suikoden 2): The story manages to follow the old pattern of \u0026ldquo;oh I need to flee my home and now I\u0026rsquo;m leading a band of rebels in a civil war!\u0026rdquo; but infuses with a lot of new elements: usurpers to the throne, historical wars of succession, threats of foreign invasion. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of politics involved in this game, and most of the first eight hours are a bit draggy because they spend so much time elaborating on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for gameplay, the trademark Suikoden mechanic comes back again: gathering the 108 stars of destiny to your cause. This has always been the shining point of Suikoden \u0026ndash; the 108 stars quest makes it stand above all other console RPGs where combat is basically the only thing standing between you and the ending. Simply winning all the battles will get you to an ending, but not \u003cem\u003ethe\u003c/em\u003e ending. To get the canonical ending, Suikoden gives you an additional challenge \u0026ndash; one that is exploratory in nature. Finding (and recruiting) the 108 stars is an incredible challenge, and I ‘m fairly sure that only the most patient of gamers can successfully do it on the first play-through without a walkthrough. Suikoden V feels a bit more difficult than previous games with this regard, as many of the 108 stars of destiny have to be recruited at certain times within a very narrow window only. The closest I\u0026rsquo;ve ever come was with Suikoden IV \u0026ndash; I actually got to 107 (!) before missing out on Snowy :/ For Suikoden V, finally surrendering to the fact that I don\u0026rsquo;t have that much time for gaming anymore, I went ahead and used an FAQ to help in the 108 stars, knowing I would not have time for a second play-through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for other gameplay mechanics, they\u0026rsquo;re mostly inherited from earlier games in the series, but enhanced to give you more flexibility. I especially like the fact that you can now bring up to 10 characters around with you \u0026ndash; 6 for battle and 4 in the entourage.

I prefer software developers who are always looking to improve themselves; the ones who buy reference books, read articles on the ‘net, consult with senior developers for design advice, attend trainings and seminars, etc. They study what works and what does not in software development, and they strive to apply only the best practices. For lack of a better term, such people are craftsmen, software development is their craft. I\u0026rsquo;m fairly sure that any software developer who exhibits such qualities is a pretty good one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suppose I\u0026rsquo;m fairly lucky.

If you\u0026rsquo;ve never seen samples of wacky Japanese TV before, \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshi%27s_Castle\"\u003eTakeshi\u0026rsquo;s Castle\u003c/a\u003e is a good start. This wacky Japanese show throws a bunch of a hundred or so contestants into a series of ridiculous games, each one hoping to make it to the end to defeat Count Takeshi and win one million yen!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTakeshi\u0026rsquo;s Castle had a Philippine run, hosted by local actors Anjo Yllana and Smokey Manaloto. Although shown on a less popular channel, the show\u0026rsquo;s hilarious antics and ridiculous games earned it a cult following. The games themselves are sheer madness, requiring mostly luck, agility and a whole lot of guts in order to win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost games usually pit you against Count Takeshi\u0026rsquo;s henchmen. The guards hunt you down in the Honeycomb Maze, shoot cannon balls at you in Bridge Ball and roll giant rocks at you in Avalanche. Several games feature the contestants being stuffed into ridiculously large suits that impair movement. The best games are those that run on pure guts, such as the ever-favorite Skipping Stones, where you must quickly jump across rocks to cross a river — but some of the rocks are fake! If you have nerves of steel, just blaze ahead, jumping from rock to rock, don\u0026rsquo;t care if the one you\u0026rsquo;re stepping on starts to sink!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy single most favorite game is \u0026ldquo;Knock Knock\u0026rdquo;, where a contestant is faced with four walls, each with four doors. Three of the doors on each wall are paper\u0026hellip; but one is boarded up with wood from behind. The contestant doesn\u0026rsquo;t know which is which, but he must choose a door at each wall and charge through in whatever way he can, usually throwing all of his weight into the attempt \u0026ndash; with horrible results if you choose the wrong door. It\u0026rsquo;s cruel and it\u0026rsquo;s mindless, but you find yourself laughing out loud whenever a particularly enthusiastic contestant slams helmet first into the door. It\u0026rsquo;s all about guts baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swear, I wish there were some Japanese channel on cable with these types of shows. It\u0026rsquo;s the kind of mindless, addictive stuff that makes TV so dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

So, I\u0026rsquo;m all \u0026ldquo;alpha geek\u0026rdquo; and stuff, and I go: \u0026ldquo;No we can\u0026rsquo;t. We can\u0026rsquo;t style the ‘Browse\u0026rsquo; button directly, and IE will throw an Access Denied error on submit if we invoke the click() method using Javascript.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut HK guy replies: \u0026ldquo;Gee, I wonder how GMail does it then.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI checked, and he\u0026rsquo;s right. I never noticed before because I use Firefox all the time, but GMail in IE doesn\u0026rsquo;t even show the freakin\u0026rsquo; file input control! It\u0026rsquo;s just an \u0026ldquo;Attach a File\u0026rdquo; link that opens the \u0026ldquo;Open File\u0026rdquo; dialog on click!

But from experience, I know that trying to figure out gmail\u0026rsquo;s obfuscated javascript code would take me days. So I decided to take an alternative approach: I would let gmail execute it\u0026rsquo;s weird javascript magic, then use javascript myself to extract the relevant HTML and Javascript code from the gmail window at the correct state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first attempt: I tried to load gmail in an iframe so I could read the document contents from window.top.
