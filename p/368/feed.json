Is this still true today, with the advent of digital audio editing? Would people who edit conversations be able to create fake voices that accurately mimic the voiceprint of other people?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould there be a way to check if the recordings really have been altered? I don\u0026rsquo;t know if the mobile service providers routinely keep logs of phone calls\u0026hellip; but if they do, it should be easy enough to check the recordings against any originals logged by the phone company. Although I guess it would be optimistic to assume that even if they did keep recordings, they would be able keep all their tapes since June of last year. That would consume an awful lot of space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess that means this is really a wiretap. Of course, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to imagine how the term applies since mobile phones don\u0026rsquo;t have wires. I\u0026rsquo;m not really aware how one \u0026ldquo;taps\u0026rdquo; wireless technology. Does it involve some sort of interception of the communications? I would think such communications would be encrypted such that only the authorized recipients would be able to receive and decrypt them. But maybe that\u0026rsquo;s too much to expect\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI should\u0026rsquo;ve thought of this as soon as I got DSL: I went ahead and downloaded Transformers the Movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTransformers was of course, the epitome of my youth. Unlike most other guy kids, I preferred the Transformers to G.I. Joe. I guess I preferred high-tech fantasy over soliders back then, with the war of the heroic Autobots and the Evil Decepticons appealing more to my young mind than soldiers trying to fight terrorists. I watched the show, I read the comics (the first comic series I really collected), I had a lunch box, and I even bought and ate the unhealthy cheap knock-off Transformers-branded chips they sold near the St. Joseph parish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTransformers: the Movie was the pinnacle of my childhood experience with the Transformers cartoon, since the seasons following the movie were never broadcast on Philippine TV. I watched it yesterday, hoping I would still find the old charm which enthralled me as a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was not disappointed. Well, not much anyway. As an adult I\u0026rsquo;ve grown more critical of things in general, quick to spot and point out minute flaws. Some notes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe year is 2005 in Transformers the Movie, some 19 years after the movie\u0026rsquo;s actual release. At least they didn\u0026rsquo;t predict flying cars like Back to the Future, but how come we don\u0026rsquo;t yet have cars that look like Hot Rod? The \u0026ldquo;futuristic\u0026rdquo; look of the six new Autobots introduced in the movie (Ultra Magnus, Hot Rod, Kup, Blurr, Springer and Arcee) give you an indication of how the people of 80s perceived future transportation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, Transformers can use lightsabers, er\u0026hellip; Laser Swords! Megatron pulls one out during his fatal battle with Optimus Prime, and later in the movie one of the Autobots does too. (I think it was Hot Rod, I forget.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmazingly, while the Autobots and Decepticons never actually hit each other with their weapons in the TV series, their appearance in a movie suddenly made Starscream\u0026rsquo;s use of the Megatron-gun a lot more efficient, accurate and lethal. Ironhide, Prowl, Brawn and Ratchet go down with a single shot each in the first few minutes of the movie. More Autobots died in the first twenty minutes than in the entire run of the series prior to the movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be much of a problem if the Autobots actually had the same numbers they had in the series. It\u0026rsquo;s a well-known fact that the Autobots greatly outnumbered the Decepticons almost all the time, since there are far more types of cars than there are jets and guns and other stuff. But in the movie, there are apprently less than twenty Autobots still in active service. What happened to the rest? We\u0026rsquo;re limited to Optimus Prime, the more popular first-batch Autobots, the Dinobots and the new guys. The Decepticons get a slightly better deal. They get both the first and second batch of jets, the Constructicons, Insecticons, and even the triple-changers Blitzwing and Astrotrain. Also, I think Blaster\u0026rsquo;s cassette-bots make their first cartoon appearance here. Conspiciously absent are the second set of â€˜combiner\u0026rsquo; teams\u0026hellip; the Protectobots, Aerialbots, Combaticons and Stunticons. Some of the fights might have gone better had the Autobots thought to bring around Omega Supreme or Skyfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dinobots are apparently stupider than I remember. I guess my memories preferred the comic-book Dinobots, where Grimlock actually managed to become Autobot leader. Here Blurr has trouble convincing them to board a ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s too bad the Autobots didn\u0026rsquo;t think of bringing Optimus Prime to the planet of junk, where apprently an Autobot can still live after being blown into some twenty-thousand pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ultra Magnus character was created solely to have someone fail to be a leader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrangely enough, when the Autobots crash through Unicron\u0026rsquo;s eye, we don\u0026rsquo;t see any sort of optic sensors on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the movie went pretty much as I remembered it. With a lot of forgettable 80s-style music running in the background. Amazingly, at the end, Rodimus Prime declares an end to the Cybertronian wars, and a new era of peace. I don\u0026rsquo;t recall any peace being negotiated with the Decepticons, who looked like they outnumbered the Autobots fifteen-million to one during Unicron\u0026rsquo;s attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m quite relieved, as watching the movie failed to change my nostalgic childhood memories of the Transformers, although I still vastly prefer the comic book series. Not at all bad for a series made to sell toys.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Get past all of that, and it\u0026rsquo;s a decent enough ride, and a fitting conclusion to the Star Wars epic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeriously, people need to stop picking it apart and just enjoy the movie. Spoilers follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR2-D2=funny. Apparently that droid can do anything. Imagine having a universal socket that can hack any computer system? Plus apparently he\u0026rsquo;s smart and handy enough to fight off a couple of war droids. Not bad for an Astromech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMace Windu vs. Palpatine=good fight. Better than Yoda vs. Palpatine. Mace Windu is obviously better than Yoda at this, probably because he\u0026rsquo;s Morpheus\u0026rsquo; cousin or something, or so my brother claimed. Speaking of which, my brother, sitting beside me, was cringing all throughout their fight. \u0026ldquo;Oh\u0026hellip; he\u0026rsquo;s gonna die\u0026hellip; he\u0026rsquo;s gonna die\u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeriously, what was up with those 3 Jedi Mace Windu brought with him? They had like 1 hit point each. What was he thinking?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnakin: Palpatine is a powerful Sith Lord. You\u0026rsquo;ll need my help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMace Windu: No way, fool. He\u0026rsquo;s just an old man. These 3 noobs will be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Palpatine kills the 3 noobs almost instantly)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMace Windu: Crap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnakin\u0026rsquo;s turning to the Dark Side was believable enough, given a bit of suspension of disbelief. We should\u0026rsquo;ve known it was Padme that would lead to his fall. Too bad Anakin was so gullible\u0026hellip; despite Obi-wan praising him for his wisdom.

I hear he was better in the Clone Wars animated series. I\u0026rsquo;ll watch it sometime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you think about it\u0026hellip; all those references to the later trilogy seemed conveniently crammed into the last part of the movie. So don\u0026rsquo;t think about it. Just enjoy the wholeness of the circle. ðŸ˜€\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, the six-episode story was very good. Lucas\u0026rsquo; sub-par execution make it an easy target for nitpickers, but the Star Wars mythos as a whole is rock-solid foundation, upon which writers far better than Lucas can improve on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story from beginning to end is very tight, from Anakin\u0026rsquo;s discovery as the \u0026ldquo;one who will bring balance to the force\u0026rdquo;, to his fall, to the rise of Luke, and eventually to Anakin\u0026rsquo;s redemption and Luke becoming the last from both lines \u0026ndash; Jedi and Sith.

Previously we had a problem where the other computer could not use the internet through the gateway machine. Looks like ZoneAlarm was the culprit, as apparently, the free version of ZoneAlarm does not support Internet Connection Sharing. I got the internet working by installing Sygate Personal Firewall instead, although this led to the new problem of the other computer not being able to access shared files/folders on the network. We\u0026rsquo;re keeping it at this state until I can figure out a better solution.

Quick reviews, Shrek 2 was the better movie by far. Rib-tickling. I didn\u0026rsquo;t bother seeing it before because it didn\u0026rsquo;t really give me a feeling of being too good, but I was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Especially since I\u0026rsquo;m used to wasting away most of my daylight hours in an airconditioned office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s good to spend a couple of days away from the office though \u0026ndash; God only knows I\u0026rsquo;ve been so damn uninspired with work lately. For the past two weeks or so, I haven\u0026rsquo;t had much heart for my work. Most of the time, I code while wondering if I should file for half a day\u0026rsquo;s sick leave and head home. Except that I don\u0026rsquo;t know if boredom is a valid excuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Madness, despair and self-doubt lay ahead, uncharacteristically. You have been warned.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t know why. I guess I\u0026rsquo;m just tired. Tired of overly complicated modules. Tired of badly designed data models. Tired of losing two hours every day to commuting. Tired of the heat. Tired of all the people. And maybe, just maybe, tired of trying to figure out how to win her attention. Just her attention mind you. I would be satisfied with just her attention for a good while, and that says a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe I\u0026rsquo;m just losing my sense of belonging. I like the people at work, I really do. I have friends there. Close friends, even. People whom I\u0026rsquo;ve opened up to, shared secrets with, confided in. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve had any new close friends since the original zu crew. And I like the job, or I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have stayed this long. And I am quite sure that I am quite good at what I do. So why do thoughts of resigning keep coming up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m lying to myself of course. I know the reason why it\u0026rsquo;s been so hard to keep a good mood lately. I found out some things I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have, through methods I should not have used. I did not learn anything I did not already suspect. I had nothing to gain by trying to find out, I knew that knowing these things for certain would shatter me, yet I had to know. So I went ahead anyway. And my heart is paying the price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been a fool. I know this to be true, I\u0026rsquo;ve known it all along. I\u0026rsquo;ve always hated letting my emotions get the better of me; I should\u0026rsquo;ve held myself back this time same as any other. What made me think it would be any different? What made me think I could fight fate? What made me think I had what it takes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now I\u0026rsquo;m tired. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do. I don\u0026rsquo;t know whether I have the strength to go on. There\u0026rsquo;s gap there that I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to traverse. A barrier that only grows stronger as I fight it. Common sense and several people in the know tell me that it\u0026rsquo;s alright to quit. I\u0026rsquo;ve fought the good fight, there is no shame in surrender. It happens all the time, people try and people fail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis can\u0026rsquo;t possibly be good for me. Already it\u0026rsquo;s starting to affect my work somehow. And I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure that it\u0026rsquo;s holding me back in more ways than that. This isn\u0026rsquo;t going anywhere, and it\u0026rsquo;s making me so frickin\u0026rsquo; weak. It seems so obvious what needs to be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen why is it so hard to let go?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eWell, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d write about Suikoden IV before I forgot all about it. I finished it around Holy Week, but haven\u0026rsquo;t bothered to go through again, even though I promised myself I would try since I did not get the magic number of a hundred and eight stars of destiny this time around. Curse my pride for not reading any FAQs while playing! Time is short, with work and all, so I should make the most of my games so I don\u0026rsquo;t need to re-play them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuiko 4 has big steps to fill. The first two Suikoden games gained quite a following on the PSX, and the third game, while taking things in a somewhat different direction, was pretty good as well. Does Suiko 4 live up to the series\u0026rsquo; legacy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell\u0026hellip; no. It\u0026rsquo;s mostly the same as Suiko 1 and 2, but the plot is a lot simpler this time, and quite uninspired. Very few truly moving mments or scenes. The story takes place in the Island Nations some hundreds of years before the events of Suiko 1. Only three characters are here from previous games: Viki (no surprise there), Jeane (WTF? How is she alive at this time? Does she possess a true rune?) And Ted, the original bearer of the Soul-Eater true rune from Suikoden 1. The worst part is I didn\u0026rsquo;t get Ted! Damn it. I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have rushed the last part of the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving the Soul-Eater would have been good, because frankly, the hero\u0026rsquo;s true rune in this game, the Rune of Punishment, is really lame. Story-wise and gameplay wise. The story of Suikoden games have always revolved around the 27 True Runes\u0026hellip; powerful, living artifacts of magic that shape the destiny of the world. Sought after not only because of the immense power they wield, but also because the True Runes grant their bearers one thing men can only dream of: immortality. This game is about one madman\u0026rsquo;s desire to possess the power of the True Rune of Punishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, the story follows quite the same trend as Suiko 1 and 2. Hero is a young member of prestigious nation\u0026rsquo;s military arm. Hero is forced to leave his home for some reason. Hero finds a True Rune. Hero gathers together a huge army to lay the smackdown on an evil Empire. When the war is done, Hero fades into obscurity. Really, no spoilers here. So why the plot fall so flat if it\u0026rsquo;s following a tried-and-true formula?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think it\u0026rsquo;s because of the uninspired supporting cast. The silent unnamed hero of Suiko 4 doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any strong, loyal personalities attached to him (Gremio in Suiko1, Nanami in Suiko2, a buttload of people in Suiko3) Because of this, he lacks a powerful mouthpiece to help drive the plot forward. Also, it has always been the problem in the Suikoden series that since they always have a cast of 108 in each game, many characters are underdeveloped. But in Suiko 4, I find it hard to name more than five \u0026ldquo;solid\u0026rdquo; characters that drive the plot. And the Silverburg tactician here is boring here as well. No particularly clever plots or tactics here, don\u0026rsquo;t expect any Matthiu or Shu tricks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGameplay-wise, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty blah as well. It\u0026rsquo;s mostly the same as 1 and 2 though, so it\u0026rsquo;s more of no big improvements than suckiness. There is one thing that bothers me though: The dice-bowl gambling game has been given a limit. You can only bet 3000 potch at a time! This minigame was a major source of funds in the earlier games in the series, and with this cap, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to keep up with the high blacksmith prices towards the end of the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne last complaint. This game seems to be technically inferior to Suikoden III. Case in point: cut scenes. It frustrates me that a simple change of perspective/camera angles in cutscenes demands a load time (as in, fade in/fade out) of 0.5-1 seconds. It\u0026rsquo;s the same scene, the models are already loaded in memory, why can\u0026rsquo;t it be a smooth transition? As it is, the cut scenes are jarring and feel skippy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is all. Will I play it again? Maybe, I really want to use the Soul-Eater again. One nice thing about this game is that for the first time in the series, they include a New game + mode. Not much benefits in terms of carry-over, but one major thing: You can skip cutscenes! But I probably still won\u0026rsquo;t play it again. There are other games to play, and too little time.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
