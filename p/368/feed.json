And even both these functions can be better fulfilled by other stuff. Why would you bring a radio to work if you had mp3s available? Even if you wanted to pick up new music, the only ones you\u0026rsquo;ll hear on the radio are the popular ones which you\u0026rsquo;ll likely hear from other people anyway. Radio is even more useless in the face of the internet, since even the news function is overshadowed. And there are a lot more online radio stations to choose from than \u0026ldquo;physical\u0026rdquo; radio stations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeday, people from the future will laugh at our primitive ways of turning on a machine and hoping it plays what we want and hoping the ads and the silly DJ don\u0026rsquo;t spoil it too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTV is slightly better, since TV programming is supposedly scheduled. But TV\u0026rsquo;s predictability makes it unsuitable for the function of background filler. TV remotes should come with a \u0026ldquo;random station\u0026rdquo; button. Or you could set a timer that causes the TV to jump to a random station every 30 minutes, or even every minute if you\u0026rsquo;re insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brother Brian gets credit for the \u0026ldquo;random station button\u0026rdquo; idea.

The movie is less about Batman\u0026rsquo;s crimefighting adventures and more about Bruce Wayne\u0026rsquo;s journey from being a angry, confused rich orphan to the billionaire playboy/costumed vigilante popularized by the earlier films.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe movie captures the essence of Batman\u0026rsquo;s character perfectly. It\u0026rsquo;s all about fear — Bruce overcoming his fear of bats and eventually turning that fear into a symbol to strike terror into the hearts of criminals. The Batman here is nowhere near Joel Schumacher\u0026rsquo;s colorful crusader, or Adam West\u0026rsquo;s *Biff*Pow*Sock* type of action. This Batman is a true dark knight, striking from the shadows, unseen, terrifying. I can just imagine the rumors rippling through the underworld during the movie: the Batman is a terrifying monster; he can fly; he can command bats; he is darkness incarnate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two villains that appear in the movie \u0026ndash; Ra\u0026rsquo;s Al Ghul and Scarecrow \u0026ndash; complement the general fear and deception theme of the movie. Jim Gordon\u0026rsquo;s character is great, although it\u0026rsquo;s a bit weird for me to see Gary Oldman in the role. As for Katie Holmes, well, her character didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to have an important enough role from my point of view. Michael Kaine is a worthy Alfred Pennyworth, and this Alfred seems a bit more smartass than those that appeared in the earlier movies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, worth the watch. The tantalizing hint at the end of the movie suggests a sequel, but the question is, who will play the Joker?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, we watched in the new cinemas at SM North. Nice, everything seems a lot roomier and the seats were comfy. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to see what the comfort rooms were like as the movie had me glued to my seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if they take me up or down the mail-list. Gmail is better, since it explicitly says \u0026ldquo;older\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;newer\u0026rdquo;; With Yahoo, I\u0026rsquo;m always wrong when I guess. After some experimenting, I figure it out. \u0026ldquo;Next\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Previous\u0026rdquo; are based on the sort order in the list of messages. Since the default is sorted by date descending (newest first), \u0026ldquo;Next\u0026rdquo; corresponds to Yahoo\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;older\u0026rdquo; by default. Which is kind of hard to figure intuitively.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn the grid that lists mail messages, I wanted to test if the columns would wrap any words that were too long. Multiple observations here:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of this experiment, I wanted to create an email address with a very long name. Apparently, the Yahoo ID \u0026ldquo;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345\u0026rdquo; was already taken. I settled on \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"mailto:solongandthanksforallthefish2005@yahoo.com\"\u003esolongandthanksforallthefish2005@yahoo.com\u003c/a\u003e\u0026rdquo;.

I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize the value in the sender column was the name in the Yahoo profile instead of the actual email address. I update the account name to \u003ccode\u003eAllTheThingsSheKeepsInsideAreTheThingsThatReallyMatterTheFacePutsOnItsBestDisguiseAndAllIsWellUntilT heHeartBetraysLordBringOutTheLightWrapItAllAroundMeLetItHoldMeTightSoakUpAllThatIBleedLordBringOutTh eLightWrapItAllAroundMeLetItHoldMeTightSoakUpAllThatIBleedIBleedWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWX\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhich breaks even more layouts, including this one (mental note: fix that tomorrow).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoh! I actually had to change the Outgoing name, which was set to the original account name. Why doesn\u0026rsquo;t it update the mail setting when I change the (global) Yahoo account setting? Updated it to \u0026ldquo;AllTheThingsSheKeepsInsideAreT\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sent some mail messages with the long name and a long subject line. As I suspected\u0026hellip; Yahoo compensates for the unwrappable words by expanding the grid cell, breaking the layout. This was a problem I encountered before in the webapps at workand I still don\u0026rsquo;t have a solution that would work in all browsers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m also interested in how popular webapps handle timestamping, so I try this out as well. For the uninformed, timestamping means handling the case where two people both try to edit the same record at roughly the same time. If there\u0026rsquo;s no handling, the person who updates first usually has his changes lost, without any notification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI try it out first with Yahoo Address Book and Notepad. Both experiments fail\u0026hellip; there\u0026rsquo;s no timestamping. I tested it by opening a record (Address Book entry/Notepad note) for updating in two separate Firefox tabs. I update one tab and save, then update the second tab and save. Changes made in the first tab are lost.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWell, I guess that\u0026rsquo;s okay, since technically, only one person at a time is expected to access these webapps. So I do something else. I create \u003ca href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/roytang/\"\u003ea Yahoo Group\u003c/a\u003e . I get two moderators, me and a dummy email account. I login with both accounts, using Firefox for one and IE for the other. I try to update the group description with one account, then the other. Bam! First guy\u0026rsquo;s changes are lost, without notification! If this were some sort of mission-critical webapp, that would be a dangerous bug.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m sleepy.

Is this still true today, with the advent of digital audio editing? Would people who edit conversations be able to create fake voices that accurately mimic the voiceprint of other people?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould there be a way to check if the recordings really have been altered? I don\u0026rsquo;t know if the mobile service providers routinely keep logs of phone calls\u0026hellip; but if they do, it should be easy enough to check the recordings against any originals logged by the phone company. Although I guess it would be optimistic to assume that even if they did keep recordings, they would be able keep all their tapes since June of last year. That would consume an awful lot of space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess that means this is really a wiretap. Of course, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to imagine how the term applies since mobile phones don\u0026rsquo;t have wires. I\u0026rsquo;m not really aware how one \u0026ldquo;taps\u0026rdquo; wireless technology. Does it involve some sort of interception of the communications? I would think such communications would be encrypted such that only the authorized recipients would be able to receive and decrypt them. But maybe that\u0026rsquo;s too much to expect\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI should\u0026rsquo;ve thought of this as soon as I got DSL: I went ahead and downloaded Transformers the Movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTransformers was of course, the epitome of my youth. Unlike most other guy kids, I preferred the Transformers to G.I. Joe. I guess I preferred high-tech fantasy over soliders back then, with the war of the heroic Autobots and the Evil Decepticons appealing more to my young mind than soldiers trying to fight terrorists. I watched the show, I read the comics (the first comic series I really collected), I had a lunch box, and I even bought and ate the unhealthy cheap knock-off Transformers-branded chips they sold near the St. Joseph parish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTransformers: the Movie was the pinnacle of my childhood experience with the Transformers cartoon, since the seasons following the movie were never broadcast on Philippine TV. I watched it yesterday, hoping I would still find the old charm which enthralled me as a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was not disappointed. Well, not much anyway. As an adult I\u0026rsquo;ve grown more critical of things in general, quick to spot and point out minute flaws. Some notes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe year is 2005 in Transformers the Movie, some 19 years after the movie\u0026rsquo;s actual release. At least they didn\u0026rsquo;t predict flying cars like Back to the Future, but how come we don\u0026rsquo;t yet have cars that look like Hot Rod? The \u0026ldquo;futuristic\u0026rdquo; look of the six new Autobots introduced in the movie (Ultra Magnus, Hot Rod, Kup, Blurr, Springer and Arcee) give you an indication of how the people of 80s perceived future transportation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, Transformers can use lightsabers, er\u0026hellip; Laser Swords! Megatron pulls one out during his fatal battle with Optimus Prime, and later in the movie one of the Autobots does too. (I think it was Hot Rod, I forget.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmazingly, while the Autobots and Decepticons never actually hit each other with their weapons in the TV series, their appearance in a movie suddenly made Starscream\u0026rsquo;s use of the Megatron-gun a lot more efficient, accurate and lethal. Ironhide, Prowl, Brawn and Ratchet go down with a single shot each in the first few minutes of the movie. More Autobots died in the first twenty minutes than in the entire run of the series prior to the movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be much of a problem if the Autobots actually had the same numbers they had in the series. It\u0026rsquo;s a well-known fact that the Autobots greatly outnumbered the Decepticons almost all the time, since there are far more types of cars than there are jets and guns and other stuff. But in the movie, there are apprently less than twenty Autobots still in active service. What happened to the rest? We\u0026rsquo;re limited to Optimus Prime, the more popular first-batch Autobots, the Dinobots and the new guys. The Decepticons get a slightly better deal. They get both the first and second batch of jets, the Constructicons, Insecticons, and even the triple-changers Blitzwing and Astrotrain. Also, I think Blaster\u0026rsquo;s cassette-bots make their first cartoon appearance here. Conspiciously absent are the second set of ‘combiner\u0026rsquo; teams\u0026hellip; the Protectobots, Aerialbots, Combaticons and Stunticons. Some of the fights might have gone better had the Autobots thought to bring around Omega Supreme or Skyfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dinobots are apparently stupider than I remember. I guess my memories preferred the comic-book Dinobots, where Grimlock actually managed to become Autobot leader. Here Blurr has trouble convincing them to board a ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s too bad the Autobots didn\u0026rsquo;t think of bringing Optimus Prime to the planet of junk, where apprently an Autobot can still live after being blown into some twenty-thousand pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ultra Magnus character was created solely to have someone fail to be a leader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrangely enough, when the Autobots crash through Unicron\u0026rsquo;s eye, we don\u0026rsquo;t see any sort of optic sensors on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the movie went pretty much as I remembered it. With a lot of forgettable 80s-style music running in the background. Amazingly, at the end, Rodimus Prime declares an end to the Cybertronian wars, and a new era of peace. I don\u0026rsquo;t recall any peace being negotiated with the Decepticons, who looked like they outnumbered the Autobots fifteen-million to one during Unicron\u0026rsquo;s attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m quite relieved, as watching the movie failed to change my nostalgic childhood memories of the Transformers, although I still vastly prefer the comic book series. Not at all bad for a series made to sell toys.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Get past all of that, and it\u0026rsquo;s a decent enough ride, and a fitting conclusion to the Star Wars epic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeriously, people need to stop picking it apart and just enjoy the movie. Spoilers follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR2-D2=funny. Apparently that droid can do anything. Imagine having a universal socket that can hack any computer system?

Better than Yoda vs. Palpatine. Mace Windu is obviously better than Yoda at this, probably because he\u0026rsquo;s Morpheus\u0026rsquo; cousin or something, or so my brother claimed. Speaking of which, my brother, sitting beside me, was cringing all throughout their fight. \u0026ldquo;Oh\u0026hellip; he\u0026rsquo;s gonna die\u0026hellip; he\u0026rsquo;s gonna die\u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeriously, what was up with those 3 Jedi Mace Windu brought with him? They had like 1 hit point each. What was he thinking?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnakin: Palpatine is a powerful Sith Lord. You\u0026rsquo;ll need my help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMace Windu: No way, fool. He\u0026rsquo;s just an old man. These 3 noobs will be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Palpatine kills the 3 noobs almost instantly)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMace Windu: Crap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnakin\u0026rsquo;s turning to the Dark Side was believable enough, given a bit of suspension of disbelief. We should\u0026rsquo;ve known it was Padme that would lead to his fall. Too bad Anakin was so gullible\u0026hellip; despite Obi-wan praising him for his wisdom.

I hear he was better in the Clone Wars animated series. I\u0026rsquo;ll watch it sometime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you think about it\u0026hellip; all those references to the later trilogy seemed conveniently crammed into the last part of the movie. So don\u0026rsquo;t think about it. Just enjoy the wholeness of the circle. 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, the six-episode story was very good. Lucas\u0026rsquo; sub-par execution make it an easy target for nitpickers, but the Star Wars mythos as a whole is rock-solid foundation, upon which writers far better than Lucas can improve on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story from beginning to end is very tight, from Anakin\u0026rsquo;s discovery as the \u0026ldquo;one who will bring balance to the force\u0026rdquo;, to his fall, to the rise of Luke, and eventually to Anakin\u0026rsquo;s redemption and Luke becoming the last from both lines \u0026ndash; Jedi and Sith.

Previously we had a problem where the other computer could not use the internet through the gateway machine. Looks like ZoneAlarm was the culprit, as apparently, the free version of ZoneAlarm does not support Internet Connection Sharing. I got the internet working by installing Sygate Personal Firewall instead, although this led to the new problem of the other computer not being able to access shared files/folders on the network. We\u0026rsquo;re keeping it at this state until I can figure out a better solution.

Quick reviews, Shrek 2 was the better movie by far. Rib-tickling.

For the past two weeks or so, I haven\u0026rsquo;t had much heart for my work. Most of the time, I code while wondering if I should file for half a day\u0026rsquo;s sick leave and head home. Except that I don\u0026rsquo;t know if boredom is a valid excuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Madness, despair and self-doubt lay ahead, uncharacteristically. You have been warned.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t know why. I guess I\u0026rsquo;m just tired. Tired of overly complicated modules. Tired of badly designed data models. Tired of losing two hours every day to commuting. Tired of the heat. Tired of all the people. And maybe, just maybe, tired of trying to figure out how to win her attention. Just her attention mind you. I would be satisfied with just her attention for a good while, and that says a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe I\u0026rsquo;m just losing my sense of belonging. I like the people at work, I really do. I have friends there. Close friends, even. People whom I\u0026rsquo;ve opened up to, shared secrets with, confided in. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve had any new close friends since the original zu crew. And I like the job, or I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have stayed this long. And I am quite sure that I am quite good at what I do. So why do thoughts of resigning keep coming up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m lying to myself of course. I know the reason why it\u0026rsquo;s been so hard to keep a good mood lately. I found out some things I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have, through methods I should not have used. I did not learn anything I did not already suspect. I had nothing to gain by trying to find out, I knew that knowing these things for certain would shatter me, yet I had to know. So I went ahead anyway. And my heart is paying the price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been a fool. I know this to be true, I\u0026rsquo;ve known it all along. I\u0026rsquo;ve always hated letting my emotions get the better of me; I should\u0026rsquo;ve held myself back this time same as any other. What made me think it would be any different? What made me think I could fight fate? What made me think I had what it takes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now I\u0026rsquo;m tired. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do. I don\u0026rsquo;t know whether I have the strength to go on. There\u0026rsquo;s gap there that I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to traverse. A barrier that only grows stronger as I fight it. Common sense and several people in the know tell me that it\u0026rsquo;s alright to quit. I\u0026rsquo;ve fought the good fight, there is no shame in surrender. It happens all the time, people try and people fail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis can\u0026rsquo;t possibly be good for me. Already it\u0026rsquo;s starting to affect my work somehow. And I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure that it\u0026rsquo;s holding me back in more ways than that. This isn\u0026rsquo;t going anywhere, and it\u0026rsquo;s making me so frickin\u0026rsquo; weak. It seems so obvious what needs to be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen why is it so hard to let go?\u003c/p\u003e\n",
