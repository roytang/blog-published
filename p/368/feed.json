He plays a Sacred Mesa with only six lands in play (I took out a couple with the Acid-Moss) and I think \u0026ldquo;Good luck maintaining that.\u0026rdquo; I put up more pressure and finish with the Demonfire for three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: 1-2 vs RU Control\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame one sees me getting beaten down bad.

We\u0026rsquo;re both down to 10, he swings with five pegasus. I consider the lone Squall Line in my hand. \u0026ldquo;Squall Line for 4?\u0026rdquo; Remand. I take the 5 damage. My turn, I topdeck the Demonfire, assuring victory! I swing, saps make it through and bring him down to 5. And thus my stupid move: I played the Squall Line first, and ANNOUNCE IT FOR 5. Goddamn, I must\u0026rsquo;ve been really out of it. I was so excited by the topdeck that I failed to think. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. I offer my opponent the win, since he can still hit top 8 (he was paired down), and he can just split the packs with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 7: 2-0 vs Dragonstorm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t even care anymore, I just kept playing the Elephants one after another.

My deck simply has no way to handle the life gain from multiple Martyr of Sands. I managed to win game 2 off a fast clock. Game 3 I had a good start as I managed to use several Acid-Moss to keep the Tron from coming online, but eventually he had me locked in again with Martyrs, Proclamation, Howling Mine, Chronosavants, etc. He was at 40+ life when he managed to play Akroma. I hold her off with Glare of Subdual and eventually get out enough guys that he\u0026rsquo;s forced to Wrath away the Akroma. But he has the Debtor\u0026rsquo;s Knell in play, and my sideboarded Moratorium Stones failed to appear. I can\u0026rsquo;t recall, but I may have made a misplay at some point when he hard-casted a Sunscour and I had a Hierarch in play, I forget if I had the mana open to save my guys. But I certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoss: 1-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2 vs UR Vore\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYay! I\u0026rsquo;ve faced UR Vore several times before, so I\u0026rsquo;m pretty familiar with how it plays, and I crush him easily game one, working around the counters and generally ignoring the land destruction thanks to the almighty Yavimaya Dryad. Game 2 I stall a bit, and he takes me down with an 8/8 Vore. Game 3 I\u0026rsquo;m back in business, hitting back-to-back Dryad and Acid-Moss into Herd tokens. I overextend a bit since he shows no sign of having Wildfire yet. Despite a Tidings and a couple of Sleight of Hands he does not draw the ‘Fire. I eventually empty my hand and play the hellbent Demonfire for the win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin: 2-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3 vs Marnel featuring Vesuvan Lockdown\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarnel is an officemante, and he and I were playtesting last night and his deck was a slightly difficult matchup for me \u0026ndash; I won 2 out of 4 games but both wins were based on really good draws. So he and I face off in round 3 and I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;This is just a playtest, so we\u0026rsquo;re not going to draw, right?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarnel\u0026rsquo;s deck plays morph guys \u0026ndash; lots of \u0026lsquo;em. He\u0026rsquo;d only finished the changes last night. It\u0026rsquo;s an awesome deck and fun to play. And most importantly, people won\u0026rsquo;t know how to handle it! As long as he doesn\u0026rsquo;t play any insanely fast aggro, he\u0026rsquo;s got a good chance of winning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, I am not insanely fast aggro, and we go to a close game 3. During my last turn I\u0026rsquo;m at 2 and he\u0026rsquo;s at 5 with a SSS in play. He did the Thelonite Hermit + Vesuvan Shapeshifter bit during the last 2 turns, so he has a battalion of saps on his side and I will surely lose with his next swing. I decide to go for the draw: \u0026ldquo;Squall Line for 5?\u0026rdquo; But he shows me the Cancel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe loss means I don\u0026rsquo;t get top 8 status anymore, but this is just practice. 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoss: 1-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4 vs UW control\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve played this guy a few times before. He\u0026rsquo;s a nice guy, but he always plays blue =p I eat his deck alive. During Friday\u0026rsquo;s night testing I was able to handily beat a deck that had four Wraths and three Pyros, U/W is a pushover. I don\u0026rsquo;t even think I saw any offence. I finish with the Demonfire on game two and I love the surprised look on their faces when I do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin: 2-0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5 vs ugr beats\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometime during the match I morph a Thelonite Hermit and he\u0026rsquo;s like \u0026ldquo;Eh? Is there still Morph in Standard?\u0026rdquo; =/\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, this seems like a weaker version of Sea Stompy. I see no Slums or Plaxmantas or Snakes, and I know how to work around the permission. Win game one no problem. Game 2, I was at 9 and he had two mana open so I psyched myself out and did not Demonfire his Yavimaya Dryad + Moldervine Cloak. Oops, lost to Char on the next swing. Game 3, he has a bad draw and only gets two lands out early, plus birds and elves. I hit the Acid-Moss when he taps out for a Viper that trades with an Elephant. Demonfire and Thornscape Battlemage take out 2 birds, and he only has a Karplusan and a Llanowar Elf and a Giant Solifuge out. He\u0026rsquo;s at 5 I\u0026rsquo;m at 6, I pass the turn. He looks at his hand and swing with the Solifuge. I have a guildmage, a morphed hermit and the battlemage on my side, so the easy play is single-block the Solifuge and swing for six (with the Guildmage pump) the next turn. I\u0026rsquo;m about to do that, but I realize he hasn\u0026rsquo;t made a land drop yet! If I take 2 from the Solifuge, he can play Mountain, Char for the win! I do the double-block trading 2-for-1, since I\u0026rsquo;m ahead in board position anyway. He frowns and plays Island, go. I swing with the Guildmage, bringing him down to three, then play 2 more Guildmages. He frowns again, realizes he can\u0026rsquo;t play Char anymore, then offers the handshake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin: 2-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6 vs ugr tron\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheesh. This was even easier than the Vore from round 2. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I saw any offense. The magnificent Acid-Moss rears it\u0026rsquo;s ugly head again. And also my awesome power to cut Wildfires to the bottoms of decks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin: 2-0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 7 vs Monoblack Aggro\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter round 6 I was hoping I\u0026rsquo;d get paired with this guy\u0026hellip; I could take his deck any day of the week. Game one starts out like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Stomping Ground, go\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHim: Swamp, Rusalka\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Land, Assault on Rusalka\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHim: Swamp, Dark Confidant\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Land, Assault on Confidant\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHim: Swamp, Dark Confidant\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Land, Assault on Confidant (topdecked the Assault \u0026ndash; ah, Assault and Dark Confidant, you were made for each other)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eventually overwhelm him with Elephants. We go to game 2, and he has a not-so-awesome draw and plays four Bad Moons over the first five turns. He gets a swing in with a 5/5 Nether Traitor, but on my turn, I play the ever-so-awesome Glare of Subdual. I have the Ghazi in play, so I just keep pumping out saps to hold off the ever-increasing army of dudes. He made the mistake of telling me he was waiting for the Plagued Rusalka to come out (so he could finish off my saps with the Rusalka + Nether Traitor combination attack), so I alpha-strike him with just enough damage to kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin: 2-0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was my best constructed finish for this year: 5-2 (How sad.) I finish 11th, enough to win 3 booster packs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe breakout performance was however, Marnel\u0026rsquo;s Vesuvan lockdown deck, which he piloted to a 6-1 (Number 1) finish. Props to him, this deck is awesome and fun to play, both with and against. It\u0026rsquo;s also a very technically involved deck, there are lots of tricks involved, especially with Willbender. I wish I was as successful with my attempts to go rogue. =p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, good practice. I\u0026rsquo;m planning to play on each of the next 3 weekends as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "This tournament and three others for each Saturday of November are run-ups to the Time Spiral Gold Rush tournament in December. I\u0026rsquo;ve been agonizing over the past couple of weeks as to what I can play in the diverse new standard enivornment. In the end, instead of doing my usual thing and building an original decklist, I decided to work from an existing archetype instead. I believe that in order for me to become a better Standard player, I have to get more match experience before designing decks, since my thinking is still on a casual level most of the time.",

Well, my brother just hit 60 recently, so I suppose I should ask him after a few weeks what it\u0026rsquo;s like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then again, I\u0026rsquo;m the sort of person that likes multitasking, the thought of spending 12 or more hours in a day doing the same thing sends a shiver up my spine. So I doubt I\u0026rsquo;m ever really in any danger of getting addicted in that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne could argue that it\u0026rsquo;s a person\u0026rsquo;s own responsibility to make sure he doesn\u0026rsquo;t become overly addicted to any one thing, MMORPGs included. One would think that a person who allows himself to become addicted to MMOs would have just been addicted to something else had the MMO not existed. But MMORPGs are still a strange new thing to our society, one that we haven\u0026rsquo;t yet been taught how to handle, one that does not yet have those society-set levels that define how much is too much. And one cannot deny that the ability to interact with people from all over the world with an avatar of your own choosing would seem like a powerful opportunity for growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the worst pressures in the game supposedly come from other players. After reading the article, I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure I want to be involved in raiding (although I suppose it depends on what other end-game content is available), as a raiding guild can probably exert a lot on peer pressure for one to commit more time to the ever-addictive game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis phenomenon doesn\u0026rsquo;t really exist only for MMORPGs though, it\u0026rsquo;s just a lot easier because of the social factor involved. It can happen with offline games as well, especially open-ended ones. I once knew someone who brought her home computer to the lab at school for the sole purpose of being able to play The Sims while at the lab. And whenever I dropped by the Lab, there she was, happily clicking away to earn her Simoleans. MMOs like WoW are infinitely more deep than The Sims because of the interaction\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith other players and the constantly improving game content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all is said, Blizzard has made one hell of game, one that provides a virtual escape for many people. I suppose one should just be careful that it adds something to your life instead of taking away.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

A series of somewhat-badly-written-and-quite-unlikely coincidences gives the humans a chance to save their world, short Dragonball-style battle sequence and an inane homage to the ending of Superman II. Seems they tried to pack too much into one episode. And at the end of it all, we seem to be right back at the status quo of season five.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eLate afternoon on Saturday, I was looking quite a bit more work ahead of me, an amount that would later prove to last into the early morning. For some reason or another, I was a bit out of sorts, not really into what I was doing. Not wanting to waste company time being ridiculously unproductive, I decided to take an early dinner break and wander around Ortigas Centre for a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suppose everyone has their off days. You know, those days when you\u0026rsquo;re not particularly sure what the hell it is you\u0026rsquo;re doing or why you\u0026rsquo;re doing it. This was one of those days. I walked around a bit thinking random odd thoughts like \u0026ldquo;I wonder what would happen if I just went ahead, took out all my cash from an ATM and vanished forever from this life?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are people would miss me, sure; but they\u0026rsquo;d get over it. The current project would get hit by a crisis for a short while; but they would recover in a week or so. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure there are far too many people in the world for the loss of one identity to have some catastrophic impact. My real concern was wondering what I would do with the new-found freedom, what kind of new life would I set up for myself. My preferences went towards any sort of normal 9-to-5 job where I could just come in, do the minimum amount of work I could, then leave as early as I can, getting a lot of free time in the process. Well, at least a lot more than I have now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s ridiculous of course; I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t last long living a life where I had to spend 8 hours a day doing some inane thing like being a store clerk. No offense to those people who *are* store clerks, mind you; I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are many good reasons why they are store clerks. It\u0026rsquo;s just that none of those good reasons would be good enough for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe current job is actually great in that it constantly challenges me, pushing me to find smarter ways to do things, to be brilliant, to rise to the challenges. But it\u0026rsquo;s not perfect. There are periods of time where the team has no choice but to go into crunch mode. Like now. And any developer can tell you, when your team is in crunch mode, you can literally feel the weight of the world on your shoulders. Luckily, many of the devs on the current team are still hard-working and still have a bit of fight left in them, hopefully enough to see the project through. But I\u0026rsquo;m starting to feel the weight myself; I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve ever been this tired of a project before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of becoming a hobo, I figured I\u0026rsquo;d take a vacation after the project is done. I\u0026rsquo;ve already told the appropriate people that I\u0026rsquo;d like to take a two-week leave before moving on to the next project. But right now, two weeks seems a bit lame. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking a bit more\u0026hellip; maybe two or three months. I don\u0026rsquo;t even care if it\u0026rsquo;s unpaid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mentioned this to a colleague, and she told me I\u0026rsquo;d be bored out of my wits by the end of the first week. Wow, that\u0026rsquo;s ridiculous. As long as I have electricity, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I can be bored. (Didn\u0026rsquo;t we just lose all electricity across Luzon last week? Shut up.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI figure I\u0026rsquo;d spend one week just cleaning stuff up and sorting it. Yeah, I sort stuff, I\u0026rsquo;m geeky that way. And yeah, one week. I don\u0026rsquo;t even have a lot of stuff per se. It\u0026rsquo;s just not very organized right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I can spend some time on a hobby that I\u0026rsquo;ve neglected for the past two or three years: game development. I don\u0026rsquo;t plan to look for work in the gaming industry anytime soon, given that the current work conditions in commercial game development are a lot worse than I would be willing to tolerate. If ever I break into the gaming industry, it\u0026rsquo;s probably as an indie game developer. Anyway, right now I\u0026rsquo;d just want to finish one damn game. Before I started my current job I didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough programming experience or discipline to get it done. But now I think I can safely allot 2-3 weeks for a simple random-dungeon roguelike. After all, an experienced game programmer was \u003ca href=\"http://www.rampantgames.com/blog/2005/04/rpg-in-week.html\"\u003eable to do it in a week\u003c/a\u003e, I figure three times that amount of time should be enough for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat else would I do during this theoretical 2-3 month break? I also want to write a book. Not that I think I\u0026rsquo;m any good or anything, I just wanna give it a go. I\u0026rsquo;m not particularly good at world-building, so I\u0026rsquo;m thinking it\u0026rsquo;ll probably be some generic fantasy-type template world, and the story would be more person-centric than world-centric. So no epic world-saving sagas or anything. I\u0026rsquo;d also want to try something more science-fictiony, but I think the fantasy stuff would be easier for me first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRest of the time would be spent net-surfing, blog-reading, maybe twinking around with Ubuntu, WoW, Magic: The Gathering, Final Fantasy XII, etc. Maybe even some exercising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Sigh* it\u0026rsquo;s nice to dream of vacations. That being said, I\u0026rsquo;d probably only do a 3-4 week vacation at most. Aside from the fact that anything longer than that costs me a bit of salary, I think I\u0026rsquo;d actually miss the job and the people there. Strange, but probably true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, I eventually had dinner at Jollibee at the Megamall food court.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
