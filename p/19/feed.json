It helped that nothing significantly newsworthy happened over the long weekend. (Well, there\u0026rsquo;s still thousands of deaths worldwide, but somehow our bar for \u0026ldquo;significant\u0026rdquo; has shifted quite a bit.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur lockdown has of course been extended to the end of April. I expect it will go beyond that though, likely the earliest chance for things to start going back to normal might be by June.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGot some consulting work done in the first half of the week, mostly setting up some automation for a client. Looks like they\u0026rsquo;ll have more to do for me next week so at least I\u0026rsquo;m keeping busy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso managed to do two online quiz nights again, doing more poorly this time, but still pretty fun. The second one was held last night (Black Saturday), and it was a team effort, so it involved our trivia team on an FB Messenger call while watching the quiz via FB live. FB Live sucks for this kind of thing due to lag, but we had fun (but still did not do well.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince it\u0026rsquo;s Easter Sunday and the folks haven\u0026rsquo;t seen their grandkids for a while, me and the bros set up a Zoom call so all the grandkids could see the grandparents, everyone all together at once. As could be expected, it was kind of chaotic, but also all kinds of fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"watching-lately\"\u003eWatching lately\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the weekend to watch a few movies, notably completing the Hobbit trilogy. This trilogy wasn\u0026rsquo;t as good as the LotR one (talk about high bar to meet right?), but pretty watchable in its own right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also watched The Departed, pretty intense movie. Gradually building up to watching the Irishman on Netflix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I watched this fantastic collaborative fan-made shot-by-shot remake of Back to the Future II put together during quarantine, featuring all kinds of ridiculousness: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcUUjWbVc4I\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcUUjWbVc4I\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheck the \u003ca href=\"/page/lists/2020/movies/\"\u003e2020 movies page\u003c/a\u003e for my commentary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, I also rewatched the last two seasons of Community (now surprisingly available on both Netflix and Prime Video at the same time!), mostly to prep for a trivia round, but also because it\u0026rsquo;s a fun underrated show and more people should watch it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome things of interest:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ai-art.tokyo/en#/\"\u003eAl Gahaku\u003c/a\u003e, an AI \u0026ldquo;artist\u0026rdquo; that takes an existing photograph and modifies it to look like a renaissance-style painting. Pretty fun.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s this \u003ca href=\"https://ncase.me/contact-tracing/\"\u003egreat comic\u003c/a\u003e summarizing a privacy-respecting bluetooth-based contact tracing protocol. Nice way to present information for easier consumption by the general public.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"gaming\"\u003eGaming\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeen playing mostly Magic Arena (wasting my gold on \u003ca href=\"/2020/04/1248178769275256832/\"\u003ecube sealed\u003c/a\u003e, really fun), Divinity: Original Sin 2 (kind of a slow burn) and a bit of Megaman Legacy Collection (currently about halfway through Megaman 3).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal Fantasy VII Remake is out this week. I had a Deluxe edition preorder with our local game store, but given they\u0026rsquo;re all closed IDK how that\u0026rsquo;s going to work now. The store collected information from everyone who preordered so that they can give out info, but no updates yet. I suspect they\u0026rsquo;re going to try to set up some kind of delivery service, but don\u0026rsquo;t want to promise too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlas even if I could get my FF7R copy, I don\u0026rsquo;t even have my PS4 at home as it was borrowed by my brother in February. I was planning to get it back right before the FF7R release, but eh, life in quarantine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dug up some old draft blog posts that I never published, so I polished them up and we should have some new content for the coming week (other than these weeknotes).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than that, I\u0026rsquo;ve been considering re-organizing how this blog/site is organized. I was recently reading Kev Quirk\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://kevq.uk/why-i-dont-use-a-static-site-generator/\"\u003epost about why he doesn\u0026rsquo;t use a static site generator\u003c/a\u003e, it kind of tempted me to consider switching back to Wordpress. The main problem with Hugo running this site at the moment is that the build time is quite long, so feedback can take a while. (Still the same issue I \u003ca href=\"/2019/11/one-year-with-hugo/\"\u003ereported in November\u003c/a\u003e.) Anyway, I considered going back to Wordpress, and while that\u0026rsquo;s certainly a viable solution, there are some things that I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of doing that would be complicated to do in Wordpress\u0026rsquo;s data structure. Also, my gut doesn\u0026rsquo;t like the idea, although there are certainly some pros. I\u0026rsquo;ll need to think about this a bit more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeday, we\u0026rsquo;ll find our way back to the world we once knew, but it will have moved beyond us.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I can\u0026rsquo;t sit without a shirt or rest or my arms anywhere without sweat threatening to accumulate on the contact surface. Coincidentally around the first week of the lockdown, our aircon in the only airconditioned room in the house started making funny noises so we\u0026rsquo;ve stopped using it.

It seems kind of difficult to get your thoughts together when your brain is constantly distracted by the state of the world.

I will say however that I\u0026rsquo;m amazed how strong his business still seems to be going, given they\u0026rsquo;re an industry that I don\u0026rsquo;t really consider essential. Still, more work is fine, as it helps distract me from the prevailing mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe did two online quiz nights again. I even managed to win one of them!

I may pause again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLots of multiplayer gaming again this week. SC2 with my usual gaming group. Armello with my other gaming group. And now even my brothers are asking around if we all have Left 4 Dead 2 installed (but we haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten around to a session yet.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo progress on Megaman LC this week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI purchased Divinity: Original Sin 2 a couple of weeks ago in anticipation of an extended lockdown and finally started it up this week. I played a premade character first to get a feel of things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, this week was the start of spoiler season for the next MTG set, Ikoria. And it\u0026rsquo;s kind of crazy; they\u0026rsquo;re doing a crossover with Toho to feature Godzilla-themed alters for certain cards. There was a leak before that Godzilla would be in the set, which seemed ridiculous, but here we are! I think the set comes out in a week, and it looks pretty sweet, looking forward to playing it on Arena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonal projects: Thinking of finally adding a set of new trivia questions to the \u003ca href=\"https://triviastorm.net/\"\u003etrivia app\u003c/a\u003e. Mostly because our quizzing activity has kind of gone up while in quarantine (including random friends sharing quizzes etc.) A lot of the older questions/answers are kind of low quality too, so I want to implement some kind of weighted random selection so that newer questions are more likely to be picked. But first I need to cobble together a decent data set. Most of it will be movie and TV related I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecent site changes: Not much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s highly probably that our lockdown is going to be extended by at least a month.
