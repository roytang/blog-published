(This is what happens when you set a vague goal.) It didn\u0026rsquo;t help that I found myself browsing Tumblr themes in the early mornings after recently \u003ca href=\"/2020/02/tumblr-cloudflare/\"\u003ehaving to debug Tumblr stuff\u003c/a\u003e. I don\u0026rsquo;t consider myself especially good at web design, but I do enjoy browsing themes, whether it\u0026rsquo;s Wordpress or Tumblr or Hugo themes. This is the reason why even when I was using Wordpress, I would be switching themes way too often. I\u0026rsquo;m not one of those guys who can be happy running the same Blogspot template for ten years. Given all of that I don\u0026rsquo;t know if the redesign would ever finish if I insisted on a general redesign. So, I\u0026rsquo;m deploying #1 and #2 first, and maybe worry about the other stuff in the future. So: more incremental, less big, drastic change, I find that always works out better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe do get some general changes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esidebar added for the navigation links, replacing the previous hero section at the top of the pages. The sidebar ploops to the bottom on lower display widths. Main links still up top.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003etightening up the spacing in the header\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMenus and Home page summary lists externalized to JSON data files\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably some kinks to work out here and there since I decided to cut the cord on the redesign abruptly, but should be nothing we can\u0026rsquo;t fix as needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs is tradition for \u003ca href=\"/tags/changelog\"\u003echangelog\u003c/a\u003e posts, I\u0026rsquo;m attaching a screenshot of the new design here.

That was working fine for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen recently I decided to play around with having \u003ca href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\"\u003eCloudflare\u003c/a\u003e in front of my site (might be helpful on the off-chance I ever manage to go viral somehow). Not yet sure whether Cloudflare was a good idea, but apparently it doesn\u0026rsquo;t play well with Tumblr\u0026rsquo;s custom domains, so the above custom tumblr URL got turned off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I don\u0026rsquo;t actually care about the tumblr blog anymore and have no intention of updating it further. All the content from that blog has already been \u003ca href=\"/source/tumblr\"\u003eimported into this site\u003c/a\u003e anyway. But those imported posts still have a link pointing back to the original URL.

It would be super straightforward since it\u0026rsquo;s just file updates. But other sources out in the wild may be pointing back to the original URL, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to give them link rot either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to figure out a solution with the Tumblr and Cloudflare DNS settings for around ten minutes before saying \u0026ldquo;screw it\u0026rdquo; and set up a redirector from \u003ca href=\"https://tumblr.roytang.net\"\u003etumblr.roytang.net\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"roytang.tumblr.com\"\u003eroytang.tumblr.com\u003c/a\u003e, which is where the tumblr blog now lives.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI watched a little bit of the Senate hearing yesterday on the ABS-CBN franchise renewal issues. One of the senators, a known lackey of the president claimed that while the president was not vindictive, \u0026ldquo;kung masama ka sa kanya, masama din sya sa yo\u0026rdquo; (I\u0026rsquo;m not sure the senator understood what vindictive means). One of the ABS head honchos later made a statement that they were \u0026ldquo;sorry if they had offended the president\u0026rdquo; even though they were just following all the relevant laws, or something to that effect. I cringed. Why do they need to apologize to an onion-skinned politician if they did nothing wrong? The whole thing had the air of \u0026ldquo;you have displeased your betters, repent and you may be forgiven.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed ironic that all this was being done on the eve of the anniversary of the so-called People Power EDSA Revolution of 1986. Not just the sheer audacity to target the free press for suppression (it\u0026rsquo;s all about sending a message), but to do it with so obvious personal vindictiveness. It reminds me of the \u003ca href=\"/2019/02/edsa/\"\u003efailed promise of EDSA\u003c/a\u003e, specifically our failure to remove this culture of patronage that burdens us so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatronage defines this administration, this is obvious from the fact that we have a senator openly proclaiming his allegiance to the president above all things. People unfriendly or critical of this administration are accused of crimes or are removed from office through legal gymnastics. Favored sycophants are elected to prime government positions. Friends who steal from the people or get midnight deals get off scot-free. The administration turns a blind eye to encroachments on our sovereignty when they come from a country that is \u0026ldquo;friendly\u0026rdquo; with the president, but takes it as an insult when a long-time ally tries to get us to respect human rights. A long-standing defense pact is abrogated because a loyal lapdog was denied a visa. And of course, mass media companies are pressured when they refuse to recognize the emperor\u0026rsquo;s new clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis administration has brought patronage to shameless heights, but it\u0026rsquo;s hardly unique to them. It is a general malaise of the Filipino culture for as long as I can remember. People don\u0026rsquo;t respect institutions or processes or merit, they look for patrons or connections to get ahead of others. Arcane and obtuse bureaucratic processes don\u0026rsquo;t help, they encourage the emergence of fixers and facilitators. Even among private industries, there are those where you can\u0026rsquo;t get hired or get promoted unless you know someone higher-up who can support or endorse you. People in power routinely ignore laws. Sometime ago a congressman even had the gall to ask to be exempted from traffic rules because they were \u0026ldquo;doing important work\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a harsh truth, but it can be difficult to blame the Filipino people. This is what they see in their everyday lives: people getting ahead in life through \u0026ldquo;diskarte\u0026rdquo; or connections or patronage. They vote for the politicians who bring them the most personal benefit, without any regard to whether they are good for the system or the collective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis culture of patronage is one of the reasons why there is so much \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_distance\"\u003epower distance\u003c/a\u003e in \u003ca href=\"https://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/797-pnoy-and-the-power-distance-index\"\u003ethis country\u003c/a\u003e. People are beholden to those in power in our feudalistic, patron-driven society. Many would prefer not to speak up or question those in power, knowing that their fortunes may depend on keeping a good relationship with their \u0026ldquo;betters\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSide note: this is one of the reasons why I like working in tech. In tech companies, connections or influence can only get you so far, if you are bad at your job, it is going to show. One of my chat groups had a discussion about moving from a tech company to a nontech company like in the mass media or banking sectors, one of the tips was to be prepared for a lot more \u0026ldquo;politics\u0026rdquo;. A polite term for people getting ahead (or trying to) by using connections or influence. I have better things to do than trying to navigate political relationships or arcane company policies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday is the anniversary of the EDSA \u0026ldquo;revolution\u0026rdquo;. Except it wasn\u0026rsquo;t really a revolution, more of a revolt. We replaced the top leadership but not the culture that brought us down that path. And here we are still electing the same kind of leaders after all this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe need a different kind of revolution. The term \u0026ldquo;cultural revolution\u0026rdquo; is heavily loaded because of China, but that\u0026rsquo;s the kind of revolution we need right now - one that changes the culture in our country, one that strengthens institutions and promotes honesty, integrity and transparency, one where people are treated equally regardless of power or position. We need to be a country where the politicians serve the people, not the other way around, that is what \u0026ldquo;people power\u0026rdquo; should really mean.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThe week went by quickly for me for some reason. I suppose it was mainly because I actually did some paid work this week (just some planning and technical review for a future project) and that I had multiple events to attend (two quiz nights and there two birthdays in the family).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat and maybe doing the \u003cstrong\u003eTales of Berseria\u003c/strong\u003e platinum stuff might be taking up a lot of my time. One would think the plat grinding would be tedious, but I kinda enjoy ToB\u0026rsquo;s battle system, so it\u0026rsquo;s not so bad. I was even inspired to check out my old Tales of Hearts R save and see if I could plat that too. Then also checked Xillia and Graces. Lol, if I went back and platinumed all the Tales games I might never have time for any other games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth quiz nights were a wash however. I was pretty confident in our team for the Geekfight league game, but the competition was fierce and we didn\u0026rsquo;t end up placing, though we retained the tie for league first place. The other one was a love-song themed quiz in Quezon City. I suspected I would be next to useless for this one, but attended anyway to support and encourage more North-side quizzes. We ended losing a tiebreak question that would have gotten us third place, and had to settle for a mediocre fourth. Which was actually pretty amazing considering we had one round with only a single point!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhat related: I spent some nontrivial amount of time over the past two weeks rewatching all of Rick and Morty, since that was one of the topics for the Geekfight league game. I also write like 8 pages of a Google doc worth of notes on trivia for each episode. The review was pretty useful, since I ended up answering 9 out of 10 questions correctly (the only miss being a non-episode related question), but I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m doing that again. I was reminded however of how useful actual note-taking is for study, since the physical act of note taking reinforces the memory muscles somehow. I\u0026rsquo;m sure the retention would have been much stronger if I had done it by hand instead of digital (though my wrists might kill me). TLDR: Note-taking super useful, but probably not worth it just for a quiz. On the upside, I did enjoy the R\u0026amp;M rewatch. I might post my notes sometime this week as a blog post too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill doing some minor coding work on my personal projects throughout the week. Mostly QoL stuff, no big fixes/changes/features yet. I should block out some time to work on those.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSite changes this week:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esuper minor QoL fixes\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eredesign still pending\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis week I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esite: continue the redesign things\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eside project: work on some QoL improvements\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003estill haven\u0026rsquo;t watched Birds of Prey, might be running out of time.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIn 2010 I took a short work hiatus which meant I was often home for most of the day. Back then Netflix wasn\u0026rsquo;t really a thing, so I would often have local cable TV playing in the background of whatever I was doing. And it was because of this that I started regularly watching police procedurals. They\u0026rsquo;re not the cleverest or most highbrow of shows, but they\u0026rsquo;re more like a guilty pleasure. Most of it was \u003cstrong\u003eNCIS\u003c/strong\u003e, which the cable channels loved showing for some reason, but during that time I also picked up other shows like the quirky \u003cstrong\u003eBones\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eCastle\u003c/strong\u003e. But the best of these shows by far, was \u003cstrong\u003eCriminal Minds\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCriminal Minds, or CM for short (as the very small group of office friends who also enjoyed the show called it), was a cut above the rest for a number of reasons:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea strong, solid cast of interesting characters, my favorite was the \u0026ldquo;nerd\u0026rdquo; of the group, Dr. Spencer Reid, played by Matthew Gray Gubler\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eit\u0026rsquo;s serious stuff, the crimes in investigation almost always being of the serial killer variety; the other shows often sprinkled some light comedic moments across the episodes, such a thing was rare in CM, especially considering the subject matter they dealt with. What other shows would have as special season finale villains would be mere unsubs-of-the-week for the CM team\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea focus on behavioral science and profiling in order to catch their unsubs. While I did read somewhere a while back that profiling isn\u0026rsquo;t held in as high regard nor considered as scientifically rigorous as the show makes it out to be, it\u0026rsquo;s still a reasonably good conceit for a TV show, and the framework helps the show establish villains with understandable motivations\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethese shows tended to have the trope of having an \u0026ldquo;ridiculously powerful tech guy\u0026rdquo; providing support for the team. The most egregious of these is NCIS\u0026rsquo; Abby, who is somehow able to do anything with a computer while at the same time being a top of the line forensic scientist. (NCIS is also famous for idiotic tech scenes that work nothing like IRL, such as the famous one where \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8qgehH3kEQ\"\u003ethey have 2 people working one keyboard trying to stop a hacker\u003c/a\u003e). The best one is CM\u0026rsquo;s Penelope Garcia; like most such characters she can do basically anything with a computer, but this is a lot more believable than the rest because she is a complete nerd who was access to all the FBI databases. (Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, you definitely still have to suspend your disbelief a lot of times!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, I\u0026rsquo;m writing about this show because their series finale ended this week, after 15 seasons. I started watching this show around the 3rd or 4th seasons (after Mandy Patinkin\u0026rsquo;s Jason Gideon had already left), and never stopped. (I later borrowed some DVDs from one of the office friends to back-watch the first few seasons). The series finale was reasonable, not the best I could have imagined (more on that later), and centered mostly around Reid and Garcia, appropriate since they were the only characters who had managed to stick around from season 1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe recurring villain for the final season was one carried over from season 14, and was kind of a disappointment. He was kind of hyped up to be a really big threat, the FBI\u0026rsquo;s Most Wanted, but he went out in just the most ridiculous way to somehow justify a spectacle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had the perfect idea a while back for how this show would end: it would involve Aaron Hotchner. He was one of the original CM FBI team members and head of the BAU (Behavioral Analysis Unit) from the time Mandy Patinkin left until he was written off the show in 2016 due to the actor Thomas Gibson having an altercation with someone from the crew. Because of the way he left, this suggestion would never have been viable, but I would have wanted Hotch to be the series\u0026rsquo; final unsub, finally breaking down after one last horrible event that forces him to relive all the trauma from all the previous seasons. And he would be the BAU\u0026rsquo;s greatest nemesis - someone who knows how they work and operate, who can counter all their moves and even use their profiling against them. In my head, it would have been glorious. Alas, it was not to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCM is actually the last of the police procedurals I was still watching. Others that I liked because of their quirkiness, such as Castle and Bones, had ended years ago.So it\u0026rsquo;s kind of an end of an era for me, not just the era of Criminal Minds, but the era of watching police procedurals in general. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot more stuff to watch now, so I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;d ever pick up such a show again. I did enjoy the show a lot during the course of the last ten years, despite the heavy subject matter, so I look back at it fondly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the last time, wheels down.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI found this great article the other week about \u003ca href=\"https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/\"\u003eWhy You Should Start A Blog Right Now\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole thing is absolutely worth a read, but my favorite part is at the start where he enumerates a list of reasons why he wrote particular posts, and it sent me down a rabbit hole again of evaluating why I write on this blog, and whether it was an endeavor worth continuing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresumably, having a blog has a lot of possible benefits, but the one important for me personally are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eit helps me clarify step through my own thoughts and understand my own thinking\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eit serves as an archive of my state of mind at the time\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eit helps me improve my own writing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresumably, you can also use a blog to advance your career, build a brand/reputation, finding an audience, etc. And those are fine, but for me they are only incidentals, nice-to-haves. Fundamentally, I still always write for myself first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf that\u0026rsquo;s the case, I said to myself, why write in public at all? If those three reasons are the most important, then something like \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/private-writing/\"\u003eprivate writing\u003c/a\u003e should already suffice. I even asked my self the very same question back in 2005 at the end of \u003ca href=\"/2005/11/why-do-i-blog/\"\u003ethis post\u003c/a\u003e, and at that time I had no answer. Today I do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI write in public because we as humans have so much in common, even if we aren\u0026rsquo;t aware of it. And while writing down one\u0026rsquo;s own thoughts or opinions or everyday happenings may seem like it would be entirely uninteresting to the average reader, there will always be some aspect of your stories that will resonate with someone else, somewhere, because of that shared human experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days, everyone can have a platform for writing, whether it\u0026rsquo;s in one of the social media silos or your own site like this one, so the whole \u0026ldquo;writing in public\u0026rdquo; thing isn\u0026rsquo;t so novel anymore. But even in this age, not everyone chooses to participate in social media, not everyone tweets or posts all the time, and that\u0026rsquo;s fine. I can accept that writing in public isn\u0026rsquo;t for everyone. But to have that voice, that ability to express yourself and share your human experience with others, to have stories to share and advice to dispense and objections to raise - to have it and not to exercise it in a meaningful way? For me that seems a waste. And so I write.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, I actually haven\u0026rsquo;t been writing much the past couple of weeks, aside from the \u003ca href=\"/tags/weeknotes\"\u003eweeknotes\u003c/a\u003e. I pumped out a couple of longish and in my mind pretty good posts early in the month (\u003ca href=\"/2020/02/old-web/\"\u003eTales of the Old Web\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"/2020/02/burnout/\"\u003eBurnout\u003c/a\u003e), but after that I found myself struggling to put some new ones together. Somehow in my mind I became trapped in the idea that I needed to have these long, profound, well-researched essays as posts. Browsing blogs like Alexey Guzey\u0026rsquo;s (author of the post linked at the start of this one) certainly hasn\u0026rsquo;t helped - on his \u003ca href=\"https://guzey.com/notes/\"\u003enotes page\u003c/a\u003e he mentions that some of his better posts take upwards of 100+ hours to write.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I kind of fell into the \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/comparison-is-the-thief-of-joy/\"\u003etrap of comparison\u003c/a\u003e and wanted to be writing thesis papers? Except that\u0026rsquo;s not really my style. I can probably churn out some longer pieces if they\u0026rsquo;ve been formulating in my head for a while, but for the most part, my regular blogging consists of thoughts-in-the-moment, a snapshot of where my thinking is at that time, to be built upon and to be evolved later on. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s fine, I think everyone has their own unique writing/blogging style and voice that they need to develop to see what works best for them. Maybe as time goes on, I will tend more towards longer-form posts, but for now I have to listen to my own advice and remember that \u003ca href=\"/2019/01/not-all-posts-have-to-be-profound/\"\u003enot all posts have to be profound\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the past few years or so, and especially since I got interested in this \u003ca href=\"/2019/11/indieweb/\"\u003eIndieweb stuff\u003c/a\u003e I\u0026rsquo;ve also been more on the lookout for interesting blogs to read. Personal blogs, none of that \u0026ldquo;professional blogger\u0026rdquo; crap. There\u0026rsquo;s still a lot of interesting sites out there, a lot of them long-running ones even. With the rise of social media silos, having personal websites and blogs hasn\u0026rsquo;t really gotten mainstream attention, but there\u0026rsquo;s still plenty of people writing out there. I think I\u0026rsquo;ve added more blogs to my RSS reader over the past 12 months than I have over the preceding 5ish years or so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt saddens me a bit that among people of my cohort I am one among very few who are (still) actively blogging. I have a large folder of RSS feeds named \u0026ldquo;people I know\u0026rdquo;, many of them have tried blogging at some point or another, and all of those links are inactive or even inaccessible. Friends: please write more! You can revive your old sites if you like, you don\u0026rsquo;t even have to explain!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still have a bunch of reorganizing my RSS feeds to do, but I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to put enough feeds into a folder called \u0026ldquo;blogroll\u0026rdquo; that seems suitable for sharing, so I created a new \u003ca href=\"/page/blogroll\"\u003eBlogroll page\u003c/a\u003e where you can see some of the blogs I follow. Very few of these are people I know IRL, mostly I just stumbled upon their blogs via some method or other. Many of them are tech-related though not all of them are. All are reasonably active. I thought about tagging or categorizing them somehow, but it\u0026rsquo;s rude to put people into boxes, so maybe it\u0026rsquo;s rude to do that for their websites too, just let people be people and let blogs be blogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to maintain an older blogroll back in the day, but it seems that has already been lost to the dustbin of history, so this one is brand new and built from scratch. (If I find the older one, I might put it on that page too as a record of history.) As with many other things on the site, the blogroll is perpetually under renovation, so if you find (or have) a personal blog that you think I might find interesting, feel free to tell me about it and maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll add it there!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Technical note: The blogroll listing is automatically imported from a JSON-formatted OPML file. I got the idea from \u003ca href=\"https://jlelse.blog/dev/auto-blogroll-hugo/\"\u003ethis post by jlelse\u003c/a\u003e, and coincidentally he is also on the blogroll.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: I\u0026rsquo;m having trouble writing long-form posts recently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso me: Hey, I wrote a thousand words on blogging without thinking about it!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

To get to the venue, I found myself walking through the old neighborhood again, the one where I grew up. It\u0026rsquo;s been a while since \u003ca href=\"/2013/02/unscheduled-trip-down-memory-lane/\"\u003ethe last time\u003c/a\u003e. Unlike last time where I only had a quick unscheduled glance, this time I went out of my way to walk down a few streets in the area, since I had the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe streets I walked were narrower and shorter than I remember - I guess in my head I still see them through a ten-year-old\u0026rsquo;s eyes. I recognize many of the houses I walk past, neighbors we never really knew. But I recognized their plants! One house still had a lot of greenery adorning their facade, same as I remember it. In the last post I wrote that our old lot had been replaced by three townhouses, but this time when I passed by I saw there were four identical ones side-by-side, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell which three replaced my grandmother\u0026rsquo;s house. Was the fourth one added later, or did I simply miss it the last time I was here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was also a KFC now along Anonas, to my left as I emerged from our old street. That used to be some kind of car repair complex, I think? Memories are hazy. I think to myself: \u0026ldquo;there should be a Google Maps version of the Wayback Machine, showing us what the streets looked like some time ago, for nostalgia\u0026rsquo;s sake.\u0026rdquo; I continue walking and take a break at a 7-11 across the street from \u003ca href=\"/2020/02/1228281070300299264/\"\u003ethe old bakery\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(As for the quiz, we won handily, though I suggested that dominating so much might discourage future quizzes in the same area. Eh, whatever.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/lists/2020/movies/\"\u003eThree movies watched this week\u003c/a\u003e, all of them very good. Aside from that, I\u0026rsquo;ve also been rewatching all of Rick and Morty. It\u0026rsquo;s a fun rewatch, but I\u0026rsquo;m mostly doing it because it\u0026rsquo;s a topic for a quiz next week, and it can be a very challenging show for that purpose, because most episodes are filled wall-to-wall with zany antics, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to tell what needs to be remembered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finished \u003cstrong\u003eTales of Berseria\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"/2020/02/1228114501179977730/\"\u003elast Friday\u003c/a\u003e! Well, the main story at least. I plan to still go for the platinum, though that\u0026rsquo;ll probably take quite a bit longer. So the blog post/review will have to wait a bit. I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m already way over the typical hours for the first run though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had one of my regular checkups this week. Bloodwork all came back good, but the annoying thing was mild coughs/cold I was experiencing since the start of the week. Probably exacerbated by the cold nights. Now is not a good time to be remotely Chinese looking and coughing/sneezing in public! My doctor prescribed a bunch of things, including some nasal spray and a pill I have to dissolve in a glass of water. Hopefully they help; the cold seems to have receded by now, but I still have the coughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSite changes this week:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003enot much in terms of blog posts last week. I did have some things in mind, just not the time or energy to sit down and fire one out\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edid some work on the import backend for tweets, pockets links, etc. Mostly a revamp needed for future enhancements that I want. Fixed some bugs. Imported links from pocket are automatically shared to Mastodon now.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003estarted work on the planned redesign. Lots of things to think about re: layouts and I\u0026rsquo;ll probably be trying out some CSS things. Referencing a number of blogs whose layout I like. I don\u0026rsquo;t wanna rush it, so it may take a while. I previously said it would be limited to the home page, but looks like scope is creeping up!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis week I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI have some actual work lined up.
