Historically, those who have made it into the Senate did so mostly on name recognition. What does it matter if Diokno had the best resume of all the candidates, if many of the voters did not know who he was? How could he compete against someone who appeared on a hit primetime TV series right up until the start of the campaign period?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes I think, things were simpler before we were woke. For me, at least. When I was younger I didn\u0026rsquo;t care much about politics. Oh of course like everybody, I got riled up about Estrada\u0026rsquo;s impeachment trial and \u003ca href=\"/2005/07/gloriagate-now-is-not-the-time/\"\u003eGloria\u0026rsquo;s election scandals\u003c/a\u003e, but back then I didn\u0026rsquo;t have much awareness on who the senators were, what party they were aligned with, who were the senate president or the speaker of the house, etc. Not in-depth as I\u0026rsquo;ve done during the more recent elections. Even back then there was a general sense of how dirty the elections and our politicians were, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t have much outrage in me then. Not yet at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I started \u003ca href=\"/2004/05/halalan-2004/\"\u003ecasting my vote in 2004\u003c/a\u003e, I certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t legal for the prior elections in \u0026lsquo;98 and I don\u0026rsquo;t remember voting in the midterms in \u0026lsquo;01. At first I was like \u0026ldquo;Okay, I cast my vote, that\u0026rsquo;s my civic duty, yay\u0026rdquo; and was done with it, but as time went by awareness started to grow. As the PH internet has matured, information about the candidates became more easily available, and with that came the eventual and repeated disappointment with who our electorate actually gave the victories to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCut to today, and the vicious cycle repeats. Disheartening results that make no rational sense whatsoever. As if elections were ever decided rationally. And so it goes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany are being down on those who express an intention to migrate because of their disappointment. I can\u0026rsquo;t blame those who feel this way. It would be better to stay and fight the good fight of course, but it\u0026rsquo;s never that easy. People can get tired of politics, and I know that\u0026rsquo;s what certain parties would want - to beat us into submission by bludgeoning us with these terrible politicians and their dirty ways - but let people be tired and let people express their frustrations, it\u0026rsquo;s healthier that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes I\u0026rsquo;m envious of those who chose to stay \u0026ldquo;unwoke\u0026rdquo;, that is, unconcerned with modern-day political issues, and just stick to living their daily lives. Like I said, times were simpler then. You only worried about your own problems. You shook your fist at the taxman and the shitty government service but at the end of the day did nothing about it. It\u0026rsquo;s selfish, but it can be understandable. Life is not always easy, and not all are accorded the privilege of worrying about things greater than themselves. All the more reason for us who have that privilege to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am tempted to just step back from it all, back to those simpler times. I\u0026rsquo;ve spent too much energy worrying about this country, let others take over now. I won\u0026rsquo;t be personally affected too much - I\u0026rsquo;m not likely to be killed in a drug bust, I\u0026rsquo;m not one of the poor that his cronies can bully around, I don\u0026rsquo;t lose anything if they let China take our islands, I can survive any economic fallout (probably), I have enough sources of real information even if they choke the press, I have the option of migrating if things get too bad, etc. There is a part of me that is just like \u0026ldquo;bahala na kayo diyan, just let me watch my movies and play my video games in peace!\u0026rdquo; But who am I kidding? The odds that I can stay out of it for long are low, but perhaps a short respite is in order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings were simpler before we were woke. Unfortunately, that\u0026rsquo;s a genie we can\u0026rsquo;t put back in the bottle. Being woke is exhausting. Rest, regroup, recover, and hopefully have the energy to come back and fight again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese rants were brought to you by the letters disappointment and frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Sounds familiar. Not only that, but you can even map the characters somewhat:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEmond Field kids -\u0026gt; Hobbits\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMoiraine -\u0026gt; Gandalf\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLan -\u0026gt; Aragorn\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThom -\u0026gt; Okay, LoTR didn\u0026rsquo;t have a bard, but he does take the role of sacrificing himself while the kids run\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s even a location called the Mountains of Dhoom, which is a riduclous name!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that\u0026rsquo;s fine. I remember back when I read this series the first time I didn\u0026rsquo;t have much patience for Jordan\u0026rsquo;s prose where he describes everything in so many words including the food being eaten, the clothes worn, the crowds, the buildings and so on; I was always hungry for the plot so I tended to skim a lot of the background noise. This time I made more of an effort to appreciate the prose and the settings, since I already knew most of the plot. It is not as boring as I feared it would be, and perhaps my imagination is more enriched because of it. The characters certainly look a bit different in my head now than they did before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, the book does take its time. After Shadar Logoth, the party gets split up and it takes them forever to be reunited. It isn\u0026rsquo;t until 85% through the book that everyone gets back together and Moiraine concludes that they have to go visit the titular Eye of the World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Nynaeve and Lan relationship wasn\u0026rsquo;t built up very well either I think. It seems they just were suddenly affectionate near the end, after barely anything more than longing looks and barely any conversations for most of the book. Also, I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to the WoT TV series if only to learn how to properly pronounce \u0026ldquo;Nynaeve\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book ends with a victory for the good guys. Not THE victory, as some of them think, but it is a victory. But it is also a strange place, as Rand discovers what he can do and decides to leave the group for a while. The next book takes them to Ilian for the Great Hunt I believe, and I seem to recall that it may be a long time before the Emond Fielders are together in the same place again. Onwards!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThe PH senatorial and local elections are on Monday. I almost didn\u0026rsquo;t want to write the usual election post, mostly because I was annoyed with and tired of the electorate and the politicians and the system and all that. But we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t give in to despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften when choosing who to vote, it will be difficult to find candidates who align perfectly with your values. You make compromises to prioritize those issues you think are more important. You settle on lesser evils to try to stave off the worse ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can be scary sometimes to make a judgment that \u0026ldquo;this candidate is great\u0026rdquo;, because you can\u0026rsquo;t really know a person right? And these candidates, you only see a sliver of their lives, what they project publicly, so it can be difficult to judge. But at least you should be openly rejecting those who are already projecting poor values: supporting murders, blind support for the administration, plunderers, criminals, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me, the most important issue facing the country right now is the need to provide a decent check and balance in the legislative branch, so for this reason, I will vote all of the Otso Diretso senatorial slate. Some of them aren\u0026rsquo;t the best choices, but the administration candidates are far worse. Even if you are not inclined to support the opposition, I strongly suggest you consider Chel Diokno. He\u0026rsquo;s the best candidate I\u0026rsquo;ve seen since the late Raul Roco. Gutoc, Alejano, and Aquino are the next best ones. Hilbay has had some flaky opinions, but he\u0026rsquo;s smart without a doubt, and a bar topnotcher. Roxas had a poor stint sa executive branch, but he was ok sa legislative. Macalintal and Tanada are the ones I have the least info about, but again, opposition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am considering leaving the remaining 4 slots open, will probably decide on election day. The pickings are slim. If only we had an option for downvotes instead, I could vote down the really bad choices like Marcos, Go, Revilla, dela Rosa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocal elections: The Quezon City mayoral choices aren\u0026rsquo;t very good. Belmonte has an air of incompetence. But her opponent Crisologo is as a friend described \u0026ldquo;an evil Ilocano warlord stuck in the 70s\u0026rdquo;, so in the choice between incompetent and evil, we have no choice but to choose incompetence. (There is a third candidate, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think he has a chance.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I will skip voting for the vice mayor and councilor slots. I have no info on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the QC sixth district, I\u0026rsquo;m lucky that our district has a liberal party incumbent who has made some house votes I agree with, so for me it\u0026rsquo;s still Kit Belmonte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParty list: Eh, IDK anymore. Maybe Akbayan or Magdalo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can see, I don\u0026rsquo;t have very strong opinions this time around, especially on the local level. I am not super optimistic about this election, as I suspect the electorate may very well disappoint me yet again. But still, duty is duty. And so we hope for the best while fearing the worst.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eSince I was going to be taking a long trip in a month, I was looking for some books to read on the plane and in airports and whatnot while waiting. I settled on a re-read of Robert Jordan\u0026rsquo;s Wheel of Time series, a pretty good time for it since by next year we may have a TV series from Amazon (hopefully better than Game of Thrones). Side note: Wheel of Time is also why I\u0026rsquo;m not optimistic that GRRM can finish ASoIaF in just two more books - Jordan took forever and died before he could finish WoT and even Sanderson who took over needed an additional three books to finish the saga.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s been a while since I read any of the books - I bought and read the final book \u003cem\u003eA Memory of Light\u003c/em\u003e when it came out, so that was around 2013. That means I followed the series for around two decades - I remember borrowing \u003cem\u003eEye of the World\u003c/em\u003e from a friend maybe around late high school/early college (circa mid 90s) and quickly going through the books until I was caught up. Wheel of Time was my first real epic fantasy series - I only read Tolkien later on and before that most of my fantasy exposure was limited to TV and movies. I enjoyed the first half of the 14-book series, then got \u003ca href=\"/2005/05/wheel-of-time-10-crossroads-of-twilight/\"\u003eannoyed by the pacing in the second half\u003c/a\u003e, and was relieved when Sanderson managed to satisfactorily land the plane with \u003ca href=\"https://tumblr.roytang.net/post/41200573244/so-i-finished-reading-a-memory-of-light-today\"\u003eMemory of Light\u003c/a\u003e. My annoyance with the later books may have been due to the fact that I had to wait for each one in turn to be released - it will be interesting to see how the series holds up for me now that I can read all the books in succession. I also like to think I\u0026rsquo;ve matured as a reader since then and will be able to appreciate the books differently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m also well behind my book reading target for this year, so doing a re-read of a long series gives me a good bump. Also, since the books have been out forever, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to bother to mark spoilers when I\u0026rsquo;m discussing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am however starting with a book I haven\u0026rsquo;t read yet - \u003cem\u003eNew Spring\u003c/em\u003e is a prequel novel that I never bothered to read before. The story takes place 20 years before \u003cem\u003eEye of the World\u003c/em\u003e, so it\u0026rsquo;s a good starting point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story follows the PoV of two characters introduced in \u003cem\u003eEye of the World\u003c/em\u003e - Moiraine Damodred, starting out as an Accepted with future Amyrlin Siuan Sanche at the White Tower in Tar Valon, and Lan Mandragoran, fresh off the tail end of the Aiel War and how their paths eventually intersect. Given the two main characters future, we can anticipate that the novel will end with them forming the Warder bond. The book is short - about half as long as \u003cem\u003eEye of the World\u003c/em\u003e - but as is typical of Robert Jordan, it takes a long time to get there, as most of the first half of the book centers around Moiraine and Siuan navigating the intrigues of the White Tower as the search for The Dragon Reborn begins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pace picks up a bit once Moiraine manages to leave the tower and crosses path with Lan and they realize the existence of the Black Ajah searching for the Dragon Reborn. Yes, reading this book before the rest means you are already aware the Black Ajah exists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven how at the start of this book Lan is openly disdainful of getting caught in Aes Sedai problems and how tight Moiraine and Lan are by the time of \u003cem\u003eEye of the World\u003c/em\u003e, I assumed there would be some big life-changing event near the end of the book that would cause him to change his mind and allow the Warder bond, but I was a bit whelmed by how it happened. One would think losing his oldest bondsman to the Black Ajah would Lan more wary of Aes Sedai, but all it took was a quick reminder from Moiraine about the stakes and he easily acquiesed to the bond. Oh well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finished the book in 3 days (as I said, quite short), but the other books in the series are at least twice as long, and there are 14 more books to go, so I think there should be plently leftover by the time the trip rolls around.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

When you have been reading (and speaking) English so much from an early age, you come to have an instinctive grasp of what is and what is not proper sentence construction. Some sentences just look right and some just look wrong. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying I have perfect mastery of the English language or anything. But I am for the most part capable of proper sentence construction. I like to think that being a programmer (or at least, a good programmer) correlates with a tendency towards good grammar as well, given how the syntax rules of programming languages are even stricter than the rules of English grammar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to be pretty anal about it too. I would correct most people given any opportunity, especially online in forums and social media and what not. These days I\u0026rsquo;m less inclined to do so, at least for strangers on the internet whose first language may or may not be English, unless the grammar is especially atrocious or the poster was asking for it in some way. I guess the advice in the following tweet mostly applies for me these days:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHere\u0026#39;s what I was taught about manners: Correcting someone\u0026#39;s \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/grammar?src=hash\u0026amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003e#grammar\u003c/a\u003e in public is rude.

Speaking good English is often seen as a sign of privilege. I imagine even foreigners make some judgments based on how good your English is; I imagine that my \u003ca href=\"/2019/04/i-got-a-us-visa/\"\u003eUS Visa interview\u003c/a\u003e might have been a bit more difficult if I wasn\u0026rsquo;t fluent. That being said, it may be a thing that\u0026rsquo;s on the downturn, given the recent rise of anti-intellectualism locally (or is it really recent?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will still often correct friends and family though. The people who know me well know that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t signify any ill will or malice on my part, just a lingering obsessive desire for correct grammar. It\u0026rsquo;s the same way a slightly misaligned painting hanging from the wall would bother other people (okay, that would bother me too).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion: I had to review this post a few times to make sure I made no grammatical errors, that would be embarrassing.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

This is not entirely inaccurate, though I prefer not to tinker with real world stuff because of my poor dexterity. My tinkering is usually limited to software and tech devices. I\u0026rsquo;m always willing to try different things to figure out how to get software to work. I guess this contributes to my aptitude for software development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was thinking about this because there\u0026rsquo;s some contrast when I\u0026rsquo;m working with non-technical people who easily get frustrated with why things don\u0026rsquo;t work. They often won\u0026rsquo;t even try simple things like restarting something or pushing buttons to see what happens. I guess there is some level of fear or intimidation involved, they are worried that if they try things they don\u0026rsquo;t understand they might break something. While that\u0026rsquo;s a concern, modern tech is a lot more resilient and uh, well, shall we say \u0026ldquo;idiot proof\u0026rdquo; than back in the old days, but I guess that\u0026rsquo;s difficult to communicate to someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a technical background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally though, with the modern internet giving video tutorials for most anything, there is little reason to not be a tinkerer these days, but I guess if you didn\u0026rsquo;t grow up with that mentality it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to adjust especially when you\u0026rsquo;re older. For younger people who grew up on the internet just trying to push whatever buttons until you figure out what you want seems to come naturally with the usage of tablets and smartphones and such. My nieces certainly handle modern technology a lot better than their grandparents do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world needs more tinkerers and technical people anyway, and maybe a tad less of people like salesmen, marketers and propagandists.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Sometimes they follow me back for one reason or another, and it gives me a little bit of anxiety. The anxiety is because here is this person whose content I like, who followed me back probably because of an interaction we had, and she is expecting that my tweets will be more of the same kind of content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut often it\u0026rsquo;s not. I don\u0026rsquo;t write about the same kind of thing all the time - one only needs to look at this blog to see that. I write on a variety of topics that interest me, from \u003ca href=\"/tags/software-development/\"\u003estuff I learn working as a software developer\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"/tags/movies/\"\u003emovies\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"/tags/games/\"\u003egames\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"/tags/tv/\"\u003etv shows\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"/tags/philippines/\"\u003ethings that are going on in my country\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"/tags/quotes/\"\u003equotes I like\u003c/a\u003e and all other kinds of stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a while I considered that blogging might be more effective if I had a more focused blog, instead of this chaotic willy-nilly mess I\u0026rsquo;ve refused to give up on since 2002. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried starting topic-centered blogs before, about stuff like \u003ca href=\"/tags/magic-the-gathering/\"\u003eMagic the Gathering\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"/tags/comics/\"\u003ecomic books\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"/tags/royondjango/\"\u003esoftware development using Django\u003c/a\u003e, but most of those efforts collpased and I just absorbed the contents back into this blog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think having a focused blog depends really on your goals. Like, if your goal is to have a blog with a lot of followers and to grow your audience and to monetize through ads or newsletters or other methods, then focused, specific content is the way to go. But for me and this blog, as I like to remind myself, I\u0026rsquo;m writing largely for myself. This blog and this website are my presence on the internet, more than any social media account. Thus, it should reflect all my interests in totality, not just the ones that I can monetize or get me more work or whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m reminded of how sometimes on Twitter famous people like tech personalities will comment on something like politics and they\u0026rsquo;ll get people who are disagreeable and go \u0026ldquo;I follow you for your tech content, please keep your politics out of this\u0026rdquo;, which is ridiculous. Just because a person is primarily known for a certain thing doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean their opinions and personalities can be limited to that thing only and for all time. People are multi-faceted, they have many views and many interests and they should be allowed to express themselves on whatever topic they like (within reasonable limits obviously no to hate speech thanks.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a barely related blog note: something I\u0026rsquo;ve been putting off for a while, I merged categories and tags on this blog. It just seems to make more sense. I probably broke some links somewhere though, I\u0026rsquo;ll figure it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
