If you\u0026rsquo;ve never seen samples of wacky Japanese TV before, \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshi%27s_Castle\"\u003eTakeshi\u0026rsquo;s Castle\u003c/a\u003e is a good start. This wacky Japanese show throws a bunch of a hundred or so contestants into a series of ridiculous games, each one hoping to make it to the end to defeat Count Takeshi and win one million yen!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTakeshi\u0026rsquo;s Castle had a Philippine run, hosted by local actors Anjo Yllana and Smokey Manaloto. Although shown on a less popular channel, the show\u0026rsquo;s hilarious antics and ridiculous games earned it a cult following. The games themselves are sheer madness, requiring mostly luck, agility and a whole lot of guts in order to win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost games usually pit you against Count Takeshi\u0026rsquo;s henchmen. The guards hunt you down in the Honeycomb Maze, shoot cannon balls at you in Bridge Ball and roll giant rocks at you in Avalanche. Several games feature the contestants being stuffed into ridiculously large suits that impair movement. The best games are those that run on pure guts, such as the ever-favorite Skipping Stones, where you must quickly jump across rocks to cross a river — but some of the rocks are fake! If you have nerves of steel, just blaze ahead, jumping from rock to rock, don\u0026rsquo;t care if the one you\u0026rsquo;re stepping on starts to sink!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy single most favorite game is \u0026ldquo;Knock Knock\u0026rdquo;, where a contestant is faced with four walls, each with four doors. Three of the doors on each wall are paper\u0026hellip; but one is boarded up with wood from behind. The contestant doesn\u0026rsquo;t know which is which, but he must choose a door at each wall and charge through in whatever way he can, usually throwing all of his weight into the attempt \u0026ndash; with horrible results if you choose the wrong door. It\u0026rsquo;s cruel and it\u0026rsquo;s mindless, but you find yourself laughing out loud whenever a particularly enthusiastic contestant slams helmet first into the door. It\u0026rsquo;s all about guts baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swear, I wish there were some Japanese channel on cable with these types of shows. It\u0026rsquo;s the kind of mindless, addictive stuff that makes TV so dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

So, I\u0026rsquo;m all \u0026ldquo;alpha geek\u0026rdquo; and stuff, and I go: \u0026ldquo;No we can\u0026rsquo;t. We can\u0026rsquo;t style the ‘Browse\u0026rsquo; button directly, and IE will throw an Access Denied error on submit if we invoke the click() method using Javascript.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut HK guy replies: \u0026ldquo;Gee, I wonder how GMail does it then.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI checked, and he\u0026rsquo;s right. I never noticed before because I use Firefox all the time, but GMail in IE doesn\u0026rsquo;t even show the freakin\u0026rsquo; file input control! It\u0026rsquo;s just an \u0026ldquo;Attach a File\u0026rdquo; link that opens the \u0026ldquo;Open File\u0026rdquo; dialog on click! I took a look at it and I was like\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;how in the world\u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, being a developer, I of course attempt to get the source, analyze it, break it down, and get it to work for me. But from experience, I know that trying to figure out gmail\u0026rsquo;s obfuscated javascript code would take me days. So I decided to take an alternative approach: I would let gmail execute it\u0026rsquo;s weird javascript magic, then use javascript myself to extract the relevant HTML and Javascript code from the gmail window at the correct state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first attempt: I tried to load gmail in an iframe so I could read the document contents from window.top. Eh, no go. Gmail pops itself out of the frame easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy second attempt: I open gmail in a new window using javascript\u0026rsquo;s window.open, then use the resulting window variable to access the document contents.

True Rune attaching itself to your hero? Check. Only thing we need now is a permanent HQ. I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine living on a boat would be very enticing for me in real life. On a side note, this is the first Suikoden where I\u0026rsquo;m actively using an FAQ to avoid missing Stars of Destiny. It was ok not to use an FAQ before, as I always had time to make a second pass to complete the 108 stars after the first play-through. But again, I\u0026rsquo;m a busy man.

As mentioned, beholders and mind flayers are a pain, but Yoshino\u0026rsquo;s traps and summoned skellies help a lot. On a side note, I always play a female pally in D\u0026amp;D; games. This one is no different, except that I made the mistake of choosing the Cavalier kit which prevents me from using ranged weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs always, the strength of console RPGs lies in their story focus.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e(My previous practice was never to post an entry about a game until I\u0026rsquo;d finished it. This was a good idea during those days that I had a lot of free time and could finish the average RPG in a week. I haven\u0026rsquo;t been in that state for four years.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brother warned me that according to reviews, the first eight hours or so of Suikoden V were quite draggy. When I thought about it, that should be expected. I\u0026rsquo;ve played Suikoden 1-4 of course, and in all those games, a largish part of the beginning involved the setup where your young hero (or heroes as in Suikoden 3) would be thrust in the middle of a conflict that would eventually result in a quest to gather 108 Stars of Destiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m about 5 hours into Suikoden V, and I have to say: It\u0026rsquo;s draggier than usual. I think it\u0026rsquo;s because most of the first five hours are heavily scripted, mostly scenes with minor interactions designed to lay out all the backstory and history and political intrigue and whatnot. It\u0026rsquo;s been five hours, and I still have no idea what the main conflict is gonna be\u0026hellip; granted it looks like there\u0026rsquo;s gonna be some civil unrest at some point, but we have no idea yet who\u0026rsquo;s going to be on which side, etc. In Suikoden I, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure you were appointed the head of the Liberation Army long before the five-hour point! In Suikoden II, you were kicked out of your homes within two hours. In Suikoden V, it feels like five hours and four weeks of game time later, you\u0026rsquo;re still running errands to ensure your sister\u0026rsquo;s engagement to a scheming noble goes through. Hopefully it starts to pick up soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the things I noticed this time around: I don\u0026rsquo;t like that thing in console RPGs where you have to wander around town until you run into the exact area where a scene will move the story forward. It was fine in Dragon Quest VIII (the last console RPG I played), but here it\u0026rsquo;s ridiculous\u0026hellip; mostly because the cities here seem huge! Granted, I\u0026rsquo;ve only seen Sol-Falena and Stormfist, but both of those cities were large, multi-area maps. There were some sequences where you literally had to systematically traverse the whole town to find the next scene that triggers the story. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m just spoiled because I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing Baldur\u0026rsquo;s Gate 2 lately. That game has a huge city too, but you couldn\u0026rsquo;t walk half a screen through the city without some quest or event thrown at you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, yeah. They need to get to the \u0026ldquo;Okay, I got an HQ and I\u0026rsquo;m gonna collect 108 stars\u0026rdquo; point faster, that\u0026rsquo;s where all the gameplay is anyway. I think the start of the game suffers from the fact there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of back story to cover: the discord between factions in the Senate, the struggle for the throne two generations prior, the invasion from Armes eight years ago, the wrath of Arshtat two years ago, how a barbarian managed to win the Sacred Games and thus marry into the royal family, etc. I suppose that all this back story is needed *before* the meat of the game gets underway, otherwise they could have just sprinkled it in liberally through the game\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",
