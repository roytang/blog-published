Probably due to the fact that I actually went to work before going to the tournament (which meant I had a lot less sleep\u0026hellip; ), I made too many bad plays in the first two losses. There\u0026rsquo;s an \u003ca href=\"http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/academy/41\"\u003earticle today\u003c/a\u003e on magicthegathering.com about how you should avoid racing aggro and avoid taking damage as much as possible\u0026hellip; I think I basically violated every single principle in that article during those losing matches. Yes, even the lone control matchup \u0026ndash; I didn\u0026rsquo;t kill a Hellkite thinking I would just race it with Korlash, but the Bust on his turn sealed my fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe GW aggro loss hurt \u0026ndash; I lost the last game because I was at three, he had a Saffi, all I had was a 9/9 Korlash with a Temporal Isolation on it and I didn\u0026rsquo;t notice my opponent had a Vitu-ghazi and I thought I could survive one more turn with one life. If I had just taken out his Saffi with the Demonfire I had in hand instead of waiting to burn him to 0\u0026hellip; I would have drawn a House Guard next turn, transmute for Tendrils, swing with Korlash, stack damage and cast Tendrils on Korlash for an 18-point life swing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe round 6 loss really broke my spirit, I was in such a bad mental state that I played badly in the round 7 zoo matchup. Not that having perfectly tight play would have helped \u0026ndash; he had the zoo god draws both games, I was down to eight before I even had Damnation mana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLessons learned:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNever, ever try to race with damage.

I should always take out threats until I can stabilize with Tendrils.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI need to become mentally stronger, so that play mistakes from previous losses don\u0026rsquo;t affect succeeding games.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing as how the local metagame is maybe 60-70% aggro, I\u0026rsquo;ll also probably tweak the deck to make the maindeck stronger against aggro and move some of the control hate to the board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext stop: Regionals.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

My sideboard was pretty weak this time though, as I gave in to \u0026ldquo;the fear\u0026rdquo; and most of my board was dedicated hate against dragonstorm and narco-bridge combo decks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I like the deck, it\u0026rsquo;s fun, and it can occasionally come back from 18-to-1 life deficits to win the game in one turn. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably play this before regionals, but my work sched will probably prevent me from playing it in any other Saturday events until then.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I opened a card pool with no outstanding rares. The only real bomb was the red uncommon Pyrohemia. Spotting the Deep-Sea Kraken and wanting to play it, I decided to go red-blue. I tested the build for a few minutes before realizing it completely stunk and had very few creatures. I looked over the card pool and quickly realized I had overlooked some quality green fatties: Nacatl War-Pride, Durkwood Baloth, Sporesower Thallid, etc. During the last minute of deck-building, I switched to a red/green build with a rather nice curve that proved quite solid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went 5-1 in the first six rounds, always hovering near the top tables. Also took down quite a few of the top limited players in the country. Not too shabby for a deck built in under a minute! For the seventh and last round, my opponent asked for the win since I was guaranteed top eight status already. After some negotiation, he agreed to split his prizes with me after I conceded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo my finish was a respectable 5-2, but with some pretty good wins and quite a number of packs taken home. Nacatl War-Pride is quite good in sealed (dunno in draft), it\u0026rsquo;s practically a \u0026ldquo;must-kill\u0026rdquo; creature. Pyrohemia is a true bomb, as it turned the game around for me more than once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love playing Limited Magic, much more so than Constructed, despite the fact it feels more expensive (I\u0026rsquo;m still not sure whether it actually \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e more expensive) Constructed Magic is fun, but I prefer not having to worry about metagames. Coming to a tournament bringing nothing but your deckbuilding and playing skills, opening your packs, building your deck and slugging it out — there\u0026rsquo;s no better way to play Magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Sure, poor people win relatively-large cash prizes and stuff from it, but it feels so exploitative. Hundreds, maybe thousands of poor folk from god-knows-how-far-away queue up outside the studios every day hoping to get into the studio audience to participate in the cash giveaways. There are probably people that see all these \u0026ldquo;lucky\u0026rdquo; scrubs earning free cash on TV, so that instead of spending their time looking for work or ways to earn a decent, continuous income, they stand around the ABS-CBN studios day in and day out hoping to get lucky. And hope they don\u0026rsquo;t get caught in a stampede of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I wish someone would do a survey on how well the \u0026ldquo;winners\u0026rdquo; of these noontime shows (yeah, we also caught a bit of \u003cem\u003eEat Bulaga!\u003c/em\u003e) fare a few months after their windfall of cash. Methinks that giving out cash to poor families, while certainly good intent, is nowhere near enough to guarantee that they rise above their station. \u0026ldquo;Teach a man to fish\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;. Alongside their exploitative nature and promotion of cheap barbs and slapsticks, I doubt whether such shows actually have a net positive effect on society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Brian, as it were, has never been the most opinionated of my brothers. In fact, he\u0026rsquo;s more of the laid-back type, seemingly not caring about what\u0026rsquo;s going on in the world at large, so I was a bit surprised when we got into a discussion on the cheap lows that Philippine media has sunk to. Apparently he had caught a TV interview of \u0026ldquo;Mr. Shoo-Li\u0026rdquo; Jun Urbano that he really liked, where the old comedian compared the Philippines of yesterdays to our current dire straits. I was pleasantly surprised with the level of our discussion, and I said to myself: \u0026ldquo;No matter how bad things get in our country, as long as we have kids that are able to think about things like this, we\u0026rsquo;ll always have hope.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn short (and this may be obvious anyway), noontime shows are really bad and shockingly exploitative. Seriously, anyone who looks at these noontime shows with at least 1% of a critical eye would agree.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I got there before Galleria opened and whiled away time on the DS. The NG staff was a lot more efficient today, they were able to start the first 3 flights as early as 10:30. I got on flight C, and proceeded to open one of the most mediocre card pools I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen. I quickly judge that the best synergies among my cards were (a) six black removal spells and (b) I have a lot of thallid cards (gernimator, sporesower, deathspore, and the new 5cc 4/4 guy from FS). I ruled out the blue/white evasion strategy despite having a decent number of fliers, since I hate going without removal. So I assembled my no-bombs deck, of course calling it \u0026ldquo;Deathspore Thallid Go!\u0026rdquo; as my officemates would have wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won the first two rounds and was well on my way to winning round 3 when my opponent suddenly cast a Dragonstorm into Scourge of Kher Ridges in game 2, allowing him to wipe my board away. He tries the same thing in game 3, but I manage to take out the Dragon with a Tendrils and an Ichor Slick. That causes me to go into topdeck mode though, and he quickly lays down a swarm to overwhelm me. Round 4 I almost lot to a sliver deck, but it seems my opponent was not aware that Firewake Sliver gives haste\u0026hellip; he could have easily pumped his 4/4 flying Gemhide (thanks to Griffin Guide and graft) for lethal damage, but missed the chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, my finish is again 3-1, same as the PLC pre-release. My overall record for Time Spiral block is 10-2, not bad I suppose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy opinions on Future Sight? My deck was almost 80% TSP anyway, so it\u0026rsquo;s hard to say. In general red seems pretty good in the set, getting some decent burn in the form of Ghostfire. As for creatures, Gathan Raiders, as I expected, are quite good; that 1/1 that suspends itself when it dies is a bit annoying, Grandeur is useless in limited, and yes, Angel of Slavation and that Scourge of Kher Ridges are pretty much bombs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere should be one or more TSP limited events over the next two weeks\u0026hellip; I hope I can open decent cards the next time around\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I had to skip most of the fillers though to catch up. And from the pirated DVDs I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in some stores, there\u0026rsquo;s probably some other group subbing One Piece that are already at least eighty episodes ahead of KF. That being said, I think I\u0026rsquo;ll follow their pace for now, as their subbing is of really good quality. One Piece is an awesome series and continues to be entertaining. The best arc in the series so far has been the Alabasta arc, and I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to Movie 7 which supposedly covers this arc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGintama\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea new series that people at the office got to know from Jump Ultimate Stars for the NDS. It\u0026rsquo;s mostly a parody/comedic anime, often breaking the fourth wall and using a lot of puns, references, toilet humor and visual gags. There are some really funny bits that made me laugh out loud, but it\u0026rsquo;s a bit of hit-or-miss unlike, say, Excel Saga, which would have me laughing a good 70-80% of the time.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I said, uneventful.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The fifth case however is added exclusively for the DS and features additional gameplay mechanics like the ability to rotate pieces of evidence and using the DS stylus and microphone to simulate the fingerprinting process. The fifth case is also much more difficult. The first four cases are easy enough to brute-force (\u0026ldquo;trial and error\u0026rdquo;) your way through, but the fifth one is much more complicated and it had me stuck for a while since I couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out how to proceed in one of the investigative parts.

TMNT is a kids\u0026rsquo; movie right? Yeah, more or less I suppose, but all of us brothers saw the first 3 live-action Turtles movies, played the NES game with the annoying dam sequence and watched not just a few episodes of the cartoon series. Thankfully, none of us had any Turtles jammies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, yeah we saw the movie. Before I saw the trailer about a month back I actually thought it was gonna be another live-action thing. The animation is ok, the turtles look less brutish than before and it\u0026rsquo;s action-packed as expected. As expected, Leo tries hard to be a leader, Mikey provides the comedy, Raph is the serious brooding one, and Donatello provides the tech support (literally). It\u0026rsquo;s no high art, but it\u0026rsquo;s entertaining enough, but it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much the equivalent of watching a multi-part episode of the TV series. The turtles have a spat, they kick some ass, extradimensional monsters appear, the turtles kick some more ass, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear that the movie is selling quite well in the States. Not so much here though, as the theater was maybe 50% full at best, and on a Sunday afternoon at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis deck is named \u0026ldquo;Under Development\u0026rdquo; because I basically threw it together two days ago with almost no playtesting. Basically, today\u0026rsquo;s tournament was my playtesting, as I could use it to gauge whether I like the feel of the deck and I should continue using it. Also, it\u0026rsquo;s my first team playing with basic islands again in constructed since forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, as the title implies, I am teh suck. Bad plays cost me at least two matches, leading me to a terrible 1-3 finish (and the one win was a \u003cem\u003eBYE\u003c/em\u003e) My post-tournament analysis is that I am so not used to playing blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick match roundup:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1 vs Dragonstorm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally, really bad matchup. First game is practically auto-loss. Second game, I trickbind the first attempt to Storm, but the lone Hellkite is enough to stand in the way of my Solifuge, and he gets out a second one a few turns later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2 vs GW Scryb/Force\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame 1 goes fast as he mulligans down to 4. I win handily and bring in Electrolyze, Pyroclasm and Serrated Arrows for game 2. Game 2, he had like six small guys in play, I was down to 3 and had 6 mana open. My cards in hand are plaxmanta and remand. I play plaxmanta, in response, remand the plaxmanta, draw my card and show him the topdecked Pyroclasm. Too bad he folllows up with two Spectral Force over the next few turns. =/\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame 3 I lost due to a bad play on my part. My opponent was tapped out with like 5 creatures that are also tapped, and an untapped Mangara (with summoning sickness) On my side, I have a morphed Shapeshifter and morphed Brine Elemental, with Stomping Ground, Plaxmanta and Demonfire in hand. My opponent is at 18, I\u0026rsquo;m at 10. I have six lands in play, if I play the Stomping Ground and take the two life loss, I can lock him down with the Brine Elemental. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what I\u0026rsquo;m thinking however, I play the Stomping Ground tapped and Demonfire the Mangara for 1, then swing for 4.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe correct play should have been:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePlay stomping ground. lose 2 life (down to 8)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAttack with both morphs, Mangara does not block\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUnmorph Brine Elemental, opponent takes 7 and drops to 11\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOpponent\u0026rsquo;s turn: no untap phase, does nothing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMy turn: Swing with morph and Brine Elemental. Opponent attemps to take one down using Mangara. I play Plaxmanta to counter the ability. Unmorph shapeshifter and copy Brine Elemental. Opponent goes down to 6 or 1 depending opn whether Mangara blocked.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMy next turn: PS Demonfire you\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBah, I caved in to fear that time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3: A bye! I get to have a decent lunch! (At 2pm)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: Vs BW Discarder/Rack\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis guy somehow managed to draw 3 castigates in each game that he won. I won the second due to aggro, and we want to game 3. Game 3 was close, very close. During his turn, he was at 4, I was at 6, he had a Mindslicer and a Rack in play. I have no board and 2 cards in hands. He\u0026rsquo;s afraid of the Demonfire, so he plays Smallpox, saccing the Mindslicer, hoping to have us both in topdeck mode and me with no answer to the rack. I let Smallpox resolve, and respond to the Mindslicer trigger by playing Plaxmanta. Plaxmanta survives, and will swing on the next turn for 2; he\u0026rsquo;s at 3 and I\u0026rsquo;m at 5. However, it seems I have no answer to the Rack. My turn, untap, upkeep take 3 from Rack (down to 2), I draw a land and hold in my hand. I swing for 2 with the Plaxmanta, bringing him down to one. But it looks like I\u0026rsquo;m losing to the Rack. I pass the turn to see what happens. He draws an Extirpate and starts looking through my ‘yard, and I spot the bad play. I HAD A THINK TWICE!!! I could have avoided 2 points of Rack damage, enough for the Plaxmanta to seal the deal. Gah, I am teh suck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the well-deserved loss and drop from the tournament, quite tired. A really bad result for me after more than a month of cutting back on Magic tournaments, not a very good comeback. However, I think the playtesting session was a success, as I found quite a few weaknesses in the deck and also found that I like playing it, it\u0026rsquo;s quite fun. So, I will probably tweak this deck and continue to play it in Standard tournaments for the time being. I probably won\u0026rsquo;t play in Block Constructed until FS comes out, so is my deck for April.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the next part, I will pick apart the deck and see what I can improve. Stay tuned!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
