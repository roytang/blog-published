            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThe following article made the rounds recently: \u003ca href=\"https://joshcsimmons.com/2019/09/10/i-quit-social-media-for-a-year-and-nothing-magical-happened/\"\u003eI Quit Social Media for a Year and Nothing Magical Happened\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting enough not only on its own, but also for the discussion generated around any piece about qutting social media. I will admit I\u0026rsquo;ve been flirting with the idea myself, but that\u0026rsquo;s a topic for another day. Of particular interest to me at the moment is this comment about the article on \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20934675\"\u003eHacker News\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy biggest issue with social media is less that it\u0026rsquo;s distracting (IMO not necessarily an unhealthy thing) but that it has, for me, more than anything else seemed to make all aspects of my life a competition with others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Instagram, you\u0026rsquo;re competing with others on who has the happiest life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn LinkedIn, you\u0026rsquo;re competing with others on who has the steepest career trajectory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven on Twitter, perhaps more acutely in certain jobs or industries, it seems like you\u0026rsquo;re competing with other in gaining professional influence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt creates a lot of anxiety that stems from a feeling like you\u0026rsquo;re constantly on the verge of falling behind others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlenty of scholars/thinkers/philosophers have said something to the effect of focusing on just being a better version of you. Social media enables the exact opposite i.e. forcing you to constantly evaluate how you compare to others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt reminds me of my previous post \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/comparison-is-the-thief-of-joy/\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;Comparison is the Thief of Joy\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e. This kind of mindset is applicable to real life as well as social media, though I do agree that social media tends to exacerbate the problem. If you are the type of person who has this mindset, then yes it\u0026rsquo;s probably a good idea to reduce/control/filter your social media usage accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI generally don\u0026rsquo;t suffer from this problem, mainly because I outgrew comparing myself to other people a long time ago, but also because I tend to aggressively filter my social media channels so that I\u0026rsquo;m only seeing content from people that are of interest to me. I wonder sometimes about those people who whine that Twitter is so toxic or some such complaint. Don\u0026rsquo;t they know they control the kind of people who appear in their feed? Why are they following toxic people? (I understand that this may be more of a problem that is difficult to control once you get to higher follower counts, but hey that\u0026rsquo;s the price you pay I guess.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhat related: Our 25th high school reunion is coming up next year, and this early our batch has a thread about High School Reunion Anxity (HSRA). Here are some excellent words from a batchmate that I thought were good to share (removing some stuff specific to this person and the batch, since the post was to a private group. Will happily cite the original poster if she requests it):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0026rsquo;re not alone. It\u0026rsquo;s common to feel a lot of anxiety about attending a high school reunion. Our 25th at that. Kasi ohmaygad ganyan na ba tayong katanda?!\n\u0026hellip;\nThe second common barrier to attending is HSRA. Mostly because you might feel your life didn\u0026rsquo;t turn out the way you wanted and that other batchmates have done so much better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo 2a - your life didn\u0026rsquo;t turn out the way you wanted. You know what? My life didn\u0026rsquo;t turn out the way I wanted. \u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m willing to bet nobody\u0026rsquo;s life turned out exactly the way they planned. And that\u0026rsquo;s OK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2b - other batchmates have done better. OK so please for your own mental and emotional health do NOT compare other people\u0026rsquo;s external stuff (visible on Facebook, Instagram, etc) to your internal stuff. That\u0026rsquo;s illogical and bad science. Also will drive you crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI am aware of the existence of Pauper as a format in MTG, but I never paid too much attention to it before. A couple of weeks ago, a friend pointed out that I might enjoy playing the recent Jeskai Nuneca decks that had become popular recently. I checked out a sample decklist, and you bet I jumped at the chance to play Mulldrifters again lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe set about to gather the cards. Since we almost never sell cards, even draft chaff, we had most of the cards available already. The only exception was red elemental blasts/pyroblasts for the sideboard and some extra Archaemancers which we ended up getting from a shop. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have Ash Barrens (apparently a pauper staple), and didn\u0026rsquo;t want to bother looking, so I made do with extra common fetches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the pauper deck to my first event today, completely blind to what the meta was lol. I figured I\u0026rsquo;d just enjoy the event and see how the deck plays and what the meta is like.

expect, since it was pauper I expected it to play a bit more like a limited format compared to Standard or Modern. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The format is diverse with a lot of different decks and most of the matchups are highly interactive. I wish I could say I placed well too, but after a couple of good matches, I folded to some misplays. Here\u0026rsquo;s the match record:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR1 2-0 vs MonoU Faeries/Delver\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR2 2-0 vs RG Madness\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR3 1-2 vs U/B\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR4 0-2 vs Boros\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR5 0-2 vs MonoU Faeries/Delver\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made one misplay in R3 when I agreed with my opponent\u0026rsquo;s assessment that both my spellstutters would die after he disfigured them both. We later agreed that one of them should have survived and two of this spells should have been countered. I also made a mistake when I allowed my R5 opponent to Snap his own Spellstutter to counter my Preordain when I had a Standard Bearer on the board. This is a result of not playing this card since Apocalypse! Lol. A few other minor mistakes in sequencing in the other games, but nothing too major. And I needed better sideboard plans, since I almost never knew what to pull out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving forward, I might play a bit more of this format, at least it provides a fun and cheap alternative to Modern for paper Magic!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I am aware of the existence of Pauper as a format in MTG, but I never paid too much attention to it before. A couple of weeks ago, a friend pointed out that I might enjoy playing the recent Jeskai Nuneca decks that had become popular recently. I checked out a sample decklist, and you bet I jumped at the chance to play Mulldrifters again lol.\nWe set about to gather the cards.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eMagic Arena\u0026rsquo;s community was in an uproar this past weekend over the latest \u003ca href=\"https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-beta-august-29-2019\"\u003estate of the beta\u003c/a\u003e, mostly over the announced plans for Arena\u0026rsquo;s eternal Historic format that will become relevant with the coming rotation. It\u0026rsquo;s likely that Wizards will backpedal in some way in response to the community, but here are my thoughts for now:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"historic-cards-to-cost-double-wildcards-to-craft\"\u003eHistoric cards to cost double wildcards to craft\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the universally-reviled bit and has been the target of much outrage, accursing Wizards of being greedy etc. On this point I am in agreement with the community that yes, this sucks. On the other hand, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned not to be outraged by ridiculous DLC/microstransaction pricing. If something is too unaffordable, I simply won\u0026rsquo;t indulge it. If I can\u0026rsquo;t afford to craft a historic deck, I won\u0026rsquo;t play the format, until I can. More on this later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWotC\u0026rsquo;s plans for Historic looks to me like they are trying to replicate the \u0026ldquo;scarcity\u0026rdquo; inherent to paper eternal formats like Modern and Legacy. Arena is actually a bit more generous that either MTGO or HS, since both of those don\u0026rsquo;t sell boosters from older sets in their stores. WotC still plans to have Historic sets available, though only in 45-pack bundles (I don\u0026rsquo;t care about this either, as I rarely purchase packs anyway, but some people also dislike this change). The 2-for-1 crafting cost is still uniquely Arena and thus their own bad decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, digital games have to have slightly different business models than IRL counterparts. Arena is unique in this regard since it\u0026rsquo;s the only modern digital CCG that has a strong paper analogue. Trying to replicate the scarcity of paper Magic may have made sense for MTGO, since that platform allows trading and thus cashing out, but for Arena it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost likely the goal is to ensure that Standard is the main gameplay mode especially for newer players, as Standard generall drives sales. But increasing the crafting cost is unnecessary. The barrier to entry for Historic will already be pretty high for a new player anyway, even if the crafting cost was 1-to-1, since a new player will have more sets to catch up with. There is no sensible reason for doing this, as it is only setting Historic up for failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"curated-cards-to-be-periodically-added-to-historic\"\u003eCurated cards to be periodically added to Historic\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this one, the community is more split. There are those like me who consider this a good idea, as long as they are conservative with the power level of the curated cards added to historic. My personal preference is that they release cards that were pretty good in standard during their time, but haven\u0026rsquo;t really found a good place in Modern, so that they have a chance to shine. Clouding the issue is a \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/MTG_Arena/status/1167184191215165440\"\u003erecent tweet by the official twitter\u003c/a\u003e where they suggest that examples of curated cards could be Brainstorm, Firebolt, Wurmcoil Engine, and Dark Confidant, all of which are at least Modern power level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose who dislike this change seem to be mainly because they don\u0026rsquo;t want Historic to be Modern or Legacy. I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest, I would love it if I could play Modern on Arena. But technically, it\u0026rsquo;s not likely that the historic format will ever be the same as Modern (or Legacy), unless WotC goes crazy. It\u0026rsquo;s highly unlikely that they would add the Tron lands or Storm cards or Dredge cards into Historic for example. It would take a lot of cards for historic to even come close to Modern. But I understand the concern \u0026ndash; there are a lot of broken cards in Modern and Legacy, and WotC is made up of humans, so there is a nontrivial risk that they will screw up and add something ridiculous into Historic, breaking the format. The Brainstorm inclusion in the tweet linked above certainly doesn\u0026rsquo;t help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand the appeal of having an eternal format that is Arena sets only, moving forward. Some also want the previous Arena-implemented sets (Shadows over Innistrad, Kaladesh, and Amonkhet) to be included as well. Some prefer that Arena start adding sets one by one working backwards and stopping at Magic Origins. In general, these are all in the same vein. The idea generally is that more recent sets are more \u0026ldquo;balanced\u0026rdquo; in terms of power level, especially since Play Design is now a thing, thus the format will probably be healthier in generally than Modern which is a turn 4 format.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s also a secondary concern that adding curated cards so often (the initial plan is quarterly) will shake up the metagame more often and make Historic even more expensive as a format to get into, as you need to be getting new cards every so often. The assumption is that the curated cards will be high power level staples which would be necessary to participate in the format. Again, such concern could be mitigated by careful curation. If the curation is done well, each batch of new cards could introduce new strategies and make small changes to the metagame without necessarily invalidating entire decks. And again, there is a nontrivial risk of screw-ups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo assuage these concerns in general, what I would do if were WotC would be to introduce two eternal formats instead. One is just Arena eternal - all Arena sets (maybe including Amonkhet, but people don\u0026rsquo;t seem to like Kaladesh very much \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=417766\"\u003efor some reason\u003c/a\u003e), and a second one which is basically just what they\u0026rsquo;re already planning for Historic. More options is always better (although it might \u0026ldquo;confuse the new players\u0026rdquo;, whatever that means).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"managing-your-own-expectations\"\u003eManaging your own expectations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCircling back to my point earlier. If Historic is too cost prohibitive, I won\u0026rsquo;t play it, until I can. In many ways, it\u0026rsquo;s a case of managing your own expectations for an online game. I like playing Magic, and Arena lets me do that at a manageable cost (i.e. free and conveniently). The addition of the Historic format doesn\u0026rsquo;t change that. I can still play Standard regardless of whether I can afford Historic or not. Until this state of the beta, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t even thinking about what happens to my cards that are rotating out, whether I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to use them again or not. For most of those cards, I drafted them, I played with them, I used them with standard decks and I generally enjoyed my time playing Arena (Nexus of Fate notwithstanding). It helps that I am a f2p player, as all I invested was my time, and since I enjoyed my time, it was not wasted time for me no matter what happens to those cards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess it\u0026rsquo;s a different matter if you\u0026rsquo;ve been paying for the cards? IDK, I have a friend who\u0026rsquo;s bought at least a bundle every time a new set comes in, I haven\u0026rsquo;t heard any complaints from him. If you\u0026rsquo;ve invested more into this game, I get that it\u0026rsquo;s a feel bad if you can\u0026rsquo;t make the most of the game by participating in all the available modes because of cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a bit like Wild in Hearthstone. I played Hearthstone for a while before rotation became a thing, so I had a lot of cards that are now only playable in Wild. I don\u0026rsquo;t really play HS anymore, but in the short time when I was active and Wild was available, I probably played only a handful of games. And I never disenchanted all those cards, even if I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to play them much. I don\u0026rsquo;t care that they\u0026rsquo;re just sitting there not doing anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"in-conclusion\"\u003eIn conclusion\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to how WotC responds to the outrage.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It was great and it was hilarious, although you must make sure not to lose patience with the first thirty minutes. I went in blind not knowing anything about it other than \u0026ldquo;Japanese comedy zombie movie\u0026rdquo;, so you should too! Easily one of the funniest movies I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in recent years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"young-justice\"\u003eYoung Justice\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack half of Young Justice Outsiders finished this week. I\u0026rsquo;ve honestly been a bit whelmed for this half of the season as I feel like they\u0026rsquo;re all over the place and there\u0026rsquo;s too many plot threads going on at once. Still an enjoyable watch especially for DC fans of course. The thing about having such a large cast is that it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to focus on any one of them too long, but this season was all about Halo, Geoforce and Cyborg so the arc endings pretty much revolved around those three. It feels like so many status quo changes happened in the last episode though, felt a bit crammed. Also, some spoilers:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails class=\"spoiler\"\u003e\n    \u003csummary\u003e(Spoilers)\u003c/summary\u003e\n    \u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI feel like the Light declaring at the end that their gains were sufficient vs Luthor\u0026rsquo;s original plans seemed ridiculous (i.e. controlling Markovia vs controlling and registering all superhumans). They already had one puppet nation under their control (Queen Bee is right there!) and they\u0026rsquo;re literally planning to go against Darkseid, how does controlling Markovia help? Feels like a very post-facto justification.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI did like that they chose not to complete their Judas Contract re-telling in a similar manner and we get a \u0026ldquo;redeemed\u0026rdquo; Tara to contrast with the \u0026ldquo;fallen\u0026rdquo; Geoforce\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cp /\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"fleabag\"\u003eFleabag\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t know anything about this Amazon Prime series going in either, only that it was a comedy and it was well-reviewed. I did enjoy watching it, although it\u0026rsquo;s more of a tragic comedy than anything else. Basically about how people deal with absurdly difficult situations in their daily life. The story is well-told, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I get all the hype.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-boys\"\u003eThe Boys\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother Amazon Prime series. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t read the source material, and I was a bit turned off by the first episode, but I powered through. I knew it would be dark going in, and possibly gratuitous in terms of the sex and violence at some points, so not many surprises there. The plot seems in my head to be \u0026ldquo;What if superheroes were driven by a greedy corporation\u0026rdquo;, which certainly doesn\u0026rsquo;t help address my \u003ca href=\"/2018/10/capitalism/\"\u003emisgivings about capitalism\u003c/a\u003e. The plot also reminds me of Sanderson\u0026rsquo;s book Reckoners, which was also a story about a resistance trying to oppose a superhuman regime led by a Superman-like figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking over the Wikipedia entry for the comic book series, it seems the TV show had some significant divergences, which is understandable, so I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ll be seeking out the comic books. The series was enjoyable enough to binge over a few days, although some parts are a bit predictable. I did like the treatment given to Hugh and Annie/Starlight. The cast is pretty good too, I almost didn\u0026rsquo;t recognize Simon Pegg (because it was such a serious role) and Elisabeth Shue (because\u0026hellip;I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen her in anything in a while?). Oh and Gus Fring is also here!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I ended up enjoying the season overall, as it tackles a lot of issues I relate with.

I went in blind not knowing anything about it other than \u0026ldquo;Japanese comedy zombie movie\u0026rdquo;, so you should too!",
