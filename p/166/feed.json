I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to dive into the third book without having to re-read the first two, with a general recollection of the events from the first book still intact. I found it a bit heavy-handed with the prose, as the writers spend a couple of paragraphs in each scene for each character to ponder in self-doubt, fear or despair. I forget if that\u0026rsquo;s something they did in the Dragonlance books as well. The plot of this book went in a direction that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been able to predict, but I guess the ending was satisfying enough.

I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to dive into the third book without having to re-read the first two, with a general recollection of the events from the first book still intact. I found it a bit heavy-handed with the prose, as the writers spend a couple of paragraphs in each scene for each character to ponder in self-doubt, fear or despair. I forget if that\u0026rsquo;s something they did in the Dragonlance books as well. The plot of this book went in a direction that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been able to predict, but I guess the ending was satisfying enough, although I don\u0026rsquo;t know what the hell they were thinking with Simkin towards the last third of the book.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/18436248-roy-tang\"\u003eView all my reviews\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Many elements of the world are expanded upon and added to and by now we get a better sense of the sort of wonders the world of Harry Potter represents. The plot is starting to get more complex, with more Chekov\u0026rsquo;s gun-type elements firing off as the story spins its plot twists near the book\u0026rsquo;s conclusion.
