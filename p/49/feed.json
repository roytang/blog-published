It\u0026rsquo;s something my family celebrates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am of course, ethnically Chinese, but I don\u0026rsquo;t talk about it much. When asked, I will often reply that I identify as a Filipino, not as Chinese (maybe slightly more relevant these days given our disagreement with our largely populated neighboring country). I don\u0026rsquo;t reject the heritage or anything - but I\u0026rsquo;m not particularly steeped in it either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t speak the language (beyond a few token phrases). When we were kids my dad had a few Chinese language learning books laying around the house, but they were mostly inscrutable, too difficult for a kid to pick up without instruction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t go to Chinese school. My brother did, for a year, then my folks gave up on it because he had trouble with having to learn in three languages, especially since we didn\u0026rsquo;t even speak Chinese at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t even enjoy Chinese food. I mean, I\u0026rsquo;ll eat some of it sometimes, but more often there\u0026rsquo;s far too much vegetables for my sake. Imagine how I felt my first time travelling to Hong Kong, everytime the officemates would go out for dinner it would be Chinese food. (I write about that a bit \u003ca href=\"/2004/05/so-i-went-to-hk/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not bragging or anything, just another life observation. Our family never got too into Chinese culture in the Philippines. I myself am probably more Westernized than Chinese if anything. We do observe some things like the aforementioned Chinese New Year. And some Chinese traditions during funerals and such. I was exposed to a bit more Chinese culture at my first job, where there were special activites during the Mooncake festival and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, I do think it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to acknowledge and celebrate one\u0026rsquo;s cultural heritage even when one doesn\u0026rsquo;t particularly enjoy it. So today, I guess I\u0026rsquo;m Chinese.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

There is also definitely an element of subjectivity as to which answers should be accepted. One time a player complained that his answer \u003ccode\u003e\u0026quot;Batman vs Superman Dawn of Justice\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e should count for \u003ccode\u003e\u0026quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e, but for this particular question I had chosen not to allow \u0026ldquo;vs\u0026rdquo; for \u0026ldquo;v\u0026rdquo; because that was the actual movie title, which might be unreasonable now that I think about it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do know that I need to implement a better \u0026ldquo;synonym\u0026rdquo; handling, i.e. mapping of \u003ccode\u003e\u0026quot;v\u0026quot;\u0026lt;-\u0026gt;\u0026quot;vs\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e and other terms like \u003ccode\u003e\u0026quot;mr\u0026quot;\u0026lt;-\u0026gt;\u0026quot;mister\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003e\u0026quot;natl\u0026quot;\u0026lt;-\u0026gt;\u0026quot;national\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e. The problem with handling things like that is that is the possible combinations of phrases expands when multiple such terms are found in the same answer, so it can\u0026rsquo;t scale too well. I suppose I need to normalize the answer sets at the time the question is defined. What do you know, I figured out how to do something just by writing a blog post!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do have a bunch of other enhancements planned for the trivia bot, including support for slack and discord, and a longer time frame roadmap, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure when I can commit more time to it. Still, it\u0026rsquo;s turned out to be a pretty fun endeavor, I\u0026rsquo;m hoping it leads to something cool!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI picked up Slay the Spire during the last (Winter) Steam Sale, not really knowing what I was getting into. I had heard some good things, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t really know much other than it was a roguelite where I had to go through a dungeon. But it was cheap so I took the dive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was pleasantly surprised to find that not only was it a roguelite, it was also a deckbuilding game! I love deckbuilding games, they often generate a significant amount of variance that translates to fun, and pairing that mechanic with a roguelite meant each run would be pretty interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo in Slay the Spire, you choose a character from three choices, each of which have a different set of powers and cards. You go through the dungeons, one room at a time. Each room might have an enemy, a treasure or a random event. The map for the entire dungeon act is available ahead of time, so you can plot your route as needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#1c94092f8f4b7ae78ac2c2ef706b0caa-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2019/02/game-review-slay-the-spire/slaythespire_hu35bffa5482582b07d5d679f7c3d03273_358404_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"1c94092f8f4b7ae78ac2c2ef706b0caa-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2019/02/game-review-slay-the-spire/slaythespire.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"2 Feb 2019 5:56am\"\u003e2 Feb 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour character is equipped with a deck of cards that includes attacks and blocks and powers. Along the way you can add new cards to your deck by defeating enemies or opening chests or buying from merchants and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are three available characters to play (as of now), and they offer pretty different play styles. There\u0026rsquo;s the Ironclad, who\u0026rsquo;s kind of a straightforward attack and block kind of guy. There\u0026rsquo;s the Silent, a rogue who prefers chaining multiple attacks or using poison. And there\u0026rsquo;s the Defect, who summons persistent orbs that perform various functions. The dungeon proceeds the same way for each class, but they have different card sets to choose from so battles often play out differently, and each character has different builds you can lean towards to increase your odds of a successful run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBattles proceed in a turn-based manner. You draw some number of cards from your deck and each turn, and play as many as your energy allows. The unique thing about Slay the Spire is that during your turn, you can see each enemy\u0026rsquo;s intent. That is, you can see what the enemy will do next turn, more or less, via an icon over their head (see image).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#aafaacd2db44b2628a0dce0eb63cb6a4-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2019/02/game-review-slay-the-spire/slaythespireintent_hu4b75871302203df90c0b1fcd01f05aff_410558_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"aafaacd2db44b2628a0dce0eb63cb6a4-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2019/02/game-review-slay-the-spire/slaythespireintent.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"2 Feb 2019 5:56am\"\u003e2 Feb 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the enemy plans to attack, there\u0026rsquo;s an icon over their head indicating how much damage and how many attacks they\u0026rsquo;re going to do. If they\u0026rsquo;re going to block, there\u0026rsquo;s a shield icon. And there\u0026rsquo;s icon for if they are going to do buffs or debuffs. In a sense the game gives you perfect information about what the enemies are going to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis means every turn is sort of a mini-puzzle: what are the cards I need to play to minimize the amount of damage I take (always your priority, since taking too much damage endangers your run) or should I try to avoid debuffs or can I maybe already beat the enemy this turn?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt all plays out in the framework of the spire, the dungeon you\u0026rsquo;re trying to conquer, with the map being randomly generated rooms. Every room presents choices: which card to add to your deck? Which card to remove? Should I risk some HP to gain a relic? And so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s all very fun, and quite challenging. It can also be frustrating, but since the game gives you near perfect information (you even know at the start of a floor which among a set of bosses you are going to be facing at the end of the floor), any deaths are always at least partly your fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tend to wait until I\u0026rsquo;ve \u0026ldquo;completed\u0026rdquo; games before I review them, and for Slay the Spire I did manage to finish a run with each class at least once. But I\u0026rsquo;ve only scratched the surface, there\u0026rsquo;s a ton of content beyond that. I haven\u0026rsquo;t even gotten the \u0026ldquo;true ending\u0026rdquo; yet, which only becomes available after beating the game once with each class, as the \u0026ldquo;true ending\u0026rdquo; boss is quite difficult. And even beyond that there\u0026rsquo;s special cards to unlock, daily challenges with different parameters, and even an endless mode I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried yet. I also hear that the devs are very diligent and add content on a regular basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlay the Spire recently went \u0026ldquo;live\u0026rdquo; and left Early Access, just last month, and they\u0026rsquo;re planning for a Switch port too. The one disadvantage of the game for me is that each run takes a considerable amount of time (You can actually quit at any time during a run and resume it later, but I always feel compelled to finish each run in one sitting), and I have a lot of other games to play. I\u0026rsquo;ll still probably revisit the Spire from time to time, but frankly trying to \u0026ldquo;complete\u0026rdquo; the game, Steam achievements and all, seems like a huge task, given the large amount of variance in the game, but maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll get there someday.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I picked up Slay the Spire during the last (Winter) Steam Sale, not really knowing what I was getting into. I had heard some good things, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t really know much other than it was a roguelite where I had to go through a dungeon. But it was cheap so I took the dive.\nI was pleasantly surprised to find that not only was it a roguelite, it was also a deckbuilding game!",

For me, the term invokes the names Frank and Joe before the Matt and Jeff of WWE fame. We had a fairly wide collection of the blue-hardcovered books of those days. And I believe I made the effort to read every single book in that particular series, through borrowing and such. I think I was successful, but I can\u0026rsquo;t be sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case , that meant this article piqued my interest:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/01/reading-hardy-boys-nostalgia-disappointment-racism/581071/\"\u003eThe Knotty Nostalgia of the Hardy Boys Series\u003c/a\u003e\nWhy one writer still reads the wildly popular books with a mixture of love and disappointment, 60 years after they were revised to remove racist content\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReading the series as a child, I never felt any serious racist undertones, probably because the versions I had were already torn down. Or more likely, because as a child I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any real concept of race. Sure, Frank and Joe were depicted as white kids on the book covers, but that meant nothing to this brown kid from Asia, even though I was certainly aware of caucasians and blacks by then. As far as I was concerned, I could have been mixed in with their crowd with no issues. I even remember specifically the Hidden Harbor book mentioned in the article, there were some characters who spoke with a southern accent, I guess they were meant to be black? But I never imagined them in my head as any different from their northern visitors. (There was this one character named Grover who in my head looked like a blue muppet\u0026hellip;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur copies of those Hardy Boys books are long gone, but like the article\u0026rsquo;s author I still look back at them with a tinge of nostalgia. I did learn a lot from those books, from vocabulary to American culture to different kinds of hobbies. I think the main charm of the Chet Morton character mentioned in the article is that with every book he always had a new, different hobby, and in that way the teenage readers could learn about some new field or possible area of interest. Later on, we also encountered softbound books of a later Hardy Boys series \u003cem\u003eThe Hardy Boys Casefiles\u003c/em\u003e, which was more dark (one of the character\u0026rsquo;s girlfriends got killed), but they lacked the charm, templating or formularity of the old ones, and we never got more than a few books from that series.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if these books are still available locally, I don\u0026rsquo;t recall seeing them in bookstores. I think they would still be pretty good reading for young boys these days - the Hardy Boys seem like they\u0026rsquo;d be good role models, they\u0026rsquo;re smart, they do well in school, they\u0026rsquo;re friendly and accepting and they obey the law and perhaps most importantly, they exhibit a sense of curiosity and adventure about the world around them, something many kids these days seem to lose as they grow up.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

In fairness to old me, at that time the IDEs didn\u0026rsquo;t support a real dark mode - only the editor area had the dark background and light text, while the rest of the application\u0026rsquo;s chrome still sported the OS default (but you could change the OS default I believe).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure when it happened, but sometime over the next few years I had a change of heart and started defaulting to dark mode themes whenever possible, and not just for programming IDEs. I now have dark mode defaults for many apps like Twitter or Discord. I also tried adding a browser extension to default dark mode on all sites, but that didn\u0026rsquo;t work out too well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would guess that dark/night mode became more prevalent with the rise of smartphone/tablet usage, since many people use those devices even in bed with the lights out. I personally can still work with light mode apps, I just prefer the dark mode now, it\u0026rsquo;s softer on the eyes and all.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
