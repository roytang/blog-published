            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIn late 2017, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-USA-cyber-kaspersky/trump-signs-into-law-u-s-government-ban-on-kaspersky-lab-software-idUSKBN1E62V4\"\u003eUS moved to ban Kaspersky antivirus from use by federal agencies\u003c/a\u003e, because of suspected influence from the Russian government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn late 2018, \u003ca href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/countries-banning-huawei-181206130850129.html\"\u003ethe US and other countries have either banned or are considering banning the Chinese tech giant Huawei and its telecoms products\u003c/a\u003e, for security reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth companies are under scrutiny for their perceived ties to their governments, both of which happen to have authoritarian leanings. From a certain POV, the bannings may be unfair, as they are \u0026ldquo;preventive\u0026rdquo; in nature, i.e. punishment is given preemptively before any offence is discovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s interesting to me because it shows that being under the sway of an authoritarian leadership can be considered a competitive disadvantage in the international marketplace. Trust in the Russian and Chinese governments is low (internationally), which affects the corporations working out of those states. While they may not be doing anything nefarious now, the fact that these states \u003cem\u003ecan possibly\u003c/em\u003e influence these companies is already a considerable risk, especially for government\u0026rsquo;s mission-critical systems given the geopolitical history and past behavior of those states.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven here in the Philippines, there is some level of mistrust against the entry of the supposed third telco, which is a consortium of which China Telecom is a part, mainly for security concerns as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn theory, this distrust should not be limited to Russia and China. For example, the US also has a history of requesting information from tech companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter, and so on. So in theory these US-based companies should not be trusted with communication platforms, etc. The difference is that the US-based companies have a stronger history of independence from the US government. They also regularly release \u003ca href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/18/facebooks-government-data-requests-continue-to-rise/\"\u003ereports\u003c/a\u003e about how the \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/google-reports-all-time-high-of-government-data-requests/\"\u003eUS and other governments request data\u003c/a\u003e from them. These are exercises to build trust from the consumer base, to emphasize their independence from any one state authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kaspersky ban was a relatively small deal, I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure if it affected Kaspersky at all. But the Huawei (and potentially ZTE as well) ban would be more important as Huawei is a very large telecoms company currently. It will be interesting to see how they move forward - will they take actions to assert their independence from the Chinese state and improve international trust? Or will they double down and have China resort to diplomatic pressure?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI love sleeping. And taking naps. But I\u0026rsquo;m not very good at doing it at night. Insomnia is a common problem for me. I often find it difficult to go to sleep at night, taking upwards of 1-2 hours in bed before I can manage to fall asleep. Of course all that time lying there feels unproductive, so I\u0026rsquo;ll often be tempted to to grab a nearby screen and read something online or such, which makes it even harder to get to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t blame the electronics devices completely, though. I remember even when I was a kid I would sometimes have trouble sleeping at night due to a hyperactive brain having too many trains of thoughts to resolve. Something I still carry to this day, though I like to imagine my ability to compartmentalize thoughts has improved since then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember when Warcraft III came out, one of the hero characters had an ability to send other units to sleep and I always chose that ability because I wanted to have it IRL. Not to use on other people, but on myself so I could sleep on demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting a continuous block of eight hours of sleep (or even six or seven hours) is pretty rare for me as well. Usually I\u0026rsquo;ll wake up after 1-2 hours, then if I\u0026rsquo;m lucky I manage to go to sleep again. If not, sometimes I\u0026rsquo;ll give up and work on stuff until it\u0026rsquo;s breakfast time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes I try to force-reset my sleep cycle by going like 36 hours without sleep so I can\u0026rsquo;t help but be real tired and sleep continuously for a while. But it usually doesn\u0026rsquo;t last. And I\u0026rsquo;m at that age where going 36 hours without sleep isn\u0026rsquo;t really that easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that since I quit working full-time I usually have a highly irregular daily schedule. Combined with a tendency to take naps during the day, it leads to the irregular sleep cycle. I also like having breakfast early so I often wake up at like 5 to 6 in the AM, no matter how late I went to sleep, then just recover sleep with naps during the day, making it harder to go to sleep early in the night, and so on. A bit of a vicious cycle. Also, it makes me a weird kind of cross between a morning person and a night owl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the problems with sleep is that even though it feels great, when you sleep so much it feels unproductive, like you could\u0026rsquo;ve put that time to better use. I remember maybe a decade or so ago, I was reading about the idea of polyphasic sleep. I liked the idea because it meant fewer sleep hours overall during the day, which meant more time for doing stuff. Sadly, I never got it to work. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit challenging to do it with a nine-to-five job, but even without that, I don\u0026rsquo;t really have the discipline to keep it up. And also, I like sleeping a lot sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ll end this post with this tweet:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eGOD: You have probably 70-80 years at most before you die, ideally.\u003cbr\u003eMAN: oh. well, i\u0026#39;ll make the most of-\u003cbr\u003eGOD: You\u0026#39;ll be unconscious for 1/3 of the time. \u003cbr\u003eMAN: ..uh\u003cbr\u003eGOD: *leans in* That\u0026#39;ll be your favorite part.\u003c/p\u003e\u0026mdash; Ray 🦔 (@SirEviscerate) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SirEviscerate/status/943137889977819138?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eDecember 19, 2017\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e \u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026hellip;then I\u0026rsquo;ll go take a nap.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I often find it difficult to go to sleep at night, taking upwards of 1-2 hours in bed before I can manage to fall asleep. Of course all that time lying there feels unproductive, so I\u0026rsquo;ll often be tempted to to grab a nearby screen and read something online or such, which makes it even harder to get to sleep.",

Like many people, I used to have a mild fear of speaking in front of a bunch of people/strangers, but as I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten older and cared less about what other people think, this kind of faded away. But the main issue with these two items is that they require a lot of prep, and that\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;m generally bad at (chalk it up to lack of discipline etc). I generally tend to prefer to \u0026ldquo;wing it\u0026rdquo;, even back in the college days, not that I\u0026rsquo;m particularly good at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame streaming seems like it could be good. Not much prep needed aside from some general familiarity with the game I\u0026rsquo;m playing. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;ve already set up \u003ca href=\"https://twitch.tv/twitchyroy\"\u003ea twitch channel\u003c/a\u003e before and did a few test broadcasts. My main problem with game streaming is that there\u0026rsquo;s a need to be talking all the time - avoiding dead air. And it can feel weird doing that with nobody around. I guess it\u0026rsquo;s more of a beginning streamer problem? If there were people in the twitch chat it would probably be easier. Or if there was someone else in the room with me while I\u0026rsquo;m streaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA friend also sometimes suggests I make a webcomic, that also seems like a viable option. My problem with that one is the prep again. You need to be able to come up with material on a regular basis, and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I can do that. As I say to my friend, I\u0026rsquo;m a generally witty guy, but my wit is more of \u0026ldquo;in the moment\u0026rdquo; insted of something I can summon on command. But then again, maybe the fact that I\u0026rsquo;m now able to make daily blog posts means a regular (weekly?) webcomic would now be viable?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn issue I have with trying to pick up new hobbies is the climb you have as a beginner, where everything you try sucks at first. I really dislike that initial learning period. But as Jake the Dog says \u0026ldquo;Dude, sucking at something is the first step towards being sort of good at something.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

When we were kids my dad had a few Chinese language learning books laying around the house, but they were mostly inscrutable, too difficult for a kid to pick up without instruction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t go to Chinese school.

I mean, I\u0026rsquo;ll eat some of it sometimes, but more often there\u0026rsquo;s far too much vegetables for my sake. Imagine how I felt my first time travelling to Hong Kong, everytime the officemates would go out for dinner it would be Chinese food.

Our family never got too into Chinese culture in the Philippines. I myself am probably more Westernized than Chinese if anything. We do observe some things like the aforementioned Chinese New Year. And some Chinese traditions during funerals and such. I was exposed to a bit more Chinese culture at my first job, where there were special activites during the Mooncake festival and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, I do think it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to acknowledge and celebrate one\u0026rsquo;s cultural heritage even when one doesn\u0026rsquo;t particularly enjoy it.
