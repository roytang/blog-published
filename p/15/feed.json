I have no data or analytics to back up this assertion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"twitter-has-an-open-api\"\u003eTwitter has an open API.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one is a more technical reason. Having an open API allows me to cross-post from my site to Twitter every time I write a blog post, and also archive all my tweets from that platform back into my own site. FB API used to be a lot more open as well, but as they continued to flub their personal data management, their API got more and more closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe open API also means services like \u003ca href=\"http://rssbridge.chamallow.com/\"\u003eRSS Bridge\u003c/a\u003e can exist, allowing Twitter feeds to be followed via open formats like RSS/Atom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"twitter-moderation-is-less-evil-than-facebook-moderation\"\u003eTwitter moderation is less evil than Facebook moderation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of them are actually fairly terrible and inconsistent (surely a consequence of operating at that scale without corresponding scaling up of moderation efforts), but at least Twitter is not afraid to at least fact-check Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"twitter-has-better-public-content\"\u003eTwitter has better public content\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlright, this one might be totally subjective or anecdotal based on my own Twitter follows and setup, but I find that public discourse is generally better on Twitter compared to Facebook. It might be due to some of the factors above, and maybe some level of luck/privilege/good filtering on my part. I mean, you can find bad actors and low-quality discussions if you go looking for them, but why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not saying Twitter is perfect. There is certainly a lot of room for improvement, especially technically. But compared to Facebook, I think Twitter is much less of a garbage fire maybe because (a) I don\u0026rsquo;t feel constrained to follow mainly family and friends; Twitter feels more like it can be a window to part of the larger world; and (b) the existence of Tweetdeck and better filtering tools means I don\u0026rsquo;t have to suffer through ads or other such inanity every few posts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: It seems a bit weird to be publishing this right now when the world seems to be on fire. I follow a lot of Americans so a lot of the racism and police brutality-inspired chaos dominates my Twitter timelines at the moment (as can be seen in the Tweetdeck screenshot above). But I think this is also a good illustration of how useful Twitter\u0026rsquo;s filters and options are. If you chose to, (or needed to temporarily, for your sanity maybe?) you can probably block out these events from your timeline completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is certainly a lot of room for improvement especially from the technical side; \u003ca href=\"https://mastodon.technology\"\u003eMastodon\u003c/a\u003e comes to mind as a superior platform in this regard, but that platform doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the scale of Twitter yet, which limits the interesting interactions that can come up. I find a lot of smart and interesting interactions still happen on Twitter, so it\u0026rsquo;s not yet something I\u0026rsquo;m willing to give up.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Basically, many states are responding to protests against police brutality with\u0026hellip; police brutality. Bold move Cotton. I\u0026rsquo;m not an American, but this resonates with me a lot because to see this kind of thing happening in a country that purports to champion human rights, how much worse can it be in a country like ours or a dictatorship like China where they don\u0026rsquo;t even give lip service to the concept? (Spoiler: we already know police brutality and EJKs are a thing in my country.)

It should punish Black people who break the law, but protect cops who break the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a meaningful difference between reactionary and progressive, left and right. It\u0026rsquo;s the difference of property rights vs human rights – whether you exact the right to hoard while others starve, or the right not to starve while others hoard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s the difference between pluralism and elitism: whether you think some of us were born to be ruled over, or whether you think we should have a government selected by its people to serve those people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s the difference of equal protections and duties under the law, as opposed to impunity for the powerful and the legalized oppression of the powerless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis resonates with me a lot because \u0026ldquo;equal protections under the law\u0026rdquo; may be a pretty big ask in this country when individual citizens find it difficult to apply judgement equally to both those they support and those they don\u0026rsquo;t. Double standards abound, both for the government and many of the citizens. There are a lot of people in this country who support the people in power blindly because of some form of tribalism; they chose this person so they feel they have to support them no matter what, no matter how incompetent, no matter how blatant the abuses are, and so on. It\u0026rsquo;s a weird case of trying to justify a purchase after the fact, even if it turned out to be horrible, out of some sense of pride, maybe? People hate being wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m reminded of someone I used to know who was an avid supporter of a particular candidate during the 2016 elections. Whenever he would fail to convince us of the merits of his candidate (or be unable to answer our concerns about his human rights record, etc), he would simply say \u0026ldquo;you guys just don\u0026rsquo;t trust him\u0026rdquo;. Which is a really weird thing to say because why trust any politician based on anything other than his track record and what he says or does? It always felt like he had already decided to trust this candidate and that nothing else mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like so many people in this country are so used to our politicians taking advantage of them that they have become hostage to this form of \u0026ldquo;rule\u0026rdquo;: ordinary people are subject to the harshness of the law, while for those in power, the law must be \u0026ldquo;tempered with compassion\u0026rdquo;. Being progressive and believing in pluralism in this country requires that we challenge those norms wherever we can, that we hold the powerful to account, regardless of political affiliation. It can be challenging to get people to look beyond their tribalistic nature, but it\u0026rsquo;s something we need to figure out if we are to survive and evolve as a truly democratic \u0026ldquo;rule of law\u0026rdquo; society and not devolve into some kind of right-wing populist authoritarian \u0026ldquo;rule of men\u0026rdquo; wasteland (if we aren\u0026rsquo;t already there yet).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing back to the Doctorow quote (which I\u0026rsquo;ve already strayed from a bit\u0026hellip; the last few paragraphs turned out a little ranty about the state of the country, but I\u0026rsquo;ve actually already rewritten it a couple of times to be\u0026hellip; less ranty I guess?), this model of how \u0026ldquo;the right\u0026rdquo; thinks can be a useful tool when engaging in debate or discussion with others (something I am less inclined to do these days). The two sides of this model are mostly incompatible, thus when discussing with anyone you can ask yourself (or them directly) which side of that divide they lie on. (I don\u0026rsquo;t imagine anyone would say out loud they believe people in power deserve special treatment, because that sounds absurd. Or evil. But that might just be the leftist perspective in me.) Whether they agree with you or not, at the very least it gives you a model in which to frame further discussion, or even to decide whether further discussion would even be worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisclaimer 1: Doctorow is of course primarily left-leaning, hence his bias towards these definitions. It would be interesting to see what the equivalent definitions would be on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisclaimer 2: Every individual is slightly different. I use \u0026ldquo;the right\u0026rdquo; in quotes here to indicate that the generalizations are describing a significant subset of people who might consider themselves \u0026ldquo;right-wing\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;conservative\u0026rdquo; or whatnot. I use this label more for this particular way of thinking rather than a political alignment. (And I dislike labelling people anyway, as much as possible.)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve basically been using GMail as my main email account since I first got access in 2006ish. \u0026ldquo;Main email account\u0026rdquo; means I use it as the primary access point for all my other online accounts. GMail was certainly revolutionary when it came out, and had a lot of benefits: it was fast, easily searchable and had a lot of free storage. But in the modern day, there are significant disadvantages to using GMail:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eyou don\u0026rsquo;t control your account; it\u0026rsquo;s rare, but anecdotally people have lost access to their GMail accounts for some perceived infraction, and when that happens you have no way of recovery or appeal\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eyou\u0026rsquo;re fueling a surveillance capitalism machine\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eit can \u003ca href=\"/2020/05/1263160405737607170/\"\u003elook unprofessional\u003c/a\u003e to be using free email, especially for official or business correspondence\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first bullet point is the biggie for me. One such story came across the Hacker News front page a while back and I can only imagine the nightmare it would be for me to lose access to my Google account. Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve started a conscious effort to slowly but surely decouple myself from my dependencies on Google Services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat meant migrating my online accounts to use another email, primarily one I control. I already had this domain \u003ca href=\"https://roytang.net\"\u003eroytang.net\u003c/a\u003e, so there\u0026rsquo;s no reason to not use emails with that domain. The only risk to using an email on your own domain is that if you forgot to renew your domain, or otherwise lose control, you are screwed. So\u0026hellip; don\u0026rsquo;t let that happen I guess?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only question was what email service provider to use? I\u0026rsquo;m still on Webfaction hosting, and they do provide email accounts, but I\u0026rsquo;m planning to move away from them before the end of the year \u003ca href=\"/2019/03/rip-webfaction/\"\u003edue to the GoDaddy purchase\u003c/a\u003e, so probably best not to be reliant on their email service. If I wanted more control over the risks, I could of course run my own mail servers, but I\u0026rsquo;m not ready to go that far yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first one I tried was \u003ca href=\"https://protonmail.com/\"\u003eProtonMail\u003c/a\u003e because yay, end-to-end encryption! I used it for a couple of months first before paying for anything (using a custom domain email requires a paid plan). Unfortunately, I felt like the additional security wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth the trouble of not being super portable. Accessing via mobile required their app, can\u0026rsquo;t use any generic email client. I also wanted to be able to access via a desktop client like Thunderbird or Mail on the Macbook Air, but that required some sort of SMTP bridge, and it seemed like a bother. Every time I set up a new machine I\u0026rsquo;d need it? I\u0026rsquo;m not super security-conscious, so I decided to keep the protonmail account as a secondary account, in case I did come to a situation where e2e encryption was absolutely critical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI next tried \u003ca href=\"https://www.migadu.com\"\u003emigadu.com\u003c/a\u003e as an email provider, based on \u003ca href=\"https://cmpwn.com/@sir/102452352875414214\"\u003ethis recommendation thread\u003c/a\u003e by Drew Devault over on Mastodon. Their web settings aren\u0026rsquo;t super refined, but everything was relatively easy to setup. And their free tier includes support for custom domains and multiple mailboxes per domain, so that\u0026rsquo;s a big plus. I\u0026rsquo;ve been using them now for a few months and am generally happy with the service. (They did have a short bout of server access issues around the time the covid19 thing started getting around, but they resolved it pretty quickly.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter choosing an email service provider, the next step was setting up emails and shifting over all my online accounts. Migadu\u0026rsquo;s support for unlimited mailboxes meant I could have separate email addresses for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003econtact email for other online accounts\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epublicly accessible contact email on the website\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eprivate email for communication with friends\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eetc\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ended up updating over 50 online accounts to point to the new domain email. Not all in one go, as that\u0026rsquo;s terribly boring, but a few at a time over the course of the last few months. That covers social media services, gaming services, financial services, dev tools, and so on. The upside of all this effort is I got to do a kind of audit of all my online accounts, which ones could be deleted/deactivated, which ones needed new passwords, which ones have poor security measures, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheoretically, I only need to do this once. An advantage to using custom domain emails is that if you\u0026rsquo;re unhappy with your underlying email provider, you can switch to a different one while retaining the same email addresses, no need to update emails in all your other online accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, I had no intention of using webmail anymore, so I ended up installing Thunderbird (it\u0026rsquo;s been a while old friend) for accessing these accounts, and also set up the Mail app on the Macbook Air. For the phone, I installed K-9 mail, although I\u0026rsquo;m having an issue with that currently where it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be doing background syncing of mails. Not a super critical issue, as I mostly don\u0026rsquo;t want to be pinged real-time by email anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m still keeping the GMail account of course, a lot of people still know me by that email address, but now I have a largely reduced footprint and dependency on it. And as mentioned, I\u0026rsquo;m also keeping the ProtonMail account for any security-conscious communications. So I ended up having to manage a lot more email addresses, but hopefully everything will be a bit more organized, with every account having a specific purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

If you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar, these were a pair of apps that were used for \u0026ldquo;checking-in\u0026rdquo; to particular locations, with a sort of gamification system where if you checked in at a place often enough, you would earn points and eventually become \u0026ldquo;Mayor\u0026rdquo; of the venue. The idea being that owners of those venues might give some benefits to those who check-in often at those locations (AFAIK, this never really caught on in the Philippines). I wasn\u0026rsquo;t a super active user of Foursquare/Swarm, I had maybe 500ish check-ins from 2010-2017 when I stopped using it.

It also gave me an excuse to figure out how to render OpenStreetMap. (The location pages are one of the few pages that have JavaScript on this site.) The \u003ca href=\"/locations/\"\u003elocations page\u003c/a\u003e shows a map of all the visited locations and a listing of the locations grouped by country, and for the Philippines, by city (where available). You can click through to individual locations to see how often I\u0026rsquo;ve checked in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, one of the venues with the most number of check-ins for me is \u003ca href=\"/locations/4d27f36c8292236a41e814bb/\"\u003eBBQ Chicken\u003c/a\u003e, a now-closed Korean-themed BBQ chicken place in Ortigas near where I used to work. Another one with a lot of check-ins would be \u003ca href=\"/locations/4bbbfea5ed7776b032413f51/\"\u003eMurphy\u0026rsquo;s in Makati\u003c/a\u003e where we did a lot of quiz nights from 2011-2013. Obviously, the location data isn\u0026rsquo;t complete and doesn\u0026rsquo;t capture all my visits, since I didn\u0026rsquo;t use Foursquare/Swarm that religiously anyway. I\u0026rsquo;m certain I\u0026rsquo;ve eaten at BBQ Chicken more than the 18 times I checked in!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-about-privacy\"\u003eWhat about privacy?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually telling the internet where you are all the time might seem a bit anathema to the more privacy-conscious modern world, but I do like having a history of where I\u0026rsquo;ve been. I even have location tracking enabled on my phone via Google Maps so that I can have a timeline of where I am on a day-by-day basis. I\u0026rsquo;ve used it more than once to answer queries like \u0026ldquo;do you know if we went to \u003cplace\u003e in \u003cmonth\u003e of last year?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;When did you last go to \u003cstore\u003e ?\u0026rdquo; Obviously it\u0026rsquo;s not for everyone and I fully understand the privacy ramifications of Google having all my location data and feeding the mightly global surveillance capitalism machine, but for me right now it\u0026rsquo;s an acceptable tradeoff. As for the foursquare data, I was using foursquare back when I was less privacy-conscious that I am now, so I my attitude is like, that particular dataset has been out in the world for years, I can\u0026rsquo;t put the toothpaste back in the bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, I did scrub some old check-ins from this data (and the corresponding data on Swarm and on Twitter if it was cross-posted)) that was a bit too close to home. I know this data potentially allows bad guys or assassins or whatnot to figure out where I live, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d at least make it a tiny bit more difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-now\"\u003eWhat now?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is just a neat little thing that probably only I will care about, as it lets me see some of the places I\u0026rsquo;ve been to. And I probably won\u0026rsquo;t be using 4sq/Swarm again, so the dataset probably won\u0026rsquo;t be growing. That being said, I do want to add some future features like grouping the check-ins according to trips, so I can see all the particular places where I went to on particular trips. Many of my trips are missing data though; for example, my only check-in in France was in the airport, and not at any of the touristy places we went to. I may try to supplement this data with selected extracts from my Google Maps location history (hopefully it\u0026rsquo;s easy to figure out!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also don\u0026rsquo;t know where to put the locations page in the menus lol. I\u0026rsquo;ll figure it out sooner or later!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "A while back I got an export of my Foursquare/Swarm data. If you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar, these were a pair of apps that were used for \u0026ldquo;checking-in\u0026rdquo; to particular locations, with a sort of gamification system where if you checked in at a place often enough, you would earn points and eventually become \u0026ldquo;Mayor\u0026rdquo; of the venue. The idea being that owners of those venues might give some benefits to those who check-in often at those locations (AFAIK, this never really caught on in the Philippines).",

This despite the NTC earlier promising they can operate provisionally while the franchise renewal is being processed, a change of heart apparently due to a legal opinion by the SolGen. Some thoughts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"bias\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;Bias\u0026rdquo;\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe speaker of the house \u003ca href=\"https://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2020/05/15/cayetano-slams-bias-at-abs-cbn/\"\u003esays\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you are one of the reasons why there are issues with your network. In the eyes of some, there is clear bias and meddling in the elections, which is against the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, IDK what this supposed election meddling is that he\u0026rsquo;s talking about (If they have really done such a thing that is illegal, they can be charged in court, but AFAIK there are no such cases?), but speaking on the issue of \u0026ldquo;bias\u0026rdquo;: we cannot require that a news entity be unbiased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRepeating for emphasis: \u003cstrong\u003ewe cannot require that a news entity be unbiased\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy, you say? It comes back to the nature of bias, and the nature of humans. Every individual human is biased towards certain things, as a result of their experiences growing up. No matter how well-read or well-traveled or well-learned you are, your individual human experience is but a fraction of a fraction of an infinitessimal fraction of the collective human experience. Therefore, you will exhibit bias naturally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrganizations are pretty much the same, since they are composed of biased humans. Any given organization can strive to be less biased by having members with diverse points of view and opinion. And in fact it would be better if our news entities were as unbiased as possible, this would be ideal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we (through the state) cannot require that such entities be unbiased, for the simple reason that determination of bias will itself be tainted by bias. There can be no absolute, objective standard for being unbiased, because who would make that judgement? Who would make the rules? Humans, who are also biased? Imposing such a vague restriction on news entities (\u0026ldquo;you must be unbiased\u0026rdquo;) is tantamount to imposing someone else\u0026rsquo;s will (and bias) upon the entity, and that encroaches upon the freedom of expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can impose specific restrictions on freedoms of expression and the press through law; examples are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edisallowing knowingly publishing falsehoods through libel laws (although this too is problematic, since truth is also not always measurable nor absolute)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edisallowing child pornography\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efalse fire alarms in a crowded theater\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eetc\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe important thing is that specific, measurable things can be disallowed, since presumably these can be evaluated fairly (or as fairly as possible). More dangerous are restrictions that depend upon the whims of those in power, such as commonly found in authoritarian countries like China.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t want to get into the nitty-gritty legalities of it, since I am not a lawyer. But my main point is that like it or not, we can\u0026rsquo;t require news entities to be unbiased. We want them to be as close to that as possible ideally, but we can\u0026rsquo;t require it, because that is not enforceable fairly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout ABS-CBN specifically, I don\u0026rsquo;t even see any bias; I mean, if anything, many of their news anchors and celebrities seem to be supportive of the administration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(You might disagree with me, but that\u0026rsquo;s just your bias, and that\u0026rsquo;s fine.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"press-freedom-access-to-information-and-other-concerns\"\u003ePress Freedom, Access to Information, and other concerns\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people have commented that press freedom still exists in the Philippines despite the ABS-CBN shutdown, citing reasons such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eexistence of other networks\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eABS-CBN still being able to broadcast over digital channels\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epeople still being able to criticize the government\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this is true, that the Philippines does still enjoy some press freedom, undoubtedly:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eany reduction in the diversity of news sources is harmful to democratic society since it reduces access to information\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003enot everyone has access to cable or internet channels through which ABS-CBN programs can still be accessed, thus depriving many people of a source of information (and in some cases the only source of information they had available)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe mere fact that the government, on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/168137-duterte-block-abs-cbn-franchise-renewal\"\u003epresident\u0026rsquo;s whim and vindictiveness\u003c/a\u003e (no one really believes the NTC and the SolGen and even the House are acting independently), has taken the biggest network off the air leads to what is called a \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect\"\u003echilling effect\u003c/a\u003e, basically sending a message to everybody else.

For me, that\u0026rsquo;s extraneous. Of course we don\u0026rsquo;t want anyone to lose their livelihoods, but that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be necessary to contemplate: on the basis of the harms to democracy and press freedom alone this should not have happened. And especially not during a pandemic, when getting information out to people can be crucial!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand the requirement for Congress to approve broadcast franchises, since broadcast frequencies are a limited resource. But if it were me: the grant of provisional franchise upon expiry would be automatic unless explicitly revoked by Congress with clear violations specified as the cause of revokation. And the grant of franchise should probably explicity specify the conditions upon which the franchise may not be renewed. The grant or renewal of broadcast franchises should be as free of politics as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-to-police-bad-news-entities\"\u003eHow to police \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; news entities?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we can\u0026rsquo;t impose unbiasedness, and shutting them down violates press freedom, how do we control wayward news entities? Since humans are biased, we have no universal definition of \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo;, but there are still some controls that society can impose, not necssarily through law:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethrough law, specific restrictions as described above\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIdeally, it should be the market and news consumers themselves who are able to control the biases of the news entities, by not patronizing news entities that tend to be editorialized. (Although this probably requires a more educated populace, see: Fox News). ABS-CBN itself is still super popular, in spite of everything.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"etc\"\u003eEtc\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chilling effect on free expression has a slippery slope. Already the government has started going after critics allegedly for social media posts. If we are not careful, we might be on the road to becoming like China. (Which might be what Duterte and his cult following want, but certainly won\u0026rsquo;t be good for a democratic Philippines).\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Sadly, we didn\u0026rsquo;t too well in this week\u0026rsquo;s quizzes. I did win the Geekfight one last Wednesday, but the other two were a wash. As if that weren\u0026rsquo;t enough, we also decided to do internal trivia team quizzes, with the intent of putting them up on our \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCptXvNbp4ETVttb_k-1oOww\"\u003erelatively-new Youtube channel\u003c/a\u003e (Subscribe, etc).

This reminds me of a convo I had with a friend a couple of years back when he saw one of my blog posts. He was getting into content creation himself via a Youtube channel and he asked me what kind of traffic or how many visitors I see on my blog, and I was like \u0026ldquo;You know what, I have no idea!\u0026rdquo; because I never really got into that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to have Google Analytics on the site back when I first migrated to Hugo, because the initial theme I used supported it and why not right? But I got rid of it when I did the redesign because I didn\u0026rsquo;t really use it and didn\u0026rsquo;t care for the additional JavaScript and tracking and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I do have are server-side stats via AWStats, which I do look at maybe once every couple or years or so. For the purposes of this post I decided to pull the server-side stats into a \u003ca href=\"/page/stats/awstats/\"\u003epage on this site\u003c/a\u003e. So if you check that page, I had 29292 unique visitors for the entirety of 2019. That\u0026rsquo;s around 80 visitors per day. The peak was in 2017, when I had around 135 visitors per day. These are pretty weak numbers I guess? I don\u0026rsquo;t really know, but obviously I haven\u0026rsquo;t gone viral or gotten on the frontpage of HN/reddit or anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0026rsquo;s fine! Traffic isn\u0026rsquo;t why I write, and any visitors above 0 are kind of a bonus, since I write mostly for myself! I feel like optimizing for traffic or SEO or whatever would be a bit like selling your soul. I think the whole point of the original post was a nostalgia for the old-style blogs that were writing for the sake of writing, and not to cater to the whims of the search engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do like engagement though, mostly in the form of comments, which is something I have \u003ca href=\"/page/stats/site/\"\u003ebeen tracking before\u003c/a\u003e. (Other than the comments, you can see that most of the stats that I track are \u003cem\u003emy\u003c/em\u003e stats, i.e. how much I post and so on.) Again, it\u0026rsquo;s not a whole lot, but it\u0026rsquo;s enough to feel a bit rewarding every time a new comment comes in. I recently disabled the comment form for the site (been getting too much spam), but this site can still get new comments via webmention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is nice to know that there are actually people out there reading my words. I do know some friends of mine follow the blog somehow (or maybe they just pick up the posts when I syndicate to Twitter), but it\u0026rsquo;s actually more fun when a stranger leaves a good comment!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"on-self-censorship\"\u003eOn Self-Censorship\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone on HN mentioned:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, this is why I don’t have a blog. I have a lot of strong opinions that might be interesting to some people, but I don’t want to miss opportunities because some HR person googled my name and found a post they disagreed with. Or, in the future, not a real person but an algorithm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess this is a result of the current climate, where people can get \u0026ldquo;cancelled\u0026rdquo; for things they\u0026rsquo;ve said in the past etc. And I guess that\u0026rsquo;s a valid concern, if you want to live your life that way. But really, how strong are your opinions if you can\u0026rsquo;t stand for them in public?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I write something, on this blog or elsewhere on the internet, it\u0026rsquo;s because I believe it to be true, at that time. (Or I may also be shitposting, but it should be obvious when I\u0026rsquo;m shitposting.) I\u0026rsquo;ve written some political stuff on the blog and elsewhere on the internet before, and I often criticize my country\u0026rsquo;s government when the opportunity arises. This might become problematic recently, as Duterte\u0026rsquo;s administration has started harassing critics by filing charges against them and so on. But even if it comes to that, I like to think that I would be willing to stand by what I write.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like to think it\u0026rsquo;s because I tend to be right all the time (LOL), but also if I\u0026rsquo;ve said or done or posted something before that would later turn out to be inaccurate or offensive or whatnot, I have no concerns about walking that back and saying \u0026ldquo;Hey, I made a mistake!\u0026rdquo;. That\u0026rsquo;s another advantage running your own blog has over something like Twitter. On Twitter you can only delete your past mistakes. Here I can preserve them, but add a note saying something like \u0026ldquo;My opinion on this has changed\u0026rdquo; or such. I have not yet had a reason to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(I think it helps that I largely hold non-controversial opinions and generally try to avoid being an asshole to people, but that\u0026rsquo;s probably the topic of another post entirely.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s also the idea that you may want to write things that you don\u0026rsquo;t want associated with you IRL. I can understand that. For those kinds of things, you can make one-off posts using throwaway accounts I guess? For me, from the very beginning of my internet presence, I haven\u0026rsquo;t considered anonymizing or protecting my content. My geocities URL had my full name in it for example (and so does this domain!). But I have made some throwaway posts that aren\u0026rsquo;t tied to me, for example when talking about sensitive information or such. But I think for a large majority of the content a regular person would post, this isn\u0026rsquo;t really necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"on-originality\"\u003eOn Originality\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI often notice when I start writing on a particular topic, I learn more about my thoughts and opinions of it and realize my thoughts are wrong or not really novel. Halfway in I give up since I feel like, \u0026ldquo;oh, this actually isn\u0026rsquo;t really adding anything new to the conversation\u0026rdquo;. Then I leave with a new humbleness about my beliefs but also a sense of \u0026ldquo;when am I actually going to know enough to warrant writing about it?\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in a blogging lull around 2010-2015 (as seen on \u003ca href=\"/page/stats/site/\"\u003ethe stats page\u003c/a\u003e!) and thinking of getting back into it and writing more software-related content, but I mentioned to a friend that I was worried that the internet was already oversaturated with such writers/bloggers and I would not have anything original to contribute. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember his exact words, but it was one of the best pieces of writing advice I had ever gotten, something along the lines of: \u0026ldquo;No one else is going to be writing with your perspective and your point of view, so no matter what, you are bringing something to the table.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"on-discoverability\"\u003eOn Discoverability\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people on the HN thread said that Google no longer surfaces older blog content. I anecdotally know this to be not true, because a Google search for the terms \u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en\u0026amp;q=killer%20killer\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;killer-killer\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en\u0026amp;q=pasmado\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;pasmado\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e still shows posts from my blog from 2008 on the first page. I suspect this is because my blog has been continuously updated since 2002, hence my posts never fall \u0026ldquo;out of rotation\u0026rdquo;? Is that a thing? Who knows! SEO, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe original post was correct however in that it is difficult to find old-school blog content if you are searching specifically for that kind of thing. I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned \u003ca href=\"/2020/04/fe45adb8c24e654605b9906dea2df749/\"\u003ebefore\u003c/a\u003e that I want some kind of indieweb federated search focused on searching content from \u0026ldquo;indie\u0026rdquo; blogs (for lack of a better term. We need a better term?). Maybe someday I\u0026rsquo;d write down how I imagine that would work. And implement it maybe? IDK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil then, there are still a lot of blogs around, if you know where to look. One of my favorite avenues is Kicks Condors\u0026rsquo; \u003ca href=\"https://www.kickscondor.com/hrefhunt/\"\u003emonthly HrefHunt updates\u003c/a\u003e. And I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned before, but whenever anyone posts anything remotely nostalgic about old-school blogging on Hacker News, the comments are always full of links to blogs. There\u0026rsquo;s specialized subreddits like \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SpartanWeb/\"\u003er/SpartanWeb\u003c/a\u003e (not many users!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you run a blog, you can help by having a page where you list other blogs you like! Some kind of roll call, but for blogs. Like\u0026hellip; a \u003ca href=\"/page/blogroll/\"\u003eblogroll\u003c/a\u003e? And if they make a post you like, share it on your blog, and maybe on other social media channels too! Us indie and old-school bloggers need to have each other backs!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"more-to-come\"\u003eMore To Come\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am 99.9999% sure this is not the last time I\u0026rsquo;m going to blog about blogging.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The government messaging has not been very tight about the reopening, they should have made much clearer that despite the loosening of restrictions we should still take precautions and not go out unless absolutely essential. I guess it\u0026rsquo;s an indicator that many people were not staying in because they wanted to avoid spreading the virus, but rather because they had nowhere to go.

Need to think about this for a while.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecent Links of Interest:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI always like it when a \u003ca href=\"http://tttthis.com/blog/if-i-could-bring-one-thing-back-to-the-internet-it-would-be-blogs\"\u003epost about blogs\u003c/a\u003e makes it to the front page of Hacker News.

Watching: Haven\u0026rsquo;t watched much this week. There was the really great Justice League Dark: Apokolips War which came out last week. Apparently it\u0026rsquo;s the last one for the DC AMU, or this particular timeline at least. Quiz: We are now up to 3 locally produced online quiz nights per week, which seems like a lot because we only used to attend 2-3 live events per month.",
