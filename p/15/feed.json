I\u0026rsquo;m not planning to get the DLC, what I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to is the accompanying free patch since one of the promises is improved late-game performance, something which made playing this game very annoying during the past year. I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of how Paradox does continuous content updates for their titles, even now almost 4 years after release. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably eventually get this and the other DLC at some point in the future, but I\u0026rsquo;m sure I haven\u0026rsquo;t even experienced everything the base game has to offer.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e31 Mar: \u003cstrong\u003eMount and Blade Bannerlord\u003c/strong\u003e. I have a friend who can\u0026rsquo;t shut up about this game and he\u0026rsquo;s been looking forward to it forever so I\u0026rsquo;m kind of looking forward to it as well. I\u0026rsquo;m not planning to buy it on release, but I hope to see if it\u0026rsquo;s good. I\u0026rsquo;ve played Mount and Blade Warband for a nontrivial amount of time, and I really enjoyed the simulation and overworld stuff, but was really bad at the combat, especially mounted combat. I hope the combat gets easier for people like me.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e10 Apr: \u003cstrong\u003eFinal Fantasy VII Remake\u003c/strong\u003e. I recently had a convo with a friend group where one guy said we played FF7 in the summer of 95 and I was like wasn\u0026rsquo;t it summer of 96? But when I looked it up, the game actually came out Sep 1997, so we actually played it in summer of 98! Memory, how does it work? I lent out my PS4 recently and won\u0026rsquo;t get it back before April so I don\u0026rsquo;t get to try the demo, but I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to the remake and already have it preordered for PS4!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(I was originally planning to include this in the \u003ca href=\"/2020/03/weeknotes-2020-03-08/\"\u003elast weeknotes\u003c/a\u003e, but I thought to separate it so it\u0026rsquo;s purely a gaming post.)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eSince I stopped being a full-time employee at the end of 2015, I\u0026rsquo;ve missed around four years of monthly SSS payments. This isn\u0026rsquo;t really that big a deal, since I\u0026rsquo;ve already paid more than 10 years of premiums, I\u0026rsquo;m already guaranteed to get a pension from SSS when I reach retirement age. However, this past January I decided to resume making SSS premium payments on a voluntary basis. I had to research a bit and ask some friends about the whole process, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d document it here both for my own recollection and in case someone finds it useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe SSS pension isn\u0026rsquo;t a lot, which is why I\u0026rsquo;ve never really prioritized making the payments, but making voluntary payments will slightly increase the actual pension I can get from SSS in my old age. The computation for SSS pension amounts is outside the scope of this post (it\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab\u0026amp;q=sss+pension+computation\"\u003eeasy to search for\u003c/a\u003e) but AFAIK each additional year of payments I make (with the maximum contribution amount) will increase my monthly pension by around 320 pesos, and this is the maximum possible bracket. A pitiful amount really; whether it\u0026rsquo;s worth it or not depends on how long you intend to live past retirement age. By my computation if you live around 8 years past retirement age, you come out ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst step: Create an account\u003c/strong\u003e. If you want to transition from monthly payments made by your employer to voluntary payments, the first thing you need is an account on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.sss.gov.ph/\"\u003eSSS online website\u003c/a\u003e. There are several methods to register an account, but all of them will require your SSS No. plus a secondary set of information to verify your identity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe secondary info can be something a mobile number or savings account number already registered with SSS, or a Payment Reference Number (PRN) previously used (more on PRNs later). If you\u0026rsquo;re like me and you\u0026rsquo;ve had zero interactions with SSS in the past, the easiest way is to get the SSS Employer number for your last employer. (If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a previous employer, I suspect you have to go to the SSS office and ask for advice there.) Hopefully you haven\u0026rsquo;t burned your bridges and can just ask them for this information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#44f5afa62540b9f947dad54259f2337b-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2020/03/how-to-make-voluntary-sss-payments/sss-registration_huf3e6c771291eb65c97c6bff49990b5cb_40807_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"44f5afa62540b9f947dad54259f2337b-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2020/03/how-to-make-voluntary-sss-payments/sss-registration.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"9 Mar 2020 12:00am\"\u003e9 Mar 2020 12:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOk, so I signed up by providing this information, so now I have an account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNext step: Generate a PRN.\u003c/strong\u003e A PRN is a Payment Reference Number, basically a record of the payment you want to make. after you log in to the SSS web application, click the \u0026ldquo;Payment Reference Number (PRN)\u0026rdquo; tab and click \u0026ldquo;Generate PRN\u0026rdquo;.

This is currently through a service called \u003ca href=\"https://moneygment.ph/\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;Moneygment\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never tried it myself so I have no feedback other than that is a terrible name for an app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe SSS website also \u003ca href=\"https://www.sss.gov.ph/sss/appmanager/pages.jsp?page=eservices\"\u003eclaims that it is possible to pay via BancNet or Unionbank\u003c/a\u003e. When I checked the Unionbank web application, there was no option to pay to SSS as a biller, so I guess that\u0026rsquo;s out. BancNet Online is only available to \u003ca href=\"https://www.bancnetonline.com/BancnetWeb/view/goToUserPreRegistrationPage.do\"\u003eaccounts in certain banks\u003c/a\u003e, none of which apply to me, so I can\u0026rsquo;t do that either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, what I\u0026rsquo;ve tried is I go and make a payment at the nearest Bayad Center. Yes, I need to go out and interact with people like this was the 1990s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, you go to the Bayad Center and you ask for a form for SSS member contribution. You fill up the form, including the PRN number you want to pay, and make the payment. It\u0026rsquo;s relatively painless, aside from the having to go to the Bayad Center in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout a week after making the payment, I suggested logging in to the SSS website again and checking your account details to see if the payment was recognized, just to make sure everything went fine. IDK how it could go wrong, but this is the government, so better safe than sorry!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: I was using the old SSS webapp for this (and the screenshots above). They also have a publicly-accessible beta of their \u003ca href=\"https://portal.sss.gov.ph/member/\"\u003enew member portal\u003c/a\u003e. It uses the same account as the old webapp, and it looks \u003cem\u003eslightly\u003c/em\u003e less dated. However, I could not find a screen in the beta member portal for generating the PRNs, so you might be stuck using the old webapp.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The Trump administration seems to be handling things poorly, which would be typical to expect of an administration not used to transparency or integrity. For all our sakes they need to get their act together. The PH government appears to be doing slightly better (assuming no hidden epidemic), although their messaging still seems to be all over the place. Some local governments have started suspending classes and private business are now requiring self-quarantines, and rumor has it the Greenhills business district was a ghost town the last few days after a confirmed case identified in that area. Bill Gates famously warned a few years ago that a global pandemic may be the most predictable threat to the world in modern times, but let\u0026rsquo;s hope our governments can get their act together and get this thing under control. Otherwise, the future may look like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n    On \n    \u003ca href=\"/2020/03/1236252441600872449/\"\u003e\u003ctime datetime=\"2020-03-07 11:28:45\"\u003e7 Mar 2020 11:28am\u003c/time\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n    I wrote:\n    \u003cblockquote\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eThe year is 2034.

So let\u0026rsquo;s talk US politics for a bit. I\u0026rsquo;m not an American so my opinion isn\u0026rsquo;t worth much, but US politics disproportionately affects the rest of the world, so I think we get to comment too. Besides, a vast majority of the Americans I follow on Twitter are either liberal or quiet on politics, so I\u0026rsquo;m kind of accidentally exposed to the Democrats\u0026rsquo; POV a lot of the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, the Democratic Primaries: More or less down to Biden or Sanders. I think Biden is the favorite at the moment; my opinion on him is largely summarized by a meme I say (but can no longer find again) where his image was given the treatment similar to the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_%22Hope%22_poster\"\u003eObama hope poster\u003c/a\u003e, except with the caption \u0026ldquo;MEDIOCRE FOR ALL\u0026rdquo;. He seems like the type of candidate you get when the base is largely divided and people have to settle on a \u0026ldquo;least common denominator\u0026rdquo; kind of candidate. I like Sanders, but his electability is a real issue (because Americans are so indoctrinated against anything that could remotely be-called \u0026ldquo;socialism\u0026rdquo;) and so are his \u0026ldquo;Bernie bros\u0026rdquo;. If he\u0026rsquo;s able to move the needle towards the left even a little for the Democrat base/establishment, that would be great. It\u0026rsquo;s too bad the race is down to two old white guys. I liked Warren as a candidate more than Sanders, but her being a woman was also a downside in misogynist America. None of Sanders\u0026rsquo; or Warren\u0026rsquo;s progressive programs are going to mean anything if they can\u0026rsquo;t retake the Senate though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, the outcome of the US political process may very well affect the future of liberal democracy worldwide, as they have been slipping further and further away from that ideal during the past couple of decades, emboldening populists and strongmen in other countries, including my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a personal level, my week was exhausting. Mostly due to social events necessitating travel to far-flung parts of the Metro and also filial duties requiring me to spend inordinate amounts of time in hospital waiting rooms. Nothing serious, just accompanying some loved ones for regular tests and checkups, but am severely annoyed by the obvious lack of doctors causing severe waiting times for patients. One of the arguments against universal health care is that it would increase waiting times and such, I wonder if that\u0026rsquo;s something that\u0026rsquo;s happening here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaming: I got \u003ca href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription/february-2020\"\u003elast month\u0026rsquo;s Humble Choice\u003c/a\u003e, mostly by default. The main draw for me was \u003cstrong\u003eFrostpunk\u003c/strong\u003e which some friends had been recommending. And I also promised someone that I would stream a survival game blind, so I \u003ca href=\"/2020/03/1235920529233776640/\"\u003edid that for Frostpunk last week\u003c/a\u003e. Otherwise, we\u0026rsquo;re kind of in a holding pattern until the FF7R release next month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonal projects: Not much progress the past week. I need to plan out some new features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaid work: Billed a small amount of time, mostly for consulting meetings. Same old, same old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe did two quizzes last week. The first was for fun, and I missed probably my only chance to win first place by enumerating Street Fighter II characters; the game mechanic was such that we needed to bid on how many we could enumerate (max 15 out of 20), and I initially wanted to bid 15 but I was talked down and made to doubt myself and we instead bid 10. I actually got 16 (forgot about the extra evil fighters in succeeding remakes), but since we only bid 10, that\u0026rsquo;s what we got and we ended up losing by 1 point. This decision may haunt me forever lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond quiz was for the Geekfight League we\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this year. We only finished second place, but that was enough to give us the solo lead in the league rankings, so that was a better outcome than the previous quiz. (And this loss was more \u0026ldquo;we really didn\u0026rsquo;t know the answers\u0026rdquo; vs \u0026ldquo;we did know the answers but we screwed up\u0026rdquo; so it was less feels-bad)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSite changes this week:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMinor theme updates\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSome older posts have been receiving a lot of spam via the comment form.

            "summary": "The Week That Was: The COVID19 pandemic is starting to pick up steam, both internationally (including the US) and here in the Philippines. The Trump administration seems to be handling things poorly, which would be typical to expect of an administration not used to transparency or integrity. For all our sakes they need to get their act together. The PH government appears to be doing slightly better (assuming no hidden epidemic), although their messaging still seems to be all over the place.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eFor the past month, most of my gaming time was spent on the Steam version of Tales of Berseria, which I got from a Humble Monthly Bundle back in 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummary: One of the best entries in the Tales series. Has fun combat, a great cast, a darker story and a really good aesthetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy notes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of the Tales series of games, ever since Phantasia on the SNES and Destiny on the PS1, and I take the opportunity to play them whenever they come out for a console I actually have. I\u0026rsquo;m especially a fan of how their real-time battle engine has evolved over the years, and version in the Berseria may be one of my favorites.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe combat balance is slightly tilted in favor of the heroine Velvet, but the rest of the party members are reasonably fun to play as well and each have their roles.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI played majority of the first run on Hard difficulty, I think I dropped to Moderate a couple of times in the bonus dungeon, just to get things over with. Hard difficulty had a reasonable balance: if I wasn\u0026rsquo;t paying attention to random encounters, there was a nontrivial chance I could just die. (And I did, more than once!). You have to look out for Risky Encounters (back attacks!) or Dangerous Encounters (when you trigger more than one mob groups at the same time), as both those encounters give the mobs serious advantages. And then, there\u0026rsquo;s the Dire Foes, boss-type mobs with invincible minions that show up unannounced at the end of battle if you\u0026rsquo;re doing too well in a certain area. They\u0026rsquo;re great for farming grade later on, but the first few times I encountered one led to a game over due to me being unprepared. As you can tell, I like a bit of challenge in my random encounters, I like that if I\u0026rsquo;m not focused, I might die. For the second achievement-focused run, I played all of it on the highest difficulty (Chaos), though that was blunted by the XP boosts.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of the game\u0026rsquo;s cel-shaded aesthetic as well. I took a whole bunch of screenshots, you can see them later in this post!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe story is a bit atypical of Tales games where you\u0026rsquo;re usually some chosen hero out to save the world. In this case you start out more as a villain/anti-hero and are out for revenge in a Count of Monte Cristo kind of way. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely darkier/edgier than most Tales games, although there are still light-hearted moments along the way. You spend most of the story as fugitives opposing the dominant authority of the era. The rest of your party members are mostly in the same boat: rogues and escaped criminals and pirates and rebels and whatnot. It\u0026rsquo;s a refreshing change of pace.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBerseria also acts as long-ago prequel for Tales of Zestiria, though the world map is mostly different (due to certain in-game events vastly changing geography at the end of Berseria), it was fun to revisit that world and remember how everything lines up with what happened in Zestiria.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI did two runs for the achievement completion. Total playtime came out to 119 hours, which seems like a lot, but for comparison, when I finished \u003ca href=\"/2016/01/690206344666750976/\"\u003eTales of Zestiria back in 2016\u003c/a\u003e, my playtime clocked in at a whopping 472 hours (where did I find the time?!?), so Berseria actually took a lot less time. Tales games typically have a lot of super-grindy achievements, Berseria had some, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as bad as it usually was, I would guess my overall grinding specifically for achievements took less than ten hours total.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHappy to see Milla and Jude appear as cameo characters in this one, as Xillia was one of my favorite ones, and Milla may be my favorite character design in the Tales series overall. (They\u0026rsquo;re in a bunch of screenshots below!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn the screenshots below, you can see that I had everyone wear Normin suits for the second run lol. I like how the Tales series has introduced cosmetics with the advent of 3d models. It\u0026rsquo;s not unreasonable as DLC, since they\u0026rsquo;re not really essential, but they can also be fun.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what RPG I\u0026rsquo;m playing next - FF7R is coming out in April, and I already have it preordered; there might not be time to squeeze in another long one in between.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScreenshots follow!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The \u0026ldquo;(Spoiler)\u0026rdquo; anchor changes the URL hash to point to the id of the \u003ccode\u003espoiler_target\u003c/code\u003e element, and we use the CSS \u003ccode\u003e+\u003c/code\u003e operator to display the actual spoiler content when the \u003ccode\u003e:target\u003c/code\u003e pseudo-selector is activated. I originally tried it with the id being assigned directly to the spoiler content, but this had the problem of \u0026ldquo;jumping around\u0026rdquo;, i.e. clicking the \u0026ldquo;(Spoiler)\u0026rdquo; link would scroll the page to the anchor location. The workaround for this was separating the target anchor from the spoiler content, making the anchor hidden (no text) and adding \u003ccode\u003eposition:fixed\u003c/code\u003e (to prevent the scrolling). The \u0026ldquo;Hide\u0026rdquo; link simply sets the URL hash location back to \u0026ldquo;#\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

He ends the thread with:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ccite class=\"u-quotation-of h-cite\"\u003e\n    Quoted \u003ca  href='https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1234146067589029890'\u003epatio11\u0026#39;s tweet\u003c/a\u003e:\n\u003c/cite\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n    Don\u0026rsquo;t date your work!\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I enjoy Patrick\u0026rsquo;s writing a lot; he has consistently written a lot of good, evergreen articles that would be helpful regardless of whether they were a decade old or not. Just browse through \u003ca href=\"https://www.kalzumeus.com/greatest-hits/\"\u003ehis Greatest Hits page\u003c/a\u003e for some examples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, it\u0026rsquo;s a hard disagree for me on this particular point. Aside from saying that people who judge your posts\u0026rsquo; relevance by how old they are might not be the sort of high-quality audience one would prefer, I think the date of publication remains contextually an important part of the context of an article, regardless of whether the advice therein remains forever relevant. It is sage advice that one should prefer writing things that do not depreciate with time, but Patrick may be the exception rather than the norm here, in that many of his essays remain of interest even a decade later. But for most of the content of the internet, I\u0026rsquo;d still prefer having dates clearly visible for context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlight tangent: Just last week, while watching John Oliver episodes on Youtube and was annoyed how all the recommended videos on the sidebar don\u0026rsquo;t show the dates.

Which brings me to my next point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart the second:\u003c/strong\u003e I shared this article recently: \u003ca href=\"https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/\"\u003eThe Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral\u003c/a\u003e. The TLDR is that modern publishing paradigms typically revolve around a \u0026ldquo;Stream\u0026rdquo; metaphor, i.e. social media timelines, chronological blog posts, etc, but we can also consider as an alternative a \u0026ldquo;Garden\u0026rdquo; metaphor, which is less date-centric but more wiki-like and focused on how ideas interrelate. The article is more about a federated wiki, but that\u0026rsquo;s my general takeaway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about something like this recently with regards to my own writing. I\u0026rsquo;ve \u003ca href=\"/2020/02/thoughts-on-blogging-2020-edition/\"\u003ementioned before\u003c/a\u003e that my writing on this site \u0026ldquo;consists of thoughts-in-the-moment, a snapshot of where my thinking is at that time, to be built upon and to be evolved later on\u0026rdquo;. But I\u0026rsquo;ve also been thinking that there might be room for a more permanent or maybe wiki-style of page that consolidates these moving parts into a coherent state. This is kind of similar to the \u0026ldquo;Garden\u0026rdquo; metaphor mentioned above. But I suppose I have to ruminate a bit more on what that might look like and what kind of content might appear there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooping back to part the first: I guess patio11\u0026rsquo;s more evergreen content belongs more in a \u0026ldquo;Garden\u0026rdquo;-like arrangement, rather than the \u0026ldquo;blogging form factor\u0026rdquo; he has been using for a while now. I like that he put together that \u0026ldquo;Greatest Hits\u0026rdquo; page. One thing I do when I find a new personal blog to follow is to browse around the last few posts to see what kind of content is generally there, but the most recent items aren\u0026rsquo;t always representative of why you\u0026rsquo;d like to follow a blog. So a page like that \u0026ldquo;Greatest Hits\u0026rdquo; one serves as a nice feature to help new readers get a sense of what sort of things to expect, independently of the date \u0026ldquo;Stream\u0026rdquo;. This was also the rationale as to why I added the \u003ca href=\"/tags/favorites\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;Featured Posts\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e link in the sidebar. during the \u003ca href=\"/2020/02/redesign/\"\u003emost recent redesign\u003c/a\u003e. (Although I still have to review more of this blog\u0026rsquo;s 18ish year history to add posts to that section!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn conclusion:\u003c/strong\u003e put dates on your posts! But maybe also have an alternative way to browse them isn\u0026rsquo;t date-sensitive.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Probably the best movie I\u0026rsquo;ve seen this month was \u003cstrong\u003eKnives Out\u003c/strong\u003e. (\u003cstrong\u003eJojo Rabbit\u003c/strong\u003e close second.) The goal of 200 movies for the year is getting farther!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for TV, I think most of my watching time was spent rewatching \u003cstrong\u003eRick and Morty\u003c/strong\u003e for quiz purposes lol. Well, \u003ca href=\"/2020/02/criminal-minds/\"\u003eCriminal Minds\u003c/a\u003e ended, so there\u0026rsquo;s that. Arrowverse has been meh, though I did enjoy \u003cstrong\u003eSupergirl\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026rsquo;s 100th episode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHm, I guess I haven\u0026rsquo;t actually watched a lot of stuff in the past month. There\u0026rsquo;s a ton of stuff that I\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting to watch but haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten around to: The Expanse, Star Trek Picard, new season of Jack Ryan, Birds of Prey/Harley Quinn, and so on. We\u0026rsquo;ll see if things get better next month maybe?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonus, since this entry was kinda short: Here\u0026rsquo;s three movies I started watching but didn\u0026rsquo;t manage to finish:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2001: A Space Odyssey\u003c/strong\u003e. It started off with like 20 minutes of some monkeys shouting at each other and a mysterious black box and I kind of lost interest. I\u0026rsquo;m sure that kind of thing was fine in 1968 when the movie came out and the people whose butts were already in the theatre were like \u0026ldquo;this is strange, but we\u0026rsquo;re already here, so we might as well sit through it\u0026rdquo;, but it\u0026rsquo;s 2020, I kind of need something to hold my internet-broken attention span more easily. It\u0026rsquo;s also one of the most renowned and highly-praised movies of all time, so I\u0026rsquo;m probably losing something here. Will try to resume it sometime.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Conjuring\u003c/strong\u003e. We have a horror-movie themed quiz category coming up so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d watch a horror movie. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve voluntarily done so since having been mentally scarred by \u003cstrong\u003eThe Gate (1987)\u003c/strong\u003e as a kid. I picked The Conjuring, it was first on Netflix\u0026rsquo;s list of horror movies. I sat through the appropriately-creepy intro, then one of my quiz teammates told me he\u0026rsquo;d already unwillingly seen it before and couldn\u0026rsquo;t sleep for a week after, and I was like \u0026ldquo;You just gave me an excuse not to watch it.\u0026rdquo; so I stopped.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCarrie (2013)\u003c/strong\u003e. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to give up on horror movies just yet, so I picked another title from Netflix. I chose this one because it had Hit-Girl. It started out with typical teenage bullying stuff before she manifested her mutant powers and after that I kept thinking they needed to contact Professor Xavier, and couldn\u0026rsquo;t take it seriously after that.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",
