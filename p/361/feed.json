Something like a cellphone conversation with my brother who\u0026rsquo;s standing in a store in Singapore pressuring me with \u0026ldquo;Well? Should I buy one or not?\u0026rdquo; I don\u0026rsquo;t like pressure, so obviously I just said, \u0026ldquo;Ok, whatever!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inevitable question arises: which one is better, PSP or NDS? A friend asked me if they have different types of games, and I tell her that the NDS has more fun/casual games, while the PSP has more action-oriented stuff. So I guess it really depends on your taste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe NDS is a fun piece of equipment and I had enjoyed it so much I bought a 2nd one when I saw a cheap price, yet lately the PSP has been garnering more attention from me. Two obvious reasons: (a) it\u0026rsquo;s new and (b) \u003cstrong\u003eFinal Fantasy Tactics\u003c/strong\u003e, most likely my favorite game of \u003cstrong\u003eall time\u003c/strong\u003e is available on the PSP with rewritten dialogue, added characters and added battles. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s better than the NDS in the long run is hard to say, as \u003cstrong\u003eAce Attorney 4 \u0026ndash; Apollo Justice\u003c/strong\u003e lies in the short distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, the presence of \u003cstrong\u003eStreet Fighter Alpha 3 Max\u003c/strong\u003e on the PSP, along with the inevitable need to learn \u003cstrong\u003eTekken: Dark Resurrection\u003c/strong\u003e\nso I can beat up the guys at work is a strong incentive to buy a 2nd PSP. But I\u0026rsquo;m not that rich/impulsive. Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the end of the lifetime of the PS2, I had been thinking that I may never again play console-style long games in the vein of \u003cstrong\u003eFinal Fantasy\u003c/strong\u003e, but the PSP can possibly bring me back into that fold. PSX-style games on a handheld is huge, as one of the biggest drawbacks of playing on a console was needing to be stuck in front of a television to play those games. Amusingly, most of the games I have on the PSP now are ports/remakes of Playstation-era (or earlier!) games, which shows my preference for older games. I\u0026rsquo;m not even aware of what other games are available now \u0026ndash; FF Tactics takes up way too much of my mindspace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to go play some more\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

later with the card list. For now, tourney report!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1, game 1: His deck was something like black, red and white. I remember seeing a Shard Volley, Shriekmaw, Eyeblight\u0026rsquo;s Ending, and a Nameless Inversion. Surprisingly, I still manage to get out Drowner + 2 Schoolmaster + Merrow Commerce. The first time I tap the Commerce to mill him, he asks me why I\u0026rsquo;m tapping the enchantment. I keep getting that question for the rest of the day. He reads the cards, and scoops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1, game 2: We both keep six-handers, but mine has a lot more gas. He\u0026rsquo;s stuck on a single mountain and I\u0026rsquo;m attacking with a couple of dorks. He tries to stay alive by saccing his lone land to Shard Volley, but I have the Spellstutter Sprite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe play an extra round for fun, but I still take it with damage, although he did put up more of a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2, game 1: I win by lib-death again. Needed only a single Schoolmaster this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2, game 2: Turn four he plays Boldwyr Heavyweights. I search out and play Guile. He swings for eight. I topdeck Weight of Conscience. He manages to kill Guile (duh\u0026hellip; Final Sting Faerie). I manage to draw him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3, game 1: I overcommit the Drowner and the Schoolmaster + a couple of other guys, and he shows me an Incendiary Command. Feast of Footbottomgives him back some elves and I scoop to damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3, game 2: We race about evenly, but then I swing with five creatures; he thinks he\u0026rsquo;s only taking eight, but I show him the Swell of Courage for the win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3, game 3: My notes tell me I dealt no damage this game. I was basically behind all game, and I was at one when he drew the Incendiary Command again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4, game 1: My opponent asks the players on the adjacent table and ask if I\u0026rsquo;m really allowed to tap it for Drowner. They nod and look at the Drowner, the Schoolmaster and the Commerce and advise him to scoop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4, game 2: I was well in control here, locking down the board with Stonybrook Angler. He used a Warren Pilferers to champion into a Boggart Mob. I brought out Guile. He swings with mob, I figure if Guile blocks, he\u0026rsquo;ll just get back the Mob with Pilferers and recast, wasting his mana. Guile blocks the Mob to kill it. Blunder \u0026ndash; I had forgotten he had a Shriekmaw in the yard, which he promptly gets to dispose of my Incarnation. I lose to the wave of goblins and quickly shuffle up for game 3.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4, game 3: Anticlimactic, as he drew no gas and all lands while I was beating with 2 1/1s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal record: 3-1. Three packs as prize, plus the foil Earwig. Not a bad way to start off Limited this year.\u003c/p\u003e",

No outright bombs or cash rares, but I immediately spot the Drowner of Secrets + Merrow Commerce + 2 Stonybrook Schoolmasters. I had reasonable fliers and permission, so I built the blue-white deck. My only removal being a Weight of Conscience that I did not actually put in the maindeck.\u003c/p\u003e",

That includes the start menu, the panel, the system tray, and icons on the desktop. This isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad thing per se, but I got confused by the icons on the desktop being widgets. They have some widget controls around them that allow me to rotate or remove them from view. I was like \u0026ldquo;Eh? Why would I want to rotate the icons one-by-one? And will clicking this X thing delete the file?\u0026rdquo; And the icons don\u0026rsquo;t have the usual context menu for files. Apparently it\u0026rsquo;s designed so that the icons on the desktop are not treated as files inside a file manager. I realize it\u0026rsquo;s intended to be a completely different paradigm, but it just threw me off.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOccasional slowdown.

I understand it\u0026rsquo;s hard on your financial situation, but a lot of people take longer to find work. if you just jump on to the first job you\u0026rsquo;re offered, you\u0026rsquo;re more likely to get a crappy job\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(08:20:28 PHT) Roy: 2. \u0026ldquo;java programmer\u0026rdquo; means that you specialize in java only. unfortunately, the good jobs for programmers all require you to be easily able to learn new stuff (particularly programming languages), as needed. it\u0026rsquo;s alright to try to get your foot in the door using java, but you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t restrict yourself to that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(08:21:52 PHT) Roy: regarding that blog post\u0026hellip; looking back, I\u0026rsquo;m glad that I did not get that job, as it was obviously not the right company for me. you need to figure out what kind of company you want to work for. personally, I prefer working for a company that really does software, instead of a bank or something that just happens to need some in-house programmers\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is 100% true. If you are serious about having a career in software programming, you should avoid working for companies whose primary product is not software. You will get a lot more respect in a dedicated software-development company.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(08:23:40 PHT) Roy: lastly, and this one is a bit harsh: being a programmer is hard. the good companies won\u0026rsquo;t take you in unless you\u0026rsquo;re really smart. make sure you have what it takes. try to improve your problem solving or learning skills in your spare time. try to learn a new language, etc. your background works against you here, as I know for a fact that most of the good software shops prefer to hire from the big 3 (UP, Ateneo, Lasalle)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe bias I mention here is certainly true. In my place of work probably a good 80%-90% of people at least are from the big three. And most of our recruitment drives are geared towards those three schools. I\u0026rsquo;m sure it\u0026rsquo;s the same in all the \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; software shops. Whether this reflects the quality of those schools\u0026rsquo; graduates or just an inherent bias in recruitment, it is a real bias that graduates of other schools have to recognize and work to overcome.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking back at the conversation this morning, I wonder if I did not come off as a bit elitist or something, focusing my advise on looking for \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; companies and all. I can afford to say all this now since I have a good, stable job, but I wonder how it would have felt hearing that advice when you\u0026rsquo;re running out of cash and desperately needed work? I guess I have to say that if you really need to take a crappy job, then take a crappy job. But be aware that it\u0026rsquo;s a crappy job, and figure out how you plan to climb out of it and find something better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;d also like to reiterate that these are just my opinions \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;m certainly no expert on job hunting, having been lucky enough to land a nice job after almost a year of being a bum and lazily submitting resumes. 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "No, I\u0026rsquo;m not job hunting. But other people are, apparently. I got a comment on an old post I made about my job hunting days. Not only that, but the guy IM\u0026rsquo;d me asking to talk (I put my yahoo id on this site somewhere me). It\u0026rsquo;s a bit strange, but I figured, why not? What I got from listening to him was that he was just extremely frustrated at how difficult it is to find a good job, so he was looking for people who had gone through similar experiences.",

So for our weekend trip to Albay to visit our new sister-in-law\u0026rsquo;s family, I booked 3 two-way Cebu Pacific tickets for my brothers and myself. Our parents would take the bus since it was slightly cheaper and they didn\u0026rsquo;t mind sleeping on the road. The other reason was that my two brothers had never ridden a plane before \u0026ndash; this would be their first time. First domestic flight for me as well. As expected, they were excited like giddy shoolboys, taking pictures on the way up the plane and leaning towards the window and all that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suppose it was to be expected, but the airport in Legazpi was a far cry from the Manila one. Practically a strip of road labeled as the runway and a small building labeled a terminal. The flight itself was fine but obviously budget. I have been spoiled by PAL. And of course the view of Legazpi City was a lot more green than Metro Manila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, there was Mayon, visible as soon as we descended from the clouds. Unfortunately the peak stayed hidden from us for the entire weekend, maybe another time. Still, Sunday morning we climbed Lignon Hill, which is a lot smaller than Mayon. We were hoping that by the time we finish the 30-minute walk to the top the peak would show itself. No such luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walk upwards was\u0026hellip; invigorating in a way. I have a newfound respect for slopes. The road we were walking on our way to the peak can\u0026rsquo;t have been more than 30 degrees at its most difficult, yet my leg muscles felt dead tired before we were halfway up. Just shows how out of shape I was. The trip down was much faster of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the stay was mostly eating and shopping for \u003cem\u003epasalubong.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, I suck at buying gifts for people so I\u0026rsquo;m glad I had a DS while everyone else was walking around the informal \u003cem\u003etiangge\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur parents dropped us off at the airport in time for the return flight. We checked in and sat down to wait. The rain outside started getting worse, and eventually there was a message that our flight is canceled. Boo! After asking around, I was told I\u0026rsquo;d get a full refund for the round trip flight. (So we got to fly to Albay for free) I called up my parents and asked them to get us bus tickets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I mentioned at the start, traveling by land sucks. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to sleep, and I\u0026rsquo;m prone to motion-sickness on extended bus trips. Still, we made it back to Manila alive and well. I had a bit of a headache and some of the aforementioned nausea and hardly any sleep, as I expected\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Terrible way to start the year. My own fault for bringing an outdated version of Mannequin to the tournament without even any testing. The meta is heavily Faeries and Elves it seems, and I think the Faerie matchup is bad, as I\u0026rsquo;ve never won a round against it (or my build is too inefficient). Elves matchup should be managable since they don\u0026rsquo;t have tempo on me, but I was playing so badly I even lost to BG Tarmorack which I used to consider a good matchup. BGW Doran is strong \u0026ndash; I played 3 more games with him after I lost the first 2, I think he got the elf/birds into Doran start 4 out of 5 games.

I also need more Pithing Needles as I keep randomly losing to manlands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo Magic for me for the next two weeks though, due to personal matters.

I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if there\u0026rsquo;s any important reason to backup all the episodes I\u0026rsquo;ve been watching to DVD when I\u0026rsquo;ve already watched them all. Of course the argument can be made that it makes it easier to lend out to people, but truth be told there are a lot of people I know who already have such copies so my keeping backups is just redundant. And it\u0026rsquo;s not like the world would end if someone wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to borrow the last season of Heroes off me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m especially wary now about committing stuff to optical media; going through all the discs I had I encountered quite a few that were already beyond recovery. I\u0026rsquo;m considering reburning some of the older stuff from CDs to DVDs, both to conserve space and to make sure I can still access those old files later on.

At least I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to consume at least 90% of the stuff I archive. I guess it\u0026rsquo;s a geek thing, to want to have access to \u0026ldquo;historical data\u0026rdquo; and stuff. Organizing all of it is probably a geek thing too. Heck, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to think of a way to have everything be searchable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m considering buying something like a 250 GB external and just using that as a backup.

I\u0026rsquo;ve played in a few Limited tourneys before that, but I guess I took them with a different DCI number as they don\u0026rsquo;t reflect on my ratings history. In particular I remember placing 2nd at a Team Sealed event at BCI Makati back during the Invasion block era. And I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I went 4-0 at an Onslaught prerelease, as I have the shirt to prove it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs can be seen in the stats page though, this was the year I started taking it seriously. I devoted more time to Magic, studying my own technical play for faults and missteps, struggling to learn from every mistake. I read more articles online and tried to practice on Magic Online more to improve my game.  I joined more tournaments (31 this year versus 18 the previous year), and got 9 top 8\u0026rsquo;s this year as opposed to 2 last year. (Granted, some of those were for Prereleases :p) I managed a GPT top 8 and a PTQ top 8 this year, my first ones ever!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I have a long way to go towards improving. I was disappointed to find out my match win percentage was under 60% (although I have no idea how much higher the match win percentage of top players would be.) For next year I hope I can push that win percentage even more, make fewer misplays and get more PTQ top 8s (although I doubt I will be able to play in the extended season\u0026hellip; maybe Block Constructed). My goal is to stabilize my rating in the top 75 of the Philippines so that I can play in Nationals without having to go through those horrendous qualifiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWish me luck 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Not because I\u0026rsquo;m tired of it or anything, but because I\u0026rsquo;ve run out of people to play with. Unlike last year where we had enough players in the office to occasionally have an 8-man draft, this year most of the Magic players have either switched to WoW or moved to a different company/country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are only two of us seriously playing now, so our card pool has become so much smaller. That also means less preparation for constructed formats as it\u0026rsquo;s harder to get serious playtesting done. Having a team and a shared card pool makes a huge difference. You can see this easily because so many of the players that repeatedly hit top 8 in the local tourneys are known members of a team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not  sure how I\u0026rsquo;ll proceed next year, but I\u0026rsquo;m not quitting. I love to play the game and will make do with what I have if I need to. I\u0026rsquo;m even contemplating playing in the Extended PTQs, although how I can gather the needed cards for that is still a mystery!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

makes me sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first round matchup is against one of the more veteran players. He\u0026rsquo;s playing some R-B-W combination, fast aggro stuff. I\u0026rsquo;m faster in game 1 and manage to play Colfenor\u0026rsquo;s Plans, attracting some onlookers who told me it was a deathtrap. I had read about some pros liking it and wanted to try it out. The logic being, if you\u0026rsquo;re out of cards anyway, and you can only play one spell per turn anyway (the one you topdeck), and you can win with just a bit more push, might as well grab the next seven cards immediately. As one of the judges pointed out, I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to play the plans, it was plain greedy, since my opponent was at six and I had a flier and two Tar Pitchers out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame 2, I hit Footbottom Feast targetting Spiderwig Boggart then I put the Boggart in my hand then said, \u0026ldquo;draw a card from feast\u0026rdquo;. I looked at the top card before my opponent could stop me. Oops, of course the Boggart was already the draw from the feast, so I got a warning for looking at extra cards and the judge shuffles my deck. I\u0026rsquo;m glad it\u0026rsquo;s not a game loss, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter as I lose to an aggressive Blades of Velis Vel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame 3, I mull to five and am unable to recover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1: 1-2 loss. Yes, not a good start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond round is\u0026hellip; some guy. Don\u0026rsquo;t recall what he was playing. I win in 2 games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2: 2-0 win\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird round is a guy I\u0026rsquo;ve been up against a few times before. His deck is black-green but light on removal. I power out Giants, he stacks Treefolk on his side to keep me from attacking, dragging out the game. (I hate fighting Black Poplars!) but eventually I take it in 2 games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3: 2-0 win\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFourth round is against one of the better limited players around, he plays fast so somehow I\u0026rsquo;m forced to match his pace. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember his deck, though it must have had blue because I remember getting countered. We trade the first two games, and I draw no gas for game three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: 1-2 loss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I am X-2 once again. Sigh, it has not been a good limited PTQ season for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5 was fun. He\u0026rsquo;s white-green. Game 1 I\u0026rsquo;m losing badly to his early creatures, but then I hit Spiderwig giving Axegrinder fear (six damage), sac the Spiderwig to Fodder Launch one of his guys (+5 damage). End of his turn I footbottom the Spiderwig to give the Axegrinder fear again, dealing 17 damage in two turns to win from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame 2 I get hit by the early aggro rush again and am unable to recover. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember game 3, but my notes tell me hit was pretty bad for him as I took no damage at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5: 2-1 win\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6, my opponent is a merfolk deck with Springleaf Drum, Falloysage and Veteran of the Depths, which gets annoying quick. I hold on for a long time in game 1 before succumbing to School tokens. Game 2 I keep a hand with Adder-Staff, 2 Lash Outs and another creature. I play the Adder-Staff and Lash Out his first two creatures, which I soon regret as his third play is a Veteran that goes all the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6: 0-2 loss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSigh, I\u0026rsquo;m not even getting prizes anymore. I tick \u0026ldquo;Drop\u0026rdquo; on the result slip, then change my mind and cross it out. I want to play the last round to at least get some practice\u0026hellip; hopefully my play skill can improve just a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 7: 0-2 loss. Bleah. I think my play was tight, but he just drew better cards. I remember he had an Epic Proportions that stopped my Lash Outs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA 3-4 finish, how terrible. Before this season I had actually envisioned myself as a decent limited player. Obviously, Lorwyn limited is hard, I need to do so much to improve my deck construction and technical play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext: Morningtide Release Events? I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to play in the prerelease since I\u0026rsquo;ll be out of town\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Impulsiveness made me throw away this game and I vow it will never EVER happen again. It was game one, I was dead to his next swing, but 3 of my guys were fliers and I drew into Final Revels. I quickly went for +2/+0 thinking I had enough damage to win the game. As he considered his options I realize the miscount and that he would live with 1 life, killing me the next turn with two Kithkin guys with no blockers. Oh man, what an idiot. I just saw the Final Revels topdeck and played it without thinking. NEVER AGAIN. I figure I\u0026rsquo;ll recover in game 2, but I draw no lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSigh. 1 and 2 after 3 rounds.

I just bring in 3 Vesuvan Shapeshifters to handle his Red Akroma and Hellkites. Game two, he shows me the other 10% of his deck that would give me fits: Chandra Nalar. My entire offense literally stops after Chandra takes down one creature and Incinerate knocks out my last one. I lose to the card disadvantage and proceed to search my board for answers to Chandra. I had none (I don\u0026rsquo;t own any Pithing Needles sir), so I just sucked it up and decided to try for a fast aggro kill. I had a good hand too \u0026ndash; Faerie Conclave into suspended Cloudskate. But midgame he shows me another aspect of his deck \u0026ndash; land destruction. I get hit by Avalanche Riders and Mwonvuli Acid-Moss and he even shows me his sideboarded card: Rootgrapple! I have mana problems up to the end, and he even gets Chandra out again.
