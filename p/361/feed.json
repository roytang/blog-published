I drank the Kool-Aid all the way on this one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull \u0026ndash; classic Indy goodness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncredible Hulk \u0026ndash; Edward Norton is cast brilliantly here, a choice on the same level as Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man. And they addressed the issue of Hulk\u0026rsquo;s stretchy pants!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWanted \u0026ndash; The story is decent, although the Loom of Fate weirded me out a bit. But let\u0026rsquo;s face it, you\u0026rsquo;re really here for the kickass gun battles, and the movie pretty much delivers. Remember back when bullet time from the Matrix was a big deal? The gun battles here are like a generation up from that. I love the gunfight through the factory, and the train battle was pretty much insane. The ending was meh, but at least it wasn\u0026rsquo;t some generic \u0026ldquo;good guy wins and gets the girl\u0026rdquo; (er, spoiler much?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I now have a laptop, I\u0026rsquo;ve also been able to watch more movies on DVD as well:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e21 \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s undeniably a geek movie. If you want to watch it, you need a geek with you to explain how card counting in Blackjack works. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty good, and also doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any predictable \u0026ldquo;hero wins it all\u0026rdquo; ending. Based on a true story, but I think the win rate may be highly exaggerated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kingdom \u0026ndash; we actually just needed something to watch. Something with guns and explosions. This movie did the job. Jamie Fox and Jennifer Gardner are FBI agents who went into Saudi Arabia to hunt down a terrorist. The nice thing is that they don\u0026rsquo;t portray the Arabian police as incompetent and are instead useful allies, i.e. the Americans don\u0026rsquo;t hog all the work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve also managed to watch a few random crap movies as background noise (Monster in Law, Norbit \u0026ndash; god, HBO seems to be showing this stupid movie all the time!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpcoming movies I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to: Dark Knight, obv. Although Hancock seems interesting as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It\u0026rsquo;s also my first time working with an OS that has Windows Update enabled, and some people have told me how annoying the restart prompts are especially while playing games. Luckily, I can afford to restart right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, Vista seems okay, and I believe it\u0026rsquo;s a good upgrade to XP, which has been getting boring to me. I was originally planning on dual-booting this laptop with Linux, but I think I\u0026rsquo;ll stick with Vista for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

before, so I had a good idea what to expect. In game one we have a staring contest, building up lands and trading counters over evoked Mulldrifters. I take the early beats and drop to three with him at around fourteen. End of my turn he Mannequins a Thresher and I have no blockers. Crap! I\u0026rsquo;m dead! However, for some reason he untaps and thinks the Thresher still has summoning sickness so he passes the turn without attacking. On my turn I take it out with a Shriekmaw, then climb back up in life on succeeding turns using Kitchen Finks, eventually managing to take the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two The situation is reversed, at the end of his turn I Mannequin Horde of Notions, then use the ability to bring back a Shriekmaw and a Mulldrifter, then swing for lethal on my turn. I explain to him that as long as I untap with a creature, it no longer has summoning sickness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame record: 2-0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 1-0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound two vs Faeries\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the same guy to whom I lost the day before so I was hoping for some payback. In game one I tapped out at a comfortable nine life while he only had a Faerie token and a Mutavault. He swung for three and played Notorious Throng and I had to scoop. In game two, we get into a staring contest basically just laying down lands during the early turns. We get into some counter battles, but between Ponder and Cryptic Command we\u0026rsquo;re basically staying at full hand size. I can\u0026rsquo;t get any advantage as he refuses to let my Mulldrifter resolve. I sweep his side several times, but eventually he manages to get in another Throng to finish me off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame record: 2-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 1-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound three vs Monored splash black\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKitchen Finks are at a disadvantage against Puncture Bolts and Boggart Ram-Gangs, but I still manage to put it away in three games, always being careful to stay away from the range of two Flame Javelins. We end game three with me beating down with 3 creatures, him with no black sources and three Eyeblight\u0026rsquo;s Endings in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame record: 4-3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 2-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4 vs Kithkin\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s the same deck I lost to in round six the previous day, so I\u0026rsquo;m told. I win game one easily same as yesterday. In game two the sideboarded BFT don\u0026rsquo;t make an appearance and I manage to win that as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame record: 6-3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 3-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5 vs W/x\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first turn plains made me think it was Kithkin, but the second turn Shinewend meant it was something different. I\u0026rsquo;m unsure what to expect but after seeing Spectral Procession, Wilt-Leaf Liege and Kitchen Finks it was definitely an aggro build with play style similar to Kithkin, except slower to allow for more flexibility. I stabilize at two life with a Cloudthresher under an Oblivion Ring. I manage to win from there, and the opponent later realizes he could have won by playing a Shinewend and taking out the Ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn game two I\u0026rsquo;m at fourteen; he swings with Burrenton FT, WL liege and a Kitchen Finks. I block the Liege with a Finks, hoping to finish it off with Nameless Inversion. He plays Mirrorweave on the Liege, hoping to win on the spot; I don\u0026rsquo;t panic and take out the Forge Tender with NI, taking only six damage and getting to kill the Liege. From there I play Mind Spring for four and take control of the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame record: 8-3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 4-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound six vs Faeries\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame one, he mulls to five and is still color-screwed, so I win easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two I mull to six and am less color-screwed, but still lose the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame three was too close; I had him two turns away from losing to his own Bitterblossom, the life was 14-2 in my favor, I had a 2/1 Finks and he had a bunch of Faerie tokens. I play Kitchen Finks so I could survive the next two turns, but he shows me Cryptic Command, bouncing his own Bitterblossom in the process. On his turn he swings for four, taking me to ten. On my turn I topdeck the Firespout, play it for 1GG and he has no permission left. The 2/1 Finks win me the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame record: 10-4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 5-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive and one!

We trade game one and two, and game three I thought I had it lost\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was his turn, the third turn in extra time and I was at nine. I had no chance of winning at this point, but he had Bitterblossom and seven tokens without summoning sickness. I had nothing. He plays Mutavault, his fifth land, then swings with the seven tokens. I would take seven and go down to two, losing on the fifth turn even if I had a sweeper because of the Mutavault. I signal no blockers and prepare to write down \u0026ldquo;2\u0026rdquo; on my life total\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe signals wait. He taps his mutavault and indicates he\u0026rsquo;s animating it. He plays Mirrorweave targetting Mutavault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand shoots into the air, \u0026ldquo;Judge!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome explanations later, we get the ruling: the Faeries become lands and are removed from combat!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI survive into turn four, topdeck a Cloudthresher and sweep away the Faeries. The game ends in a draw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame record: 11-5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 5-1-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMust win in order to top eight. Hopefully I fight anything other than Faeries which has been difficult for me so far (probably because I\u0026rsquo;m not playing the matchup correctly)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, round eight is Faeries!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame one the first play is Vendillion Clique from his side, followed by two Scions on succeeding turns. I manage to sweep, but by that time I\u0026rsquo;m at five and lose to his Mutavaults.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two went pretty much the same way (Vendillion into Scion into Scion), except I had Kitchen Finks on the ground to stall the â€˜vaults. We trade removal and counters for a while, but eventually he manages to tap down my guys with Cryptic Command and swing in with three â€˜vaults.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal Game record: 11-7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal Match record: 5-2-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinish: 17th, winning two packs. The packs contained Wheel of Sun and Moon and Order of Whiteclay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bit disappointed, since I had begged out of Father\u0026rsquo;s Day dinner in order to finish the tournament since I was doing well. Still, it\u0026rsquo;s a decent finish and brings to an end my month-long streak of bad tournament results. The Commandments deck is exhausting yet fun to play, now all I need to do is figure out the Faeries matchup\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext week: I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I can play in the last GPT.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The format was of course Block Constructed.\nI was playing the same Commandments deck as the day before, except I managed to get the second Mind Spring (taking out the Fathom Trawl). During last minute playtesting on Sunday morning I also decided to take out the Plumeveils from the board (they were redundant with Nameless Inversion) and put in Faerie Macabres to help the Elemental matchup.",

match!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this round I encountered the first problem with this deck, the mirror takes forever! We stretched game one over 45 minutes of the 50 minute round. I almost made a few mistakes here, such as killing my own men with two firespouts intended to kill Oona \u0026ndash; but the spectators were a bit too obvious that I should\u0026rsquo;ve paid only green. I had gotten him down to eight before he went back up to 20 with Dawnglow Infusion. I went down to 1, held on and clawed back to five life. Eventually I won with 13 damage from a Horde of Notions + buddies alpha strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe tried to play game two in the last five minutes, and he had a quick start and I had a bad draw, but he couldn\u0026rsquo;t finish me in extra turns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame record: 1-0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 1-0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2 vs BG (Doran?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a nonmatch, as he mulled to five in game one and never recovered.

After which he played BB on his own turn. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember more details, but I lost in two, most probably because I don\u0026rsquo;t really know how to play the matchup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame record: 3-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 2-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4 vs Faeries:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time I won in two games easily; he never had Bitterblossom and I had aggro starts, I was ahead on all metrics all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame record: 5-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 3-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5 vs Kithkin:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy opponent had complained that he had fought Elementals all five rounds \u0026ndash; except I wasn\u0026rsquo;t the usual Elemental deck!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn game one, a forge tender ran smack into the Plumeveil, and he never recovered from that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn game two I mulled to five and kept a two-lander with questionable land synergy and quickly lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn game three, I took some beats but stabilized at 13 after an awesome Mind Spring for five. My notes have the life at 13-23 in his favor, but he had nothing on the board and I had a full grip; he was frustrated and just scooped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame record: 6-3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record 4-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound six vs Kithkin:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI easily beat him game one due to no maindeck Forge Tenders, meaning I actually got rid of five or so creatures with a Firespout. In game two I mulliganned and had mana issues. In game three he had something like a God start \u0026ndash; two Forge Tenders, Wizened Cenn, Meadowgrain, Thistledown Liege and a Reveillark under the hideaway land. I eventually ran out of Cryptics to stall and couldn\u0026rsquo;t use the spouts due to the BFTs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal Game record: 7-4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal Match record: 4-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a small tournament so 4-2 was good enough for 5th place, winning me 4 packs.

To anyone who starts playing MTG, the ability to build your own decks has always been one of the primary appeals. For this reason, every MTG player would like to think that they have in themselves some level of deckbuilding \u0026ldquo;skills\u0026rdquo; and that using netdecks should be treated as a loss of pride in one\u0026rsquo;s own work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t feel strongly about this issue; I\u0026rsquo;ve used both netdecks and my own homebrew designs in tournaments before. Checking my own stats (one advantage of this blog is that I have a record of every tournament I ever played): I have a 59% match win rate when using a netdeck, and 54% when using my own homebrew designs. There\u0026rsquo;s a statistically signficant difference, so I can\u0026rsquo;t claim that I am an awesome deck designer. (Maybe in the future.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think that netdecking makes more sense the less time you can dedicate to Magic. For people like me who barely have one hour a week to playtest before playing in tournaments, netdecking makes a lot of sense. Definitely, if you have the time and inclination to design and develop your own original decks, you should do so, especially since having a Filipino-designed deck taking the world stage would be a big source of pride to local Magic players.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for people like me especially at times like these when I\u0026rsquo;m busy with work, if I try bringing a self-designed deck to a tournament with minimal preparation, usuallyÂ \u003ca href=\"/2008/05/regionals-2008/\"\u003edisaster\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"/2008/05/grand-prix-trial-manila-i/\"\u003ehappens\u003c/a\u003e.

I\u0026rsquo;m walking into a tournament again with no playtesting, so it\u0026rsquo;s almost sure to bite me in the ass. Still, it\u0026rsquo;s a solid choice; hopefully I could just make some skill matter. I probably should have splashed white for some removal, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to gather Crib Swaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 1: 1-2 Loss vs Monowhite/Kithkin:\u003c/strong\u003e Not a good start. All three games were close races decided by his Thistledown Liege; if I actually did have white and Crib Swaps, they would have been awesome here. I also made the mistake of not boarding in Cloudthresher to handle the Spirit tokens off Spectral Procession, since the Liege makes them a powerful clock. Ironic, since I was winning using the same combo in the draft yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 2: 2-0 win vs Red Black:\u003c/strong\u003e No surprise here, the matchup is probably something like 90-10 in my favor. In the second game, he played Countryside Crusher off one mountain and two Reflecting Pools. I played, in succession: Oversoul of Dusk (stops the Crusher), Primal Command (bounce mountain to top and search for second Oversoul), Oversoul of Dusk. At that point, his deck had no point of recovery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 3: 1-2 loss vs Green/white/black:\u003c/strong\u003e His deck is the same as mine, except with more removal. Skill came into play here, but sadly it was my lack of skill Game one was close, but I lost game two to a 4/4 indestructible Vanquisher that suddenly became 7/1 courtesy of Nameless Inversion. I could have blocked the Vanquisher for at least two more turns; I knew he had the Inversion in hand (he revealed it for the Vanquisher) when he attacked with me at six life, still I said \u0026ldquo;take.\u0026rdquo; =( Checking the top cards of my library afterwards, I might have won in two more turns, since he was at one life with no fliers and I was going to draw the Shield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinal Record: 1-2-Drop\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSigh. Despite doing well in drafts, I\u0026rsquo;m on a bad streak constructed-wise. At least the deck is definitely better in block compared to standard; no real bad matchups as far as I can tell. The games I lost were winnable games this time, instead of lopsided matchups. The difference lies in playing skill. Since I still don\u0026rsquo;t have time to playtest, there\u0026rsquo;s not much to do but to be more careful in making my decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext week: Probably nothing, as I can\u0026rsquo;t play in GPT II due to another appointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

(Faeries), and the relatively large size of my men, plus Finks and Primal Command in the board meant I would have favorable odds against other aggro. Control decks with Wrath of God will probably be either a coin flip or an uphill battle, although the Treetops will help.

Good portents. I won game one with an Overrun with five creatures in play. Before combat, a Jagged-Scar shot down Akroma (the White) with nine points worth of Jagged arrows, then I swung for 16ish to win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI boarded -3 Riftsweeper, -1 Wolf-Skull Shaman, bringing in 2 Chameleon Colossus (to fight his big creatures) and 2 Cloudthresher (to eat Akroma)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn game two, I was taking beats from two Oversouls, but was one turn from winning off Overrun when he cast Primal Command for 7 life and Akroma, giving him enough to stay alive and finish me off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI board out -1 Hexhunter (didn\u0026rsquo;t see any Oblivions Rings), -3 Jagged Scar, +3 Kitchen Finks (better against Wrath), +1 Wolf-Skull Shaman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI draw my seven for game three and see Forest, Llanowar, Wren\u0026rsquo;s Run Vanquisher, Imperious Perfect, Wilt-Leaf Cavaliers WIlt-Leaf Liege. I figure what the hell, I have gas, and drawing a second forest will put me over the top. I keep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy opponent mulligans his seven, then agonizes over the six before mulliganning again to five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI play Forest, Llanowar, go.

I swing with the Vanquisher, then tap the forest to play Llanowar Elf. _\n(Misplay here obviously, the other llanowar should have attacked!)_ He drops a land, go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI draw a third Llanowar. I play Imperious Perfect using the forest and two llanowars. I swing with Vanquisher for four. He drops to thirteen. Go. He plays the fourth land, and if he plays Wrath, I\u0026rsquo;m basically done. He looks over his hand and I know he doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the Wrath. He plays Mwonvuli Acid Moss, taking away my only land. (I suppose he boarded them in to slow-down me getting to Overrun mana). He searches his library before finally settling on Highland Weald. He\u0026rsquo;s looking at ten damage next turn, so the Wealed optimizes his chance of topdecking either Wrath, Firespout, or Glittering Wish to get Firespout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Did you spot the misplay in this paragraph?)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI draw a forest and play it, then swing for ten.

He scoops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame record: 2-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 1-0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt pretty good, going up against a Wrath deck and winning (mostly due to lucking out in the third game?). It\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a struggle, but chances are I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t face any more such decks right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 2: Monogreen Elves vs WG Mana Ramp\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight.

Playing today might very well have been a mistake; if I didn\u0026rsquo;t have trading meetups set for the day, I probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have gone at all.

But at least she\u0026rsquo;s able to use it in place of Excel. On a tangent, one of the nice effects of the BSA cracking down on pirated software is that there are more companies looking at FOSS alternatives, given the insane licensing fees for Microsoft software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully OpenOffice 3 will bring significant improvements to the OpenOffice suite especially in terms of UI and usability. I believe that in terms of features/functionalities it is already close enough to parity that adding more would already be significantly affected by diminishing returns.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure how popular or well-known Beerkada is among the non-UP crowd, but right now I consider the slice-of-University-life comic (that has now graduated into slice-of-adult-life stories) probably the second best local comic strip. First place being of course the seminal Pugad Baboy, which has been running what, almost twenty years now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI digress. If you\u0026rsquo;ve read Beerkada, it\u0026rsquo;s far from perfect. It\u0026rsquo;s often corny, and sometimes he has too many of his own in-jokes. In the early strips, the author Lyndon Gregorio often blatantly rips jokes from other sources. I\u0026rsquo;m not surprised it hasn\u0026rsquo;t received as much mainstream attention as Pugad Baboy has.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strip has its\u0026rsquo; moments however, and the cast will often remind you of real-world people (with their idiosyncracies exaggerated of course). Personally, I prefer those strips where the author parodies common pop-culture references, and the sheer inaneness of such parodies is where Beerkada trumps Pugad Baboy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recently found out Beerkada had its\u0026rsquo; own website atÂ \u003ca href=\"http://beerkada.net\"\u003ebeerkada.net\u003c/a\u003e. In an attempt to attract a more global audience, the author actually translates those strips that have Tagalog content into English. Aside from the current (daily) strips, he seems to be posting the older strips online as well, albeit the archives still currently have a huge gap between 1998 and 2006. Still, it\u0026rsquo;s awesome that Gregorio recognizes the power of the internet to publicize his work and willingly distributes his strips online. Hopefully, Pol Medina of Pugad Baboy fame would follow suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot being a regular reader of the Philippine Star, and the last Beerkada book I read having been 3-4 years old already, I went through the archives to catch up.

I guess one of the reasons I enjoy Beerkada is that Lyndon Gregorio and I are obviously of the same generation.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how popular or well-known Beerkada is among the non-UP crowd, but right now I consider the slice-of-University-life comic (that has now graduated into slice-of-adult-life stories) probably the second best local comic strip. First place being of course the seminal Pugad Baboy, which has been running what, almost twenty years now?\nI digress. If you\u0026rsquo;ve read Beerkada, it\u0026rsquo;s far from perfect. It\u0026rsquo;s often corny, and sometimes he has too many of his own in-jokes.",

has more synergy with Runes of the Deus. Old Ghastbark might have been better than Watchwing Scarecrow despite being one mana more expensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m amused by the fact that I\u0026rsquo;m splashing two Aethertow with neither Islands nor Plains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoo to NG for not providing basic lands! I had to desleeve some lands from some deck components I had brought along and had to proxy Islands for Mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound one: 2-1 win vs RG\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis guy was to my right, and since we were counterdrafting each other, he got the better red spells, I think I got the better greens. Still, I would have had an awesome deck had he passed me that Fire-Lit Thicket and those Tatermunge Duos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound two: 0-2 loss vs RB\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLost to too many annoying evasion guys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound three: 2-1 win vs BR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had like 3 Emberstrike Duos and various other small guys, but not much removal. Same general problems with BR in SHM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a really stupid play in game 3 and it was lucky that I still won despite it. I had Knollspine Invocation out, my opponent had Loch Korrigan and a Scuzzback Marauder with a -1/-1 counter on it. He tapped out for Rattleblaze Scarecrow, of course it would have haste due to the Marauder. I activated Knollspine Invocation for 2 to take out the Marauder, removing the haste and stopping the attack. On my turn, I untap and realize that the 2-cc spell I had discarded to Knollspine was a Smash to Smithereens! I\u0026rsquo;m so smart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily on my turn I drew the sixth land and played out Morselhoarder, getting two elf tokens due to Flourising Defenses. On his turns the elves chump block and he lays down two blockers. On my turn, I show him the Runes and he\u0026rsquo;s at some low number like 9 so the jig is up. He clarifies the implication of double-strike + trample with the judge, and it\u0026rsquo;s lethal as expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won two packs! The prize rares were \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sunken%20Ruins\"\u003eSunken Ruins\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Oversoul%20of%20Dusk\"\u003eOversoul of Dusk\u003c/a\u003e!

Luckily I\u0026rsquo;m modifying the default template instead of starting from scratch. The one I\u0026rsquo;m creating is rather simple but after spending almost 8 hours on it so far, I\u0026rsquo;m still far away from completing it.

For this I had to darken the image a bit using the Gimp so that the white text isn\u0026rsquo;t difficult to read against the header image.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eChanged the layout to use CSS and divs instead of the previous table-based layout. I solved the \u0026ldquo;columns with equal heights\u0026rdquo; problem using a hack I found from several websites. Basically: for each column you add a large amount of padding to the bottom of each column, then apply a negative margin so that the padding isn\u0026rsquo;t actually visible on-screen. This will create a scrollbar in the containing div though, so you need to hide the overflow. Sample CSS for this is:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e```css\n.content {\noverflow: hidden; /* Part of equal heights column hack */\n}\n.column {\nmargin-bottom: -20000px; /* Part of equal heights column hack */\npadding-bottom: 20000px; /* Part of equal heights column hack */\n}      \n```\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003col start=\"3\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCentering the main div was something I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to do either.
