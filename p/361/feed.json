Helluva lot of people there, more than I was expecting for a Core Set Release tournament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe format is, as usual, Sealed Deck with four rounds of Swiss pairings. Players were grouped in Flights of 32 people each (previous prerelease tournaments had 48-people flights), each win gets you an Xth booster pack and the top 2 of each flight (the ones who went 4-0) get something extra. Apparently the extra prizes were stuff like a bag, a shirt and a big (cardboard) Kamahl card box. I of course got the crappy box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I went 4-0. I\u0026rsquo;m not too surprised. Since a release tournament is more \u0026ldquo;casual\u0026rdquo;, the competition is not very fierce. Usually things get tricky in the last two rounds. Anyway, I won all 4 rounds, not even giving up a game loss. My sealed pool was awesome, lots of removal and acceleration. Beacon of Destruction and Mobilization are bomb rares, with Cone of Flame and Overrun as bomb uncommons. Awesome deck, good on tempo and usually giving quick wins (gave me time for lunch)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the Sealed portion (and assembling my crappy box), I was in a fighting mood so I signed up for an 8-man draft. This was more serious competition, and the prize for the top 2 places was an additional promo foil Reya Dawnbringer (and a couple of packs). I won the first match 2-0, got my first game loss in game one of match 2 won two games in a row to make the top 2. Yay!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe art for Reya Dawnbringer is quite the awesomeness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal record: 6-0-1 matches for the day. 12-1 games. Not bad at all. My plan of going to work for 3 hours before tournaments to increase my mental strength is working!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext: Nationals Qualifiers\u003c/p\u003e\n",

mostly because I put together the deck two days before the tournament with only 3 games of practice against a standard Dralnu deck. I was still too stupid to know I should leave an island open when playing a Shapeshifter face down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the quarterfinals loss, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t think fo any play mistakes. However, my sideboard was stupid. All I could bring in were some Penumbra Spiders. I have some ideas for sideboard changes should I be able to play Block again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deck is solid, with game against both aggro and control. My decklist is \u003ca href=\"http://www.roytang.net/wiki/index.php/UG_Shifters\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s actually a modification of the \u003ca href=\"http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/mf152\"\u003eTop 8 Shifters deck from GP Montreal\u003c/a\u003e. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any Vensers, so I tossed in random stuff like Psionic Blasts and Call of the Herds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCard-specific notes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThelonite Hermit is pretty awesome, allowing you to win out of nowhere with 8 additional surprise damagae (24 if you have a shifter)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVesuvan Shapeshifter + Llanowar Reborn is awesome tech. A grafted shifter beats most other things in combat. I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to take down Calciderms and Spectral Forces without losing my shifter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLlanowar Reborn may be the best or 2nd best of the uncommon FS lands.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWillbender is awesome in the GW Goyf matchup \u0026ndash; mostly because their removal (Temporal Isolation/Bound in Silence) is so effective on their own creatures. And their Griffin Guide is so nice on mine.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDraining Whelk is stupid here. I think it should be in the board, coming in against RG mana ramp decks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, yeah I scrubbed out in the quarterfinals. At that point I was really tired and just wanted to go home. My deck also annoyed me in the last game. I cast all 3 foresees trying to find and answer to an 8/9 flying Tarmagoyf but I didn\u0026rsquo;t find any. I picked up my prize for the top eight finish (seven packs)\u0026hellip; I was a bit disappointed as well since I fought through so many rounds and only got seven packs, I was hoping maybe 10-12. Well, I\u0026rsquo;ve never had a top 8 finish before so maybe I was expecting more stuff :p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn my way home I was thinking about quitting Magic. I started to play \u0026ldquo;seriously\u0026rdquo; about a year ago, and all I have to show for it so far was a PTQ top 8. Playing Magic is so fucking hard. Let me rephrase: playing Magic is easy. Being good at Magic is so fucking hard. You need to pay attention to everything, you need to have the best deck, you need to know how to sideboard in all the matchups. At some point it stops being fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s going to become harder since most of the guys I grew up playing the game with are either no longer playing or out of the country. And I\u0026rsquo;m too cheap to pay for more stuff on MTGO. Many of the Magic players in the office have migrated to playing WoW CCG.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAm I going to quit? Am I burned out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNah, that was just the tiredness talking. Magic is fun, despite the competitive pressure. I just need to be able to reconcile two things: \u003cstrong\u003eI have to be the best\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eI can\u0026rsquo;t lose sight of the fun.\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, it\u0026rsquo;s fun to win, so that makes it a bit easier. It\u0026rsquo;s fun to have a face-down Willbender in play when your opponent\u0026rsquo;s Ancestral Vision is about to resolve. It\u0026rsquo;s fun to beat down using your opponent\u0026rsquo;s Griffin Guides. It\u0026rsquo;s fun to come back from one life to win the game. It\u0026rsquo;s fun to win, and it\u0026rsquo;s also fun to play. And playing against some of the best players in the country, I\u0026rsquo;m almost there. Am I good enough yet? We\u0026rsquo;ll see soon enough\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit: Oh noes! \u003ca href=\"http://www.neutralgrounds.net/results_contents.php?id=7\"\u003eMy picture is on the internets\u003c/a\u003e!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit 2020: Above dead link \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070712144753/http://www.neutralgrounds.net/results_contents.php?id=7\"\u003erecovered from archive.org\u003c/a\u003e.

I was playing Mike Flores\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Legends of Team CMU\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; the Mishra/Korlash aggro/control/combo deck that placed seventh in \u003ca href=\"http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgevent/regionals07/edison\"\u003eNew Jersey Regionals\u003c/a\u003e, with a modified sideboard since I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get all of the cards in time. Flores discusses the deck in detail \u003ca href=\"http://www.starcitygames.com/php/news/article/14323.html\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e (requries a Premium SCG.com account)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1 0-2 Loss vs GUB NarcoBridge (Dregde combo)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2 2-1 Win vs Mono-black Rack\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3 1-2 Loss vs Mono-red Burn\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4 2-0 Win vs White Weenie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5 0-2 Loss vs Dragonstorm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6 2-0 Win vs Rakdos\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 7 2-0 Win vs BW Rebel Control\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 8 2-0 Win vs Gruul\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpecific game notes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1: First game went long, eventually two large grave trolls and a svogthos managed to overwhelm the defense with 5 cards left in his library. I guess I should have mulliganned the 2nd game when I didn\u0026rsquo;t have either a Crypt or the Leyline, as I died to 20+ zombies on turn 4.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2: Game 1, I went down to 1 he had four racks down and I had three cards in hand. Over the next few turns I brought him down to zero from eighteen while at that precarious state. \u003ca href=\"http://www.down-to-one.com\"\u003ewww.down-to-one.com\u003c/a\u003e. Game 2 went fast for him, taking me out with fast discard. Game 3 sees him keep a one-lander. I transmute for Persecute and name black, obviously. Mishra and Korlash walk across and end the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3: This deck is very good against aggro. At least the normal Gruul aggro that has like 33% creatures and 33% burn. My opponent here was more like 50% burn. Four Tendrils simply can\u0026rsquo;t keep up. His deck is an autoloss to Paladin en-Vec + Worship, but it has game over mine. I made a play mistake here in that while I was getting trounced in Game 2, I showed him Korlash (which didn\u0026rsquo;t show in game 1) in a desperate move to stave off the loss. I lost anyway, and now knowing that I had the Korlash, he boarded in Dead/Gones to handle him in game 3. In the 3rd game, I actually had a naked Cloister on the board for four turns, hoping to draw a Tendrils \u0026ndash; I had not drawn any of the four yet at that point. I drew eight cards over four turns from a library of maybe forty cards and didn\u0026rsquo;t see a single Tendrils. :(\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: He went first, playing Ication Javilineers. I yawned inside. Easy match. I was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5: We were 5 turns into game 1 and I hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen any Lotus Blooms so I was thinking it was some sort of R/U counterburn, and held back on the Rise / Fall until I knew what was going on. Then I died. Game 2, I had the Rise / Fall on turn 2. But I was thinking, \u0026ldquo;Gee, I don\u0026rsquo;t wanna waste it and hit lands, I\u0026rsquo;ll wait for him to play a couple more lands.\u0026rdquo; Then I lost. Stupid, stupid, stupid play against what should have been a favorable matchup. In my defense, I was really tired and pissed-off at my 2-2 (now 2-3) record. Yeah, bad excuse. Must\u0026hellip; stay\u0026hellip; in\u0026hellip; top\u0026hellip; mental\u0026hellip; form\u0026hellip; (and think about adding Stupors to the board).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6: Most people need to read the Epochrasite when I play it, so I was surprised when the guy just went \u0026ldquo;Ok\u0026rdquo; after I played mine on turn 2. it turns out he had some of his own. He had a few Tombstalkers as well, but no Korlash in sight. Easy win once I got out a pair of Cloisters to stop the discard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 7: Blowout. Sorry if he reads this, but his deck isn\u0026rsquo;t very good. I get to four Epochrasites early in the first game, then back it up with Arrows to take out the rebels. Game 2 was fun, with me at 2 life and no blockers, he swings with a Phyrexian Totem. Tendrils for 9. Ouch, your board is wiped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 8: Again, blowout. The matchup is pretty much as Flores describes it, block with Epoc during early turns, trade one of your legends for card advantage, then climb back quickly with either Korlash or Mishra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal record: 5-3, finishing 42nd. Despite my game win ratio, I had the worst tiebreaks of all 5-3s (since I climbed back from a 2-3 deficit).

Maybe I was growing up. :p Despite my love of being a rogue deckbuilder, I have to admit I haven\u0026rsquo;t been really successful at it. I realize now that one way to get better is to play some well-designed decks that other people have built so I can learn from their design. I was already playing a Korlash deck prior to this, and had heard of variants that splash blue for various reasons. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think I would have ever been able to think of this current design \u0026ndash; the deck is just crazy. It plays very solidly and randomly gets blowout draws. I will probably play it for at least one more tournament and hope that I actually play a lot better than I did today.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

If I had just taken out his Saffi with the Demonfire I had in hand instead of waiting to burn him to 0\u0026hellip; I would have drawn a House Guard next turn, transmute for Tendrils, swing with Korlash, stack damage and cast Tendrils on Korlash for an 18-point life swing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe round 6 loss really broke my spirit, I was in such a bad mental state that I played badly in the round 7 zoo matchup.

I opened a card pool with no outstanding rares. The only real bomb was the red uncommon Pyrohemia. Spotting the Deep-Sea Kraken and wanting to play it, I decided to go red-blue. I tested the build for a few minutes before realizing it completely stunk and had very few creatures. I looked over the card pool and quickly realized I had overlooked some quality green fatties: Nacatl War-Pride, Durkwood Baloth, Sporesower Thallid, etc. During the last minute of deck-building, I switched to a red/green build with a rather nice curve that proved quite solid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went 5-1 in the first six rounds, always hovering near the top tables. Also took down quite a few of the top limited players in the country. Not too shabby for a deck built in under a minute! For the seventh and last round, my opponent asked for the win since I was guaranteed top eight status already. After some negotiation, he agreed to split his prizes with me after I conceded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo my finish was a respectable 5-2, but with some pretty good wins and quite a number of packs taken home. Nacatl War-Pride is quite good in sealed (dunno in draft), it\u0026rsquo;s practically a \u0026ldquo;must-kill\u0026rdquo; creature. Pyrohemia is a true bomb, as it turned the game around for me more than once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love playing Limited Magic, much more so than Constructed, despite the fact it feels more expensive (I\u0026rsquo;m still not sure whether it actually \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e more expensive) Constructed Magic is fun, but I prefer not having to worry about metagames. Coming to a tournament bringing nothing but your deckbuilding and playing skills, opening your packs, building your deck and slugging it out — there\u0026rsquo;s no better way to play Magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Sure, poor people win relatively-large cash prizes and stuff from it, but it feels so exploitative.

There are probably people that see all these \u0026ldquo;lucky\u0026rdquo; scrubs earning free cash on TV, so that instead of spending their time looking for work or ways to earn a decent, continuous income, they stand around the ABS-CBN studios day in and day out hoping to get lucky. And hope they don\u0026rsquo;t get caught in a stampede of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I wish someone would do a survey on how well the \u0026ldquo;winners\u0026rdquo; of these noontime shows (yeah, we also caught a bit of \u003cem\u003eEat Bulaga!\u003c/em\u003e) fare a few months after their windfall of cash.

Alongside their exploitative nature and promotion of cheap barbs and slapsticks, I doubt whether such shows actually have a net positive effect on society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Brian, as it were, has never been the most opinionated of my brothers. In fact, he\u0026rsquo;s more of the laid-back type, seemingly not caring about what\u0026rsquo;s going on in the world at large, so I was a bit surprised when we got into a discussion on the cheap lows that Philippine media has sunk to. Apparently he had caught a TV interview of \u0026ldquo;Mr. Shoo-Li\u0026rdquo; Jun Urbano that he really liked, where the old comedian compared the Philippines of yesterdays to our current dire straits. I was pleasantly surprised with the level of our discussion, and I said to myself: \u0026ldquo;No matter how bad things get in our country, as long as we have kids that are able to think about things like this, we\u0026rsquo;ll always have hope.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn short (and this may be obvious anyway), noontime shows are really bad and shockingly exploitative. Seriously, anyone who looks at these noontime shows with at least 1% of a critical eye would agree.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "So, I was there in the taxi with my youngest brother Brian. And I brought up the topic of the noontime TV show Wowowee, which we had just seen about half an hour of before we got in the taxi.\nI told him that I thought of it as a really terrible show. Sure, poor people win relatively-large cash prizes and stuff from it, but it feels so exploitative. Hundreds, maybe thousands of poor folk from god-knows-how-far-away queue up outside the studios every day hoping to get into the studio audience to participate in the cash giveaways.",

I got there before Galleria opened and whiled away time on the DS. The NG staff was a lot more efficient today, they were able to start the first 3 flights as early as 10:30. I got on flight C, and proceeded to open one of the most mediocre card pools I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen. I quickly judge that the best synergies among my cards were (a) six black removal spells and (b) I have a lot of thallid cards (gernimator, sporesower, deathspore, and the new 5cc 4/4 guy from FS). I ruled out the blue/white evasion strategy despite having a decent number of fliers, since I hate going without removal. So I assembled my no-bombs deck, of course calling it \u0026ldquo;Deathspore Thallid Go!\u0026rdquo; as my officemates would have wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won the first two rounds and was well on my way to winning round 3 when my opponent suddenly cast a Dragonstorm into Scourge of Kher Ridges in game 2, allowing him to wipe my board away. He tries the same thing in game 3, but I manage to take out the Dragon with a Tendrils and an Ichor Slick. That causes me to go into topdeck mode though, and he quickly lays down a swarm to overwhelm me. Round 4 I almost lot to a sliver deck, but it seems my opponent was not aware that Firewake Sliver gives haste\u0026hellip; he could have easily pumped his 4/4 flying Gemhide (thanks to Griffin Guide and graft) for lethal damage, but missed the chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, my finish is again 3-1, same as the PLC pre-release. My overall record for Time Spiral block is 10-2, not bad I suppose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy opinions on Future Sight? My deck was almost 80% TSP anyway, so it\u0026rsquo;s hard to say. In general red seems pretty good in the set, getting some decent burn in the form of Ghostfire. As for creatures, Gathan Raiders, as I expected, are quite good; that 1/1 that suspends itself when it dies is a bit annoying, Grandeur is useless in limited, and yes, Angel of Slavation and that Scourge of Kher Ridges are pretty much bombs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere should be one or more TSP limited events over the next two weeks\u0026hellip; I hope I can open decent cards the next time around\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I had to skip most of the fillers though to catch up. And from the pirated DVDs I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in some stores, there\u0026rsquo;s probably some other group subbing One Piece that are already at least eighty episodes ahead of KF. That being said, I think I\u0026rsquo;ll follow their pace for now, as their subbing is of really good quality. One Piece is an awesome series and continues to be entertaining. The best arc in the series so far has been the Alabasta arc, and I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to Movie 7 which supposedly covers this arc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGintama\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea new series that people at the office got to know from Jump Ultimate Stars for the NDS.

The fifth case however is added exclusively for the DS and features additional gameplay mechanics like the ability to rotate pieces of evidence and using the DS stylus and microphone to simulate the fingerprinting process. The fifth case is also much more difficult. The first four cases are easy enough to brute-force (\u0026ldquo;trial and error\u0026rdquo;) your way through, but the fifth one is much more complicated and it had me stuck for a while since I couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out how to proceed in one of the investigative parts.

Not being in the mood to feel like french toast during this Sunday noontime, my brothers and I decided to troop to the nearby mall and catch a movie \u0026ndash; in this case the return of those childhood stalwarts the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to the big screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, as my youngest brother asked, what were we doing there? TMNT is a kids\u0026rsquo; movie right? Yeah, more or less I suppose, but all of us brothers saw the first 3 live-action Turtles movies, played the NES game with the annoying dam sequence and watched not just a few episodes of the cartoon series. Thankfully, none of us had any Turtles jammies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, yeah we saw the movie. Before I saw the trailer about a month back I actually thought it was gonna be another live-action thing. The animation is ok, the turtles look less brutish than before and it\u0026rsquo;s action-packed as expected. As expected, Leo tries hard to be a leader, Mikey provides the comedy, Raph is the serious brooding one, and Donatello provides the tech support (literally). It\u0026rsquo;s no high art, but it\u0026rsquo;s entertaining enough, but it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much the equivalent of watching a multi-part episode of the TV series. The turtles have a spat, they kick some ass, extradimensional monsters appear, the turtles kick some more ass, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear that the movie is selling quite well in the States. Not so much here though, as the theater was maybe 50% full at best, and on a Sunday afternoon at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I played with my friend Paul, and we had a rather good sealed pool, coming up with a pair of decks that had the basic strategy of \u0026ldquo;Do not block!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, we were only able to go 5-2, ending up as the team in 10th place. Well, it\u0026rsquo;s not like we would\u0026rsquo;ve been able to go to San Diego, but still the 750USD would have been nice. We lost one game to mana flood, and the other loss was one where we were winning \u0026ndash; at least until the opposing team decided to take 3 turns in a row via Walk the Aeons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe could\u0026rsquo;ve won that last one though, but we made a few mistakes such as not being aggressive enough, i.e. deciding to block. The thing about Magic tournaments, you pretty much need to have at most one loss in order to hit top 8, and you can assume you\u0026rsquo;re gonna get at least one loss due to mana screw; so there\u0026rsquo;s really no room for error or bad plays. You must make the best play at every possible time. It\u0026rsquo;s a demanding game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new 2HG format is a lot more fun though, with the thiry life leading everyone to choose aggro strategies. And since you only get one game per round, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more pressure involved, and it\u0026rsquo;s not uncommon for decisive plays to take 5 or more minutes to decide. Fun, but mentally exhausting.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
