I did a hundred million things, maybe. I dunno. I didn\u0026rsquo;t keep track. I read a few books, wiped quite a few TV episodes off my backlog, learned a few new programming tricks, cleaned up some stuff, finished a few games, and God knows what else. If I bother to explain this, I would often get that lopsided look from people saying \u0026ldquo;You wasted your vacation on that?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t get this concept of \u0026ldquo;wasted vacation\u0026rdquo;. The whole idea of a vacation is to have free time to one\u0026rsquo;s self. Maybe for some people that means going off to some island resort or traveling overseas or something. For me it means I get to waste my time on whatever the hell I feel like doing when I wake up in the morning. (Or often around lunchtime.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of people burn away all their days working on a job they don\u0026rsquo;t even enjoy, now that\u0026rsquo;s what you should consider a waste of time. Not that I don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy my job, but I certainly wanted that break (and I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I earned it.) I didn\u0026rsquo;t have anything in particular to do or accomplish. I simply wanted to have free time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePost Part II:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI came back to work just in time for annual assessment time, a stressful time for many people, as they wonder how much of an increase they\u0026rsquo;re going to get, if any. Well, it\u0026rsquo;s not a stressful time for me, as I don\u0026rsquo;t really care much about the increase. My current compensation was already pretty good anyway, so anything I get this year is just a \u0026ldquo;win more\u0026rdquo; situation really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I would really appreciate (and I\u0026rsquo;ve told them this before) is more free time. I like my job, even enjoy it every so often. But I really enjoy my free time as well, and I actually wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mind taking a significant (say, 20%) salary cut to gain one day of free time per week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of people say time is money. What many people don\u0026rsquo;t realize is that time is more important than money. Money is simply one of the things time can be translated into. But time can also be transformed into other, more important things that money cannot provide: personal growth, the company of your loved ones and the freedom to be your own person\u0026hellip; things that make the flexibility of free time far more valuable than mere money.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Insane number of people, as expected. I got there about ten minutes after the mall opened (I came from work), and I was already preregistered, but I only got to sign up for the sixth flight (Flight F). They had to buy extra tables from a nearby Office Warehouse. I finally got to crack open packs around 12:30PM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly bomb in my sealed deck pool was an Avatar of Woe, but my black was too weak to support it. I went for a U/W aggro build to take advantage of a Serra Sphinx I opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Hits:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamnation seems easy to get \u0026ndash; 3 of the people I knew who were playing opened it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened 5 rares in 3 Planar Chaos packs, one was a foil Shivan Wumpus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first round opponent was apparently a prerelease virgin; after giving a beating with his creatures for most of game one, he played an Oros the Avenger hoping to finish me off. Luckily for me, he was playing the actual prerelease card, which is a no-no. I won the second game, game record: 2-0; match record 1-0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond round opponent was red/white again. I\u0026rsquo;ve never played against Giant Growth in limited, but one would expect it to be a house. After getting hit by Brute Force twice, I\u0026rsquo;m inclined to agree, and have now learned to play around combat tricks when the opponent only has a mountain. I won 2-1. Game record: 4-1, match record: 2-0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird round opponent\u0026hellip; some red also. First game I only saw an Avalanche Rider and the 7/7 echo guy. Second game he put up more of a fight, and the \u0026ldquo;free echo\u0026rdquo; goblin helped him a lot. He get out the Goblin Advisor and went all aggro on me before I managed to stablize. Those exploding goblins can\u0026rsquo;t get past a Dream Stalker! Game record: 6-1, match record: 3-0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFourth round opponent\u0026hellip; well, it seems everybody but me plays red. First game I played out all the tricks my deck had with a Clockwork Hydra. Auramancer\u0026rsquo;s Guile + Hydra meant I could attack without losing +1/+1 counters. He bounces the Hydra, I play it again. He shoots the Hydra, I save it with a lion. He forces my Hydra into a bad block, I blink it out. He tries to Lightning Axe, I flashback the blink. This game was way fun on my end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond game goes long, but he later drops a Pyrohemia. Bomb enchantment! And I had no way to remove it. I tried to play around it, but his Paradise Plume eventually gave him enough life that he could just burn me out with the red Pestilence. I quickly gauge my options: ten minutes left in the round, but my deck is more aggro. I still have enough time to win game 3, so I concede and shuffle quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird game I draw a hand with five lands, a morph guy and the Serra Sphinx. The morph guy doubles as removal (gives +2/-2), so I figure this is good enough, as I don\u0026rsquo;t miss the 3rd-turn creature drop. Bad decision, as I draw into even more lands, and he\u0026rsquo;s more aggro than usual. The game goes long again, and eventually he surprises me with a Teferi I didn\u0026rsquo;t see the first two games. I sigh and realize I\u0026rsquo;m probably going to lose when he flashes the Sorceress Queen-timeshift at end of my turn. We go to time. And I try to stop him from killing me in three swings. Not enough blockers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal game record: 7-3, match record 3-1. I had good enough tie breakers to finish 4th in the pod, and I hoped I could still get a shirt for such a good performance. No such luck though. I take my 3 packs anyway, hoping I get good stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did. (1 Angel of Fury, 1 Groundbreaker, 1 Timbermare)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy flight finished at around 6PM. By this time I had gone with around 2 hours sleep in the past 14 hours, and the only food I had was two ensaymadas for a late breakfast before the flight started. Yeah, dead tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotes on specific cards:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat 3cc blue common morph guy, the one that gives +2/-2? He\u0026rsquo;s awesome. I\u0026rsquo;d pick him high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaltfield Recluse was a card I initially underrated and did not play main. However, I ended up bringing him in every time I could. That -2/-0 really screws the combat odds in your favor, and saves your guys from the occasional bad block or combat trick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of combat tricks: yeah, Brute Force is pretty good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitemane lion is essentially a combat trick with a free bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePongify is fun as expected. I loved it when my opponent attacked with a 7/7 he had just paid echo for, and I shake my head, show him the card and say: \u0026ldquo;Monkey?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, the set is awesome for sealed deck play, the block environment looks good. The design of the cards isn\u0026rsquo;t particular innovative since everything is either a throwback or a reprint, but the choice of cards and abilities to bring back\u0026hellip; everything is awesome. I\u0026rsquo;m definitely going to play the release tournament.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

But anyway, it\u0026rsquo;s just a simple Stop/Go timer I can use for timeboxing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast is a Window WP right-click menu addon, \u003ca href=\"http://www.lopesoft.com/en/index.html\"\u003eFileMenuTools\u003c/a\u003e. Some nice common tasks can be added to the context menu, some I do regularly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve also looked at some a few PIM programs, but my experience is that I\u0026rsquo;m not very good at this sort of thing\u0026hellip; the only one that\u0026rsquo;s stuck to me for a while was \u003ca href=\"http://shared.snapgrid.com/index.html\"\u003eGTDTiddlyWiki\u003c/a\u003e, and I don\u0026rsquo;t even use that regularly anymore. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking I should find some way to integrate task management into my workflow. Maybe I could write the program myself, the requirements are simple:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI want to be able to specify tasks that I want to be reminded of. As an initial example, maybe I could schedule daily, weekly or monthly tasks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAt the start of each day, or when I boot up my computer (configurable), the program would dump all tasks for that day in the middle of my workflow.\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAt the office, it could send me an email.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAt home, I could add a local web page to my Firefox tabs.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s basically it. I can add more features or bells and whistles later. I could probably put together a quick scripts + text files solution, similar to the\u003ca href=\"http://lifehacker.com/software/todo.txt/\"\u003etodo.txt series at lifehacker\u003c/a\u003e \u0026ndash; in fact, I\u0026rsquo;ll go read that first for ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to write more about my time in Hong Kong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the many new things I experienced there was the food. People who\u0026rsquo;ve eaten out with me on a regular basis know that I\u0026rsquo;m quite the picky eater. In general, I dislike eating veggies and seafood (yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m an unhealthy carnivore). In Hong Kong, you cannot avoid vegetables and seafood; every meal comes with some form of green stuff or shrimp or whatnot. I\u0026rsquo;m almost always eating out with the HK colleagues, and since I\u0026rsquo;m a guest in their country, they\u0026rsquo;ll always invite me to taste everything. I\u0026rsquo;ve probably eaten more seafood in those three weeks than I have for the previous years of my life. I\u0026rsquo;m probably exaggerating, but there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance of me being correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince most of my days were spent in the Wan Chai area, we often had lunch and dinner at the restaurants there. Anyone who\u0026rsquo;s been to Hong Kong will probably know about Wan Chai: the area is full of bars and nightclubs and such. It seems that the area is frequented by foreigners. In the evening, many of the clubs have some pretty young women outside enticing passing Caucasian guys to have a drink or two. Of course, I didn\u0026rsquo;t go into the bars or nightclubs because that\u0026rsquo;s not the sort of thing I do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLunch was the expensive meal of the day, since we usually had to pay for it ourselves (as opposed to dinner which was company-reimbursed). The HK guys would usually decide where we would all have lunch and we just go along with them. Most meals cost around 40 HK$ \u0026ndash; more than 2.5 times I normally spend for lunch back home. But these meals are usually larger servings and good quality stuff, not fastfood-level or carinderia-type junk. We get soup, plus drinks (I usually order Lemon Iced Tea or Milk Tea) then the meal itself. Usuallyyou have some meat or fish, plus veggies on the side, and you can choose your viand from rice, spaghetti, mashed potato, etc. Many restaurants allow you to choose from a list of set meals, so sometimes I joke that I can just choose randomly, \u0026ldquo;Today I\u0026rsquo;ll have meal B\u0026rdquo; and just order it without asking what it is. But of course I\u0026rsquo;m a picky eater, so I don\u0026rsquo;t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince dinner is company-sponsored, it seems the HK guys always choose cheaper places for dinner. We ate once at a McDonald\u0026rsquo;s and once at a Yoshinoya. And several times at this small chinese place that had a TV. I kept trying to follow the plot of the TV show aired during dinner but the inability to understand Chinese makes it hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, of course being unable to speak Chinese makes almost everything hard \u0026ndash; I need to ask for help whenever I\u0026rsquo;m ordering, etc. I also started out quite bad with chopsticks. Despite my years of honing hand-eye coordination using the game controller, my dexterity is terrible, and that leads to being really bad with chopsticks. On my first Sunday there, I had to eat lunch alone at a cafe. I ordered some pork with noodles in soup (I like noodles), but I had trouble eating since I\u0026rsquo;m not used to eating noodles with chopsticks. I tried to ask the counter lady for a fork, but she and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand each other. I wonder if the other cafe patrons noticed me eating the noodles in a terrible manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was wondering if my time in Hong Kong would change my eating habits when I got back home, making me less picky in what I eat. Turns out, not by much.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Hit // Run provide additional damage in addition to removal. Main deck cryoclasm is good, as 5 out of 7 opponents had the requisite islands or plains to be targetted. Spike Feeder keeps me alive against Boros/Dragonstorm. People are usually surprised when I play the Strangling Soots in games 2 or 3, but the Soots do something unbelievably good against aggro decks: they trade evenly with Call of the Herd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1: 0-2 vs Mono-green aggro\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUgh. Not a good way to start the day. Multiple weenies, some sporting cloaks or armor, definitely a weakness of my build. I drew mostly lands too. This matchup is probably around 40-60 in their favor, as I need to draw into 2 strangling soots to win, or bring out a Fortune Thief (backed by a Spike Feeder) to stay alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2: 2-1 vs Dragonstorm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt that I had a good game one against Dragonstorm, but I made a misplay where I didn\u0026rsquo;t play the second spike feeder that would\u0026rsquo;ve kept me alive. Even with four dragons out, as long as I survive, there\u0026rsquo;s a chance to win because of Hit // Run. Game two I managed to resolve a Persecute for red, bringing his hand to one mountain. Game three, he didn\u0026rsquo;t draw the storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3: 2-0 vs Rakdos\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucked out here. First game, opponent had mana troubles, only three lands came out, and one got taken by an Acid-Moss. Second game, I was able to deny him of black sources\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethroughout the game, and a Solifuge wrapped him up real nice while Strangling Soot cleared the blockers. Thing about land destruction, it really punishes bad draws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: 2-1 vs WGr Aggro\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis deck was mostly Elephants (Call of the Herd / Hierarch) and random small critters, plus Disintegrate as a finisher. First game, I got him with the second turn ryoclasm + Acid-Moss on the Selesnya karoo. Game two, I sided out all the LD, and brought in the Soots and the Grips, expecting Sacred Ground, Worship, and/or Glare. He drew three Call of the Herd and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop the stampede, I took damage down to 5 and he showed me the Disintegrate. Game three was a race, but I had a Solifuge and an early forestwalker, and the Demonfire in my hand for the win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5: 1-2 vs UR Tron\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was playing in a bad mental state here, holding back on my spells for fear of permission. A friend who was watching rightfully told me that keeping my spells in hand doesn\u0026rsquo;t reduce the number of counters he had. I should\u0026rsquo;ve been playing threats one after another until I could resolve a Hit for massive damage. In the second game, my weakness to Pyroclasm becomes the end of me as it kills half my mana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6: 2-1 vs Triskitron\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew what to do this time. His hand runs out of counters and he desperately throws Demonfire for 16 at me. I stay alive and respond with Demonfire for 9, winning the round. Mental note: When they play the Compulsive Research early, they have a bad hand and are looking for permission! Based on experience during the Gold Rush tournament, I usually side out the Cryoclasms against ‘Tron \u0026ndash; they usually have only 4-8 viable targets, and I\u0026rsquo;d much rather have a Persecute or Krosan Grip available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 7: 2-1 vs Simic-Tron\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like the matchup against SimicTron better, as they have Breeding Pools that the Dryads can walk through. The dryads take him down in game one despite the presence of a Sky Swallower. Game two, I\u0026rsquo;m confident of winning; I have the hellbent Demonfire in hand and he\u0026rsquo;s within reach. But I fear the Commandeer, so I point the Demonfire at a nearby Hellkite instead. Completely illogical, I lost game two because of that. I was thinking I would wait for a Persecute to clear the hand before going for the Demonfire. Game three, he was able to handle all my threats except for an early Elf and Dryad, which took him down to 1 life before he was forced to Wildfire to clear the board.

Minor land destruction theme (4 Cryoclasm, 4 Mwonvuli Acid-Moss), Elephant and Solifuge beats and always going for the Demonfire finish. The black was in the main only for Hit // Run, my answer to Akroma and Bogardan Hellkite. Sideboarded Nightmare Void against control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRidiculously huge turnout, over two hundred people participated, meaning the event would play out for a total of nine rounds. I got my fourth loss in the seventh round, after a ridiculous string of bad draws that led me to mulligan down to four and keeping a no-land hand. After this, I dropped out of the event, damn tired after having to endure one and a half hour rounds. This was already at 9pm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t have any detailed report, as I was still really sleepy, having had little sleep since flying back from Hong Kong. Some highlights:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ndash; Maindeck Cryoclasms are great, I never faced any opponent where it wasn\u0026rsquo;t relevant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ndash; Round 5 I played and beat National Champion JT Porter, playing a UB control deck with Teferi and Dralnu. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get it either, but he put up a good fight, losing when he miscalculated and did not have enough mana to use Mystical Teachings to search for the Commandeer that would push away the lethal Demonfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ndash; Round 6 I played another high-ranked local player, Ogie Jaro playing Martyr-Torn. I won game one on the back of fast aggro and Hit on a Chronosavant, but didn\u0026rsquo;t see the Martyrs until game 2, where he ended the game at 95 life. Round 3 I had the Rain of Gore in the opening hand, managing to play it on turn two, stopping his combo. However, I failed to draw any more meaningful spells, instead drawing into a ton of lands.
