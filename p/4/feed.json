Just in time for the one year anniversary of the world\u0026rsquo;s longest lockdown. SinoVac isn\u0026rsquo;t the best choice, but many of my doctor friends say they\u0026rsquo;ll settle for it if that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s available for them. I think QC is planning to use AstraZeneca for their citizens, but worrying is that AZ\u0026rsquo;s efficacy has been shown to be not so good against certain variants such as the South African one, which has already been detected in the country. Cases have been on the rise in the past couple of weeks as well, possibly due to the variants. We may very well be in a race against time now (maybe we always have been). The next month may be the most crucial phase of the pandemic for us, as vaccination drives hopefully kick into gear to try to overcome the accelerating spread.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"links-of-interest\"\u003eLinks of interest:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ohhelloana.blog/catching-up-on-my-bookmarks/\"\u003eOhHelloAna.blog shared a whole bunch of bookmarks\u003c/a\u003e.

A case study in the problems with blindly relying on dependencies perhaps, and the complexities of C code performance, and even software performance in general.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRachel True had \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/RachelTrue/status/1365461618977476610\"\u003eproblems with iCloud\u003c/a\u003e after accidentally inputting her last name in lowercase.

I\u0026rsquo;ve switched back to doing digital sketches via Procreate, with kind of a different style this time? I kind of like it, more or less.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eToday I was \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/lzagfz/eli5_whats_the_difference_between_joules_watts/gq0i81h/?context=3\"\u003ementioned via the u/hungryroy syntax on reddit\u003c/a\u003e for the first time. Not a big deal, I was just surprised lol.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGenerally the pandemic and the quarantine hasn\u0026rsquo;t hit me as bad as other folks. My day to day routine hasn\u0026rsquo;t actually changed that much, since I didn\u0026rsquo;t really go out too often even pre-pandemic. That being said, I do miss being able to go out to places just to wander around, take my daily walk in a public place like \u003ca href=\"/2021/03/1366349139559129088/\"\u003ethe QC circle\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"/2020/01/saturday-morning-up/\"\u003ethe university campus\u003c/a\u003e, or even just loitering at the mall. It\u0026rsquo;s not that I miss being able to hang out with other people (although I do to some degree as well). More like I miss the ability to be outside, alone, in public, just sitting quietly and letting the universe wash over me.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatching:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWandaVision\u003c/strong\u003e is done! Here\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"/2021/03/wandavision/\"\u003ea spoiler-free review\u003c/a\u003e, something I used to \u003ca href=\"/tags/spoiler-free-review/\"\u003edo more regularly\u003c/a\u003e. I have more spoiler-related thoughts, but they may be too much for this space.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m almost done with season 2 of \u003cstrong\u003eStar Trek: Enterprise\u003c/strong\u003e, which means I\u0026rsquo;m about halfway through the series overall.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Flash\u003c/strong\u003e started its new season last week, but it feels like their episodes are like 90% nonsense now. (Used to be closer to 60% nonsense.). Second ep of \u003cstrong\u003eSuperman and Lois\u003c/strong\u003e was okay, although we are definitely getting more moody teenager problems.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGaming:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSecond Fire Emblem Three Houses run: still WIP. Moving forward slowly, ever so slowly.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI got last month\u0026rsquo;s Humble Choice, and decided to go ahead and install and try out some of the games in the bundle.\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI started by playing \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127610/Iris_and_the_Giant/\"\u003eIris and the Giant\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s a nice little tactical battle indie game with CCG mechanics \u0026ndash; think Slay the Spire, but with turn-based tactical RPG battles that can also feel very puzzle-like. I\u0026rsquo;ve been enjoying well-designed indie games recently, and this one seems to fall into that bucket. It has a unique, minimalist aesthetic and the story is about a young girl\u0026rsquo;s mental health? Maybe? I\u0026rsquo;ll know more if I actually managed to finish a run.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also tried to play a game of \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/392110/Endless_Space_2/\"\u003eEndless Space 2\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;m not unfamiliar with 4X games of course, but this one was a bit confusing for me. In the one game where I managed to get anywhere, it felt like I was always behind in tech, and there\u0026rsquo;s so many indicators and UI elements on the different views that I don\u0026rsquo;t really understand. I can see there\u0026rsquo;s going to be a learning curve for this one, so it may take a few games for me to get the hang of it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSpeaking of Humble choice, the next one has Control as a showcase game, but I already got that off PS+, so I think I\u0026rsquo;m pausing on this one.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSaturday regular gaming group decided to play \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1015930/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition/\"\u003eBlood Rage\u003c/a\u003e again yesterday, and we found out there was new DLC so we all decided to buy that and try it out. Might do a review for this game this week!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlso did quite a few Starcraft 2 1v1s with friends this past week. I don\u0026rsquo;t consider myself very proficient with SC2, mostly because I\u0026rsquo;m very micro-averse, but I still enjoy playing it. Maybe not ladder though. We recorded some of our games, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bINjaPjt1M\"\u003ethe first one is up on the Team Camote youtube channel\u003c/a\u003e, if you\u0026rsquo;d like to watch me be terrible.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBecause of reasons, I browsed some Ludum Dare games the other day. My favorite is this short and simple one: \u003ca href=\"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/a-monster-hunter-story\"\u003eA Monster Hunter Story\u003c/a\u003e. Check it out!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBooks:\u003c/strong\u003e Still very slowly reading cyberpunk classic \u003cem\u003eNeurmancer\u003c/em\u003e by William Gibson. I\u0026rsquo;m about halfway through, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I understand everything that\u0026rsquo;s going on. Might need to look for a recap later on. Still, I soldier on!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"this-coming-week\"\u003eThis coming week:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh, nothing.

Both sides claim they were doing a buy-bust, which is impossible. As usual, there is little transparency about what actually happened, and many promises of \u0026ldquo;impartial\u0026rdquo; probes and investigations. People speculate that at least one of the parties involved really was dealing drugs, and they got into a shootout because they were afraid of being EJK\u0026rsquo;ed.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"links-of-interest\"\u003eLinks of interest:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t have any of these today, sadly. This is why I don\u0026rsquo;t have a newsletter, I\u0026rsquo;m unable to promise regular content lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"my-stuff\"\u003eMy stuff:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThis week was busy with family and medical errands, so not much else was accomplished.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/albums/sketchbook/\"\u003eStill sketching\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatching:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWandaVision\u003c/strong\u003e penultimate ep, people still liked it, but it was a bit meh for me. Still looking forward to next week\u0026rsquo;s finale, as there are still so many things to wrap up!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStarted watching \u003cstrong\u003eStar Trek: Enterprise\u003c/strong\u003e, the last of the non-animated Trek shows I have yet to watch. (I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen the TOS animated series). It\u0026rsquo;s Scott Bakula! Their uniforms here remind me of something like modern astronaut wear, so I assume they wanted something closer to \u0026ldquo;modern day\u0026rdquo; Earth to bridge to the Star Trek future. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting because at this point the relationship between the humans and Vulcans isn\u0026rsquo;t well established, there is no federation, no prime directive, etc, so we get to see the beginnings of those things later on I guess?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlso watched a couple of movies this week. First was \u003cstrong\u003eSpace Sweepers\u003c/strong\u003e, a Korean space sci-fi adventure on Netflix. Entertaining enough, though the plot is easily predictable and the villain seemed like a moron. Great visuals and special effects, miles apart from anything local cinema has to offer. One-inch barrier of subtitles, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSecond movie was \u003cstrong\u003eOnce Upon A Time In Hollywood\u003c/strong\u003e. This was a very laid-back, relaxed movie, unfolding mostly as a series of slice-of-life vignettes of what life was like Hollywood in 1969, with no real plot urgency to speak of. The climax sort of just happens through no real actions by the main characters. Fairly long, took me four sittings to get through. Was surprised to find out later that it was based on a true story of a massacre that took place at that time, with Margot Robbie playing a real-life actress who was the victim in the actual massacre. The story unfolds a bit differently, probably due to the presence of fictional protagonists Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth (portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt). Bruce Lee also makes an appearance!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLast week was also the premiere of \u003cstrong\u003eSuperman and Lois\u003c/strong\u003e on CW. I still like these positive portrayals of Superman better than something like Snyder\u0026rsquo;s Man of Steel, although I\u0026rsquo;m a bit meh on the premiere overall. Everything about the teens gives me Smallville vibes. They had a really big missed opportunity to \u003ca href=\"/2021/02/1364758520885772288/\"\u003ematch a scene from the opening sequence with a classic comic cover\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGaming:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePlayed a bit of Civ6 now that the Barbarian Clans mode has dropped. Restarted a few times with Kublai Khan before I got a decent start. Not super impressed with the Barbarian Clans mode so far, seems like the main effect is that we get more city-states going into the endgame. Will probably still try it out for a few games.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSecond Fire Emblem Three Houses run still in progress, finally got to the Edelgard decision point, and went as I planned.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHave been trying to figure out why I\u0026rsquo;m having \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/lquag0/sf5_is_it_expected_to_be_so_hard_to_find_a_match/\"\u003eso much trouble finding matches in Street Fighter V\u003c/a\u003e. Still no luck though. I want to indulge myself by getting the season 5 pass, but it\u0026rsquo;s not worth it if I can\u0026rsquo;t actually find matches.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlways annoying whenever this happens, but next month\u0026rsquo;s PS+ games include FF7 Remake, which I\u0026rsquo;ve already played and finished. Good for everyone else though! New content was also announced for the PS5 version of the game, which is also annoying since it\u0026rsquo;s probably goinna be a while before I bother with a PS5 (maybe waiting for a smaller version!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEdit: One of my loyal readers pointed out I failed to mention that we played a few games of 4-player Free For All in Starcraft 2 last Saturday.

            "title": "Game Review: Knightin'",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA while back, on a whim I purchased this indie game \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/922710/Knightin/\"\u003eKnightin\u0026rsquo;\u003c/a\u003e on Steam. I forget how I came across it and why I decided to buy, but no regrets. It\u0026rsquo;s a tightly-focused dungeon crawler in the style of original Legend of Zelda/Link to the Past dungeons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach dungeon is a set of rooms you clear one at a time, until you get  to the dungeon boss and beat him. Clearing rooms involves defeating  enemies, solving puzzles, avoiding obstacles and opening chests. It\u0026rsquo;s a  short game, there are only four dungeons to clear each slightly more difficult than the last. There is no plot at all. The game itself openly admits this by painting the thinnest of flavors. You play Sir Lootalot and you want to beat the evil dark lord at the end of the fourth dungeon. For treasure! No princess to save or anything like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I say \u0026ldquo;tightly-focused\u0026rdquo;, I mean that the game is barebones and does only what it says, but it does it very well. I\u0026rsquo;m a fan of how well-designed it is. It\u0026rsquo;s entirely predictable, you know what you\u0026rsquo;re getting into, but each part is executed really well. Each dungeon consists of multiple floors. Each floor has exactly twelve rooms, arranged in the same 3x4 rectangle shape every time. There\u0026rsquo;s a minimap that never changes shape, but maps room paths as you go. The minimap has a nice notation that indicates things like stairs up, stairs down, a merchant, a warp point, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCombat is simple and straightforward as well. You don\u0026rsquo;t get a plethora of weapons like Link does in the Zelda series. You start out with a sword (obviously) and later you get access to a wand that lets you shoot fireballs, and those are your only weapons ever. Later you also learn to dash (which hits enemies with the sword), fire dash (which leaves a trail of flames as you dash), and learn a spin attack (a la Link to the Past). You only ever have to remember four buttons: swing sword, shoot wand, dash, and raise shield (and I very rarely use the shield).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObstacles in your way include enemies of course, and the difficulty ramp is great here as well. You start out with enemies that just walk around randomly and they damage you if they bump you. As you progress you meet more complicated foes. Enemies with ranged attacks. Enemies that chase you. Enemies that can move faster. Enemies that can pop out from under your feet. Enemies that can reproduce. And so on. They are always introduced one new enemy at a time so you get to know their shtick before you meet them in more difficult rooms. Rooms can also have obstacles, such as blades that suddenly jut out of the ground, rotating saw blades, pillars that shoot projectiles, and so on, all adding to room difficulty. Some rooms will have a merchant who sells stuff (you get gold from enemy drops), or chests you can open.

I\u0026rsquo;m familiar with the author\u0026rsquo;s work, but mostly in the realms of tech, design and public speaking, but this book was largely personal, and mostly talking about strangers I had no real interest in.

I consumed mostly as if it was a work of fiction, about strangers and their relationships. Humans like stories after all, and this is a story about people who are only human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe author\u0026rsquo;s relationship with his father was strained at best, and it affected the rest of their family as well. I can\u0026rsquo;t personally relate to that, as I have a pretty good relationship with my family. The author\u0026rsquo;s difficult family life provides a window into a kind of human interaction I\u0026rsquo;m not too familiar with. But I do empathize with how it can be difficult to deal with certain people, and how sometimes the people you need closure from the most will simply have no interest in providing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s not a long book, it was a quick read for me (less than a week). I probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have sought out such a book on my own, but I\u0026rsquo;m glad I read it.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "title": "Digital Boardgames Review: Scythe",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eOver the past couple of years, I\u0026rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d do reviews of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy second review is about \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/718560/Scythe_Digital_Edition/\"\u003eScythe: Digital Edition\u003c/a\u003e. Scythe is a competitive game where you play one of seven factions in an alternate history post-war Eastern Europe. Players vie to control territories, hire workers, build mechs, accumulate resources, accomplish secret objectives, and other such goals. Accomplishing secret objectives, winning combats or maximizing one of the several metrics (workers, money, popularity, military power, recruits, structures, mechs, etc) earns you stars, and the game ends when at least one player has six stars. Having six stars doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee victory, as points are then tallied up depending on various factors including stars, territories, money, popularity, and so on. Having separate victory and end conditions creates a bit of tension and a balancing act between progressing stars and earning points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlayers play as one of seven available factions, each with preset locations on the board. The board is preset and consists of hex tiles, each with different movement limitations and resources that can be produced. The board also has \u0026ldquo;encounters\u0026rdquo; on certain tiles, basically roleplaying opportunities where you get the choice of an action to take, typically trading one type of resource for another, usually a good deal, if you can pay the costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe board is fixed, but each player is randomly assigned a mat that determines the actions available during their turn. The mat is split into top actions (produce, move, bolster, trade) each paired with one of the available bottom actions (upgrade, deploy mech, recruit, build structure). During your turn, you may play one top action followed by the corresponding bottom action, and you cannot do the same action pair on successive turns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis weird action structure makes the game challenging. Typically, the top actions generate resources, while the bottom actions consume them to advance your goals. If you get a mat with pairings that are poor for your particular situation, it may take a while for you to get into a regular rhythm of production to actually get anything done. Other players can also interfere with you by sending their character and/or mechs to attack or harass your territory or workers. I usually find that I need to plan ahead 2-3 turns to accomplish a simple goal like building a mech. Beyond the 3-turn window, who knows what the board looks like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCombat is kind of straightforward - you can attack a hex with one or two combat units, and up to two combat units will defend it. Each side can spend up to 7 military power, plus play one combat card per unit on their side, each card adds 2-5 to your total. The attacker wins all ties, favoring aggressors. Due to the way military power and combat cards are accumulated, it\u0026rsquo;s risky to initiate combat unless you have at least 14 military power (this ensures you have a fighting chance against a counterattack). Furthermore, each faction can only gain up to 2 stars from winning combats, so you want to make them count. In our games, we find that typically the winning faction will use two combats to try to earn 2 stars in one turn and end the game, and often those will be the only combats that happen in the entire game. Not sure if we are playing this optimally!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames tend to go at least an hour long, roughly 20 or so turns in our experience. Because of the game\u0026rsquo;s pacing and action structure, you can have games where it feels like I haven\u0026rsquo;t accomplished much by then. Usually this creates a bit of snowball effect as well - the player who gets his act together earlier will tend to pull ahead and be difficult to catch up to. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if there\u0026rsquo;s a \u003ca href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComebackMechanic\"\u003ecomeback mechanism\u003c/a\u003e we\u0026rsquo;re missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe display is literally just the actual board, and the camera can be a bit finicky sometimes. In my last game I accidentally rotated the view and took a minute to figure out how to get it back. The UI is also fairly sparse and a lot of information or options can be hidden in the weirdest places. Like, figuring out where your faction is allowed to cross rivers can be challenging for new players. I\u0026rsquo;ve attached some screenshots to this post, but they\u0026rsquo;re nothing special.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is probably just relevant to my playgroup, but because of the slow pace, we tend to play a second metagame on top of the endgame scoring, where we consider the player who has spent the least amount of time on his turns (as seen via the turn clock) as \u0026ldquo;winning by time\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong the digital board games we\u0026rsquo;ve played, this is the one where we have the least amount of playtime. Unsurprising given how slow the pace is and how difficult it is. For this reason, I think it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to recommend to any boardgame newbies.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
