I decided to try it out mostly because I remembered it getting a lot of buzz for its last season back in 2020 and getting a lot of Emmy Awards for that season. I ended up binge-watching all six seasons of the series in around two weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe accolades are quite well-deserved, as it\u0026rsquo;s a very good sitcom. The series follows the rich and famous Rose family who lose their fortune to an embezzling business manager. They are left with one asset: a small, backwoods town they once purchased as a joke: the titular Schitt\u0026rsquo;s Creek. They end up having to stay at a run-down motel in Schitt\u0026rsquo;s Creek and having to find their way forward in the world after losing everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe series starts off with the predictable fish-out-of-water scenarios one would expect, with the Roses initially experiencing friction with the residents of their new home town. Through the course of the series, they eventually learn to adapt to their situation and to get along with the small-town residents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think the best thing about the series is that it\u0026rsquo;s very positive; there is very little malice, drama or conflict among the main cast, and most of their comedic situations are due to things like miscommunications, poor expectations, or plain bad luck. One of their major long-running story arcs is about David, the son of the family David, who is pansexual, meeting and falling in love with another guy and eventually marrying him, and this story arc is executed over four seasons without a hint of homophobia from the other characters (there is a minor plot point where the guy is worried about how his parents will take his coming out, but they face no issues there.) They don\u0026rsquo;t even really use the \u0026ldquo;shit\u0026rdquo; pun in the town name in more than one episode!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s one of those shows that\u0026rsquo;s more absurd situation than absurd comedy. It\u0026rsquo;s not the ridiculous, laugh-out-loud, greatly memeable kind of show like some of my favorites like \u003cstrong\u003eBrooklyn Nine Nine\u003c/strong\u003e  or \u003cstrong\u003eParks and Recreation\u003c/strong\u003e and focuses more on the absurd situations the Rose family find themselves in. It\u0026rsquo;s relatively short (each of the six seasons I have only around 13 episodes) and the run was ended by their choice (and not by a network cancellation or such), so they were able to wrap up most of their story arcs and give each of the characters satisfying endings. (Except maybe Ted. Poor Ted!)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Part of it was probably because when I was a junior developer they almost never gave me access to production (like a sensible company!) Not to mention there\u0026rsquo;s always been several layers of reviews, testing and QA between me and production. And by the time I was senior enough to be handling production myself, I knew enough to be super careful with everything.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eEarlier today I watched Rurouni Kenshin: The Final (2021), now out on Netflix (PH, not sure about elsewhere). I don\u0026rsquo;t normally do full blog posts for \u003ca href=\"/reviews/movies\"\u003emovies\u003c/a\u003e anymore, but I\u0026rsquo;m \u003ca href=\"/archives/ancient/geocities/rk/\"\u003ea big Rurouni Kenshin fan\u003c/a\u003e, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t have much commentary on record for the \u003ca href=\"/2012/12/277092263371350017/\"\u003efirst three live action films\u003c/a\u003e, so I figured I would write some words mostly about this new film, but maybe also a bit about the first three as well. The film is based on a manga story arc from more than 20 years ago, so I\u0026rsquo;m not really going to be avoiding spoilers here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo this film covers the Revenge / Jinchuu arc, the third and final arc of the Rurouni Kenshin manga, most of which was never adapted to anime. This kind of works in the film\u0026rsquo;s favor, as I don\u0026rsquo;t have any anime to compare it to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was \u003ca href=\"/2014/09/10153244419688912/\"\u003ea bit disappointed\u003c/a\u003e in the original trilogy\u0026rsquo;s handling of the fight scenes, since in my head I was comparing them to the epic anime battles, which is silly since an anime series and a live-action film are fundamentally different media, and some things simply wouldn\u0026rsquo;t translate well. Like, in the manga and anime, Kenshin\u0026rsquo;s learning the succession art of the Hiten Mitsurugi school and later using it to overcome Shishio was a big plot point, but was completely glossed over in the films. (And in the revenge arc, it\u0026rsquo;s also a plot point that Enishi is able to defeat that same succession art.) I guess I\u0026rsquo;m more forgiving these days of not strictly adhering to the source material (countless comic book movies will do that I guess), so I\u0026rsquo;m learning more to enjoy them as swashbuckling samurai adventures rather than only as anime adaptations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing about the Jinchuu arc is that it was quite long, so I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how they were going to fit it all in a single movie, even taking liberties with the plot points. I found out before that they had actually made two new films, with \u003cem\u003eThe Final\u003c/em\u003e only being the first, so I kind of assumed this one would end with a cliffhanger, assuming they follow the general plot of the manga. Well, it turns out that while the first half of the film largely follows the plot of the manga arc and the first part of Enishi\u0026rsquo;s revenge plan, they scrapped the second half of the manga arc in favor of an all-out battle / assault for the film\u0026rsquo;s final act, pulling in appearances from characters that never appeared in the manga arc (some of them obviously appearing as fan service!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this divergence from the manga is fine and understandable given the limitations of the medium, it does significantly weaken the impact of Enishi\u0026rsquo;s revenge plan; early on in the film he states that death is insufficient for Kenshin to atone, but in the third arc he just ends up attempting to kill him or to get him to kill himself. The manga arc had a stronger punishment for Kenshin in the form of faking Kaoru\u0026rsquo;s death, sending Kenshin into a downward spiral that takes him a while to recover from, a character arc that speaks more strongly towards the series\u0026rsquo; general message of atonement and redemption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m also disappointed because cutting out the second half of the revenge arc means we never get to see Yahiko in a one-on-one battle against one of Enishi\u0026rsquo;s minions. That was one of the most memorable parts of the manga arc for me because it represented a big growth in strength and capability for Yahiko to be able to hold his own using Kamiya Kasshin techniques. But again, I guess that\u0026rsquo;s not a thing that would have translated well to the big screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s an English rock / R\u0026amp;B track that plays over the end credits, it\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n5bpeh5NNg\"\u003eRenegades by One OK Rock\u003c/a\u003e. It felt slightly jarring and out of place since I watched the film with Japanese voices and English dubs, but I\u0026rsquo;m told even the first trilogy had English tracks over the end credits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter finishing the movie, I wondered what the fifth film would actually be about, and it turns out it\u0026rsquo;s actually going to expand more on the Tomoe / Kenshin backstory that was only covered briefly in this film. While that would be a reasonable way to split up the revenge arc into two movies, it feels like it would have made more sense to release the prequel film first (and more appropriate since it\u0026rsquo;s titled \u003cem\u003eThe Beginning\u003c/em\u003e), especially since this film already covers the major plot points that they would show in the prequel. Still as a big series fan (despite \u003ca href=\"/2017/11/932887665346670593/\"\u003ethe author becoming controversial\u003c/a\u003e later on), I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to the prequel\u0026rsquo;s eventual release on Netflix; we\u0026rsquo;ll see what surprises await us there.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I was ambitious, or it might be more accurate to say I had delusions of grandeur. I would often visualize myself doing some great things, whether that was something like writing a great novel, creating some superviral software platform, making the next great game franchise, winning the Magic pro tour or such. The problem was all of this ambition never came up with the discipline or hard work that would have been necessary for the accomplishment.

When \u003ca href=\"/2020/02/burnout/\"\u003eI got tired of feeding the capitalist machine\u003c/a\u003e, I formed the first version of this life philosophy, informally, in my head: \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;From now on, I will only do things that I want to do.\u0026quot;\u003c/em\u003e (I violated that fairly quickly!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m in a stage in my life where I don\u0026rsquo;t feel strongly enough about any one thing that I think it\u0026rsquo;s a good time to formally declare this as a life philosophy. Basically I\u0026rsquo;m in an exploratory, \u0026ldquo;try things out and see where they go\u0026rdquo; mode. An example of this in practice is how I\u0026rsquo;ve been \u003ca href=\"/2021/06/gmtk-game-jam-2021-manananggal/\"\u003edoing game jams recently\u003c/a\u003e, and while getting into gamedev has been a longtime dream of mine, I hold no long-term ambitions about it.

This is my second game jam, after \u003ca href=\"/2021/04/ludum-dare-48-diver/\"\u003emy Ludum Dare 48 entry back in April\u003c/a\u003e. I was a lot more anxious about this one, especially after rewatching the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGeAkU2wu4o\"\u003evideo of the winners from the last year\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis post is mostly about how the game jam unfolded for me. If you just want to view the game I made \u003ca href=\"https://hungryroy.itch.io/manananggal\"\u003ehere\u0026rsquo;s the link\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe theme for the jam was \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026ldquo;JOINED TOGETHER\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e. The theme was announced 2am Saturday my time here, but I had stuff to do up to lunch time so I couldn\u0026rsquo;t start on any actual jam work until after then. I did spend try to brainstorm game ideas before then, but I really struggled with this theme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went through some number of ideas, though many of them were variants of \u0026ldquo;tandem side-scrolling platformer where you have to bring two characters to the end\u0026rdquo;, but most of them felt pretty meh theme-wise. I also thought about things like, a guy with a ball and chain that limited his movements, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t think I knew enough about Godot physics to implement the linked bodies correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finally decided to do a game based on \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manananggal\"\u003ethe local Manananggal myth\u003c/a\u003e, since the whole detaching half of the body and rejoining fit the theme really well. I was imagining a puzzle platformer, but I was worried that mechanically I might not have enough for anything more than a couple of levels. I had a few ideas, but I was pretty sure I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have something close the 10 levels I had for Diver. The initial discussion from my support group suggested I play into the lore that manananggals ate babies, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to make a baby-eating game!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#947dad2787cdcbf00b928fb7c64cd0a3-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2021/06/gmtk-game-jam-2021-manananggal/manang1_hu6f80a53b383b582c5587308196d6b324_89241_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"947dad2787cdcbf00b928fb7c64cd0a3-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2021/06/gmtk-game-jam-2021-manananggal/manang1.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"15 Jun 2021 4:30pm\"\u003e15 Jun 2021 4:30pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-tools\"\u003eThe tools\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m basically using the same tech stack as last time: Godot Engine for the all the coding, \u003ca href=\"https://www.piskelapp.com\"\u003ePiskel\u003c/a\u003e for the pixel art and so on. I also decided to reuse a tileset I got from an \u003ca href=\"https://www.codingkaiju.com/tutorials/beginner-godot-2d-platformer/\"\u003eonline platformer tutorial\u003c/a\u003e I was playing around with the previous week (with some modifications). I still had to do the character sprites and animation myself though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"saturday\"\u003eSaturday\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturday was challenging, since I only had half the day to work with. I used up most of the time just doing spritework and implementing the basic detach / rejoin mechanic, implementing switches and gates. All of this was only good enough for an introductory level by the end of the day so I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like I had much progress done, especially compared to my progress with Diver at around the same mark. I was tired so I just went to sleep and hoped for a better Sunday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing that helped me was being on the Discord for the jam, which was super active, and full of a lot of other people also having trouble with ideas and levels and coding. Ludum Dare had posts from the devs on their page, but that was nowhere near as active or interactive as this one. I found myself going through the Discord chat when I felt stressed or tired, reassured by the presence of my fellow game jammers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"sunday\"\u003eSunday\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManaged to start early Sunday. I started out by implementing a simple framework for easily transitioning between stages, which would allow me to easily add stages and change the order (great for debugging!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I needed to do the second stage. I implemented an enemy that I would need, a human villager out on patrol for monsters (which meant more sprite work). Basically adds a stealth component to the game - you could walk past the humans while joined together, but you can\u0026rsquo;t let them catch you while detached. I also added a Pick Up / Drop mechanic where you can pick up items while flying in detached mode and drop them for different effects. In the second stage I made, one of the obstacles was you needed to drop a rock on a human in order to stun and get past him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the second stage, I worked on the last stage. I had decided early on to have an ending that subverts some elements of the manananggal myth, so I already knew what the last stage needed to be. And that included a bit more sprite work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, I had around half a day remaining, and I wanted to submit early to avoid any possible rush on itch.io during the submission time, so time was short. Aside from the actual stages, I still had a bunch of polish stuff to do. I originally had an idea for a third stage that involved a new dog enemy that could detect you even while merged. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to do more sprite work though, so I decided to reuse some sprites and movement patterns from Diver to make a challenging spike level instead. (I would later get a lot of complaints about my playtester friends about how difficult the spike level was lol.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, I needed to do all the polish stuff I was planning. Luckily my friend Jaime told me he had time to help me with BGM and SFX, so I asked him to provide some tracks and help me source some sound effects. This freed me up to do things like intro and ending dialogs, splash screen, add decorations and polish to the stages, add key input hints, etc. For the splash screen, same as for Diver, I used up one of my \u003ca href=\"/tags/sketchdaily\"\u003esketchdaily\u003c/a\u003e slots to draw the cover art / splash screen art for the game:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#3402fdb7d2dd54393a3bd983f02915c5-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2021/06/1404039267685261332/1_1404039267685261332_E3wmRC2VoAoDYao_hubdff7498a5e79872d31686045612719b_103145_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Manananggal #sketchdaily 162/365\" title=\"Manananggal #sketchdaily 162/365\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eManananggal #sketchdaily 162/365 (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"3402fdb7d2dd54393a3bd983f02915c5-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2021/06/1404039267685261332/1_1404039267685261332_E3wmRC2VoAoDYao.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eManananggal #sketchdaily 162/365\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"15 Jun 2021 4:30pm\"\u003e15 Jun 2021 4:30pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2021/06/1404039267685261332/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003ch3 id=\"submission-and-aftermath\"\u003eSubmission and aftermath\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made my submission around 4 hours before the deadline (since I also had other stuff to do).

The game actually ended up more polished than I thought it would, though it is still very short (only 4 playable levels), but that\u0026rsquo;s fine, as I was practically new to platformers anyway. Most importantly, I learned a lot of things along the way; among them: how to structure stages and transitions in Godot, making objects interact with a linked object, patrolling mobs with ledge/wall detection and sight radius, etc. This game is my documentation of those things I learned, although I\u0026rsquo;m thinking maybe I should log some of those lessons here on the blog so I have a set of notes online for Godot. We\u0026rsquo;ll see!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the submission time, there\u0026rsquo;s a one week period for the games to be rated. I believe you only need an itch.io account to rate the games, but if you aren\u0026rsquo;t a participant, you need to rate 25 randomly-selected games before you can rate specific games. You can rate my submission \u003ca href=\"https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2021/rate/1082887\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that I\u0026rsquo;m expecting to make the top 20 or even the top 100 mind you, as the game is very short and I feel very basic. My explanations are low and really I should just be satisfied with having finished. I have already received some encouraging comments on itch.io though, so that\u0026rsquo;s a nice boost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI actually haven\u0026rsquo;t touched the game itself or looked at the code or anything like that since submitting. All I\u0026rsquo;ve done was look at comments and get some feedback from friends. At that point I had played through it so many times I was kind of sick of it, so I stayed away from it since then. I really should rate some games though, just as a way to give back to the community. I\u0026rsquo;ll try to get some reviews and ratings and comments in over the week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis makes 2 out of 2 game jams where I\u0026rsquo;ve successfully been able to finish and submit. The discussions on the Discord chat seem to be implying it\u0026rsquo;s not uncommon to fail to complete your game. I will happily take this as a testament to my ability to manage scope and keep it small. Although, it might also be an indication of playing it safe and not being willing to push the envelope - I might consider to be more aggressive in future jams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOTOH, I\u0026rsquo;m a lot older than many of the participants, so I need a lot more sleep. Some of them were talking about working on their submission for like 20-30 hours straight, and I\u0026rsquo;m like I can\u0026rsquo;t even sit in my chair for more than two hours without needing to lie down for an hour afterwards. So I gotta work smarter to keep up with the young\u0026rsquo;uns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor future jams, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably also try to do some other genres instead of side-scrollers which I did for the first 2 jams. Maybe some kind of shooter thingy? Or a match 3? Or maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll study how to do some of the ideas I passed over this time? We\u0026rsquo;ll see! Looking forward to doing more game jams! I think the major one is the next Ludum Dare in October, though I\u0026rsquo;ll also be looking out for other game jam opportunities before then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e[2021-06-23]\u003c/strong\u003e The GMTK game jam results are out; my Manananggal game ended up ranked 717 overall out of 5800+ entries. Looks like my programmer art pulled me down in the presentation criteria lol\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I was a lot more anxious about this one, especially after rewatching the video of the winners from the last year.\nThis post is mostly about how the game jam unfolded for me.

No megamalomaniacs to defeat, just foreign agents and mercs.\u003c!--sep--\u003e The opening sequence pays homage to the earlier pre-Moore films, acknowledging the death of Tracy Bond and killing off a villain that looks suspiciously like arch-nemesis Blofeld. The opening song is pretty good.\u003c!--sep--\u003e The rest of the film was ok, if a bit forgettable. I liked the rock climbing scene, but the ski chase and car chases felt like things we\u0026rsquo;ve seen before. Also, Moore is starting to show his age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelina Havelock (portrayed by Carole Bouquet) reminded me a lot of DC’s Huntress - a crossbow-wielding woman out for revenge\u003c/p\u003e\n",
