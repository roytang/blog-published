I like the set so far and looking forward to trying out the other houses!\nYT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5kKeD3qj2Q\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be",

My thoughts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSeason 1 is 10 episodes, each episode 30 minutes long. I finished all of the episodes over the span of one day!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t know much coming in: I knew it was about sports, and I knew it was supposedly a comedy. For some reason I assumed it was about American football. It turns out to be about English association football, i.e. soccer!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWikipedia claims the series is a comedy, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a \u0026ldquo;ha-ha / laugh out loud\u0026rdquo; zany situation comedy like say, Brooklyn Nine-Nine or Modern Family. Ted Lasso is more of an \u0026ldquo;absurd premise\u0026rdquo; kind of comedy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBill Lawrence, creator of Scrubs, helped develop the series, but it is much less zanier than that one.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInstead, Ted Lasso is the story of an outsider coming into to help a dysfunctional team get their act together. I\u0026rsquo;d say the story it most reminds me of is Mighty Ducks. In both cases, I learned a lot more about the associated sport (Ice hockey / association football) works.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe difference between Mighty Ducks\u0026rsquo; reluctant coach Gordon Bombay and the titular Ted Lasso is that Ted is earnest, eager, and genuinely cares for his team, and he uses his abundant optimism to plot through any problems that life throws at him.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe meat of the story is how Ted Lasso, an American football coach thrust into the unfamiliar world of the English Premiere League navigates both the foreign culture and the many contrasting personalities he has to work with.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe main plotline of the team\u0026rsquo;s eventual win-loss record is at many times overshadowed by the character arcs and development, as the cast grows to understand each other and their roles within the team.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI think one of the main reasons Ted Lasso has been so popular during this pandemic is the absolute optimism both of the show and the lead character inspite of all the challenges thrown his way. It\u0026rsquo;s a kind of optimism we could all use in these trying times.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",

I’m here to tell you that that is not true. Programming is hard, programming is not for everyone, and for the time being everyone might be able to do it, but most definitely most should not. Like most of the empty, shallow, positive messages coming with an automatic defense against refute, in this case talking about this gatekeeping thing that simply doesn’t happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think gatekeeping is definitely a thing that happens. I should know, I used to hold the opinion that not everybody can be a programmer, because there are non-trivial skill sets that are necessary, such as attention to detail, ability to analyze and reason out possible outcomes, the ability to imagine abstractions in your head, and so on. Back when I did training for new hires, I could easily tell who are the people who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t pass, by simply noting who had trouble with things like SQL joins. (This was back in the day when we expected our devs to be able to handle everything from backend database stuff to web frontends with HTML/CSS/JS. I assume modern day frontend devs wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have much use for SQL usage\u0026hellip;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, it\u0026rsquo;s not a hard gate, where someone can tell you it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to become a programmer. Anyone can be a programmer, in the same way that anyone can become an accountant or a lawyer or such: it\u0026rsquo;s going to take a nontrivial amount of effort and hard work (I\u0026rsquo;m not claiming that being a programmer is necessarily as difficult as those jobs!). Some people may make it look easy, because they may have a bit more aptitude than others (due to background or whatever), in the same way that some people find math easy and others find it nearly impossible. And a lot of the time it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to detect whether that aptitude exists until you\u0026rsquo;re trying it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s also a huge difference between learning to code just to write a few scripts in Python or some macros in Excel vs working professionally as a programmer, possibly in a team, with serious deadlines and crunch and all that. Not everyone is suited to that life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m all for inclusivity - we definitely need more people working in tech, and for people who are struggling, learning to code may be a way for them to live better lives. But we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t sugarcoat the challenges involved or the effort required. \u0026ldquo;Anyone can learn to code\u0026rdquo;, given enough time and effort, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean programming is easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWithout Their Permission\u003c/em\u003e is a 2013 book by Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian. The central thesis of the book is that modern-day internet breaks down barriers and allows anyone to accomplish great things without having to go through traditional gatekeepers like publishers and such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI actually read the first part of the book a few years ago, and just resumed reading the book now because I saw in iBooks that it remembered where I had stopped. The first part covered mostly the author\u0026rsquo;s involvement in two successful startups - Reddit and Hipmunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe middle part of the book is dedicated to the central idea that \u0026ldquo;all links are created equal\u0026rdquo; and as long as you make something that other people want and make it accessible on the internet, success is possible. The author extols how the modern internet has made it easier for anyone to start something big, the same way he and his cofounder built Reddit. The funny thing for me is he cites a number of interesting startups that he\u0026rsquo;s invested in, but I\u0026rsquo;ve not heard of most of them, so presumably they didn\u0026rsquo;t actually succeed in the long term.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last part of the book covers the then-online community\u0026rsquo;s protests against the SOPA and PIPA bills, lobbyist-fueled IP protection laws that would have stifled the open internet, the precursor of the modern DMCA. While the defeats of SOPA and PIPA were early successes for online freedom, these days there are still other insidious challenges such as surveillance capitalism  and the deliberate spread of online misinformation and conspiracy theories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I don\u0026rsquo;t object to this central idea, I feel like it should be tempered with the fact that despite the open internet, success is still much harder than the book might portray it. And despite the waning power of traditional gatekeepers, these days there are online gatekeepers as well that can hinder your success. Online gatekeepers include App Store reviewers, closed platforms like facebook that have unclear moderation policies, censorship from governments, algorithms that decide what to surface to other people, and so on. It\u0026rsquo;s still probably better than the old days, but there are still a lot of challenges on the modern internet. To be fair, the book was released in 2013, which was a lifetime ago on the internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

They handed us health screening forms and waivers to fill up while we were queued up inside.

All in all about 3 hours for me on site, and I think it\u0026rsquo;s only because they had to start late? I imagine if your time slot was 11am, it\u0026rsquo;d be a bit quicker for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m writing this around 3 hours after I got the shot, feeling fine, no apparent ill effects, though they said to monitor for up to 6 hours after the shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMostly satisfied with how things were handled on-site, mostly because the past few days I\u0026rsquo;ve heard horror stories about chaos at some of the other sites, mostly because some sites allegedly allowed walk-ins. The staff at Pinyahan were handling things as well as could be expected, although the whole process felt a bit too redundant with all the checks. Here, when someone asked outside if walkins would be accepted, they were told that the doses available for the day were only those allocated for those who had booked online. Also, they did that annoying thing with the queues for people sitting in chairs where every few minutes you\u0026rsquo;d have to get up and scoot over to the next chair over, until you eventually got to the front of the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"online-registration-and-processes\"\u003eOnline registration and processes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least the on-site process was a bit better than the online registration, which was kind of a disaster. Basically, early on they said vaccinations would be handled via their Quezon City ID initiative, so people should sign up for that. I applied for mine digitally, while the parents submitted paper forms to the barangay, since someone came around the subdivision surveying seniors who wanted to be registered. My QC ID was approved after a couple of weeks, but up to now still no word on my parents\u0026rsquo; QC ID.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometime in March, they announced that there would be two ways to get vaccinated: one was to register via the \u003ca href=\"https://app.ezconsult.io/\"\u003eapp.ezconsult.io\u003c/a\u003e, or if you had a QC ID, you could wait for the LGU/barangay personnel to process the lists and give you an appointment. Second option felt like it might take a while, so I went ahead and created an account for myself on ezconsult. My plan was to create an account for the parents after I\u0026rsquo;d seen the process, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to successfully book a vaccine appointment because apparently I had registered too early and the integration hadn\u0026rsquo;t been enabled yet??\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater on, they announced ezconsult was available for everybody, so I proceeded and was able to book an appointment for april 27th, the earliest I had seen available. Weirdly, when I was searching for vaccination sites, it included sites in other cities like Las Pinas, who I assume also have an arrangement with ezconsult. I also created accounts for the parents and submitted them for review. When filling up the form expressing interest in vaccination, some of the fields still assumed you were a health worker, since this sytem was initially used for the A1 priority groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people online were reporting problems with the app saying the email was already taken; turns out they had batch imported some QC ID data and auto-created accounts for those people without informing them, so people had to reset passwords (something a nontechnical person wouldn\u0026rsquo;t think to try!). Since I had created my account before this import, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a problem. Then there also were reports of people being able to book vaccination schedules without being one of the currently allowed priority groups; apparently the site doesn\u0026rsquo;t validate for that. And because Sinovac, the only widely available vaccine in the country, was not advised for seniors, QC government had to advice seniors not to book yet since there were very few stocks of Astra Zeneca for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while my brother, who had previously registered the same slot as me on the 27th, mentioned he had been able to reschedule to an earlier slot, today at 9am. I was like, how did you do that? When I checked the app I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see any free time slots available earlier than the 27th. Checking online, a lot of people were reporting there were free slots, while others said they couldn\u0026rsquo;t see any, so I assume they were doing some kind of manual / batch updates to set free slots, I ended up having to check every few days. It was only last Thursday I was only able to reschedule my appointment to today. And at that time, my parent\u0026rsquo;s accounts were still under review!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen last Friday, the ezconsult app was down for most of the day for some reason. (So, I was lucky to rebook right before that!) Lots of complaints from people, of course. By Saturday morning they were back up, and thankfully, I found that my parents accounts\u0026rsquo; could now schedule an appointment! Except\u0026hellip; there were no slots available again! At this time, the QC government had to send out advisories telling people not to go if they weren\u0026rsquo;t among the priority groups, as apparently large numbers of such people were causing chaos at some of the sites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile in the queues earlier, I asked about the availability of AstraZeneca for seniors, but I was told they didn\u0026rsquo;t have any today and couldn\u0026rsquo;t say if it would be available until the day itself when they got their deliveries. A few days ago, the FDA had approved Sinovac for seniors, so the few senior citizens in the queues today were getting Sinovac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I got my shot, we were told by a doctor in the observation room that the system would send us an automated email about the schedule for the second shot, but we were told to DISREGARD IT and instead come back on the date specified at the back of the vaccination card. So, their automation wasn\u0026rsquo;t going well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, I can\u0026rsquo;t really blame the developers of the app for all the problems, I can only imagine the rapid pace of changing requirements they were subjected to, especially with the flip-flopping on whether seniors could go, or comorbids could go, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully all of the problems are just growing pains and such, and that the systems and processes get better and clearer as time goes on, since we definitely to ramp up and scale up vaccination in this country! Not to mention, they also need to provide alternative methods of registration/scheduling for non-technical people (probably requires legwork by barangay officials), as right now the process is largely inaccessible to the poorer sectors.\u003c/p\u003e",

And this one was totally new to me, for sure. So, this is a bit of a double review.

But we were dragons. We were supposed to be cruel, cunning, heartless, and terrible. But this much I can tell you, you ape—the great face pressed even closer, so that Wonse was staring into the pitiless depths of his eyes—we never burned and tortured and ripped one another apart and called it morality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ndash; Terry Pratchett, \u003cem\u003eGuards!

He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.\nBut the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that’d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years’ time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.\nThis was the Captain Samuel Vimes “Boots” theory of socioeconomic unfairness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ndash; Terry Pratchett, \u003cem\u003eMen at Arms\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, yes, the Discworld books are maybe kind of same-y, but that\u0026rsquo;s kind of a good thing? You usually know what to expect. They\u0026rsquo;re light reading, they\u0026rsquo;re funny in a dry British humor kind of way, and Pratchett likes to attack and parody and deconstruct common fantasy tropes.
