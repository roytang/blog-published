            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eI had my first taste with working with software testers during my first project where I was involved with porting an old system to a new version of the software. My first task involved porting reports which were to be generated by the users then printed out. The task wasn’t too difficult: basically you took the source code of the report (it was some weird binary format recognized only by the particular reporting tool \u0026ndash; that was how it was done back in the day) and open it using the newer version of the tool, and the tool did some sort of migration magic to adapt it to the new format, then you just save it back again. You compile and run the report using the new format and verify that it’s getting the correct output (needs to be the same output as the old format), and that should be it. Most of the time, at least. Sometimes there were some things that the new format couldn’t handle, or maybe there were some minor compile errors after migration, but such problems were easily fixed, so it was pretty straightforward\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eOr so I thought. All the reports I was porting were being tested by one of my team members, who was also a newbie like me. Coincidentally, both of the testers I had on the project were also ECE graduates same as me; I was the unusual one who took the developer role. They had their own training focused on tester concepts, so initially I had no idea what to expect. When you’re fresh out of school you don’t have any idea yet how much iteration and rework goes into software development, so there’s this attitude of, \u0026ldquo;Hey it’s working. Looks good!\u0026rdquo; without being too thorough\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eI soon found out that the testers were trained to be very thorough, so I would get a bunch of bug reports. One of my testers would print out the reports, both the new format and the old format, and hold both reports up against the light, overlaid on each other. And they had to match, pixel-perfect! If the new report generated in a slightly different manner, that was a bug! (Of course, this made no sense to me, since logically the users wouldn’t care or notice if some column in the report was 1 pixel over to the right compared to the old format, but those were the instructions so whatever). And then they would use like really long nonsense strings in the data, and in some cases it would make the text wrapping in the report work differently, so I had to fix those too. Then one of the testers would print out reports with a lot of data, generating like 30 to 40 pages or more (we wasted a lot of paper in those days), and the pagination had to match exactly between the old format and the new format. And if it didn’t, I had to spend some time poring over the printout to find the exact point at which the pagination changed and what caused it. Eventually I learned a set of tricks and knew what to look out for when porting the reports\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWhen you’re starting out as a software developer and you’re first introduced to the idea of QA or software testers, there’s a slight tendency to be offended or defensive about bug reports and to be a bit annoyed at the testers. After all, these are people whose job is specifically to find your errors! It’s a problem especially if you have a sense of pride about your work, but once you let go of that pride and recognize that you are not your code, you get to realize that you and the testers are working as a team. The testers are the shield that make sure that stupid stuff you missed or overlooked doesn’t get sent to the users. It’s like how in a buddy cop movie you need to have a partner to watch your back or to cover the other exit so that the bad guy doesn’t get away\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAfter working with the same testers for some time you get used to their individual quirks and figure out which bugs they are more likely to find, so you start focusing on those areas more. You also learn some tricks to sometimes troll around with them especially when you get annoyed with too many bug reports\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eOne of my favorite things early on in the same project was when I would send one of programs over for testing. In addition to the reports, often we would also be doing forms running using the same tool. In those days, we didn’t yet have Hudson or Maven or Ant any sort of automated build system. We would commit our source to version control and generate the binary file manually and copy the binary file over into a shared network drive. And there was no versioning on the network drive, just one folder where all the binaries were. Then we can tell the tester, hey you can test so-and-so program now\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe tester would copy the binaries from the network drive to their own machines for testing, and after a while he would come back with some bug reports. The bug reports would be logged in an Excel file (we didn’t have any bug tracking software then either), and I would do a quick skim, and if the changes were easy enough (minor UI stuff), I’d do some quick edits, rebuild the binary, and copy it to the network drive. Then I would message the tester, pretending I’d just seen the bug reports, \u0026ldquo;Hey, these bug reports don’t seem right. I think you forgot to get the latest files from the drive.\u0026rdquo; And sure enough, they get the latest files and check again and the bugs would already be fixed. I managed to do this a couple of times before my tester caught on\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the advent of dedicated test servers and modern build scripts, of course this was something I couldn\u0026rsquo;t regularly do anymore \u0026ndash; although once or twice I did have the opportunity to do a live edit on a test server (to verify my fix works) and troll the tester a bit by telling her it worked fine!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few months of working with testers, you quickly get used to working with them and get into a good rhythm. You\u0026rsquo;re kind of partners in crime, except instead of crime it\u0026rsquo;s quality in software programs. Even with modern developer unit-testing and automated testing practices, having a second set of eyes looking at your program and attacking it from different angles helps improve the quality of the system. A good tester is the shield to the developer\u0026rsquo;s sword, they make sure the developer keeps his guard up and doesn\u0026rsquo;t lose to his own mistakes\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;What? Where?\u0026rdquo; Steve muttered over the cackle of his walkie-talkie. He dropped his fork on the plateful of bacon and started packing up. \u0026ldquo;I’m nearest, I’ll be there ASAP. Have Glen and Lynn follow me as soon as possible.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis companion was looking at him quizzically from across the table. \u0026ldquo;Relax, John. You didn’t screw up this time. In fact, I guess it’s time for your trial by fire.\u0026rdquo; He got up and tossed him the keys. \u0026ldquo;Come on, you’re driving.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn just nodded and followed as Steve got up and stepped out of the supply depot. John had been on this internship for three days now and he still had that feeling of awe and majesty whenever he gazed upon the vast expanse. The green grassy fields were bounded to the north by a heavily wooded area and to the southwest by a small mountain range. The sun was on the way down by the mountains; it would be dark soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Where we going?\u0026rdquo; John asked as he stepped into the driver’s seat of the open-air off-road jeep they had been using for patrols.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve jumped into the passenger seat and gestured. \u0026ldquo;North by northeast. Floor it, we need to be there fast.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn nodded and soon they were speeding down the grassy plains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Are we headed into the forest?\u0026rdquo; John asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Yup,\u0026rdquo; Steve was rummaging around in the supplies in the back of the jeep. To John’s surprise, Steve pulled out a scoped hunting rifle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;What’s going on? There’s going to be trouble?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I hope not,\u0026rdquo; Steve said, loading and readying the rifle. \u0026ldquo;But best be ready.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore John could ask any more questions, they both heard a loud thunderous roar ring through the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Is that\u0026ndash;?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Yup,\u0026rdquo; Steve nodded. \u0026ldquo;It’s Amethyst.\u0026rdquo; Steve pointed to the edge of the forest. \u0026ldquo;There! Look!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were still some distance away, but the dragon was large enough for John to see. Amethyst was on the ground, her amber-yellow scales glistening in the receding sunlight. Her large wings were pinned to the ground somehow and she seemed to be struggling with some sort of ropes. It was starting to get dark, but John could still see a number of small figures milling around the dragon. \u0026ldquo;What are they doing\u0026ndash;?\u0026rdquo; John wondered aloud as they got closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Poachers.\u0026rdquo; A grim look took over Steve’s face as he aimed the rifle and took a shot. It was a warning shot, there was no way he would hit anything at this distance. \u0026ldquo;Hang on Amy!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe poachers turned at the sound of the warning shot. John saw that there were six of them in all, and they had a large truck nearby, barely large enough to carry a small dragon. Two had trapped Amy in a net of ropes weighted down by what looked like metal drums. One of them, a stocky man with a dark tan and wearing army fatigues was shouting instructions to the others. Three were holding rifles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Shit, \u0026quot; John said, recognizing the threat. He quickly braked and turned, sending the jeep into a spinning drift. \u0026ldquo;Get down Steve!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them ducked as shots rang overhead. The jeep skidded to a stop and John and Steve quickly spilled out the passenger side and crouched down, using the vehicle as a cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Great instincts kid! Here!\u0026rdquo; Steve tossed the rifle to John as he pulled out the walkie-talkie from his belt. \u0026ldquo;Keep ‘em busy!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding, John picked up the rifle. Now he understood why weapons training had been a requirement for this internship. He took a peek over the jeep’s side. The poachers were still firing, but keeping their distance. Amethyst struggled uselessly against the weighted ropes and her roars kept echoing. John fired a shot, then sat back to reload. \u0026ldquo;I think the dragon’s wounded Steve! Her left wing looked like it was bleeding!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve nodded. \u0026ldquo;Bastards! They probably clipped her wings to force her to land.\u0026rdquo; He spoke into the walkie-talkie again. \u0026ldquo;Glen, Lynn, where are you? These guys are heavily-armed!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Ten minutes out!\u0026rdquo; a voice cackled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Not nearly quick enough,\u0026rdquo; Steve grunted as more shots rang overhead and John managed to fire back a few times. \u0026ldquo;You got any of them yet kid?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;They’re too far, I can’t get a good shot,\u0026rdquo; John shook his head, \u0026ldquo;I don’t understand, why doesn’t the dragon breathe on them?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Amy’s too young kid, just like you,\u0026rdquo; Steve replied, \u0026ldquo;You saw her snort out a couple of small fireballs outta her nostrils the other day right? That’s all she can do without getting exhausted.\u0026rdquo; A few more shots rang over their heads. \u0026ldquo;Well, we only got one shot now. Cover me.\u0026rdquo; He reached over back into the jeep again, being careful not to expose his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I don’t suppose you have a rocket launcher in there,\u0026rdquo; John said as he fired off a couple more shots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Better,\u0026rdquo; Steve said, finally pulling out a weapon only slightly larger than a pistol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;A flare gun? How is that going to help?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;It doesn’t fire flares kid,\u0026rdquo; Steve aimed the gun upwards. \u0026ldquo;Watch and learn.\u0026rdquo; He pulled the trigger. What shot out certainly looked like a flare to John, as it slowly arced upwards into the sky. At the peak of the shot, where a flare would have exploded into bright light, instead a loud roar pierced the heavens. \u0026ldquo;Gotta hope she’s nearby…\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn saw the poachers look up at the sound in alarm. \u0026ldquo;What the heck was that?\u0026rdquo; John asked, \u0026ldquo;Who is nearby…?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was cut off by another roar, seemingly a short distance away, from beyond the woods. He looked to the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;There we go,\u0026rdquo; Steve grinned. \u0026ldquo;You’re in for a treat kid.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA large winged figure was descending towards them quickly. \u0026ldquo;Another dragon!\u0026rdquo; John exclaimed, \u0026ldquo;And she’s a lot bigger too!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Not just any dragon, kid,\u0026rdquo; Steve said, \u0026ldquo;That’s Amy’s mom!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer shadow was almost fifty-feet long as she flew over the two of them and circled back towards the poachers. She flew so close to the ground that her scales glistened with the reflections of the fading sunlight, and every flap of her enormous wings sent a strong gust towards John and Steve. John was pretty sure his mouth was agape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe larger dragon roared again in fury. John looked behind the jeep just in time to see the poachers in a panic, dropping their ropes and guns and making a mad dash for their truck. He looked up and saw the larger dragon take a deep breath and then what seemed like pure hot boiling rage burst forward from her open jaws. The grass seemingly parted way to burnt leaves as the fiery breath scorched the ground, heading straight for the poachers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe leader of the poachers was already in the truck’s driver seat, willing the engine to start. The others were scrambling into the back of the truck. But it was too late for them. The dragon caught up with them and in a matter of seconds the truck was completely wrapped in flames. With another roar, she swooped back upwards and around for another go, but it wasn’t necessary. As she turned away from the truck, it exploded into a violent ball of fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy cried out to the skies as her mother circled around and finally landed next to her. The mother’s majestic wings spread out as she landed and she let out another roar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Come on kid,\u0026rdquo; Steve said, finally getting up, \u0026ldquo;Just stick close to me, they know who I am.\u0026rdquo; He started jogging towards the dragons. John shook himself out of his stupor and followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;We’re gonna need the water choppers over here,\u0026rdquo; Steve was talking into the walkie-talkie again as they jogged past the burnt grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy and her mother let out quiet wails as they approached. Not quite roars, but more like cries of… recognition? That’s what it seemed like to John.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Easy there, girls,\u0026rdquo; Steve said in a soothing voice as he slowed down and walked towards the ropes holding Amy to the ground. He kicked one of the barrels the ropes was tied. \u0026ldquo;Must be fifty pounds of rocks in there,\u0026rdquo; he muttered as he pulled out a knife and started cutting off the ropes as the two dragons quietly looked on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Amy had been cut loose. She loosed another cry again, perhaps in gratitude. \u0026ldquo;She looks tiny in the shadow of her mother,\u0026rdquo; was all John could say as Amy tried flapping her wings. The left wing was useless, she wouldn’t be able to fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mother let out a subtle roar, and started flapping her wings. Steve held on to his hat as the gusts blew over them. She hovered over the two of them and Amy for a bit, before she finally grabbed the smaller dragon with her hind claws and lifted her up. The two of them took altitude and flew off towards the mountains, into the sunset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Wow.\u0026rdquo; John said. Then after a while he said it again. \u0026ldquo;Wow. That was… intense. What happens now?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve nodded towards the mountains. \u0026ldquo;She has a nest there somewhere. She’ll nurse Amy for a few weeks until the wing heals. Dragons have naturally good healing, so she’ll probably make a full recovery.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn looked back at the charred remains of the poachers’ truck. \u0026ldquo;Does this happen a lot?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Not really,\u0026rdquo; Steve shook his head. \u0026ldquo;They don’t often go for the dragons themselves. Couple of times a year, they’ll try raiding the nests for eggs or scales or leavings, that kind of thing. You’ll be surprised what they can get on the black market.\u0026rdquo; He mused. \u0026ldquo;The last time they got a live one must’ve been something like seven or eight years ago. It’s why we only have eight dragons here in the preserve. Used to be nine.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;No new ones have been born since then?\u0026rdquo; John said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Nope. Dragon births have been getting rarer and rarer. Not enough males. We haven’t seen our male in a few months,\u0026rdquo; Steve nodded towards the mountains again. \u0026ldquo;Amy’s the most recent birth we know of. No one knows if there’re any in the wild. The older ones are starting to die off too, so there’s a good chance the eight we got might be the last ones ever.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn shook his head. \u0026ldquo;It’s sad isn’t it, in a few generations, kids might think they’re fairy tales.\u0026rdquo; Steve had no response, so they stood there in silence staring at the charred grass until the sounds of a helicopter started coming in from the east.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Well, took ‘em long enough,\u0026rdquo; Steve muttered before gesturing John back to the jeep. \u0026ldquo;Cheer up kid, you did good today. Who knows, maybe we make a difference. Maybe soon, dragons will be all over the world again.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eGrammar note: \u0026ldquo;Biased\u0026rdquo; is an adjective. \u0026ldquo;Bias\u0026rdquo; is a noun. It is not appropriate to say that a person or an entity \u0026ldquo;is bias\u0026rdquo;. Unless you are talking to like a prejudice elemental or something (takes note of that for hypothetical hipster RPG)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a (long-winded) discussion during the recent election period, someone told me that I \u0026ldquo;obviously had a bias\u0026rdquo; and my answer was \u0026ldquo;Of course I do! Everyone does!\u0026rdquo; People have different histories and backgrounds which means for any given topic they are likely to start from different points. These biases are perfectly okay and healthy and they\u0026rsquo;re called opinions. (Cue quote about opinions being like assholes). Example: I\u0026rsquo;m not in favor of the death penalty therefore I\u0026rsquo;m biased against candidates that want to promote it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough we are all entitled to our own opinions, many times we are called upon to make objective judgments. Common examples are jury trials, elections, or when you\u0026rsquo;re a judge in some contest. During these instances we have to be careful to weigh our own biases and opinions objectively to make sure we are giving a fair judgment\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat you do need to note is when you become subject to \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias\"\u003ecognitive biases\u003c/a\u003e \u0026ndash; unconscious, automatic influences on human judgment and decision making that reliably produce reasoning errors. \u003cstrong\u003eBe wary of your own cognitive biases\u003c/strong\u003e and try to mitigate or compensate for them in your reasoning\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResearch has also shown that \u003ca href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2015/june/bias-blind-spot.html\"\u003epeople have a bias blind spot\u003c/a\u003e. This means \u003cstrong\u003ewe think we are less biased than other people\u003c/strong\u003e. This is why it is important to \u003cstrong\u003eexamine your own arguments\u003c/strong\u003e from time to time to see whether you are subject to any of the known cognitive biases. When there is a need to be objective, we need to be extra critical of our own arguments\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften, it is simply a matter of shifting your perspective: think about how a situation looks to people with an opposing point of view to balance out your own views. A sure sign of bias is that you are only aware of the positives of your own point of view and the negatives in others\u0026rsquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"\u003e\n  \u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\n    Common Evidence of Bias: Your candidate is the best, and you can find absolutely nothing good to say about other candidates.\n  \u003c/p\u003e\u0026mdash; Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) \n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/741361923061653504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eJune 10, 2016\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eChastising Duterte is not mutually exclusive with supporting De Lima.

This traps you in an echo chamber of people constantly reinforcing the same ideas. A friend and I recently were discussing how certain people react poorly to differing opinions and theorized that maybe that person grew up surrounded by people who enabled his biases\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead,** seek out different opinions. **Continuing from the death penalty example above, I don\u0026rsquo;t shut out discussion from friends who I know to be pro-death penalty. I still read their threads and try to understand their point of view. Listening to a wide variety of different opinions will tend to cancel out your biases with time and will lead towards more objective thinking. For example, when conducting a performance assessment of a team member (something I\u0026rsquo;ve done often for the past decade or so!), I tend to get other people\u0026rsquo;s opinions first to contrast with my own, and will often ask someone else whether I might be biased in certain situations. The risk of personal bias is mitigated by sourcing different opinions\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the day, we probably can\u0026rsquo;t completely eliminate our own biases, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we stop trying to be more objective in our thoughts and discussions and decisions\u003c/p\u003e\n",

In general look for high-level skills: ability to step through the solution to a problem (and explain it well), ability to spot possible problems in a given solution (you might try describing a problem you encountered in a previous project and ask how he would address it), ability to work well with others, etc\u003c/p\u003e\n",
