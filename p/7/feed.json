I do have other more interesting series on my backlog to watch, but somehow I found myself falling back to procedurals and standup comedy. The main reason is that these things don\u0026rsquo;t require a lot of attention, so I can leave them running in the background while I do other things.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI will admit I was a bit meh on \u003cstrong\u003eWandaVision\u003c/strong\u003e episodes 1-3 (and even for the rest of the MCU offerings this year), but episode 4 was just fantastic and has renewed my MCU hype. If they manage to hit this level of quality for their other series, we have a lot to look forward to. It makes me a bit sad that the Netflix series/Agents of SHIELD never received the kind of MCU integration these series are getting, but what can you do?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGaming:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA lot of gaming for me this week!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePlayed three whole games of \u003cstrong\u003eCivilization VI\u003c/strong\u003e over the past week, two of them before the latest New Frontier Pass drop even.

I\u0026rsquo;m glad I got one already, because I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I\u0026rsquo;d play them again, as the terrain restrictions are very challenging. The Corporations mode is nice, but I feel like I haven\u0026rsquo;t yet maximized it too much. It does feel like I\u0026rsquo;ll be enabling this by default from now on.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBecause of reasons, I purchased a copy of \u003cstrong\u003ePrincess Maker 2 Refine\u003c/strong\u003e on Steam. I played a bunch of the original game back in the day, and it was weird reading through the old guides on GameFAQs and some of them would have advice on configuring old-timey things like \u003ccode\u003econfig.sys\u003c/code\u003e and such. Anyway, I played almost 5 hours of this in one session, which was really bad for my eyestrain. This was one of the first calendar-based life sims I played, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s the reason I really enjoyed the Persona series? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why I found this game in particular so engaging, as it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like watching spreadsheet numbers go up.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKaldheim\u003c/strong\u003e is out on Magic Arena!

I got lucky with an initial trade that had a bit too much leverage for my taste, because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t reading too carefully. Luckily the NASDAQ spiked that day so I made it out with a bit of profit. I used a bit of that profit to buy-in a minimal amount of Gamestop, trying to cash in on the trend, unfortunately I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get in on a low price. Well, I can afford to risk (and lose) this profit, so that\u0026rsquo;s fine.

I had only been going out in shorts when going to the grocery or the nearby pharmacy, but this week I had to do an errand at a hospital a bit farther away, so I figured it would be a good time to figure out where my pants were. Hospital protocols were strict, as expected. We had to wait in like 3 different waiting areas before we could get to our appointment. This hospital was one of the hotspots back in the early days of the pandemic, so their vigilance is reassuring.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePC died unexpectedly today.

Back then I had tried unplugging the power supply and opening it up, then reconnecting to see what happened, and it just miraculously fixed itself. This time, I just unplugged the PS, then left it alone for a while. When I came back later and reconnected everything and booted up, it was fine. So I guess there\u0026rsquo;s some issue with the power supply? I don\u0026rsquo;t want to have to upgrade just yet, although this rig is already more than 5 years old, I\u0026rsquo;m hoping I can get a couple more years out of it at least.
