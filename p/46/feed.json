I might not be explaining the concept too well, here\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1087316852663939072\"\u003ethe thread\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, in a fit of \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a bit bored, anything interesting I could do?\u0026rdquo; I figured I could set up a quick webapp to do that. I did a quick PoC in Python/Flask, with \u003ca href=\"http://www.tweepy.org/\"\u003eTweepy\u003c/a\u003e for accessing the Twitter API. I normally prefer Django for my webapps, but since this was just a small, quick app, I figured Flask would be ideal. That worked out fine, except that I had to use my personal access tokens to for all the API calls. This means that if many people were using the app, it was likely to hit Twitter\u0026rsquo;s rate limits!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a few months back. A couple of days ago, someone emailed me asking about an error he encountered using the app, and sure enough it was due to the rate limits. I had a couple of free hours last weekend, so I figured I\u0026rsquo;d update the app a bit. I decided to add a Twitter login requirement, that way we can use the individual user\u0026rsquo;s access token instead of using mine globally. This would allow the rate limits to be per user and thus less likely to be hit. Now, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried implementing OAuth login some years ago and it can be terribly complicated, but luckily I found out that there\u0026rsquo;s a nifty Python package called \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/singingwolfboy/flask-dance\"\u003eFlask-Dance\u003c/a\u003e that made it super easy to add Twitter OAuth to a Flask app. This also let me discard the Tweepy dependency, since the Twitter OAuth session let me query the API endpoints directly. I also did a bit of UI cleanup and error handling and deployed the changes quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe app is available online at \u003ca href=\"/apps/twitter\"\u003eroytang.net/apps/twitter\u003c/a\u003e. There\u0026rsquo;s a few other Twitter tools I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to build, so I\u0026rsquo;ll probably put them here too when I get around to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThe concept of a \u0026ldquo;meritocracy\u0026rdquo; has come to the fore again with the \u003ca href=\"http://time.com/5549921/college-admissions-bribery-scandal/\"\u003erecent college admissions scandal\u003c/a\u003e in the US, where wealthy parents bribed coaches and other professionals to get their kids into high-end universities with supposedly high standards. It\u0026rsquo;s put a lie to the idea that the students of these universities represent the \u0026ldquo;cream of the crop\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the best of the best\u0026rdquo;, showing that kids can get in not only due to their own talent, but also due to money. Of course, it was always open knowledge before that one could get their kid admitted to such universities simply by making a huge donation. The recent events apparently crosses some line because the \u0026ldquo;donation\u0026rdquo; was in the form of bribe money to individuals instead of the school itself, but even without them there was no true meritocracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to a specialized high school (and college) that had supposedly merit-based entrance exams as well, such that one could simply not get in without passing the exams. (Athletics-based admissions aren\u0026rsquo;t very popular in this country.) Even in such a system, rich kids still have a significant leg up of course - aside from growing up in an environment that favored them, their parents could also afford to send them to expensive review centers to prep for the exams. I was reminded of this due to a recent thread among my HS batchmates discussing how their kids had to prep for the entrance exams years early because it was much more competitive these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to be a strong believer in meritocracy when I was young (probably due to my educational background), believing it to be an ideal for society to aspire to. The idea is certainly attractive - that we should give the jobs and positions to those who would be able to use them most effectively, for the betterment of society. I later learned that the term orignated in 1958 as a condemnatory word by Michael Young in his work \u0026ldquo;The Rise of the Meritocracy\u0026rdquo;. I realize now that while a pure meritocracy would be nice, it would disadvantage people who are already behind in life due to poverty, sickness or other such challenges. I think that like many things, some sort of balance is better struck, with a \u0026ldquo;meritocracy at large\u0026rdquo; in effect for the most part, but with opportunities promoted for marginalized groups. That is, a meritocracy that favors the poor instead of the rich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll this meritocract quote reminds me of a quote from the Simpsons\u0026rsquo; villainous Mr Burns who tries to justify cheating in a contest during a company retreat, which gives us a different perspective:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Burns: Tell me, Simpson, if an opportunity arose for taking a small short-cut, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be averse to taking it, would you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHomer: Hmm, not as such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Burns: Neither would I. If you can take advantage of a situation in some way, it\u0026rsquo;s your duty as an American to do it. Why should the race always be to the swift, or the Jumble to the quick-witted? Should they be allowed to win merely because of the gifts God gave them? Well I say, \u0026ldquo;Cheating is the gift man gives himself.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHomer: Mr. Burns, I insist that we cheat!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Burns: Excellent!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n",

One of the games I\u0026rsquo;d been meaning to play for a while now was Zero Time Dilemma, the third game in the Nonary Games trilogy.

It didn\u0026rsquo;t help that it\u0026rsquo;s been 4-5 years since I played VLR, and that game already had an overly complex plot so I can barely remember the details from that game as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile it\u0026rsquo;s a story-based series, the gameplay largely consists of two parts: (a) escape rooms; and (b) decision-making. The escape rooms part are entertaining enough, nothing too difficult, but satisfying enough to solve everything. The decision-making part is used to unlock branching timelines, and the path to the \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; endings is determined by your ability to find the correct decisions to unlock the correct events. Not all decisions are binary or multiple-choice; some of the more important ones require text or numeric input, making it impossible to guess them. At multiple points, you will need to reference information learned from other branches of history (don\u0026rsquo;t worry, there is a story reason for why this happens).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTook me a couple of weeks of playing sporadically to finish the game.

I have a good grasp of communication skills and think I have a decent chance of writing good copy.

This happens both with me as a customer and with me on the side of the company trying to do the sales/marketing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn example in the software engineering sphere would be a developer writing project proposals in response to tenders, and he is asked to write a technical response confirming that their product supports a particular tender requirement. Except he knows for a fact that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t, and when he raises this concern, he\u0026rsquo;s told not to worry about and that they\u0026rsquo;ll just implement the feature if/when they win the contract.

I suspect that this cripples me a bit in the real world where people with less scruples are more willing to bend the truth to make money. But for me personally, honesty and integrity are more important than making more sales.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

That\u0026rsquo;s around a 9.375% deficit. Given that, why would it be necessary for a large number of areas (I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if there are even unaffected MW service areas) to have service interruptions for majority of the hours of the day? (Over here, I think we get like very weak water pressure a couple of hours a day and that\u0026rsquo;s it). Obviously they can\u0026rsquo;t just cut 9.375% of the hours, they need to add some buffer, that\u0026rsquo;s fine. And households would of course compensate for reduced hours by consuming more during the time they do have water. But why so extreme, so immediately? At worst I would have expected that they cut service hours by at most 50% (so households have water during half the day), then if that\u0026rsquo;s not enough come out with an advisory saying \u0026ldquo;okay, we\u0026rsquo;re still consuming too much water, we need to cut more hours\u0026rdquo;. As it is, their announced service interruption hours are highly inaccurate, so it seems they can\u0026rsquo;t even predict what\u0026rsquo;s going to happen with their service. Conspiracy theories aside, I prefer to attribute all of the issues to sheer incompetence first, but is there something I\u0026rsquo;m missing here, some kind of engineering reason or what, for the service interruptions to be so widespread and unpredictable?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIf I could give some advice to someone starting out in their software development career, it would be this: Don\u0026rsquo;t stay in the same place too long. The first company I worked at, I stayed with them for thirteen years, which I now feel was way too long. I have to admit, the work was hard and challenging, but I was young and had a lot of energy and was willing to work the long hours. I was good at the work and the enjoyed the company of the people I worked with so in a certain sense I got comfortable with the status quo and stayed a bit too long. But given a do-over, I would probably prefer to have left after maybe 4-5 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopping jobs too quickly can be fantastic for your salary growth, but it has some disadvantages - you don\u0026rsquo;t build close enough relationships, and too many hops doesn\u0026rsquo;t look good on your resume. Four to five years seems like a good period to stay, long enough to learn as much as you can and build your network before moving on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main advantage of not staying too long comes in the form of personal growth. When you stay at a place too long you tend to stagnate. Sure, it\u0026rsquo;s software development so somehow you\u0026rsquo;re always improving, but not improving as quickly as you would be if you were to be thrust into a new environment every few years. Your personal network of like-minded professionals will grow quicker as well when you switch companies. I was thinking about this because I was recently asked if I could refer any senior developers and I realized my personal network of high-level senior technical guys wasn\u0026rsquo;t that deep because of me staying in the same place for so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t consider this a \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/choose-without-regret-and-the-fear-of-missing-out/\"\u003eregret\u003c/a\u003e, I\u0026rsquo;m still pretty happy and satisfied with where I am in life. Thinking about this is more of an alternate universe \u0026ldquo;what if\u0026rdquo; scenario. I have to admit that staying that long did have some advantages - I got to work with and meet some good people, younger ones even, who became good friends. But this is not an argument in favor of staying that long, as you would still have the chance to build relationships even if you move on. It\u0026rsquo;s possible in that alternate universe I may have made even better friends or may have even been friends with the same ones I have now somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, given a chance to give advice to my younger self, I would probably recommend the second path. There is more uncertainty there to be sure, but life is risk, and to live is to explore. Taking the change to move to a new environment optimizes for personal growth, and it\u0026rsquo;s probably better to be doing it when you are young and full of energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
