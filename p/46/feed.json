            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eBack in 2017 during a Steam Sale, I was trying to choose a \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania\"\u003eMetroidvania\u003c/a\u003e to play. My choices came down to either Ori and the Blind Forest or Hollow Knight. My impression that was that Ori had the more challenging platforming, while Hollow Knight had the more challenging combat. I chose Ori at that time, and I enjoyed that game. Last October, Hollow Knight was in a Humble Monthly, and I decided to go for it. I played it for just about a month since January, and my impressions remain the same, but I now think that while Ori had a better visual presentation, Hollow Knight is the superior game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s not taking anything away from Hollow Knight\u0026rsquo;s aesthetic mind you, it\u0026rsquo;s a perfectly gorgeous game.

Movement in Hollow Knight also felt a lot more fun and fluid - it was great dashing and double jumping and wall jumping across the screens once I had full mobility. Hollow Knight has a stronger combat focus, and some of the fights can get very challenging indeed (as of this writing I have yet to complete the Trial of the Fool).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe progression in Hollow Knight is also less linear than Ori - which can be a bit of a double-edged sword. While the freedom to roam is nice, it can also lead to some frustrating moments when you find a path that looks like you \u003cem\u003emight\u003c/em\u003e be able to do it with a bit tighter platforming, but it turns out you should just wait for some other ability to unlock before going for it. I feel like there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more stuff to hunt down for completionists too. I finished the game at 105% completion. Post-launch DLC pushed the maximum up to 112%, but I doubt I\u0026rsquo;ll be bothering to do most of the other stuff, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty satisfied with the game as-is. I did manage to hit all three main endings somehow!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#ee97af99d43d89918d192d8596599111-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2019/02/game-review-hollow-knight/hollowknight-completion_huc7fa2882b90ca055653b4781c4bacd3e_443146_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"ee97af99d43d89918d192d8596599111-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2019/02/game-review-hollow-knight/hollowknight-completion.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"16 Feb 2019 5:56am\"\u003e16 Feb 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Ori, not gonna go for achievement completion on this one. Some of the challenges are a bit too much for me. It\u0026rsquo;s actually surprising to me how I can still play and enjoy action games like this, given how terrible my reflexes are nowadays, but Metroidvanias have a special place in my gaming heart for some reason and somehow I am able to muddle through. With deaths. Many, many deaths. I finished Ori with 900+ deaths. Hollow Knight doesn\u0026rsquo;t track this statistic (thankfully?), but I probably got close to that number in Hollow Knight too. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably wait a while before picking another one up again though, maybe let my slow reflexes relax for a while with some turn-based games instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: Coincidentally, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFAknD_9U7c\"\u003esequel for Hollow Knight\u003c/a\u003e was just announced! IDK if I\u0026rsquo;d play it - I haven\u0026rsquo;t played yet the sequels to the last two Metroidvanias I played (Guacamelee and Ori and the Blind Forest), somehow a completely new experience seems better for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAccording to Wikipedia, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaking_truth_to_power\"\u003eSpeaking truth to power\u003c/a\u003e is a non-violent political tactic, employed by dissidents against the received wisdom or propaganda of governments they regard as oppressive, authoritarian or an ideocracy. I always had the general sense of it before, but not that it was specifically for use against oppressive or authoritarian governments. It is believed the phrase has origins in a Quaker pamphlet published in 1955.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was reminded of this phrase today and looked it up because it seems relevant again recently, at least in the Philippines. Recently Maria Ressa, the head of the online news site Rappler, was arrested at dusk (so no bail could be set), on charges of cyberlibel, for an online article published before cyberlibel became a crime. Ostensibly, the state\u0026rsquo;s rationale is that there was a minor edit to the article after the cyberlibel law was passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m struggling to think of any instance where a state authority arrested journalists without the intent to silence criticism. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying there aren\u0026rsquo;t any - there probably are - but probably such instances don\u0026rsquo;t get much publicity precisely because they are normal functions of the state. For this instance, it feels very much as just the next step in targetted harassment against those who, as they say, speak truth to power. I remember one of the pork barrel senators saying during the launch of his senatorial campaign that he was the victim of \u0026ldquo;selective justice\u0026rdquo; (which is weird because it still implies he was guilty, just that other people were guilty too). I\u0026rsquo;m hoping in some interview someone has the balls to ask the senatorial candidates whether they think Trillianes or Ressa have been victims of \u0026ldquo;selective justice\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePro-admin partisans of course will just say \u0026ldquo;rule of law\u0026rdquo; etc, which they like to do when someone they dislike is being targetted, but not when say, suspected criminals are killed by vigilantes or under suspicious circumstances by the police. Most probably in their heart of hearts they know exactly what is going on here, and they either approve of it wholeheartedly or view it as a necessary compromise in their pursuit of what they believe to be good for the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve tried to avoid being too political in this blog, maybe sticking with the occasional rant or election-related personal leanings post. But with the climate these days, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure that\u0026rsquo;s resposible. Those of us who are able to speak out on our platforms, no matter how small, don\u0026rsquo;t we have a responsibility to speak truth to power?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Microsoft held a [counterpart celebration] where they only require you to submit 1 pull request to any Microsoft repository.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to start participating in Open Source, but it\u0026rsquo;s a bit difficult to find a good place to contribute (other than logging issues of course). So when I heard about this activity, I thought \u0026ldquo;Why not?\u0026rdquo; Anyway, I\u0026rsquo;m not ashamed to admit 4 out of my 5 PRs were to small/minor projects, some of them seemingly created specifically to help farm Hacktoberfest PRs lol. I did manage to get \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/61206\"\u003eone pull request accepted\u003c/a\u003e for \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/my-history-in-text-editors/\"\u003emy current favorite editor\u003c/a\u003e, VSCode! So that\u0026rsquo;s something! It was just a super minor bug fix, but it feels good to know that some future build of VS Code may have some code I wrote in it. This also qualified me to get swag from Microsoft! I haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten any open source-related swag since the dearly-departed \u003ca href=\"/2008/11/free-flex-shirt-from-adobe/\"\u003eAdobe Flex shirt from 2008\u003c/a\u003e (RIP Adobe Flex).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m only posting about this now, four months after the fact, because my Hacktoberfest swag only came in last week and I had to swing by the post office to pick them up.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIn late 2017, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-USA-cyber-kaspersky/trump-signs-into-law-u-s-government-ban-on-kaspersky-lab-software-idUSKBN1E62V4\"\u003eUS moved to ban Kaspersky antivirus from use by federal agencies\u003c/a\u003e, because of suspected influence from the Russian government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn late 2018, \u003ca href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/countries-banning-huawei-181206130850129.html\"\u003ethe US and other countries have either banned or are considering banning the Chinese tech giant Huawei and its telecoms products\u003c/a\u003e, for security reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth companies are under scrutiny for their perceived ties to their governments, both of which happen to have authoritarian leanings. From a certain POV, the bannings may be unfair, as they are \u0026ldquo;preventive\u0026rdquo; in nature, i.e. punishment is given preemptively before any offence is discovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s interesting to me because it shows that being under the sway of an authoritarian leadership can be considered a competitive disadvantage in the international marketplace. Trust in the Russian and Chinese governments is low (internationally), which affects the corporations working out of those states. While they may not be doing anything nefarious now, the fact that these states \u003cem\u003ecan possibly\u003c/em\u003e influence these companies is already a considerable risk, especially for government\u0026rsquo;s mission-critical systems given the geopolitical history and past behavior of those states.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven here in the Philippines, there is some level of mistrust against the entry of the supposed third telco, which is a consortium of which China Telecom is a part, mainly for security concerns as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn theory, this distrust should not be limited to Russia and China. For example, the US also has a history of requesting information from tech companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter, and so on. So in theory these US-based companies should not be trusted with communication platforms, etc. The difference is that the US-based companies have a stronger history of independence from the US government. They also regularly release \u003ca href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/18/facebooks-government-data-requests-continue-to-rise/\"\u003ereports\u003c/a\u003e about how the \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/google-reports-all-time-high-of-government-data-requests/\"\u003eUS and other governments request data\u003c/a\u003e from them. These are exercises to build trust from the consumer base, to emphasize their independence from any one state authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kaspersky ban was a relatively small deal, I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure if it affected Kaspersky at all. But the Huawei (and potentially ZTE as well) ban would be more important as Huawei is a very large telecoms company currently. It will be interesting to see how they move forward - will they take actions to assert their independence from the Chinese state and improve international trust? Or will they double down and have China resort to diplomatic pressure?\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "In late 2017, the US moved to ban Kaspersky antivirus from use by federal agencies, because of suspected influence from the Russian government.\nIn late 2018, the US and other countries have either banned or are considering banning the Chinese tech giant Huawei and its telecoms products, for security reasons.\nBoth companies are under scrutiny for their perceived ties to their governments, both of which happen to have authoritarian leanings. From a certain POV, the bannings may be unfair, as they are \u0026ldquo;preventive\u0026rdquo; in nature, i.",

The subtitles act like a kind of fallback to the verbal/audio cues, helping me when I get distracted (quite easily) and when I\u0026rsquo;m multitasking. They also help with accents and murmured words and things like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are people who don\u0026rsquo;t like subtitles when they aren\u0026rsquo;t necessary, complaining that having to read distracts them from the film.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI love sleeping. And taking naps. But I\u0026rsquo;m not very good at doing it at night. Insomnia is a common problem for me. I often find it difficult to go to sleep at night, taking upwards of 1-2 hours in bed before I can manage to fall asleep. Of course all that time lying there feels unproductive, so I\u0026rsquo;ll often be tempted to to grab a nearby screen and read something online or such, which makes it even harder to get to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t blame the electronics devices completely, though. I remember even when I was a kid I would sometimes have trouble sleeping at night due to a hyperactive brain having too many trains of thoughts to resolve. Something I still carry to this day, though I like to imagine my ability to compartmentalize thoughts has improved since then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember when Warcraft III came out, one of the hero characters had an ability to send other units to sleep and I always chose that ability because I wanted to have it IRL. Not to use on other people, but on myself so I could sleep on demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting a continuous block of eight hours of sleep (or even six or seven hours) is pretty rare for me as well. Usually I\u0026rsquo;ll wake up after 1-2 hours, then if I\u0026rsquo;m lucky I manage to go to sleep again. If not, sometimes I\u0026rsquo;ll give up and work on stuff until it\u0026rsquo;s breakfast time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes I try to force-reset my sleep cycle by going like 36 hours without sleep so I can\u0026rsquo;t help but be real tired and sleep continuously for a while. But it usually doesn\u0026rsquo;t last. And I\u0026rsquo;m at that age where going 36 hours without sleep isn\u0026rsquo;t really that easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that since I quit working full-time I usually have a highly irregular daily schedule. Combined with a tendency to take naps during the day, it leads to the irregular sleep cycle. I also like having breakfast early so I often wake up at like 5 to 6 in the AM, no matter how late I went to sleep, then just recover sleep with naps during the day, making it harder to go to sleep early in the night, and so on. A bit of a vicious cycle. Also, it makes me a weird kind of cross between a morning person and a night owl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the problems with sleep is that even though it feels great, when you sleep so much it feels unproductive, like you could\u0026rsquo;ve put that time to better use. I remember maybe a decade or so ago, I was reading about the idea of polyphasic sleep. I liked the idea because it meant fewer sleep hours overall during the day, which meant more time for doing stuff. Sadly, I never got it to work. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit challenging to do it with a nine-to-five job, but even without that, I don\u0026rsquo;t really have the discipline to keep it up. And also, I like sleeping a lot sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ll end this post with this tweet:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eGOD: You have probably 70-80 years at most before you die, ideally.\u003cbr\u003eMAN: oh. well, i\u0026#39;ll make the most of-\u003cbr\u003eGOD: You\u0026#39;ll be unconscious for 1/3 of the time. \u003cbr\u003eMAN: ..uh\u003cbr\u003eGOD: *leans in* That\u0026#39;ll be your favorite part.\u003c/p\u003e\u0026mdash; Ray 🦔 (@SirEviscerate) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SirEviscerate/status/943137889977819138?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eDecember 19, 2017\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e \u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026hellip;then I\u0026rsquo;ll go take a nap.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

My examples for this post are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003egame streaming\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epublic speaking\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003estandup comedy\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePublic speaking and standup comedy are basically the same, and might be interesting to do (standup seems more fun). Like many people, I used to have a mild fear of speaking in front of a bunch of people/strangers, but as I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten older and cared less about what other people think, this kind of faded away. But the main issue with these two items is that they require a lot of prep, and that\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;m generally bad at (chalk it up to lack of discipline etc). I generally tend to prefer to \u0026ldquo;wing it\u0026rdquo;, even back in the college days, not that I\u0026rsquo;m particularly good at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame streaming seems like it could be good. Not much prep needed aside from some general familiarity with the game I\u0026rsquo;m playing. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;ve already set up \u003ca href=\"https://twitch.tv/twitchyroy\"\u003ea twitch channel\u003c/a\u003e before and did a few test broadcasts. My main problem with game streaming is that there\u0026rsquo;s a need to be talking all the time - avoiding dead air. And it can feel weird doing that with nobody around. I guess it\u0026rsquo;s more of a beginning streamer problem? If there were people in the twitch chat it would probably be easier. Or if there was someone else in the room with me while I\u0026rsquo;m streaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA friend also sometimes suggests I make a webcomic, that also seems like a viable option. My problem with that one is the prep again. You need to be able to come up with material on a regular basis, and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I can do that. As I say to my friend, I\u0026rsquo;m a generally witty guy, but my wit is more of \u0026ldquo;in the moment\u0026rdquo; insted of something I can summon on command. But then again, maybe the fact that I\u0026rsquo;m now able to make daily blog posts means a regular (weekly?) webcomic would now be viable?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn issue I have with trying to pick up new hobbies is the climb you have as a beginner, where everything you try sucks at first. I really dislike that initial learning period. But as Jake the Dog says \u0026ldquo;Dude, sucking at something is the first step towards being sort of good at something.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n",
