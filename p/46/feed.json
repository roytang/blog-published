I have a good grasp of communication skills and think I have a decent chance of writing good copy. My main issue is that I\u0026rsquo;ve been exposed many times to sales/marketing practices that just seem dishonest downright or scummy. This happens both with me as a customer and with me on the side of the company trying to do the sales/marketing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn example in the software engineering sphere would be a developer writing project proposals in response to tenders, and he is asked to write a technical response confirming that their product supports a particular tender requirement. Except he knows for a fact that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t, and when he raises this concern, he\u0026rsquo;s told not to worry about and that they\u0026rsquo;ll just implement the feature if/when they win the contract. And apparently that\u0026rsquo;s a regular practice in some companies. Disclaimer: I\u0026rsquo;m not saying I have been personally involved in such a situation, but I do know such situations exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand the motivation from the sales side, but not only is that intellectually dishonest (to say the least), it also puts your engineering teams in a bind should the project push through - you now committed them to do an extra feature without proper estimation or scheduling and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me it\u0026rsquo;s okay to sell something by promoting its strengths and advantages, but not by being dishonest about its capabilities or weaknesses. I suspect that this cripples me a bit in the real world where people with less scruples are more willing to bend the truth to make money. But for me personally, honesty and integrity are more important than making more sales.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Given that, why would it be necessary for a large number of areas (I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if there are even unaffected MW service areas) to have service interruptions for majority of the hours of the day? (Over here, I think we get like very weak water pressure a couple of hours a day and that\u0026rsquo;s it). Obviously they can\u0026rsquo;t just cut 9.375% of the hours, they need to add some buffer, that\u0026rsquo;s fine. And households would of course compensate for reduced hours by consuming more during the time they do have water. But why so extreme, so immediately? At worst I would have expected that they cut service hours by at most 50% (so households have water during half the day), then if that\u0026rsquo;s not enough come out with an advisory saying \u0026ldquo;okay, we\u0026rsquo;re still consuming too much water, we need to cut more hours\u0026rdquo;. As it is, their announced service interruption hours are highly inaccurate, so it seems they can\u0026rsquo;t even predict what\u0026rsquo;s going to happen with their service. Conspiracy theories aside, I prefer to attribute all of the issues to sheer incompetence first, but is there something I\u0026rsquo;m missing here, some kind of engineering reason or what, for the service interruptions to be so widespread and unpredictable?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIf I could give some advice to someone starting out in their software development career, it would be this: Don\u0026rsquo;t stay in the same place too long. The first company I worked at, I stayed with them for thirteen years, which I now feel was way too long. I have to admit, the work was hard and challenging, but I was young and had a lot of energy and was willing to work the long hours. I was good at the work and the enjoyed the company of the people I worked with so in a certain sense I got comfortable with the status quo and stayed a bit too long. But given a do-over, I would probably prefer to have left after maybe 4-5 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopping jobs too quickly can be fantastic for your salary growth, but it has some disadvantages - you don\u0026rsquo;t build close enough relationships, and too many hops doesn\u0026rsquo;t look good on your resume. Four to five years seems like a good period to stay, long enough to learn as much as you can and build your network before moving on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main advantage of not staying too long comes in the form of personal growth. When you stay at a place too long you tend to stagnate. Sure, it\u0026rsquo;s software development so somehow you\u0026rsquo;re always improving, but not improving as quickly as you would be if you were to be thrust into a new environment every few years. Your personal network of like-minded professionals will grow quicker as well when you switch companies. I was thinking about this because I was recently asked if I could refer any senior developers and I realized my personal network of high-level senior technical guys wasn\u0026rsquo;t that deep because of me staying in the same place for so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t consider this a \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/choose-without-regret-and-the-fear-of-missing-out/\"\u003eregret\u003c/a\u003e, I\u0026rsquo;m still pretty happy and satisfied with where I am in life. Thinking about this is more of an alternate universe \u0026ldquo;what if\u0026rdquo; scenario. I have to admit that staying that long did have some advantages - I got to work with and meet some good people, younger ones even, who became good friends. But this is not an argument in favor of staying that long, as you would still have the chance to build relationships even if you move on. It\u0026rsquo;s possible in that alternate universe I may have made even better friends or may have even been friends with the same ones I have now somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, given a chance to give advice to my younger self, I would probably recommend the second path. There is more uncertainty there to be sure, but life is risk, and to live is to explore. Taking the change to move to a new environment optimizes for personal growth, and it\u0026rsquo;s probably better to be doing it when you are young and full of energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA few months back, my current web host \u003ca href=\"https://www.webfaction.com/\"\u003eWebFaction\u003c/a\u003e announced they had been purchased by \u003ca href=\"https://godaddy.com\"\u003eGoDaddy\u003c/a\u003e, which was worrying. Back then they hadn\u0026rsquo;t announced any details other than there would be some account migrations and single sign on, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a big deal yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI initially joined WebFaction \u003ca href=\"/roytang-net-site-update/\"\u003eback in 2008\u003c/a\u003e because they were a Python-friendly and developer-friendly host that had some reasonable budget options, allowing me some space to host this blog and any side projects I wanted to deploy. At that time I was learning Django, so I needed the Python support that normal hosts don\u0026rsquo;t provide. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know much about cloud servers back then and the WebFaction account let me try out so much stuff despite it being shared hosting. The news above is worrying because GoDaddy does not have a good reputation and is not especially known for being developer-friendly. They are a mass-market, \u0026ldquo;lowest common denominator\u0026rdquo; kind of host, so I would prefer not to have them as my web host.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis week, they said in an announcement that they were moving forward with a technical evaluation of migrating everyone to GoDaddy, which kind of spells doom for the WebFaction services I\u0026rsquo;m using. Even though their email promised that \u0026ldquo;you won\u0026rsquo;t lose any of your current features or services\u0026rdquo;, but according to a \u003ca href=\"https://community.webfaction.com/questions/22148/webfaction-migration-6-months-later-and-still-no-answers\"\u003erecent thread\u003c/a\u003e on their support forums:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eOne again, zero information about exactly when WebFaction services will be completely shut down.\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe exact date hasn\u0026rsquo;t been defined yet but it is estimated to be on August 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eDoes this mean that WebFaction's current features and services will remain the same AFTER the migration?\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, WebFaction\u0026rsquo;s control panel, servers and other features and services will shut down after the migration is done. The plan is to stay up and running until then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile they say the technical evaluation is still ongoing, in all likelihood that\u0026rsquo;s it for WebFaction. For me, at least. And I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in migrating to GoDaddy. I still have a few months before I need to transition, but I guess I need to start prepping by:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003elooking for a new host. Any recommendations? I have a bit more experience this time with managing servers, so I\u0026rsquo;m open to a VPS instead of shared hosting, might be fun to try out for a while. Currently looking at just getting a cheap ($5/mo) droplet over at Digital Ocean. Alternatively, I could just move this blog over to netlify and any other apps I have (like \u003ca href=\"https://triviastorm.net/\"\u003eTriviaStorm\u003c/a\u003e) over to something like Heroku, but that seems like it would cost me more money.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esee if I can refund my current balance with them, since I prepaid a bit last year. I already asked on the forums and they say we\u0026rsquo;ll have more info on refund options later after their technical evaluation, maybe around Mayish.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, I had a good run with WebFaction, a bit over 10 years now. But time moves on and things change and small businesses get eaten up by large businesses, such is the way of capitalism. They were very developer-friendly and had pretty good customer support in my opinion, so they will be missed. Hopefully I\u0026rsquo;m able to find a good alternative.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Take one or two and write them out in detail. Next time you’re in front of a warm crowd, work on telling the story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea being of course, that such an exercise trains you to be more vulnerable in front on an audience. I thought about this advice for a bit and found it difficult to remember any particular moments in my life that I feel particularly embarassed or ashamed about. All people have such moments of course, so there are two possibilities: (a) my embarassing moments are so terrible brain has blocked out such memories for my own sanity; or (b) I don\u0026rsquo;t remember them because I don\u0026rsquo;t care too much and I move on quickly from them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do remember being an insecure and self-conscious teenager growing up, so maybe I should have more embarassing memories from that era? But looking back now on any moments back then that I might have considered embarassing, they don\u0026rsquo;t seem so bad, at least not compared to other people\u0026rsquo;s embarassing stories. For all such moments that I can recall, I generally don\u0026rsquo;t feel a tinge of regret - I think they were things that contributed to my growth as a person and that I should have done anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an example, the first possibly \u0026ldquo;embarassing\u0026rdquo; moment I could think was the first office Christmas party I went to as a working person. Now, if you\u0026rsquo;re from the Philippines, you know they have this thing where they expect new hires to give a \u0026ldquo;performance\u0026rdquo; during the office Christmas party, as portrayed in this comic:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#667dc6f6dc4c2f5315f780faa29ba199-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2019/03/embarassment-office-christmas-parties-and-singing-off-key/opismeyts_huc2e037c38fd8c0199ca1b958e53d8853_222769_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"667dc6f6dc4c2f5315f780faa29ba199-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2019/03/embarassment-office-christmas-parties-and-singing-off-key/opismeyts.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"14 Mar 2019 5:56am\"\u003e14 Mar 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImage credit: \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/opismeyts\"\u003eOpismeyts\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow back then I was fresh out of college and not a very social animal. And they wanted us to do this ridiculous looking dance that was popularized by local noontime shows of the era. Performing in public was not something I wanted to do, and I had a lot of anxiety leading up to it, as I recall I even considered skipping the event completely. But of course I went through it anyway, and though I cringed at myself the whole time, I think I did learn to laugh at myself a little bit. I credit this event for helping me \u0026ldquo;lighten up\u0026rdquo; as it were, be more willing to plow straight through my anxieties, and be more open to doing ridiculous things in public. (I would still be averse to say, volunteering for such a thing, but there should now be a decent possibility of convincing me\u0026hellip;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days, it\u0026rsquo;s rare that I feel embarassed about anything. Sometimes there\u0026rsquo;ll be awkwardness somewhere when I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do, but I think that wit can push me through it. I also used to be pretty self-conscious about something like singing in public, like at a videoke session or whatever. This might be understandable given that I\u0026rsquo;m just terrible at singing - the odds that I can carry a given tune are a bit low. I used to always refuse when offered the videoke mic. But these days I\u0026rsquo;m more willing - there was a realization at some point that if I sang in public, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t the one to suffer, it would be the people listening LOL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is popular advice that goes \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t sweat the small stuff\u0026rdquo;, and in the grand scheme of things those small embarassing moments you have are pretty much always small stuff, even though in the moment they may feel like almost everything is falling apart. Be willing to laugh at your own embarassments, and move on. Life is too short to be embarassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

But it\u0026rsquo;s probably better if my naps were predictable, like say, a quick nap after lunch (when I\u0026rsquo;m likely to be sleepy anyway), instead of the irregular schedule I have now which messes up my sleep cycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe common advice for fixing a sleep cycle is to have a regular time of the day when you go to bed and sleep, so that your body gets used to sleeping at this time. This has proven\u0026hellip; difficult for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I really need to find the discipline to establish a regular routine, with scheduled naps throughout the day if needed.

I noticed this with my \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/duolingo/\"\u003eDuolingo lessons\u003c/a\u003e, the past few weeks I\u0026rsquo;ve always been doing them right after breakfast, still sitting at the table. I bring my iPad with me during breakfast for reading the news, so it\u0026rsquo;s easy to transition into the Duolingo app. Doing it a regular time and so early day makes it a lot less likely that I \u003ca href=\"/2019/01/broken-streaks/\"\u003ebreak the streak\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eit reduces the amount of decisions you need to make during the day, and can also reduce procrastination. For example, if I allocated certain hours of the day to be \u0026ldquo;productive hours\u0026rdquo; and some hours to be \u0026ldquo;gaming hours\u0026rdquo; and so on, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to make that decision during the day. And I can\u0026rsquo;t procrastinate on being productive, since I know the rest of my time is already allocated\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehaving a regular rhythm makes it easier to get through difficult days\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main downside of a routine like this is\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s boring! I dislike heavily regimented schedules that are predictably always the same. I mean, that may even be one of the reasons why I\u0026rsquo;m not working full-time anymore. I\u0026rsquo;ll need to think about this some more. A kind of hybrid approach where some time blocks are more flexible might be more feasible for me, or maybe a varying schedule depending on the day. We\u0026rsquo;ll see. But for sure I have to do something!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI stepped out of the house a bit past five in the morning today. I haven\u0026rsquo;t done this in a while, taking my \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/daily-walks/\"\u003edaily walk\u003c/a\u003e in the early morning. I used to do it pretty regularly, except back then I confined myself to the inner roads of our subdivision, or doing loops around the covered court in the nearby seminary. Walking the same routes every morning and doing repetitive routes got boring after a while, and combined with my erratic sleep schedule the habit soon fell off the wayside. I resumed my walking habit when I took a break from work in 2016, but this time mostly doing it late in the afternoons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfternoons have been getting more difficult lately, with some busyness in the schedule and the sudden yet inevitable onset of the summer heat, so I decided to try shifting back to mornings again. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how long it lasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking during the early mornings, before the sun has even broken, has a completely different atmosphere than the afternoons or even the evenings. The streets glow a pale blue and are nearly empty, though traffic is already starting to build up at some of the busier intersections. There are few other people out on their feet (as opposed to in cars) this early, enough that I would involuntarily nod when I passed some other early morning walker. I\u0026rsquo;m surprised to find that a nearby Jollibee operated 24 hours, and that the nearby Starbucks didn\u0026rsquo;t. I assumed it was the other way around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pass by a student on her way to school, with a companion accompanying her as she flags down a jeep. I commiserate with how early students need to get up to go to school in this country. I remember my own childhood when my mom would pick me up and drag me over to the sink to splash my face with water to get me going at five in the morning. Class usually started at seven, but the school bus would pick us up around six or even earlier. Somehow, we may be teaching kids to hate mornings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not one of those \u0026ldquo;not a morning person\u0026rdquo; people. I don\u0026rsquo;t need coffee to get started in the mornings either. I enjoy sleeping in when I can, but I\u0026rsquo;m always willing and able to get up early if I needed to. Combined with my tendency to sleep late into the night, this has led to my terribly erratic sleep schedule. Even as I\u0026rsquo;m walking out on the streets before the break of dawn, I expect myself to be taking a second sleep after getting home and having breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun starts to break through the night as I near the end of my route, a couple of corners away from home. My walk this morning is a bit shorter than my usual target of steps. There are some areas I prefer not to traverse before the light of day, so my options are a bit limited. As I get used to walking in the early mornings again I\u0026rsquo;ll try a few different routes to see if I can increase my steps. In the meantime, I turn the corner and head back home, looking forward to the morning\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003epan de sal\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
