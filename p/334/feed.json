If you\u0026rsquo;ve never seen samples of wacky Japanese TV before, \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshi%27s_Castle\"\u003eTakeshi\u0026rsquo;s Castle\u003c/a\u003e is a good start. This wacky Japanese show throws a bunch of a hundred or so contestants into a series of ridiculous games, each one hoping to make it to the end to defeat Count Takeshi and win one million yen!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTakeshi\u0026rsquo;s Castle had a Philippine run, hosted by local actors Anjo Yllana and Smokey Manaloto. Although shown on a less popular channel, the show\u0026rsquo;s hilarious antics and ridiculous games earned it a cult following. The games themselves are sheer madness, requiring mostly luck, agility and a whole lot of guts in order to win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost games usually pit you against Count Takeshi\u0026rsquo;s henchmen. The guards hunt you down in the Honeycomb Maze, shoot cannon balls at you in Bridge Ball and roll giant rocks at you in Avalanche. Several games feature the contestants being stuffed into ridiculously large suits that impair movement. The best games are those that run on pure guts, such as the ever-favorite Skipping Stones, where you must quickly jump across rocks to cross a river — but some of the rocks are fake! If you have nerves of steel, just blaze ahead, jumping from rock to rock, don\u0026rsquo;t care if the one you\u0026rsquo;re stepping on starts to sink!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy single most favorite game is \u0026ldquo;Knock Knock\u0026rdquo;, where a contestant is faced with four walls, each with four doors. Three of the doors on each wall are paper\u0026hellip; but one is boarded up with wood from behind. The contestant doesn\u0026rsquo;t know which is which, but he must choose a door at each wall and charge through in whatever way he can, usually throwing all of his weight into the attempt \u0026ndash; with horrible results if you choose the wrong door. It\u0026rsquo;s cruel and it\u0026rsquo;s mindless, but you find yourself laughing out loud whenever a particularly enthusiastic contestant slams helmet first into the door. It\u0026rsquo;s all about guts baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swear, I wish there were some Japanese channel on cable with these types of shows. It\u0026rsquo;s the kind of mindless, addictive stuff that makes TV so dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I never noticed before because I use Firefox all the time, but GMail in IE doesn\u0026rsquo;t even show the freakin\u0026rsquo; file input control! It\u0026rsquo;s just an \u0026ldquo;Attach a File\u0026rdquo; link that opens the \u0026ldquo;Open File\u0026rdquo; dialog on click!

But from experience, I know that trying to figure out gmail\u0026rsquo;s obfuscated javascript code would take me days. So I decided to take an alternative approach: I would let gmail execute it\u0026rsquo;s weird javascript magic, then use javascript myself to extract the relevant HTML and Javascript code from the gmail window at the correct state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first attempt: I tried to load gmail in an iframe so I could read the document contents from window.top.

True Rune attaching itself to your hero? Check. Only thing we need now is a permanent HQ. I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine living on a boat would be very enticing for me in real life. On a side note, this is the first Suikoden where I\u0026rsquo;m actively using an FAQ to avoid missing Stars of Destiny. It was ok not to use an FAQ before, as I always had time to make a second pass to complete the 108 stars after the first play-through. But again, I\u0026rsquo;m a busy man. (On a side note to this side note, the closest I came to completing the 108 stars without using an FAQ was Suiko4 \u0026ndash; I got 107!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBG2:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePros: Wide, open-ended gameplay options.

Gee, won\u0026rsquo;t Imoen be worried that I\u0026rsquo;ve left her in captivity for more than a month now? As mentioned, beholders and mind flayers are a pain, but Yoshino\u0026rsquo;s traps and summoned skellies help a lot. On a side note, I always play a female pally in D\u0026amp;D; games. This one is no different, except that I made the mistake of choosing the Cavalier kit which prevents me from using ranged weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs always, the strength of console RPGs lies in their story focus.

This was a good idea during those days that I had a lot of free time and could finish the average RPG in a week. I haven\u0026rsquo;t been in that state for four years.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brother warned me that according to reviews, the first eight hours or so of Suikoden V were quite draggy. When I thought about it, that should be expected. I\u0026rsquo;ve played Suikoden 1-4 of course, and in all those games, a largish part of the beginning involved the setup where your young hero (or heroes as in Suikoden 3) would be thrust in the middle of a conflict that would eventually result in a quest to gather 108 Stars of Destiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m about 5 hours into Suikoden V, and I have to say: It\u0026rsquo;s draggier than usual. I think it\u0026rsquo;s because most of the first five hours are heavily scripted, mostly scenes with minor interactions designed to lay out all the backstory and history and political intrigue and whatnot. It\u0026rsquo;s been five hours, and I still have no idea what the main conflict is gonna be\u0026hellip; granted it looks like there\u0026rsquo;s gonna be some civil unrest at some point, but we have no idea yet who\u0026rsquo;s going to be on which side, etc. In Suikoden I, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure you were appointed the head of the Liberation Army long before the five-hour point! In Suikoden II, you were kicked out of your homes within two hours. In Suikoden V, it feels like five hours and four weeks of game time later, you\u0026rsquo;re still running errands to ensure your sister\u0026rsquo;s engagement to a scheming noble goes through. Hopefully it starts to pick up soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the things I noticed this time around: I don\u0026rsquo;t like that thing in console RPGs where you have to wander around town until you run into the exact area where a scene will move the story forward. It was fine in Dragon Quest VIII (the last console RPG I played), but here it\u0026rsquo;s ridiculous\u0026hellip; mostly because the cities here seem huge! Granted, I\u0026rsquo;ve only seen Sol-Falena and Stormfist, but both of those cities were large, multi-area maps. There were some sequences where you literally had to systematically traverse the whole town to find the next scene that triggers the story. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m just spoiled because I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing Baldur\u0026rsquo;s Gate 2 lately. That game has a huge city too, but you couldn\u0026rsquo;t walk half a screen through the city without some quest or event thrown at you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, yeah. They need to get to the \u0026ldquo;Okay, I got an HQ and I\u0026rsquo;m gonna collect 108 stars\u0026rdquo; point faster, that\u0026rsquo;s where all the gameplay is anyway. I think the start of the game suffers from the fact there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of back story to cover: the discord between factions in the Senate, the struggle for the throne two generations prior, the invasion from Armes eight years ago, the wrath of Arshtat two years ago, how a barbarian managed to win the Sacred Games and thus marry into the royal family, etc. I suppose that all this back story is needed *before* the meat of the game gets underway, otherwise they could have just sprinkled it in liberally through the game\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Why do people keep paying you for something they could get free?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBallmer: One, people value their time. Our stuff does more, and they like that. Two, people value their time, and those [free] things tend to be clunky. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you think you can save $50. And then you go and waste three hours. You tell me how quick that payback is. Y\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAwesome example, especially from a third-world POV. Let\u0026rsquo;s try a practical example: Microsoft Office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, after being tossed around in a haphazard manner by the Microsoft Office website, I\u0026rsquo;ve determined that the box price of Microsoft Office 2003 Standard Edition is around $400.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s say we have a guy in the US who wants to buy an Office suite. A typical middle-class white-collar guy, who needs it to write stalker-type fan-mail, balance his budget, whatever. This typical middle-class guy (let\u0026rsquo;s call him Joe) makes about $200 a day. (Okay, that might be on the low-end for US salaries, I don\u0026rsquo;t really know; but bear with me here, I don\u0026rsquo;t want have to do any more actual research\u0026hellip; ). So he compares the cost of MS Office 2003 Standard Edition, which he uses at work (yes, this unscientific thought experiment considers MS lock-in!), with that of this alternative thingy he heard of, OpenOffice. Why, the difference is a whopping $400! That\u0026rsquo;s four days work!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, Joe reasons: If I go for OpenOffice, I save two days\u0026rsquo; salary\u0026rsquo;s worth in buying price\u0026hellip; but I have to download it, familiarize myself with it, convert all my old documents\u0026hellip; and I don\u0026rsquo;t even know if it will do everything I want! MS Office is convenient, and for Joe, it\u0026rsquo;s just two days\u0026rsquo; salary anyway. It might very well be worth it for Joe to just buy MS Office and not have to bother with all this open source business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, say we have another user, this time from the Philippines: Juan is a typical Filipino office worker. He\u0026rsquo;s earning around P500 a day. (Okay, I\u0026rsquo;m sure this here is a fairly good number) He looks at the price of MS Office and\u0026hellip; why, the price is a whopping $400! That\u0026rsquo;s P20,000! That translates to about a 1.33 month\u0026rsquo;s worth of Juan\u0026rsquo;s salary! Juan finds out there\u0026rsquo;s a free alternative: OpenOffice. He\u0026rsquo;s not familiar with it, but Juan is a pretty smart guy, and he figures in a month or so, he can be just as good with OpenOffice as with MS Office. After all, it didn\u0026rsquo;t take him one month to figure out MS Office right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis points us to the awesome conclusion: Open source becomes more attractive as people earn less. What an interesting (non-scientific) thought experiment! Even more interesting, if we remove the MS lock-in factor, Joe has even less incentive to buy MS Office\u0026hellip; since he has to familiarize himself with whatever software he gets anyway. So, what does this mean for Microsoft? It means, the best way for traditional software companies to conquer developing markets is to increase the per capita income in those countries! Microsoft should make us richer!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink about that: more than a month of Juan\u0026rsquo;s hard-earned salary is needed to buy this software! No wonder the software pirates are so rampant in developing countries!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Not that we mind, after all, local bets actually did kick ass and shrugged off the Japanese invasion.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are in fact a Filipino Magic player, then I hope you know what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about \u0026ndash; last weekend at the Robinson\u0026rsquo;s Galleria Trade Hall, almost four hundred local and foreign Magic: The Gathering players gathered for the third-ever Grand Prix event held in Manila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was there, of course, since for some reason I enjoy this expensive game. Sadly, the usual bunch of people who I\u0026rsquo;ve played Magic with since college were not available to ride with me into battle; my companions that day were some people from work instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was my first-ever GP, and it was an awesome experience, to say the least. Compared to the usual local events I\u0026rsquo;ve attended before, the atmosphere is much more formal; it really feels like you\u0026rsquo;re playing on a completely different level of Magic. I also played in a GPT the day before, which turned out to be a good idea as I suddenly got nervous playing against the Japanese guy who took me down in the second-round of the single-elimination trial. A good thing, because I was better prepared mentally the next day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blazed through the first five rounds with a 4-1 record, my sealed deck an all-attacking, no-thinking affair, battles mostly won on the back of a \u003ca\u003eSilhanna Ledgewalker \u003c/a\u003ebearing a \u003ca\u003eMoldervine Cloak \u003c/a\u003eor a \u003ca\u003eShadow Lance\u003c/a\u003e. My one loss was against an officemate who got me on bad draws\u0026hellip;  After he won our match 2-1, I proceeded to win every other practice game against him :(\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless, I was feeling pretty confident, even though my sealed deck had not been very exciting \u0026ndash; not many bombs \u0026ndash; it was doing fairly well, and I was winning matches fairly quickly, each best-of-three affair over in less than twenty minutes. I wanted that sort of deck, the type that wins fast, as I knew from history that long, drawn-out matches gave me a headache. I felt pretty good going into the 6th round, knowing that a win and a draw in the next two rounds meant I was sure to qualify for the second day. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t fought any foreign pros yet, but with my win record I was fairly sure I was heading into that territory\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I went to check the 6th round pairings, and sure enough my next opponent was 2005 Invitational Winner \u003ca href=\"http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/arcana/826\"\u003eTerry Soh\u003c/a\u003e. Whoo! I had been hoping I would get a chance to take on either Terry Soh or world champion Hori, both of whom were participating; what an upset it would have been for a local amateur with a sub-1600 rating to take down one of these guys!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, long story short, I didn\u0026rsquo;t win. :p He took the first game after some trading of blows; I gave him a beating in the second game via \u003ca\u003eSkeletal Vampire \u003c/a\u003eand won unopposed. Third game, we were trading blows again, but he had a \u003ca\u003eHammerfist Giant \u003c/a\u003ethat cleared the board, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any creatures to followup. He won shortly after. So much for that!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7th round. I needed to win this one to have a shot at the second day (not even a very good shot at that\u0026hellip; I think only 20% of 5-2\u0026rsquo;s would have advanced, but my tie-break points were pretty good since 3 of my 4 wins were 2-0\u0026hellip; ). I took game 1 fast, lost game 2 to a sudden surge of fatties, then lost game 3 with my opponent \u003cstrong\u003eat one life\u003c/strong\u003e! Sigh\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s just as well that I didn\u0026rsquo;t make it to the second day though\u0026hellip; I thought I was just getting a headache from playing Magic all day, but I found out later I was already coming down with a fever and some colds. Even if I did make it to day 2, I would have just rare-drafted. :p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that\u0026rsquo;s my small part of the GP Manila story. Eventually, local amateur JT Porter won the grand prize, netting almost four thousand US dollars. Sigh\u0026hellip; that coulda been me :p I hope the guys at Neutral Grounds can manage to arrange another big event like this in the Philippines soon\u0026hellip; while we aren\u0026rsquo;t the biggest Magic community in the world, we got a whole lotta heart. ^_^\u003c/p\u003e\n",

A bit old, but I know from Code Complete that Steve McConnell really hits in the mark with regard to software best practices. This book is aimed mainly at technical leads — coincidentally, that was my role at the time. I picked up a lot of good ideas, hopefully I can start to make some interesting changes in the place I work at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master\u003c/em\u003e by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas \u0026ndash; yeah, I\u0026rsquo;ve been in a sort of \u0026ldquo;improving my software development skills\u0026rdquo; mode lately, snapping up books like this and the previous one and going through them like life depended on it. Lots of sagely advice here, mostly stuff good developers know about inherently, and quite a few good ideas new to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAng Alamat ng Gubat\u003c/em\u003e by Bob Ong \u0026ndash; literally translated, it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Forest Legend\u0026rdquo;; the book is somewhat of a modern-day fable about how things are in the modern-day Philippines. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure each of the animals in the book represents some sector of society and its\u0026rsquo; faults, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m currently smart enough to identify them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eStainless Longganisa\u003c/em\u003e by Bob Ong \u0026ndash; I picked up this and the previous book on a whim at National Bookstore, because we were sorely in need of new bathroom reading material. (I\u0026rsquo;m not kidding, and bathroom reading material should be a treasured position among authors.) As usual, Bob Ong starts off with some hilarious real-life tales, before heading into some serious stuff about life in the Philippines. The main thrust of this book is to explain how and why he became a writer, giving the reader some insights into what aspiring writers in the Philippines can look forward to (or avoid.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEqual Rites\u003c/em\u003e by Terry Pratchett \u0026ndash; I think this is the third Discworld book, but it\u0026rsquo;s only the first one I finished. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure, it seems like the Discworld books make relatively quick and painless reading. It\u0026rsquo;s light fantasy of course, much the same way that Douglas Adams is light sci-fi; not the sort of thing you should seriously form a whole range of theories about, but fascinating nonetheless. I believe I will try to read more of these books.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
