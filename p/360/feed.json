I thought long and hard about the PS3 purchase because obviously it\u0026rsquo;s more expensive than the X-Box 360 and furthermore, and the games are expensive as well. But you gotta go with the best really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur PS3 package came with 2 games of our choice, and we found out just as we were buying that we had to be picky about the regions as most likely R2 games (Europe) would not work on our standard definition NTSC TV. Yup, I had decided not to purchase an HD TV because, well, they\u0026rsquo;re hella expensive! For our two free games, we went with Metal Gear Solid 4 (obviously) and Valkyria Chronicles, both are PS3 exclusives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMGS4 is a damn awesome-looking game, even on our SD TV so I can only imagine how much better it would be in HD. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t planning on playing it myself, but instead satisfied myself with watching the cutscenes as my brothers played through it. As is typical of MGS, the game was short and my youngest brother got to the ending cutscene within a mere four days after the PS3 was purchased! Luckily there\u0026rsquo;s still MGS Online and Hard/Extreme modes so there\u0026rsquo;s still some replay value there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValkyria Chronicles is the game I\u0026rsquo;m playing and I\u0026rsquo;m currently 8 chapters in. From reviews I expected it to be a tactical RPG like FF Tactics and the like, but after playing I find that it reminds me more of squad-based tactical games like X-Com: UFO Defense. The game is rendered in very detailed and beautiful cel shading and is a blast to play and also somewhat hard \u0026ndash; actual tactics are needed to win battles unlike in FFT-style games where typically it\u0026rsquo;s not too hard to power through the battles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother slight disappointment was that the US Playstation Store wouldn\u0026rsquo;t accept a local credit card for PSN purchases, so I was unable to purchases Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix as it is currently only available on the US PSN. Thanks to some kind folks at the PSPinoy message boards though for facilitating the purchase for me. I was able to successfully download SSF2THDR but was saddened by the lag I experienced while playing online. Hopefully I can tweak some of the network settings on the PS3 to solve the latency issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, the PS3 seems to have been a good solid choice. Now if only I had more time to play games!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Nothing surprising, I managed to make 3-1, good enough for fourth place and four packs with crap rares inside. My loss was to the mirror match, most probably due to my lower card quality, as I had only 1 planeswalker in my deck.",

I\u0026rsquo;m normally very careful in these situations but I was carrying more stuff than I usually do so I guess I really let my guard down here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve never actually been the victim of petty theft before, so I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what to do. I had someone try to call the phone, of course there was no response. We tried to lay a trap by sending a text message along the lines of \u0026ldquo;Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m the beautiful lady who wants to give you P20,000. How can I recognize you since we\u0026rsquo;ve never seen each other before?\u0026rdquo; but I doubt it would have worked. In the end, I\u0026rsquo;m told there\u0026rsquo;s really nothing I can do. At least I was running on prepaid so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to cancel the line or anything. And I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any sensitive info (passwords, etc.) on the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first reaction was actually annoyance at my own carelessness \u0026ndash; especially since I tend to be vigilant 99% of the time, but that 1% that I let my guard down I actually get bitten. Although looking at it another way, if I wasn\u0026rsquo;t vigilant 99% of the time I might not have lasted so long without having a cellphone stolen. A number of people were amazed that I was taking it mostly as a matter-of-fact, as I should be emo\u0026rsquo;ing over my lost phone. It\u0026rsquo;s just a phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ll just imagine that my cellphone went towards providing a nice Christmas dinner for a starving family. Then that happy occasion brings their family back together and convinces the thief to turn away from his life of crime and walk the straight and narrow, and he gets a job and his children get to go to school and become productive members of society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, farewell N73, I hardly new ye. Any suggestions for a new phone? The features I typically require are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCall/text obviously\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCameraphone (I use it to take pictures of stuff I need to remember)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBluetooth (since I prefer using my laptop to send SMS if possible)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMP3 player \u0026ndash; actually I wasn\u0026rsquo;t using the MP3 player on the last one recently, but having a player on my phone saves me from buying an Ipod or whatever separately\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlarm, Tasklist/Event notification \u0026ndash; I am not confident in my ability to wake up early without a cellphone alarm.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther features (internet, radio, etc) are lower priority.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Tournament report follows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I usually arrive at Galleria early, I spent a couple of hours waiting for the round to start and watch the people playtesting. I saw a lot of green decks which worried me \u0026ndash; particularly Wilt-Leaf Liege. I haven\u0026rsquo;t played Standard since before the Grand Prix \u0026ndash; I had no idea what was the local metagame coming in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lost round one to a mirror match in two games. It was close, as I lost both games with him at 1 life. I almost won game two when he played two Incinerates during his turn to finish me from six life. I had the Wild Ricochet for the second Incinerate, bringing him down to two. He has one card left in hand and is tapped out and I have four lands and Hell\u0026rsquo;s Thunder in the yard. Any burn spell or land I draw wins me the match. I draw a land and play it and announce \u0026ldquo;Unearth Hell\u0026rsquo;s Thunder.\u0026rdquo; He wants to call a judge because he\u0026rsquo;s not sure of what he\u0026rsquo;s about to do. He shows me the Faerie Macabre in hand and even though the judge is still coming I already know I\u0026rsquo;ve lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the match I asked him for tips on how to play the deck and he told me he just plays out Blightning as soon as possible, whereas I was sandbagging it and playing creatures first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound two I face Shorecrasher/Bant, an early Rhox War Monk sticks around in game one long enough to make it hard for me to win. In game two I get a nice draw with turn two Blossom and 2 Javelins. He\u0026rsquo;s stuck on two lands, missing two land drops before finally playing a Birds of Paradise. My only removal in hand consists of the two Javelins\u0026hellip; I decide to overkill the BoP and hope he doesn\u0026rsquo;t draw any more lands. Of course he draws a Flooded Grove next turn and then he plays out his hand and I\u0026rsquo;m finished off by a growing Shorecrasher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStarting out at 0-2. Why do I play Magic again? Seriously, I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing badly for a while now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch the match on the adjacent table while waiting for the next round. I see turn 5 Violent Ultimatim into turn 7 Violent Ultimatum into turn 9 Violent Ultimatum. Geez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI play another mirror match in round three, and he hits me with early burn but I stabilize at 2 life and he draws no gas afterwards. I win game two as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound four I was playing some sort of bant-colored control, and I finally managed to go on the offensive after stripping his hand an stabilizing at four lands. He would Wrath or Condemn away every creature I play, trading one for one, until he draws a card which he was apparently waiting for all this time. He shows me \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Idyllic%20Tutor\"\u003eIdyllic Tutor\u003c/a\u003e and I have no idea what he\u0026rsquo;s doing. He searches an reveals \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Enchanted%20Evening\"\u003eEnchanted Evening\u003c/a\u003e. Crap. He then plays \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Spring%20Cleaning\"\u003eSpring Cleaning\u003c/a\u003e on my Goblin Deathraiders and I flip mountain, and suddenly I have no permanents on board. I lose shortly thereafter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe mulligans to five in game two and is at four life before having any suitable defense, and I end it quickly. Next game it\u0026rsquo;s my turn as I mulligan to five, sending back one-land hands each time. I lost the third game to Spring Cleaning again. Awesome!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drop obviously. I should have stayed at home \u0026gt;.\u003c/p\u003e",

This lovely bug is documented in \u003ca href=\"http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/8968\"\u003ehttp://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/8968\u003c/a\u003e. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t confident enough to try patching it, so as a temporary workaround, I overrode the flag and delete templates and placed the following inside the form:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;input type=\u0026quot;hidden\u0026quot; name=\u0026quot;next\u0026quot; value=\u0026quot;{{ comment.get\\_content\\_object_url }}\u0026quot; /\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEdit: Wow that was stupid.

I\u0026rsquo;m not sure yet how to handle this, or whether I should try customizing the comment form with something like a captcha to prevent comment spam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a pending problem now that submitting comments from the preview or error page does not redirect to the correct place. (i.e. the post page). I tried adding the next parameter to the form, but apparently comment.get_content_object_url returns an empty string here because the comment has not yet been saved to the database. I think the content object should be provided in the context for the preview page. This would be handled by \u003ca href=\"http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/9268\"\u003ehttp://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/9268\u003c/a\u003e, except apparently no one\u0026rsquo;s paying attention to it yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome random features I added: Gravatar support (the Gravatar for the email address used to post the comment will be shown), and Markdown support in the comment body.

We went into topdeck mode, he was obviously hoping for the second angel, but I manage to finish him off before it comes out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the game he confirms that it was in fact my pool. Lucky guy! At least I managed to eke out a win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2-0 matches, 4-1 games\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the first game, he showed me 2 Courier\u0026rsquo;s Capsule, 2 Executioner\u0026rsquo;s Capsule, then finished me off with Cruel Ultimatum. It\u0026rsquo;s my first time to be on the receiving end\u0026hellip; that hurts! In the second game, he takes me out with Vein Drinker and Hell\u0026rsquo;s Thunder. I look over his pool afterwards, it was pretty sick. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I really had any chance of winning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2-1 matches, 4-3 games\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 4\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t remember the details, but I do remember I made a misplay here when I thought Skeletonize would give me the token even if it didn\u0026rsquo;t kill the target.

I lose game two (I forget how). In game three my 16-land count catches up with me and I finally got manascrewed. I mulliganned a five-lander with no action (big mistake apparently) into a six-card, one land hand into a five-card, two-land hand that didn\u0026rsquo;t give me the third land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal standing: 3-4 matches, 7-9 games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, at this point I can safely say I should have dropped after round four. I could have spent that time playing Fallout 3! Hopefully I can do better on the next PTQ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a side note, it seems I\u0026rsquo;m getting more blog readers, as more people are mentioning it at tournaments. To my faithful readers: feel free to post comments and tell me how I can improve my game! It would be much obliged!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I actually almost never play sanctioned matches outside of the weekend tournaments, but I was a bit tired from work and wanted to blow off steam, so I went ahead to Robinson\u0026rsquo;s Galleria and waited a couple of hours for the 8-man draft to fill up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened with Cruel Ultimatum as my first pick, then got a couple of white weenies (Akrasan Squire and Sigiled Paladin) before getting a 4th-pick Agony Warp. I grabbed some more blue and black fliers and felt myself going into Grixis again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond pack I opened Flameblast Dragon, Oblivion Ring, Branching Bolt, Soul\u0026rsquo;s Fire, etc. I gazed longingly at the removal for a bit before tucking away my flying bomb rare.
