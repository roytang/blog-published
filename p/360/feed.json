\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis deck is named \u0026ldquo;Under Development\u0026rdquo; because I basically threw it together two days ago with almost no playtesting. Basically, today\u0026rsquo;s tournament was my playtesting, as I could use it to gauge whether I like the feel of the deck and I should continue using it. Also, it\u0026rsquo;s my first team playing with basic islands again in constructed since forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, as the title implies, I am teh suck. Bad plays cost me at least two matches, leading me to a terrible 1-3 finish (and the one win was a \u003cem\u003eBYE\u003c/em\u003e) My post-tournament analysis is that I am so not used to playing blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick match roundup:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1 vs Dragonstorm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally, really bad matchup. First game is practically auto-loss. Second game, I trickbind the first attempt to Storm, but the lone Hellkite is enough to stand in the way of my Solifuge, and he gets out a second one a few turns later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2 vs GW Scryb/Force\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame 1 goes fast as he mulligans down to 4. I win handily and bring in Electrolyze, Pyroclasm and Serrated Arrows for game 2. Game 2, he had like six small guys in play, I was down to 3 and had 6 mana open. My cards in hand are plaxmanta and remand. I play plaxmanta, in response, remand the plaxmanta, draw my card and show him the topdecked Pyroclasm. Too bad he folllows up with two Spectral Force over the next few turns. =/\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame 3 I lost due to a bad play on my part. My opponent was tapped out with like 5 creatures that are also tapped, and an untapped Mangara (with summoning sickness) On my side, I have a morphed Shapeshifter and morphed Brine Elemental, with Stomping Ground, Plaxmanta and Demonfire in hand. My opponent is at 18, I\u0026rsquo;m at 10. I have six lands in play, if I play the Stomping Ground and take the two life loss, I can lock him down with the Brine Elemental. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what I\u0026rsquo;m thinking however, I play the Stomping Ground tapped and Demonfire the Mangara for 1, then swing for 4.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe correct play should have been:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePlay stomping ground. lose 2 life (down to 8)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAttack with both morphs, Mangara does not block\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUnmorph Brine Elemental, opponent takes 7 and drops to 11\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOpponent\u0026rsquo;s turn: no untap phase, does nothing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMy turn: Swing with morph and Brine Elemental. Opponent attemps to take one down using Mangara. I play Plaxmanta to counter the ability. Unmorph shapeshifter and copy Brine Elemental. Opponent goes down to 6 or 1 depending opn whether Mangara blocked.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMy next turn: PS Demonfire you\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBah, I caved in to fear that time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3: A bye! I get to have a decent lunch! (At 2pm)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: Vs BW Discarder/Rack\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis guy somehow managed to draw 3 castigates in each game that he won. I won the second due to aggro, and we want to game 3. Game 3 was close, very close. During his turn, he was at 4, I was at 6, he had a Mindslicer and a Rack in play. I have no board and 2 cards in hands. He\u0026rsquo;s afraid of the Demonfire, so he plays Smallpox, saccing the Mindslicer, hoping to have us both in topdeck mode and me with no answer to the rack. I let Smallpox resolve, and respond to the Mindslicer trigger by playing Plaxmanta. Plaxmanta survives, and will swing on the next turn for 2; he\u0026rsquo;s at 3 and I\u0026rsquo;m at 5. However, it seems I have no answer to the Rack. My turn, untap, upkeep take 3 from Rack (down to 2), I draw a land and hold in my hand. I swing for 2 with the Plaxmanta, bringing him down to one. But it looks like I\u0026rsquo;m losing to the Rack. I pass the turn to see what happens. He draws an Extirpate and starts looking through my ‘yard, and I spot the bad play. I HAD A THINK TWICE!!! I could have avoided 2 points of Rack damage, enough for the Plaxmanta to seal the deal. Gah, I am teh suck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the well-deserved loss and drop from the tournament, quite tired. A really bad result for me after more than a month of cutting back on Magic tournaments, not a very good comeback. However, I think the playtesting session was a success, as I found quite a few weaknesses in the deck and also found that I like playing it, it\u0026rsquo;s quite fun. So, I will probably tweak this deck and continue to play it in Standard tournaments for the time being. I probably won\u0026rsquo;t play in Block Constructed until FS comes out, so is my deck for April.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the next part, I will pick apart the deck and see what I can improve. Stay tuned!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m sure a lot of people have experienced it, the feeling of being adrift, directionless. Just living your life day in and day out not knowing where you\u0026rsquo;re going or why. Maybe not everybody though, as I\u0026rsquo;ve met quite a few people who seem quite content with the monotony of their lives, doing the same thing day in and day out, never bothering to overcome the inertia of their daily lives. Lately, I\u0026rsquo;ve been afraid that I\u0026rsquo;ve already become one of those people. My current lifestyle, such as it is, has been quite satisfactory for quite a while, and I could comfortably live the rest of my life this way. I see no need to change directions or shift gears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLately, a friend of mine mentioned that he would probably move to another company soon. That got me thinking again about my own career plans, about whether I would even consider moving to another company. And the conclusion I came up with was \u0026ldquo;Where would I go?\u0026rdquo; Moving to a different company isn\u0026rsquo;t really a change of direction if it was still the same line of work. I\u0026rsquo;ve actually already mentioned it before to the people who give me my performance reviews: if I ever leave my job, it would probably be when I decide to go out and do something new. What kind of \u0026ldquo;something new\u0026rdquo;, they would inevitably ask. And my answer has been the same for a while: I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like to read all these lifehacks, self-help, etc. stuff hoping it would help me decide what I want to do with my life, but so far I haven\u0026rsquo;t found my answer yet. The default path is of course to just stay the course, keep working in the company (or at least in the industry), and move up the corporate ladder or something. But there\u0026rsquo;s always that yearning to break away and to do something for myself; something outrageous, wild, fantastic and / or that will cause people who know me to question why I would throw away a perfectly good, safe and stable career.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer is \u0026ldquo;Because I want to be a rogue.\u0026rdquo; I want to walk the road not taken. I want to blaze my own trail. I want to leave something behind and be remembered for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just wish I knew what the hell that something is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s not that I can\u0026rsquo;t think of something I\u0026rsquo;d want to do. There are actually a lot of things I want to do. But I don\u0026rsquo;t have time to explore the options and figure out which one is the best one, the one I\u0026rsquo;d enjoy the most and hence the one where I would most likely be successful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is it holding me back? One thing is my job of course. As a friend of my said, somehow I\u0026rsquo;ve already planted quite a bit of roots there. But I would be willing to risk leaving it behind, if only I was sure what I would be leaving it behind for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, that\u0026rsquo;s my resolution for this year, right? \u0026ldquo;To find direction.\u0026rdquo; So I have until the end of the year to try to find time to explore my options and find my direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I started to write this post I meant to end it with \u0026ldquo;And if I can\u0026rsquo;t pick a direction by year\u0026rsquo;s end, I\u0026rsquo;ll just choose one and GO!\u0026rdquo;. But truth be told, I want to stay with the company a bit longer, to watch it grow. And to be honest it\u0026rsquo;s really still a valid option to stay, as I genuinely enjoy the work and would probably like to stay at least a while longer to hone my skills in this industry. (And I like the people in the company too) The only real problem with the job is that I don\u0026rsquo;t have much time to pursue other avenues of interest. Therefore I allow myself the safety of deciding that my direction would be \u0026ldquo;Stay for a while and see what happens.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill I choose an ordinary life or a daring life of adventure? Or try to pursue both ends, working as a mild-mannered programmer by day, and writing my own destiny by night?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell\u0026hellip; this post didn\u0026rsquo;t end quite like I\u0026rsquo;d hoped. That happens sometimes\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Currently, there are more NDS gamers, but not by much. Everything is friendly, and every so often the NDS group ribs the PSP group about getting NDS because they\u0026rsquo;re so much better, and of course the ribbing goes both ways. I think the PSP is nice, but it\u0026rsquo;s still expensive (twice as much as NDS), and the games are more \u0026ldquo;eye-candy\u0026rdquo; type than I\u0026rsquo;d like. NDS games are fun and innovative, while the PSP games feel like they just want you to play PS2 games on a handheld, and I\u0026rsquo;m not terribly excited by PS2 games anymore.

The action is decent, most battles are simplistic slugfests where Luffy and his crew win simply by more \u0026ldquo;will to win\u0026rdquo;; a typical thing in these types of anime. The only complaint would be that they spend too much time summarizing the previous episodes at the start of each new one, but that\u0026rsquo;s a problem only because I watch multiple episodes at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have more than a hundred episodes to watch, and since I can\u0026rsquo;t watch them during work I typically marathon at least ten episodes on weekends.

I did a hundred million things, maybe. I dunno. I didn\u0026rsquo;t keep track. I read a few books, wiped quite a few TV episodes off my backlog, learned a few new programming tricks, cleaned up some stuff, finished a few games, and God knows what else. If I bother to explain this, I would often get that lopsided look from people saying \u0026ldquo;You wasted your vacation on that?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t get this concept of \u0026ldquo;wasted vacation\u0026rdquo;. The whole idea of a vacation is to have free time to one\u0026rsquo;s self. Maybe for some people that means going off to some island resort or traveling overseas or something. For me it means I get to waste my time on whatever the hell I feel like doing when I wake up in the morning. (Or often around lunchtime.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of people burn away all their days working on a job they don\u0026rsquo;t even enjoy, now that\u0026rsquo;s what you should consider a waste of time. Not that I don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy my job, but I certainly wanted that break (and I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I earned it.) I didn\u0026rsquo;t have anything in particular to do or accomplish. I simply wanted to have free time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePost Part II:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI came back to work just in time for annual assessment time, a stressful time for many people, as they wonder how much of an increase they\u0026rsquo;re going to get, if any. Well, it\u0026rsquo;s not a stressful time for me, as I don\u0026rsquo;t really care much about the increase. My current compensation was already pretty good anyway, so anything I get this year is just a \u0026ldquo;win more\u0026rdquo; situation really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I would really appreciate (and I\u0026rsquo;ve told them this before) is more free time. I like my job, even enjoy it every so often. But I really enjoy my free time as well, and I actually wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mind taking a significant (say, 20%) salary cut to gain one day of free time per week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of people say time is money. What many people don\u0026rsquo;t realize is that time is more important than money. Money is simply one of the things time can be translated into. But time can also be transformed into other, more important things that money cannot provide: personal growth, the company of your loved ones and the freedom to be your own person\u0026hellip; things that make the flexibility of free time far more valuable than mere money.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003ePlayed yesterday at Galleria. With a whole bunch of people: three from the Zu crowd and I think five or six from the office. Insane number of people, as expected. I got there about ten minutes after the mall opened (I came from work), and I was already preregistered, but I only got to sign up for the sixth flight (Flight F). They had to buy extra tables from a nearby Office Warehouse. I finally got to crack open packs around 12:30PM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly bomb in my sealed deck pool was an Avatar of Woe, but my black was too weak to support it. I went for a U/W aggro build to take advantage of a Serra Sphinx I opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Hits:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamnation seems easy to get \u0026ndash; 3 of the people I knew who were playing opened it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened 5 rares in 3 Planar Chaos packs, one was a foil Shivan Wumpus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first round opponent was apparently a prerelease virgin; after giving a beating with his creatures for most of game one, he played an Oros the Avenger hoping to finish me off. Luckily for me, he was playing the actual prerelease card, which is a no-no. I won the second game, game record: 2-0; match record 1-0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond round opponent was red/white again. I\u0026rsquo;ve never played against Giant Growth in limited, but one would expect it to be a house. After getting hit by Brute Force twice, I\u0026rsquo;m inclined to agree, and have now learned to play around combat tricks when the opponent only has a mountain. I won 2-1. Game record: 4-1, match record: 2-0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird round opponent\u0026hellip; some red also. First game I only saw an Avalanche Rider and the 7/7 echo guy. Second game he put up more of a fight, and the \u0026ldquo;free echo\u0026rdquo; goblin helped him a lot. He get out the Goblin Advisor and went all aggro on me before I managed to stablize. Those exploding goblins can\u0026rsquo;t get past a Dream Stalker! Game record: 6-1, match record: 3-0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFourth round opponent\u0026hellip; well, it seems everybody but me plays red. First game I played out all the tricks my deck had with a Clockwork Hydra. Auramancer\u0026rsquo;s Guile + Hydra meant I could attack without losing +1/+1 counters. He bounces the Hydra, I play it again. He shoots the Hydra, I save it with a lion. He forces my Hydra into a bad block, I blink it out. He tries to Lightning Axe, I flashback the blink. This game was way fun on my end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond game goes long, but he later drops a Pyrohemia. Bomb enchantment! And I had no way to remove it. I tried to play around it, but his Paradise Plume eventually gave him enough life that he could just burn me out with the red Pestilence. I quickly gauge my options: ten minutes left in the round, but my deck is more aggro. I still have enough time to win game 3, so I concede and shuffle quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird game I draw a hand with five lands, a morph guy and the Serra Sphinx. The morph guy doubles as removal (gives +2/-2), so I figure this is good enough, as I don\u0026rsquo;t miss the 3rd-turn creature drop. Bad decision, as I draw into even more lands, and he\u0026rsquo;s more aggro than usual. The game goes long again, and eventually he surprises me with a Teferi I didn\u0026rsquo;t see the first two games. I sigh and realize I\u0026rsquo;m probably going to lose when he flashes the Sorceress Queen-timeshift at end of my turn. We go to time. And I try to stop him from killing me in three swings. Not enough blockers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal game record: 7-3, match record 3-1. I had good enough tie breakers to finish 4th in the pod, and I hoped I could still get a shirt for such a good performance. No such luck though. I take my 3 packs anyway, hoping I get good stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did. (1 Angel of Fury, 1 Groundbreaker, 1 Timbermare)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy flight finished at around 6PM. By this time I had gone with around 2 hours sleep in the past 14 hours, and the only food I had was two ensaymadas for a late breakfast before the flight started. Yeah, dead tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotes on specific cards:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat 3cc blue common morph guy, the one that gives +2/-2? He\u0026rsquo;s awesome. I\u0026rsquo;d pick him high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaltfield Recluse was a card I initially underrated and did not play main. However, I ended up bringing him in every time I could. That -2/-0 really screws the combat odds in your favor, and saves your guys from the occasional bad block or combat trick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of combat tricks: yeah, Brute Force is pretty good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitemane lion is essentially a combat trick with a free bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePongify is fun as expected. I loved it when my opponent attacked with a 7/7 he had just paid echo for, and I shake my head, show him the card and say: \u0026ldquo;Monkey?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, the set is awesome for sealed deck play, the block environment looks good. The design of the cards isn\u0026rsquo;t particular innovative since everything is either a throwback or a reprint, but the choice of cards and abilities to bring back\u0026hellip; everything is awesome. I\u0026rsquo;m definitely going to play the release tournament.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
