            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinal Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates\u003c/strong\u003e is an action-RPG by Square Enix. The original Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles came out on the NGC. \u003cstrong\u003eRing of Fates\u003c/strong\u003e is a different game for the NDS, though I guess it\u0026rsquo;s sort of a spiritual successor. I finally managed to get some NDS time and finish this game last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFFC: RoF follows the story of the twins Yuri and Chelinka who live a simple life with their father in an isolated cabin. Things are not as they seem however and of course eventually the twins\u0026rsquo; world is turned upside-down and they find themselves having to find dangerous beasts and cast powerful magicks. It\u0026rsquo;s the usual RPG fare, albeit a bit too kiddified at some points. And as you would expect from a Square Enix title, we get an ending that\u0026rsquo;s literally out of this world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s got the usual action RPG trappings: swinging your sword, jumping around, puzzles that involve really big switches, etc. Gameplay-wise it\u0026rsquo;s pretty decent, with each of the four main characters providing different styles of play (although Yuri is definitely the strongest one\u0026hellip; or that just might be because I always gave him the best stuff). The difficulty level is not that high, though some people may find the platforming bits off-putting. Boss battles are the usual fare \u0026ndash; figure out the enemy\u0026rsquo;s attack patterns and how to beat them, etc. The game does a good job of curving you up to make sure you know how to use the various gameplay mechanics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first complaint is about a particular \u0026ldquo;gate\u0026rdquo; in the final dungeon. Games like RPGs are sometimes referred to as \u0026ldquo;gate-driven\u0026rdquo;, because the player is presented with a sequence of \u0026ldquo;gates\u0026rdquo; or challenges he has to pass in order to complete the game. The \u0026ldquo;gate\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m talking about in the final dungeon is a switch. The switch is visible in plain sight, but when I got there I had no idea how to turn it on. The usual action of just stepping on it didn\u0026rsquo;t work, I tried throwing various stuff or casting spells on it, but no such luck. I actually set aside the game for a few days because I couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out that switch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI actually needed It turns out I need to perform a particulat air-based attack to hit the switch from a jump. Normally this would be fine, except that the game has never required me to use that particular move anywhere else! It was taught in a short tutorial near the start of the game, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never used it after that so I even forgot it existed. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit disappointing because elsewhere the game does a great job of \u0026ldquo;teaching\u0026rdquo; you how to use the various actions as required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second gripe is a bit related: there are some platforms that require a particular camera angle in order for you to see how to proceed, and it\u0026rsquo;s not always clear how to get there. You end up walking to different positions to try and figure out how to get past the \u0026ldquo;gate\u0026rdquo;. In general in RPG design I think that whenever the player is forced to figure something out by trial and error it\u0026rsquo;s kind of lame and bad design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese problems are mostly confined to the last dungeon of the game though, most of the time I just breezed through. The story mode will take about ten hours to complete, assuming decent platforming skills. THis may seem a bit short to the average RPG player who grew up with Final Fantasy VII, but it\u0026rsquo;s actually a nice bite-sized helping for guys like me who don\u0026rsquo;t have much time to dedicate to gaming and want to get on to the next game as soon as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give FFCC:RoF 3.5 out of 5 stars, decent enough. What? I don\u0026rsquo;t give ratings here? Right.\u003c/p\u003e",

I almost lost to Rage Reflection in game one, but luckily my maindeck Gleeful Sabotage came through via topdeck. Merrow Rootcutters gave me a lot of trouble, so I sided in 2 Inquisitor\u0026rsquo;s Snare for Mercy Killing and Aethertow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn game 2 he had a perfect curve for turns 1-3 but then stalled on four lands. I later found out he was holding something like three five-drops in his hand, including the Demigod of Revenge. I manage to drop my Swans before his fifth land and bring the race close enough for me to kill in 1-2 swings. By then he manages to draw a second mountain and play Kulrath Knight. I\u0026rsquo;m stupid here and think the Wither would affect the Swans (it won\u0026rsquo;t), so when his Knight blocks I hit it with Inquisitor\u0026rsquo;s Snare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext turn he plays Demigod but doesn\u0026rsquo;t attack, seeing as how I could swing back for maybe lethal. We stare off for a few turns; I can\u0026rsquo;t afford to swing as he\u0026rsquo;ll just block the Swans and draw a bunch of cards. Finally he draws the sixth land and lays down Rage Reflection, pumps Demigod with Revelsong Horn then swings with the big mean 6/5 flying double-striker. He\u0026rsquo;s tapped out, at five life, with no other fliers. I have the Swans and Barkshell Blessing in hand. I block the Demigod and tell him the Swans don\u0026rsquo;t die. He reads the card, shakes his head and draws his twelve cards. I untap, swing with the Swans and show him the pump for the win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3 vs WG 2-0 win\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m paired down for some reason. My opponent starts with early Scuttlemutts, and I hit Wilt-Leaf Cavs on turn three and Shield of the Oversoul on turn four. I\u0026rsquo;m gambling that my opponent won\u0026rsquo;t realize the Scuttlemutt trick, as he seems genuinely distressed at the 5/6/ vigilant indestructible flier, so I keep swinging till I win. Game two I open with the same turns 3 and 4 and win easily. After the game I tell him about the Scuttlemutt trick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy sweaty hands seem to be getting worse by the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4 vs RG 2-1 win\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lose game one to a powerful curve \u0026ndash; turn one Nurturer Initiate, turn two Devoted Druid, turn three Ram-Gang, turn four Morselhoarder (!), and quickly lose without being able to put up a decent defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI board +2 Inquisitor\u0026rsquo;s Snare -1 Mercy Killing -1 Gleeful Sabotage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two I choose to play first, even though I\u0026rsquo;ve always chosen to draw in the previous rounds. I can\u0026rsquo;t afford that kind of opening again. Luckily I get an early fatty out and his offense never starts off. I win with a flying indestructible Cavalier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame three he\u0026rsquo;s on the play and has no one-drop again (lucky!). I lay down Oversoul of Dusk on turn five and he\u0026rsquo;s terribly annoyed. It\u0026rsquo;s a standoff between the Oversoul and 3-4 creatures on his side of the board. I play the Liege and swing with the 7/7 oversoul bringing him to 13. He uses Tower Above to take out the Liege. I swing with the 5/5 and use Spectral Procession to create blockers. We\u0026rsquo;re both at 8.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn his turn he lays down a bunch of creatures including Safehold Elite (which can block the Oversoul!) and is ready to swing and kill me next turn. I topdeck the Shield of the Oversoul and show it to him. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s only 7/7,\u0026rdquo; he shrugs. I show him the last card in my hand \u0026ndash; Tower Above, and I take the win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour and O!

Manamorphose is the better card, as it\u0026rsquo;s truly free, the only requirement being having two mana free (but you get that mana back)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGleeful Sabotage\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe format is rife with common artifact creatures and powerful auras, so play this one maindeck. \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Smash%20to%20Smithereens\"\u003eSmash to Smithereens\u003c/a\u003e and the 1/1 elf that can kill enchantments are similarly solid.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eScarecrows\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003euse these to fill out your curve, they\u0026rsquo;re especially useful to stop the \u0026ldquo;evasive hill giant\u0026rdquo; cycle. \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Lurebound%20Scarecrow\"\u003eLurebound Scarecrow\u003c/a\u003e is a bit dangerous as it can be a 2-for-1 against you. \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Wicker%20Warcrawler\"\u003eWicker Warcrawler\u003c/a\u003e is fairly strong; note that it gains the -1/-1 counter at end of combat, so the first swing is for six.

Sometimes at least, especially when under stress or it\u0026rsquo;s really, really humid. The reason I got to thinking about it was that I finally realized it was affecting the way I play in Magic tournaments. After a few rounds of playing Magic, it always happens that the card sleeves start sticking to each other due to my sweaty hands. It\u0026rsquo;s quite a distraction and one my opponents even commented on my sweaty hands after the post-match handshake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about looking for a solution (one that didn\u0026rsquo;t involve pee), and did a bit of research on the concept of _pasmado _online. The difficult part was figuring out what the condition was called in English. I asked a few people and none could give any decisive answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brother claimed the concept did not exist in Western medicine so there was no English term for it. Some thought that the condition was fictional and only exists in old wives\u0026rsquo; tales.

Sure enough, Wikipedia confirmed that \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperhidrosis\"\u003esuch a condition did exist \u003c/a\u003e.

However, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to spend on medicine or god forbid surgery just so I could play better Magic. I\u0026rsquo;ve lived with this condition for as long as I can recall so I can tolerate it most of the time.

In game one I died due to taking 10 damage total from two Mudbutton Torchrunners that I should have just blocked early. Game two I managed to fight back, getting a nuts aggro draw that meant I only took 3 damage for the whole game. Unfortunately in game three I didn\u0026rsquo;t even manage to get one damage in, due to rapid Fanatic/Marauder attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sure how to play against the burn deck now. I seem to be at an advantage if I get into early aggro and force him to play as control.

I lost game one somehow, I think to a mainboarded Sower. The only creatures I saw were Shadowmages, Venser and Sower. I assume some sort of Mannequin build and bring in Sowers and Unsummons in case there were some sort of fatties. He gets a slow draw in game two and I win off numerous turns of attacking for one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn game three, he gets out an early Bitterblossom and a Loxodon Warhammer, pretty much bad news for me. I go full aggro to attempt to race the warhammer, but since he only has five mana I gain a lot of tempo by using Unsummons, Psionic Blasts and Sowers on whatever he equips the Warhammer to. It was lucky that he decided to be defensive, if he had tried to race me with the Warhammer I might not have won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames 3-3 Matches 1-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 3: Merfolk vs UG Faeries\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Basta may island, good matchup!\u0026quot;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI actually didn\u0026rsquo;t know he was on Faeries in game one since all he showed me were two Goyfs.

On my fifth upkeep he attempts to Mystic Snake my Ancestral Visions. I Delay the Snake, draw into and play a fistful of merfolk and take him down to a meager three life in the next two turns. I show him Psionic Blast and he jokingly asks what the target is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames 5-3 Matches 2-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 4: Merfolk vs Monogreen aggro\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame one he manages to flash in a Scryb Ranger.

His first turn was a forest without an elf, so I knew things were looking good. We make no plays on the first and second turn; third turn he plays Call of the Herd that I Rune Snag. Next turn he flashes it back and gets a 3/3 Elephant. I play Sower taking the Elephant, gambling with the tap out and hoping he doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the Scryb Ranger. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t, and I just back up those five points of power with permission to win the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame three he holds on to a hand without an elf again, and I don\u0026rsquo;t even take any damage this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames 7-4 Matches 3-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 5: Merfolk vs Monored Burn\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh inwardly when I see who I\u0026rsquo;m paired with, since I already know he has a burn deck. Game one goes quickly, due to me having no answer to Mutavaults pumped by Lords of Atlantis. I board in Sowers and Flash Freezes. He boarded out Gargadons and Crushers, go figure.

I had him at ten life before he could even untap with four mana. He surveys the ten power worth of Merfolk on the board and scoops. We finish game one in under two minutes \u0026ndash; the adjacent table hasn\u0026rsquo;t even finished shuffling yet!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two I board in Sowers and Unsummons. He gets a Troll down and a Warhammer equipped. I grab his other creatures using Sowers to chump-block and race him with 8-10 power of Merfolk and Conclaves. I dealt a total of 32 damage during this game, just enough to win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames 9-6 Matches 4-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 7: Merfolk vs Monogreen Elves\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame one he gets out early Paragons, but I stabilize with a Sower on an Imperious Perfect with two +1/+1 counters. My merfolk eventually get big enough to bash through and I take game one, winning with 5 life remaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI board in Sowers + Unsummons + Flashfreeze again, basically the best Sideboard plan ever against green decks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two and hold off on attacking early, instead building up advantage through permission and Adepts. Eventually I manage to have one Reejerey and two Lords join my last Adept, total of seventeen power worth of Merfolk on the board. He lays down more Elves to block, but I have three lords to his none, he has no chance and his sideboarded Hail Storm was surprising yet no help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal record: Games 11-6 Matches 5-2, #11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlightly better record this time, the Unsummons really helped against the green decks.

Enjoyment. Tournament report follows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 1: UB Faeries\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s basically impossible to join a standard tournament without seeing UB Faeries. This matchup is a race, since usually there\u0026rsquo;s no blocking involved. But I felt confident since they have Bitterblossom and I have Psionic Blast, so I had a lower damage target. However, the main enemy in this matchup is Cryptic Command, since it stalls one round of damage which is huge in such a close race. I won game one easily since I got a nuts draw and my opponent seemed not used to playing against the fish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ‘m not sure exactly how I sideboarded here but it was almost certainly wrong, as I remember changing my board decisions 2 or 3 times. I proceeded to lose games two and three, although game three was very close. My opponent had boarded in more removal (4 Shriekmaws) which meant I almost never had a lord on the board \u0026ndash; good choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames 1-2 Matches 0-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 2: UBw Control (with Reveillark)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure how the opponent could possibly win here; the matchup is very similar to Faeries, except that my guys are unblockable. The normal plan is to have 3-6 guys in play by turn 3, then just use permission to stop Wraths/Damnations/whatever. Delay is excellent in this matchup since you send the Damnation back three turns where he\u0026rsquo;s hopefully dead. I think I boarded in +2 Sower -2 random dorks, and won in three games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames 3-3 Matches 1-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 3: UB Faeries\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, once again Faeries! Game one I had my opponent at one life and she had Bitterblossom out so I thought I would win, but end of turn Scion + Spellstutter + me forgetting to count the Faerie Conclave meant she was able to take me from 17 to 0 in one turn\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, I managed to pull ahead and comfortably win games two and three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames 5-4 Matches 2-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 4: UB Faeries\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3 out of 4 opponents now brought this deck. Game one here was very close, as he killed me the turn before Bitterblossom would have killed him. A Cryptic Command decided that race, and he knew enough to play it inside the attack step so that I had no window to play a Merfolk spell to untap a creature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two I mulligan to five, get stuck on one land and promptly lose. My opponent was apologetic about the mana screw, but hey that\u0026rsquo;s the way the game works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames 5-6 Matches 2-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 5: UB Faeries\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t even bother writing the matchup in the notes anymore, I would surely remember that 4 out of the first five rounds I faced Faeries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame one my opponent tried to stay alive by using a Sower on my Lord of Atlantis \u0026ndash; but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually do anything since my guys get the bonus no matter where the Lord is. I lose game two to fast beats, then in game three I get the nuts draw: Turn 1 \u0026ndash; Suspend Visions, Turn 2 \u0026ndash; Banneret, Turn 3 \u0026ndash; Reejerey, Adept (revealing Adept), untap island, one more Adept (revealing 3rd Adept). I actually had the 4th Adept as well, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to overcommit to the board. No hope for the opponent\u0026rsquo;s survival here\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames 7-7 Matches 3-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 6: BRwu Control\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strange controllish deck, I got hit by Avalanche Riders, Reveillarks and Hellkites, etc. I was close to sealing off game one with him at 5 and me holding the PsiBlast, but he manages to get a Tendrils off and I lost after that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI board in +2 Sower -2 Sage\u0026rsquo;s Dousing. I win the next two games easily without drawing the Sowers though\u0026hellip; I just make it a point to be more careful about Tendrils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames 9-8 Matches 4-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 7: Monored Burn\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, an opponent without islands! It\u0026rsquo;s immediately obvious what he\u0026rsquo;s playing when his turn 1 is mountain, suspend rift bolt. I take some hits, and he chooses to point his burn at me instead of my critters, which I think is a mistake. Against a straight control deck that\u0026rsquo;s fine, but this one is an aggro-control swarm; I only need to make sure his burn doesn\u0026rsquo;t deal the twentieth point of damage and surely my creatures can finish the job. At least, that was the plan, until he played Crusher and suspended Big Gargs. I kept chumping the Crusher while waiting for my answer \u0026ndash; Sower. When I finally drew it, it forced him to sac the Crusher and he was already in topdeck mode so I just went in, dealing 4-5 points of damage at a time to win the game at one life. The Sage\u0026rsquo;s Dousing and Silvergill Adepts were awesome in this matchup, ensuring that he loses steam before me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI board in Flash Freeze for Delays. Second game is much like the first, except he draws no creatures except for a lone Mogg Fanatic which he sacs to off a Banneret, and he\u0026rsquo;s also mana flooded. He\u0026rsquo;s learned from the first game and keeps killing the lords, but eventually even the 1/1s manage to kill him. I ended the game at a comfortable 4 life, holding 2 flash freeze and a sage\u0026rsquo;s dousing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinal record:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames 11-8, Matches 5-2, #15\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI win a Morningtide Booster, and the rare is\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIdyllic Tutor!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be honest, I\u0026rsquo;m glad to win anything at all, as I haven\u0026rsquo;t won anything since the Morningtide Release event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad for a deck put together quicky with no playtesting at all. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to use the Surgespanners, which I had hoped to use against ‘Lark but after getting a feel of the deck the Surgespanners seem a bit too slow. Still, the deck is a pretty good choice for the meta. It has about an even chance with Faeries, I think it has a positive matchup against slow control decks and with a little luck can even survive against monored burn, even without Dragon Claws or Bottle Gnomes. I\u0026rsquo;ve always preferred turning men sideways in order to win, so I find this deck appeals to me more than ‘Lark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat will I play next week? Stay tuned!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

above that had a better game against Faeries (in theory!). I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to play a UW control deck for five rounds, so we go Mana Ramp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 1: BG Elves\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame one goes long, he stalls the ground with a lot of elves while I\u0026rsquo;m holding him off with Walls and Colossi. I\u0026rsquo;m at 9 and a Troll Ascetic with a Warhammer has gotten him to 36. After burning 3 Harmonizes I finally get a Sulfurous blast and wipe his side, going down to six. Unfortunately, the the Ascetic and 2 Treetop Villages survived, making it too dangerous to counterattack. I already have a Disintegrate in hand, so I just need to wait for the Hostility to win the game with. Unfortunately, he draws Profane Command before I draw Hostility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two he has no blockers on turn two so I foolishly send in the Treetop, which of course gets sent to the ‘yard via Nameless Inversion. I stall on land afterwards and never recover. Funny, I remember another Green player making the exact same mistake against me on turn 2 when I used to play Mannequin \u0026ndash; I need to learn from my opponents\u0026rsquo; mistakes as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e0-2 games, 0-1 matches (Not a good start obviously)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 2: UBW Hakkon Reanimator\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m at table 100!

I untap and play Hostility. Crovax blocks and returns to hand., taking him from 27 life to 25. He untaps and plays Akroma. End of his turn, cast Incinerate, creating 3 3/1 tokens. Cast Skred to kill Wall of Roots (blocker). My turn, untap, draw. Incinerate, creating 3 more tokens. Disintegrate for 5, creating 5 more tokens. Attack with 11 tokens + Hostility, 39 damage on the board and only Akroma as the blocker\u0026hellip; nick deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two\u0026hellip; my notes make it appear that I just played a fatty and pummelled him to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4-2 games 2-1 matches\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 4: UB Faeries\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow!

Trying to go aggro when I was obviously the control in this matchup\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;Misassignment of role = game loss\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two I played a bit better, and the game went long, but I still lost to a misplay. I needed to play a 3 damage burn spell so that Bitterblossom would kill him, and having both Incinerate and Sulfurous Blast in my hand, I went for the greedy blast, hoping to clear away the Faeries on board as well. Of course I then got hit by an Rune Snag that I could\u0026rsquo;ve paid for if I had played the Incinerate instead! I got too greedy and didn\u0026rsquo;t think it through\u0026hellip; clearing the Faeries on board wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have mattered as long as I won the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4-4 games 2-2 matches\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 5: UB Mannequin\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEasy, I win in two games.

Luckily, the deck is good against BR Goblins as well. Between Colossus, Sulfurous Blast and Pyroclasm out of the board, he doesn\u0026rsquo;t have much chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI so wanted to board in the Heavyweights here, given that I hadn\u0026rsquo;t had a chance to play them yet, but I was afraid that he might have had either Gargadon or Shriekmaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8-4 games, 4-2 matches\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 7: UB Faeries\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI play a lot better this time, and the maindeck Spectral Force goes to work, tearing across Bitterblossom Tokens like nobody\u0026rsquo;s business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10-4 games, 5-2 matches.

I easily win game one due to the 6 board sweepers in the deck. I must have had some sort of fattie as I have a record of him going from 17 to 7 to 0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two I mulligan to five and fall to 2 life before I can muster a good defense. At two life, Threshers and Blasts are useless, so on to game three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first game three! We trade blows and go long, eventually I\u0026rsquo;m at 7 and he\u0026rsquo;s at 8. I have six lands and am holding both Incinerate and Disintegrate, so I can kill him by EOT 3 damage and Sorcery-speed 5 damage, but I\u0026rsquo;m afraid of Rune Snag so I wait. Eventually, he resolves a Mistbind Clique that teams up with Conclaves to kill me. After the game he tells me that he boarded out the Rune Snags \u0026ndash; apparently it\u0026rsquo;s a common tactic vs Mana Ramp, something I would have known if I had bothered to do any research on the deck at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11-6 games, 5-3 matches\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 9: UW Reveillark\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy opponent and I knows each other from prior tournaments and we\u0026rsquo;re both known to have used ‘Lark before so he assumes it\u0026rsquo;s the mirror. Sadly, it\u0026rsquo;s actually a good matchup for him and I just shake my head as I play turn one Treetop Village. As expected, the Village gets Vensered and Cloudskated before it could do anything useful, and my attempts to Thresher to clear his side of the board are only met with a Pact of Negation. I shake my head and shuffle up for game two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally I get to use my anti-Lark sideboard. I knew coming in that Mana Ramp generally lost to ‘Lark, so I packed ten sideboard cards for the matchup: 4 Cryoclasm, 3 Extirpate and 3 Void. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember how I boarded, but I reduced my creature count (expecting Moat), keeping only Hostility among my fatties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd of course\u0026hellip; it didn\u0026rsquo;t go well. I resolved a Void, named five and he showed me his hand full of 2s: Rune Snags, Blinks and Remove Souls. He eventually draws into two Larks, and I don\u0026rsquo;t have the Extirpates to fight back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinal record:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11-8 games, 5-4 matches, finished #95 (won Extended Art Imperious Perfect)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderperformed again as usual. Of course, given that I came up with the decklist the night before and had zero playtesting I suppose it\u0026rsquo;s not so bad. And given the 3 faerie decks I faced I don\u0026rsquo;t think I would have done as well with the Lark deck. This deck is workable but could use a bit of tuning. (Obviously the Heavyweights are such a joke and have to go\u0026hellip; ) People don\u0026rsquo;t usually expect the unusually high amount of burn, and I even have the ability to deal upwards of 30 damage with the Hostility combo, so it\u0026rsquo;s pretty flexible. I\u0026rsquo;ll see what I can do to improve the Lark matchup\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e",

We both had Body Doubles that were ‘larks, plus each had another random 2/2 flier. I was at six in game three, he was still at twenty, we were both basically in topdeck mode. He swings with six power in the air, I block with my guys to get everyone killed. Big mistake, since he\u0026rsquo;s the Active Player, my trigger resolves first and he gets to Sower whatever I bring back; I bring in two Body Doubles copying Reveillarks; the second mistake was not realizing I that I had a Blink in the yard, could have prevented the Sower trigger and brought back two more guys, a large enough swing that would have been enough to win me the game that I eventually lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, still unsure if I will play this deck at City Champs, as it\u0026rsquo;s very tiring\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The second mistake was ordering a fried noodle dish. It would have been fine if I was sufficiently skilled with chopsticks, but as it is I can only food I can manage relatively well with chopsticks are large pieces of meat. And fried noodles are served all bunched up together and they aren\u0026rsquo;t straightforward to chew through, hence whenever I shove some into my mouth with the chopsticks, I feel like I would be unable to stop until I swallow it all (or choke, whatever). Eventually I just give up with about a third of the noodles still in the bowl.

This was one of the aggro matchups my scant playtesting focused on, so I already knew it was a beating. The Windborn Muses in the board were my reaction to the bad matchup vs this deck and Faeries. They weren\u0026rsquo;t in Peebles original decklist which made top 8 at the SCG 5k, but he recommended the tech in the forums. Still it wasn\u0026rsquo;t very effective against this particular build, due to 3 \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Cloak%20and%20Dagger\"\u003eCloak and Dagger\u003c/a\u003e which he just put on a single attacker with Fear.

Scary, but the UW deck easily gains control. He made a bad decision to O-Ring my 2nd turn Prismatic Lens in game 2, when I had the Moat two turns later.

Game two he keeps a one-lander with like 5 one-drops, but I show him the Windborn Muse on turn three, and a second one two turns later. Game three is a heartbreaker, and reminds me that I really need to be careful with my plays under pressure as I tend to give away games that I should have won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis board is like six ground guys, including Stinkdrinker Bandit, plus Marsh Flitter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m at 4 life. My board is Magus of the Moat and Body Double (copying Mulldrifter). and a Cloudskate. I had spent most of the game burning my two blinks on the Body Double to draw into the combo so that I could win despite my precarious situation. I already have the Entity in the yard, along with every other possible creature except for the Reveillark and the Body Double. Finally, with 10 mana available, I draw into the Reveillark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I\u0026rsquo;m an aggro player by nature, I know how to smell victory, and drawing the Reveillark told me I could win on that turn. So I went ahead and evoked it. Then I looked through the graveyard to get two guys I realized\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eI couldn\u0026rsquo;t combo while the Body Double was still in play!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMentally, I panicked, and decided to just get the Entity and Mulldrifter, and hope to draw into the last Momentary Blink (to turn my Body Double into a Reveillark). Instead, I drew a Prismatic Lens. Not mindful of the consequence (since I was supposedly still safe behind the moat), leaving 3 mana untapped. Next turn I could use Venser on the Body Double and win the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, he top decks into the Nameless Inversion, killing the Magus and taking me out of the tournament in one swing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerrible\u0026hellip; so many things gone wrong. I should have reserved a blink to protect the Moat. If I hadn\u0026rsquo;t played the lens, the Mirror Entity could have protected the Moat. Or I could have Venser\u0026rsquo;ed. I also evoked the Reveillark purely out of instinct, thinking something like I could bring back Cloudskate+ Entity, bounce the Body Double, recast it and win the game, but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have had enough mana for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLack of experience with the deck was partly to blame, since I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the instinct to recognize that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t combo with the Body Double in play. Still, I need to address this lack of thinking-through my plays since I often turns wins or draws into losses unnecessarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinal record: 3-3-Drop\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAfterthoughts:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found it hard getting back into the groove of a whole-day tournament after being out of it for so long, especially playing with a new deck. In the middle of the tournament I found myself so tired and wondering why I\u0026rsquo;m even still playing competitively given that I make so many bad plays. With so many other things vying for my time I could easily justify quitting tournament magic for a while. But that last game was a bit invigorating, it made me wake up to a challenge to improve my game.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eOn my way home today I passed by Megamall as usual, and there was a Scrabble tournament going on. I stopped for a few minutes and watched. I realize a lot of people would probably find watching Scrabble games boring, seeing only two geeky people spelling out words at random, not even making any sense. But watching the Scrabble games brought me back to a time when I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the internet to keep me up at nights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrabble is a game close to my heart, me and my brother Kerwin practically grew up with the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy grandfather often played games at home with my uncles, often with small bets of ten or twenty pesos. I remember as a kid I was so envious of a notched-tile board that my grandfather had bought, while we kids played with our cheap and dingy locally-made board. There was one summer where me, Kerwin and my cousin played Scrabble basically every day, sometimes with our uncle who often had free time. We learned a lot of new words of course, we learned strategy, we complained about someone taking far too long to play (usually my cousin).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember often abusing the fact that we played with a challenge penalty. To non-Scrabble players: that means that if you think your opponent has played an illegal word, you may challenge it, and he loses the turn if it\u0026rsquo;s not in the dictionary. But if it does appear in the dictionary, you have lost the challenge and must forfeit your own turn. It added a nice bluffing subgame: I would consciously favor words that I knew to be correct but looked ridiculous \u0026ndash; after all, words like \u0026ldquo;VUV\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;ZOA\u0026rdquo; were allowed in the usual Scrabble dictionaries. I usually did this trick to my cousin who was older than me. Kerwin was younger so for some reason he just trusted what his brother would play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember being really excited the first time I won against my uncle; he had been the most difficult opponent I had ever played at that point, and it seemed like such an accomplishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you knew me during college, you may know that I was a pretty good Scrabble player. I took the PE class (easy 1.0! although of course PEs don\u0026rsquo;t count against the GWA), played in two or three University-wide tournaments, and won one or two. Well, memory tells me I won at least one, but the number of extra Scrabble sets I still keep to this day tell me it was probably two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do remember that at a certain point I was even thinking about competing in National or International tournaments. Alas, if only Scrabble tournaments were held at the same regularity that \u003ca href=\"http://roytang.net/magic/\"\u003eMagic \u003c/a\u003etournaments are, I might have a completely different (and much less expensive) geeky hobby right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days I still manage a game every so often with either my brothers or my mother, so the extra scrabble boards go unused. We\u0026rsquo;ve also played a lot online, Scrabulous is an excellent waste of time. It\u0026rsquo;s sad that Milton-Bradley, the company that owns the Scrabble trademark, is suing Scrabulous over this when Scrabulous has made Scrabble so popular online, especially over Facebook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching the Scrabble tournament today for a few minutes, I realized I wish I had known about the tournament; I may be rusty but I could probably still put up a fight. And I also remembered one of the great things about Scrabble: anyone can play \u0026ndash; the tournament had young and old, men and women alike, fighting for dominance over the space a few tiles and a few words. Maybe someday I can compete in that world again.\u003c/p\u003e",

Case one was the usual introductory case, with Winston Payne reprising his role as would-be slayer of rookie defense attorneys. Unlike previous AA games, case one is a bit longer this time, and leaves several questions that would not be answered until the fourth case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCase two and three are by far the best in the game. The plots are involving, and the mysteries take all your effort to decipher. Each case seems so simple but it\u0026rsquo;s up to you to unmask the layers of deception and arrive at the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCase four is by far the weakest of the four cases, though still enjoyable.  My main problems with it are that it\u0026rsquo;s (a) easy \u0026ndash; the path to uncover the truth is almost handed to you directly. I would have expected the last case to be the most difficult one; and (b) it doesn\u0026rsquo;t satisfy all of the unanswered questions from case one.The most important unanswered question of course being: what happened to Maya? Really, we get to see Gumshoe _and Meekins (?!?) _again, but no Maya Fey?

And Apollo\u0026rsquo;s main problem here isn\u0026rsquo;t the fact that PW already has 3 games under his belt or that he\u0026rsquo;s still a rookie; his main problem is that he has no Edgeworth. No ruthless opposition who will eat him up if he makes a single mistake. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, Gavin is fine. But he\u0026rsquo;s too\u0026hellip; nice.

We\u0026rsquo;ve seen what the countless political episodes have exposed: corruption at almost every level of government, both the executive and legislative branches beholden to bribery and extortion. The problems in our government are systemic in nature, and it would take more than the ouster of a single person to effect any meaningful change. Even if we were to find someone *with good intentions* to replace the president, he\u0026rsquo;s still likely to be swallowed up by the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t know where the whole ZTE debacle will end; maybe they\u0026rsquo;ll be able to oust GMA, maybe not. But what I fear is that we are finding ourselves trapped in a cycle of ousting bad leaders, and with each round our apathy for corruption only grows deeper. If people rose up against GMA and things remained the same afterwards, more and more of us would just give up against the seemingly irreversible tide of corruption that pervades the government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a sad and cynical view to have of our government, but I find more and more that I just don\u0026rsquo;t care what happens to GMA. It\u0026rsquo;s not that I\u0026rsquo;ve given up hope in our govt, but I do not yet see any light at the end of that dark tunnel. Anyway, the Filipino nation is more than just the government, and there are other ways we can support our country than by meddling in politics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to admit that I posted this there hoping to incite some discussion and find out where the list members (who by definition are mostly smart middle-class people) stand. I was not disappointed, but the discussion seems to have petered out at this point. Nothing has happened yet, I guess everyone\u0026rsquo;s adopting a wait-and-see attitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore thoughts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEDSA Revolution (1986) \u0026ndash; I was of course too young to remember the events\u0026hellip; except for the fact that my favorite cartoons kept getting cancelled for some reason. But what I\u0026rsquo;ve read tells a story of a time of turbulence and despair such that there was no other way for people to regain their individual freedoms than to take to the streets and claim it back. I cannot personally attest to the factuality of the such narrations, since history is of course written by the winners. Hence, I do not presume to compare the current time to the events of twelve years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEDSA 2 (2001) \u0026ndash; Whereas EDSA 1 was an outcry to regain lost freedoms, EDSA 2 was an outcry against corruption. Personally, I did not participate in EDSA 2. Sure, at some point I felt the fever, that wave of indignation rushing through the nation when Erap\u0026rsquo;s goons tried to prevent impeachment, and I _almost _\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewent there. (Of course I didn\u0026rsquo;t on account of being lazy.) But afterwards, I felt not too satisfied with the outcome. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s just because \u003ca href=\"/2008/02/im-lawful-good/\"\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m Lawful Good\u003c/a\u003e, but somehow I was not entirely happy that the institutions established by law (impeachment) failed us and we had to go to the streets again to correct the course of our beleaguered country. But I went with it, I figured that we would learn from this mistake and be more vigilant, and we would never have to do it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFast forward and it\u0026rsquo;s now seven years later. And people are saying that we\u0026rsquo;re back in the same place. Stories of massive corruption abound, witnesses being threatened, media being warned on what they can and cannot cover, massive bribes distributed to lawmakers, et cetera. And apparently, some people want to do it all again. Go back into the streets and demand resignation. Our institutions can no longer be trusted, they say. Impeachment doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, we have no other choice. Another conjugal dictatorship, another midnight cabinet, the control the police and Congress, et cetera. Another revolution. Another shortcut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure how they imagine GMAs forced resignation would help our country. Their plan right now probably looks something like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForce GMA to resign\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e???\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProfit!

And it seems that a large number of citizens are not yet convinced either. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s possible for the current crop of personalities to convince me; I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure what they are offering in exchange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonally, I want our institutions to work. I want change to be effected without having to go out on the streets every time. I want the Senate hearings to push through and conclude, for legislation to be enacted to remove whatever loopholes allow the abuses of the GMA administration. I want charges brought before the courts (surely at the very least Abalos can be charged), and I want the law to take it\u0026rsquo;s course. I want the people to be educated so that we can elect better leaders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have a government for a reason. While citizens have their part to play, we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to go out on the streets to have change. Doing so is an indication of failure not only on the part of the president, but on all our institutions \u0026ndash; the Senate and the courts included.\u003c/p\u003e",

B/u Rogues is fun, the only problem being that your guys are so small (Festercreep really hurts!).

I\u0026rsquo;m talking the types of games that are not easily translatable into digital format and will probably remain so for quite a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne such game is known locally as \u0026ldquo;Killer-killer\u0026rdquo;. Obviously a local name due to the Filipino\u0026rsquo;s penchant for repeating words in a single term, I have no idea if it is known by other names elsewhere or if it exists outside this country at all. (As you can imagine, \u0026ldquo;Killer-killer\u0026rdquo; is not a very easy search term.) For the purposes of posterity, I will record the details of the game here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this game, a group of people sit around in a circular formation, such that each person can easily see each other\u0026rsquo;s face. A good number of participants would be around 6-8, although more can play with a few rules adjustments (we played with around 15 people on the night in question).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach player is given a role, usually written on a scrap of paper and drawn randomly. The players don\u0026rsquo;t know each others\u0026rsquo; roles. The following roles are available in the game:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Killer\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; the titular role obviously. The Killer\u0026rsquo;s objective is to assassinate a particular other role, usually named the \u0026ldquo;Judge\u0026rdquo;. The Killer kills people by winking at them silently, and tries to avoid getting caught by the Police. Other players who notice the Killer winking at them must declare that they have been killed. Once the Killer has killed his mark, the game ends and the killer wins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Judge\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; the assassination mark, his only objective in the game is to stay alive. If the Judge is killed, the Killer wins and the Policeman loses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Police\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; the law, his objective is to catch the Killer, either by catching him red-handed \u0026ldquo;killing\u0026rdquo; someone, or if the Killer attempts to \u0026ldquo;kill\u0026rdquo; the Police, the Police may immediately arrest him. Once the Police catches the Killer, the game ends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Doctor\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; an important role, his objective is to \u0026ldquo;Heal\u0026rdquo; other people who have been \u0026ldquo;killed\u0026rdquo;, by winking at them as well. The person who has been healed usually declares something like \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m alive again!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Victim\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; other players are usually assigned randomly-named roles but have no gameplay significance; their only purpose is to delay the Killer in his hunt for the mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen playing with more people, the game can be balanced by adding more Killers and Policemen as needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game is best played with a group of people who know each other well and are comfortable staring into each other\u0026rsquo;s eyes. It\u0026rsquo;s a game of concentration, bluffing and deception that is probably close to impossible to accurately translate into a digital game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd because I just now noticed that WordPress now allows me to tag posts, I will tag this one with a term I coined just now: \u0026ldquo;meatspace-games\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUpdate 2020!\u003c/strong\u003e I found out there is a \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wink_murder\"\u003eWikipedia entry\u003c/a\u003e about this game!

Something like a cellphone conversation with my brother who\u0026rsquo;s standing in a store in Singapore pressuring me with \u0026ldquo;Well? Should I buy one or not?\u0026rdquo; I don\u0026rsquo;t like pressure, so obviously I just said, \u0026ldquo;Ok, whatever!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inevitable question arises: which one is better, PSP or NDS? A friend asked me if they have different types of games, and I tell her that the NDS has more fun/casual games, while the PSP has more action-oriented stuff. So I guess it really depends on your taste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe NDS is a fun piece of equipment and I had enjoyed it so much I bought a 2nd one when I saw a cheap price, yet lately the PSP has been garnering more attention from me. Two obvious reasons: (a) it\u0026rsquo;s new and (b) \u003cstrong\u003eFinal Fantasy Tactics\u003c/strong\u003e, most likely my favorite game of \u003cstrong\u003eall time\u003c/strong\u003e is available on the PSP with rewritten dialogue, added characters and added battles. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s better than the NDS in the long run is hard to say, as \u003cstrong\u003eAce Attorney 4 \u0026ndash; Apollo Justice\u003c/strong\u003e lies in the short distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, the presence of \u003cstrong\u003eStreet Fighter Alpha 3 Max\u003c/strong\u003e on the PSP, along with the inevitable need to learn \u003cstrong\u003eTekken: Dark Resurrection\u003c/strong\u003e\nso I can beat up the guys at work is a strong incentive to buy a 2nd PSP. But I\u0026rsquo;m not that rich/impulsive. Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the end of the lifetime of the PS2, I had been thinking that I may never again play console-style long games in the vein of \u003cstrong\u003eFinal Fantasy\u003c/strong\u003e, but the PSP can possibly bring me back into that fold. PSX-style games on a handheld is huge, as one of the biggest drawbacks of playing on a console was needing to be stuck in front of a television to play those games. Amusingly, most of the games I have on the PSP now are ports/remakes of Playstation-era (or earlier!) games, which shows my preference for older games. I\u0026rsquo;m not even aware of what other games are available now \u0026ndash; FF Tactics takes up way too much of my mindspace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to go play some more\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

later with the card list. For now, tourney report!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1, game 1: His deck was something like black, red and white. I remember seeing a Shard Volley, Shriekmaw, Eyeblight\u0026rsquo;s Ending, and a Nameless Inversion. Surprisingly, I still manage to get out Drowner + 2 Schoolmaster + Merrow Commerce. The first time I tap the Commerce to mill him, he asks me why I\u0026rsquo;m tapping the enchantment. I keep getting that question for the rest of the day. He reads the cards, and scoops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1, game 2: We both keep six-handers, but mine has a lot more gas. He\u0026rsquo;s stuck on a single mountain and I\u0026rsquo;m attacking with a couple of dorks. He tries to stay alive by saccing his lone land to Shard Volley, but I have the Spellstutter Sprite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe play an extra round for fun, but I still take it with damage, although he did put up more of a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2, game 1: I win by lib-death again. Needed only a single Schoolmaster this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2, game 2: Turn four he plays Boldwyr Heavyweights. I search out and play Guile. He swings for eight. I topdeck Weight of Conscience. He manages to kill Guile (duh\u0026hellip; Final Sting Faerie). I manage to draw him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3, game 1: I overcommit the Drowner and the Schoolmaster + a couple of other guys, and he shows me an Incendiary Command. Feast of Footbottomgives him back some elves and I scoop to damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3, game 2: We race about evenly, but then I swing with five creatures; he thinks he\u0026rsquo;s only taking eight, but I show him the Swell of Courage for the win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3, game 3: My notes tell me I dealt no damage this game. I was basically behind all game, and I was at one when he drew the Incendiary Command again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4, game 1: My opponent asks the players on the adjacent table and ask if I\u0026rsquo;m really allowed to tap it for Drowner. They nod and look at the Drowner, the Schoolmaster and the Commerce and advise him to scoop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4, game 2: I was well in control here, locking down the board with Stonybrook Angler. He used a Warren Pilferers to champion into a Boggart Mob. I brought out Guile. He swings with mob, I figure if Guile blocks, he\u0026rsquo;ll just get back the Mob with Pilferers and recast, wasting his mana. Guile blocks the Mob to kill it. Blunder \u0026ndash; I had forgotten he had a Shriekmaw in the yard, which he promptly gets to dispose of my Incarnation. I lose to the wave of goblins and quickly shuffle up for game 3.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4, game 3: Anticlimactic, as he drew no gas and all lands while I was beating with 2 1/1s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal record: 3-1. Three packs as prize, plus the foil Earwig. Not a bad way to start off Limited this year.\u003c/p\u003e",

No outright bombs or cash rares, but I immediately spot the Drowner of Secrets + Merrow Commerce + 2 Stonybrook Schoolmasters. I had reasonable fliers and permission, so I built the blue-white deck. My only removal being a Weight of Conscience that I did not actually put in the maindeck.\u003c/p\u003e",

That includes the start menu, the panel, the system tray, and icons on the desktop. This isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad thing per se, but I got confused by the icons on the desktop being widgets. They have some widget controls around them that allow me to rotate or remove them from view. I was like \u0026ldquo;Eh? Why would I want to rotate the icons one-by-one? And will clicking this X thing delete the file?\u0026rdquo; And the icons don\u0026rsquo;t have the usual context menu for files. Apparently it\u0026rsquo;s designed so that the icons on the desktop are not treated as files inside a file manager. I realize it\u0026rsquo;s intended to be a completely different paradigm, but it just threw me off.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOccasional slowdown.

What I got from listening to him was that he was just extremely frustrated at how difficult it is to find a good job, so he was looking for people who had gone through similar experiences. He\u0026rsquo;d been unemployed for almost two months after quitting from a crappy job last November.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was going to be late, so I just gave him a few tips that I think could improve his chances of finding a good programming job. I thought I\u0026rsquo;d share them here as well. Note that I\u0026rsquo;m no expert on this or anything, just my opinions.

I understand it\u0026rsquo;s hard on your financial situation, but a lot of people take longer to find work. if you just jump on to the first job you\u0026rsquo;re offered, you\u0026rsquo;re more likely to get a crappy job\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(08:20:28 PHT) Roy: 2. \u0026ldquo;java programmer\u0026rdquo; means that you specialize in java only. unfortunately, the good jobs for programmers all require you to be easily able to learn new stuff (particularly programming languages), as needed. it\u0026rsquo;s alright to try to get your foot in the door using java, but you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t restrict yourself to that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(08:21:52 PHT) Roy: regarding that blog post\u0026hellip; looking back, I\u0026rsquo;m glad that I did not get that job, as it was obviously not the right company for me. you need to figure out what kind of company you want to work for. personally, I prefer working for a company that really does software, instead of a bank or something that just happens to need some in-house programmers\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is 100% true. If you are serious about having a career in software programming, you should avoid working for companies whose primary product is not software. You will get a lot more respect in a dedicated software-development company.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(08:23:40 PHT) Roy: lastly, and this one is a bit harsh: being a programmer is hard. the good companies won\u0026rsquo;t take you in unless you\u0026rsquo;re really smart. make sure you have what it takes. try to improve your problem solving or learning skills in your spare time. try to learn a new language, etc. your background works against you here, as I know for a fact that most of the good software shops prefer to hire from the big 3 (UP, Ateneo, Lasalle)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe bias I mention here is certainly true. In my place of work probably a good 80%-90% of people at least are from the big three. And most of our recruitment drives are geared towards those three schools. I\u0026rsquo;m sure it\u0026rsquo;s the same in all the \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; software shops. Whether this reflects the quality of those schools\u0026rsquo; graduates or just an inherent bias in recruitment, it is a real bias that graduates of other schools have to recognize and work to overcome.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking back at the conversation this morning, I wonder if I did not come off as a bit elitist or something, focusing my advise on looking for \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; companies and all. I can afford to say all this now since I have a good, stable job, but I wonder how it would have felt hearing that advice when you\u0026rsquo;re running out of cash and desperately needed work? I guess I have to say that if you really need to take a crappy job, then take a crappy job. But be aware that it\u0026rsquo;s a crappy job, and figure out how you plan to climb out of it and find something better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;d also like to reiterate that these are just my opinions \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;m certainly no expert on job hunting, having been lucky enough to land a nice job after almost a year of being a bum and lazily submitting resumes. 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eTraveling by land sucks compared to traveling by plane. So for our weekend trip to Albay to visit our new sister-in-law\u0026rsquo;s family, I booked 3 two-way Cebu Pacific tickets for my brothers and myself. Our parents would take the bus since it was slightly cheaper and they didn\u0026rsquo;t mind sleeping on the road. The other reason was that my two brothers had never ridden a plane before \u0026ndash; this would be their first time. First domestic flight for me as well. As expected, they were excited like giddy shoolboys, taking pictures on the way up the plane and leaning towards the window and all that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suppose it was to be expected, but the airport in Legazpi was a far cry from the Manila one. Practically a strip of road labeled as the runway and a small building labeled a terminal. The flight itself was fine but obviously budget. I have been spoiled by PAL. And of course the view of Legazpi City was a lot more green than Metro Manila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, there was Mayon, visible as soon as we descended from the clouds. Unfortunately the peak stayed hidden from us for the entire weekend, maybe another time. Still, Sunday morning we climbed Lignon Hill, which is a lot smaller than Mayon. We were hoping that by the time we finish the 30-minute walk to the top the peak would show itself. No such luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walk upwards was\u0026hellip; invigorating in a way. I have a newfound respect for slopes. The road we were walking on our way to the peak can\u0026rsquo;t have been more than 30 degrees at its most difficult, yet my leg muscles felt dead tired before we were halfway up. Just shows how out of shape I was. The trip down was much faster of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the stay was mostly eating and shopping for \u003cem\u003epasalubong.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, I suck at buying gifts for people so I\u0026rsquo;m glad I had a DS while everyone else was walking around the informal \u003cem\u003etiangge\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur parents dropped us off at the airport in time for the return flight. We checked in and sat down to wait. The rain outside started getting worse, and eventually there was a message that our flight is canceled. Boo! After asking around, I was told I\u0026rsquo;d get a full refund for the round trip flight. (So we got to fly to Albay for free) I called up my parents and asked them to get us bus tickets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I mentioned at the start, traveling by land sucks. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to sleep, and I\u0026rsquo;m prone to motion-sickness on extended bus trips. Still, we made it back to Manila alive and well. I had a bit of a headache and some of the aforementioned nausea and hardly any sleep, as I expected\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",
