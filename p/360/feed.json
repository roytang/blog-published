Hong Kong is not a particularly exciting place for me as I\u0026rsquo;m not the sort of person who totally enjoys being either a tourist or a shopper, which are the usual reasons why people come to HK.

Also, the place we are staying at now has free high-speed wi-fi internet connection, and I was able to borrow a laptop for my use during weekends, so I can goof off on the internet whenever I get bored.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eMost of the time, my work involves mostly run-of-the-mill information management systems. Lately however, I\u0026rsquo;ve been asked to look into some new tech, and that got me interested in what\u0026rsquo;s called Rich Internet Applications (RIAs for short). The primary platform for RIAs is Flash, which apparently is already owned by Adobe and Macromedia is no more. Yeah, I never really paid attention to Flash, like most people I assumed it was only for making amusing movies and annoying ads. Also, Flash has always been a tool oriented towards people who are more design-oriented, not engineers or programmers like me. I mean, I load up Flash 8 and I have no idea how to do anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLately however, Adobe has released a product called Flex, which is basically a programming API for generating SWF files using XML and the Flash scripting language, ActionScript. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty cool, and I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a few really nice demos of web applications done using Flash, some of which I highlighted in \u003ca href=\"http://roytang.net/blog/2007/07/links-for-2007-07-28/\"\u003erecent links\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried out Flex for a few days, and really it is SO AWESOME. There are some UI stuff that you can do that would be ridiculously difficult with traditional HTML/Javascript and those things are so easy using Flex. (Just one caveat: some of the demos I\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far are quite the resource hogs\u0026hellip; )\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe real power of Flex is the fact that it generates files that run on Flash Player, one of the most ubiquitous platforms on the web. I\u0026rsquo;m betting that Flash Player has a larger install base than Internet Explorer. So it\u0026rsquo;s really hard to compete with Flash as a web platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop people from trying however. Lately, Microsoft announced \u003ca href=\"http://silverlight.net\"\u003eSilverlight\u003c/a\u003e, a .NET-based RIA SDK of some sort. The screenshots seem to denote that it can do really cool things as well. Gee, it would be nice if I could experience it directly, but here\u0026rsquo;s what I got when I tried to install the runtime:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#686eed3e2f219a4486e95157ebe664a8-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2007/07/rich-internet-applications/screenshot_hu41cf75f6e18db1b222206f4c6b61dff3_20498_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"686eed3e2f219a4486e95157ebe664a8-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2007/07/rich-internet-applications/screenshot.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"28 Jul 2007 8:50pm\"\u003e28 Jul 2007 8:50pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGee, way to challenge Flash: make it difficult to install the runtime. I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure if I really don\u0026rsquo;t have Admin privileges on this machine, and you know what? I don\u0026rsquo;t care about Silverlight enough to find out.

Flex opens up that platform to any developer with decent programming knowledge. Will this change the face of the internets? We\u0026rsquo;ll see\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA friend of mine, let\u0026rsquo;s call her \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo;, was waiting for a taxi near her home. There were several other people there waiting for taxis but she had been there first. She finally managed to hail a cab and had already gotten in the back seat when an MMDA traffic guy \n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnotebase-1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e\n stopped her and told her that he had hailed that taxi for two women nearby that he pointed to. C said she was the one who had hailed the taxi, but the traffic guy politely but firmly insisted that she get out of the car. Indignant, C took note of the traffic guy\u0026rsquo;s name plate and went on her way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as she got to the office, C composed a letter of complaint to the MMDA director and faxed it to their office as soon as she was able. Having coursed her complaint through several different offices, it was promptly handled and a hearing with the traffic guy was scheduled during the next week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC and I talked about it several times during the week before her hearing. She had asked me before sending the complaint whether it was a good idea or not, or if she should just let the incident go. I said no, she should proceed with her complaint. The traffic guy was clearly in the wrong, and she at least deserved an explanation regarding whether or not MMDA traffic guys are allowed to hassle people who are getting into taxis. Some people were worried that the traffic guy might be vindictive and might try to get back at her in some way. C is a pretty strong and brave woman though, and she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t back down even if that was a likely possibility. What did concern her was whether her complaint might cause someone to lose their job. I told her not to worry, at worst he\u0026rsquo;ll be asked to apologize and explain, and that will be that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day of the hearing arrived, I wanted to go with her to the MMDA office since I was curious how things would proceed, but I had a meeting an hour or so afterwards and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to risk being late, and besides she already had her boyfriend with her for support. I\u0026rsquo;m told that the traffic guy made some lame excuse that there was some sort of emergency and that\u0026rsquo;s why the two women needed the taxi. But he apologized to C anyway and promised to be more circumspect in the future. C got a written apology and came away satisfied, having fought city hall and won, sort of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe asked me if I think she wasted her time. I told her that what she did was a good thing; every so often someone has to complain against people who may or may not be abusing their position, if only to keep such people honest. And she got to witness firsthand how the government handles things, if ever she gets into a more serious situation with the government later on, she has this experience to draw upon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy take? I\u0026rsquo;m guessing the two women were friends/acquaintances of the traffic guy and they were impatient to get a cab. In true macho Filipino fashion, traffic guy offers to help them out. And that would have been fine, really. That is, until he started harassing another commuter to get it done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m glad I wasn\u0026rsquo;t there at the hearing though. If I had heard that lame excuse I might have done my best Phoenix Wright impression and shout \u0026ldquo;Objection!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The first one with the Mishra deck (Flores\u0026rsquo; Legends of Team CMU) to a disappointing 4-3 finish in a sea of Angelfire, Solar Flare and Gruul. Disappointed with the decks performance, I took a look at the result of Australian Nationals that same weekend, and decided to play the Rakdos \u0026ldquo;Satanic Sligh\u0026rdquo; build that had won that event in today\u0026rsquo;s qualifier, which was incidentally the last one I could play given my schedule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I wasn\u0026rsquo;t the only one thinking that, as of course I failed to predict how th metagame would shift. There were a lot more burn decks this time around, and my first two matches were among them. I split the first two for a disappointing start, then lost rounds four and five in quick succession. Frustrated at my inability to play the format and the terrible 2-3 record, I ticked \u0026ldquo;Drop\u0026rdquo; in the Result Slip and went home quite a bit sleepy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo ends this year\u0026rsquo;s quest for Nationals.

Sadly, my best constructed finish this year was actually \u003ca href=\"http://roytang.net/magic/2007/07/ptq-valencia-2007-06-30-ng-galleria/\"\u003ein Block\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, I need a break.

Helluva lot of people there, more than I was expecting for a Core Set Release tournament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe format is, as usual, Sealed Deck with four rounds of Swiss pairings. Players were grouped in Flights of 32 people each (previous prerelease tournaments had 48-people flights), each win gets you an Xth booster pack and the top 2 of each flight (the ones who went 4-0) get something extra. Apparently the extra prizes were stuff like a bag, a shirt and a big (cardboard) Kamahl card box. I of course got the crappy box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I went 4-0. I\u0026rsquo;m not too surprised. Since a release tournament is more \u0026ldquo;casual\u0026rdquo;, the competition is not very fierce. Usually things get tricky in the last two rounds. Anyway, I won all 4 rounds, not even giving up a game loss. My sealed pool was awesome, lots of removal and acceleration. Beacon of Destruction and Mobilization are bomb rares, with Cone of Flame and Overrun as bomb uncommons. Awesome deck, good on tempo and usually giving quick wins (gave me time for lunch)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the Sealed portion (and assembling my crappy box), I was in a fighting mood so I signed up for an 8-man draft. This was more serious competition, and the prize for the top 2 places was an additional promo foil Reya Dawnbringer (and a couple of packs). I won the first match 2-0, got my first game loss in game one of match 2 won two games in a row to make the top 2. Yay!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe art for Reya Dawnbringer is quite the awesomeness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal record: 6-0-1 matches for the day. 12-1 games. Not bad at all.

mostly because I put together the deck two days before the tournament with only 3 games of practice against a standard Dralnu deck. I was still too stupid to know I should leave an island open when playing a Shapeshifter face down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the quarterfinals loss, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t think fo any play mistakes. However, my sideboard was stupid. All I could bring in were some Penumbra Spiders. I have some ideas for sideboard changes should I be able to play Block again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deck is solid, with game against both aggro and control. My decklist is \u003ca href=\"http://www.roytang.net/wiki/index.php/UG_Shifters\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s actually a modification of the \u003ca href=\"http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/mf152\"\u003eTop 8 Shifters deck from GP Montreal\u003c/a\u003e. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any Vensers, so I tossed in random stuff like Psionic Blasts and Call of the Herds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCard-specific notes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThelonite Hermit is pretty awesome, allowing you to win out of nowhere with 8 additional surprise damagae (24 if you have a shifter)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVesuvan Shapeshifter + Llanowar Reborn is awesome tech. A grafted shifter beats most other things in combat. I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to take down Calciderms and Spectral Forces without losing my shifter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLlanowar Reborn may be the best or 2nd best of the uncommon FS lands.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWillbender is awesome in the GW Goyf matchup \u0026ndash; mostly because their removal (Temporal Isolation/Bound in Silence) is so effective on their own creatures. And their Griffin Guide is so nice on mine.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDraining Whelk is stupid here. I think it should be in the board, coming in against RG mana ramp decks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, yeah I scrubbed out in the quarterfinals. At that point I was really tired and just wanted to go home. My deck also annoyed me in the last game. I cast all 3 foresees trying to find and answer to an 8/9 flying Tarmagoyf but I didn\u0026rsquo;t find any. I picked up my prize for the top eight finish (seven packs)\u0026hellip; I was a bit disappointed as well since I fought through so many rounds and only got seven packs, I was hoping maybe 10-12. Well, I\u0026rsquo;ve never had a top 8 finish before so maybe I was expecting more stuff :p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn my way home I was thinking about quitting Magic. I started to play \u0026ldquo;seriously\u0026rdquo; about a year ago, and all I have to show for it so far was a PTQ top 8. Playing Magic is so fucking hard. Let me rephrase: playing Magic is easy. Being good at Magic is so fucking hard. You need to pay attention to everything, you need to have the best deck, you need to know how to sideboard in all the matchups. At some point it stops being fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s going to become harder since most of the guys I grew up playing the game with are either no longer playing or out of the country. And I\u0026rsquo;m too cheap to pay for more stuff on MTGO. Many of the Magic players in the office have migrated to playing WoW CCG.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAm I going to quit? Am I burned out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNah, that was just the tiredness talking. Magic is fun, despite the competitive pressure. I just need to be able to reconcile two things: \u003cstrong\u003eI have to be the best\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eI can\u0026rsquo;t lose sight of the fun.\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, it\u0026rsquo;s fun to win, so that makes it a bit easier. It\u0026rsquo;s fun to have a face-down Willbender in play when your opponent\u0026rsquo;s Ancestral Vision is about to resolve. It\u0026rsquo;s fun to beat down using your opponent\u0026rsquo;s Griffin Guides. It\u0026rsquo;s fun to come back from one life to win the game. It\u0026rsquo;s fun to win, and it\u0026rsquo;s also fun to play. And playing against some of the best players in the country, I\u0026rsquo;m almost there. Am I good enough yet? We\u0026rsquo;ll see soon enough\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit: Oh noes! \u003ca href=\"http://www.neutralgrounds.net/results_contents.php?id=7\"\u003eMy picture is on the internets\u003c/a\u003e!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit 2020: Above dead link \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070712144753/http://www.neutralgrounds.net/results_contents.php?id=7\"\u003erecovered from archive.org\u003c/a\u003e.

I guess I should have mulliganned the 2nd game when I didn\u0026rsquo;t have either a Crypt or the Leyline, as I died to 20+ zombies on turn 4.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2: Game 1, I went down to 1 he had four racks down and I had three cards in hand. Over the next few turns I brought him down to zero from eighteen while at that precarious state. \u003ca href=\"http://www.down-to-one.com\"\u003ewww.down-to-one.com\u003c/a\u003e. Game 2 went fast for him, taking me out with fast discard. Game 3 sees him keep a one-lander. I transmute for Persecute and name black, obviously. Mishra and Korlash walk across and end the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3: This deck is very good against aggro. At least the normal Gruul aggro that has like 33% creatures and 33% burn. My opponent here was more like 50% burn. Four Tendrils simply can\u0026rsquo;t keep up. His deck is an autoloss to Paladin en-Vec + Worship, but it has game over mine. I made a play mistake here in that while I was getting trounced in Game 2, I showed him Korlash (which didn\u0026rsquo;t show in game 1) in a desperate move to stave off the loss. I lost anyway, and now knowing that I had the Korlash, he boarded in Dead/Gones to handle him in game 3. In the 3rd game, I actually had a naked Cloister on the board for four turns, hoping to draw a Tendrils \u0026ndash; I had not drawn any of the four yet at that point. I drew eight cards over four turns from a library of maybe forty cards and didn\u0026rsquo;t see a single Tendrils. :(\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: He went first, playing Ication Javilineers. I yawned inside. Easy match. I was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5: We were 5 turns into game 1 and I hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen any Lotus Blooms so I was thinking it was some sort of R/U counterburn, and held back on the Rise / Fall until I knew what was going on. Then I died. Game 2, I had the Rise / Fall on turn 2. But I was thinking, \u0026ldquo;Gee, I don\u0026rsquo;t wanna waste it and hit lands, I\u0026rsquo;ll wait for him to play a couple more lands.\u0026rdquo; Then I lost. Stupid, stupid, stupid play against what should have been a favorable matchup. In my defense, I was really tired and pissed-off at my 2-2 (now 2-3) record. Yeah, bad excuse. Must\u0026hellip; stay\u0026hellip; in\u0026hellip; top\u0026hellip; mental\u0026hellip; form\u0026hellip; (and think about adding Stupors to the board).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6: Most people need to read the Epochrasite when I play it, so I was surprised when the guy just went \u0026ldquo;Ok\u0026rdquo; after I played mine on turn 2. it turns out he had some of his own. He had a few Tombstalkers as well, but no Korlash in sight. Easy win once I got out a pair of Cloisters to stop the discard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 7: Blowout. Sorry if he reads this, but his deck isn\u0026rsquo;t very good. I get to four Epochrasites early in the first game, then back it up with Arrows to take out the rebels. Game 2 was fun, with me at 2 life and no blockers, he swings with a Phyrexian Totem. Tendrils for 9. Ouch, your board is wiped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 8: Again, blowout. The matchup is pretty much as Flores describes it, block with Epoc during early turns, trade one of your legends for card advantage, then climb back quickly with either Korlash or Mishra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal record: 5-3, finishing 42nd. Despite my game win ratio, I had the worst tiebreaks of all 5-3s (since I climbed back from a 2-3 deficit). At least it was better than my disastrous 1-4-drop Regionals record \u003ca href=\"http://roytang.net/magic/2006/06/magic-regionals-2006/\"\u003elast year\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandom mistakes I made:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTapping Academy Ruins for mana when I should\u0026rsquo;ve used it to get back Chromatic Stars (Mishra was in play)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePlaying a Graven Cairns first turn when I had a shockland\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNot being aggressive enough against Dragonstorm\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRandom boarding mistakes \u0026ndash; I need to keep better track of my sideboard.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn playing net decks: This was the first time I had brought to a tournament a deck that someone else built. Maybe I was growing up. :p Despite my love of being a rogue deckbuilder, I have to admit I haven\u0026rsquo;t been really successful at it. I realize now that one way to get better is to play some well-designed decks that other people have built so I can learn from their design. I was already playing a Korlash deck prior to this, and had heard of variants that splash blue for various reasons. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think I would have ever been able to think of this current design \u0026ndash; the deck is just crazy. It plays very solidly and randomly gets blowout draws. I will probably play it for at least one more tournament and hope that I actually play a lot better than I did today.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Probably due to the fact that I actually went to work before going to the tournament (which meant I had a lot less sleep\u0026hellip; ), I made too many bad plays in the first two losses. There\u0026rsquo;s an \u003ca href=\"http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/academy/41\"\u003earticle today\u003c/a\u003e on magicthegathering.com about how you should avoid racing aggro and avoid taking damage as much as possible\u0026hellip; I think I basically violated every single principle in that article during those losing matches. Yes, even the lone control matchup \u0026ndash; I didn\u0026rsquo;t kill a Hellkite thinking I would just race it with Korlash, but the Bust on his turn sealed my fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe GW aggro loss hurt \u0026ndash; I lost the last game because I was at three, he had a Saffi, all I had was a 9/9 Korlash with a Temporal Isolation on it and I didn\u0026rsquo;t notice my opponent had a Vitu-ghazi and I thought I could survive one more turn with one life. If I had just taken out his Saffi with the Demonfire I had in hand instead of waiting to burn him to 0\u0026hellip; I would have drawn a House Guard next turn, transmute for Tendrils, swing with Korlash, stack damage and cast Tendrils on Korlash for an 18-point life swing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe round 6 loss really broke my spirit, I was in such a bad mental state that I played badly in the round 7 zoo matchup. Not that having perfectly tight play would have helped \u0026ndash; he had the zoo god draws both games, I was down to eight before I even had Damnation mana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLessons learned:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNever, ever try to race with damage. I may have bigger beats, but I\u0026rsquo;m usually behind on life. I should always take out threats until I can stabilize with Tendrils.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI need to become mentally stronger, so that play mistakes from previous losses don\u0026rsquo;t affect succeeding games.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing as how the local metagame is maybe 60-70% aggro, I\u0026rsquo;ll also probably tweak the deck to make the maindeck stronger against aggro and move some of the control hate to the board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext stop: Regionals.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I opened a card pool with no outstanding rares. The only real bomb was the red uncommon Pyrohemia. Spotting the Deep-Sea Kraken and wanting to play it, I decided to go red-blue. I tested the build for a few minutes before realizing it completely stunk and had very few creatures. I looked over the card pool and quickly realized I had overlooked some quality green fatties: Nacatl War-Pride, Durkwood Baloth, Sporesower Thallid, etc. During the last minute of deck-building, I switched to a red/green build with a rather nice curve that proved quite solid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went 5-1 in the first six rounds, always hovering near the top tables. Also took down quite a few of the top limited players in the country. Not too shabby for a deck built in under a minute! For the seventh and last round, my opponent asked for the win since I was guaranteed top eight status already. After some negotiation, he agreed to split his prizes with me after I conceded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo my finish was a respectable 5-2, but with some pretty good wins and quite a number of packs taken home. Nacatl War-Pride is quite good in sealed (dunno in draft), it\u0026rsquo;s practically a \u0026ldquo;must-kill\u0026rdquo; creature. Pyrohemia is a true bomb, as it turned the game around for me more than once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love playing Limited Magic, much more so than Constructed, despite the fact it feels more expensive (I\u0026rsquo;m still not sure whether it actually \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e more expensive) Constructed Magic is fun, but I prefer not having to worry about metagames. Coming to a tournament bringing nothing but your deckbuilding and playing skills, opening your packs, building your deck and slugging it out — there\u0026rsquo;s no better way to play Magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Jonah Jameson is funny as always. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to take Topher Grace seriously when I keep thinking of him as Eric Foreman.

The ending is a bit lame though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t think I made any spoilers.
