Even if your reason is something as simple as \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t decide\u0026rdquo;, that\u0026rsquo;s fine, your abstention still has meaning since it indicates that you consider none of the candidates outstanding enough to support\u003c/p\u003e\n",

There is (in my opinion) at least one worthy candidate in the VP slot, and your vote could help some of the more worthy senators get past the cringe-worthy ones in the bottom half (sadly, I think we\u0026rsquo;re going to have to live with another term of Senator Sotto)\u003c/p\u003e\n",
