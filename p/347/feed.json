Paolo Santos carried Magasin surprisingly well, and Superproxy was just the right track for Francis M. Radioactive Sago\u0026rsquo;s Alcohol is hilarious, and I like the way Orange and Lemons mixed a little bit of Julie Tearjerky and Tikman in Huwag Kang Matakot. I also think I actually like Cueshé\u0026rsquo;s version of Hard To Believe better than the original. My least favorite track on the album is Kitchie Nadal\u0026rsquo;s Ligaya, (cute laugh on the \u0026ldquo;inaahit\u0026rdquo; bit notwithstanding) as I really prefer the more upbeat original.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish more bands had contributed to the effort though, as the ‘heads probably deserve it. According to my brother, the participating artists were all from the same recording studio (I don\u0026rsquo;t really pay attention to studios, so yeah I\u0026rsquo;ll just agree here.) Still, it would\u0026rsquo;ve been nice to hear some renditions from ‘heads contemporaries like Rivermaya and Parokya ni Edgar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, awesome album. If you have listened to the Eraserheads music at one time or another, go find a way to get it.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I\u0026rsquo;m in a pretty good place right now I guess, compared to a majority of people in this country. I\u0026rsquo;ve got a good job with a more than decent salary that lets me consume the mythical three-square-meals-a-day and pile on a bit of luxury on top of that.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut sometimes you stop and think to yourself, is this all there is to life? Slaving away as some company\u0026rsquo;s employee, getting promotions and raises, then retiring to watch your kids grow up? Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, I love my job and the company I work for is great, very responsive to its employees. And I\u0026rsquo;m sure retiring and raising kids is a worthy goal for some people. But I highly doubt I\u0026rsquo;m that sort of person.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI get antsy sometimes, I often tell some people at work that I think of resigning at least once a week. The thing is, I don\u0026rsquo;t really know where to go or what to do if I resigned. All I know is at some point I would like to be doing something else with my life, something other than a regular nine-to-five (well in my case more of eight-to-seven) job, something that leaves a mark on the world. \u003cspan style=\"font-style:italic;\"\u003eStand tall and shake the heavens\u003c/span\u003e, I always like to say to myself.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMy biggest problem right now is fear - fear of burning bridges. There was this awesome article somewhere by this shareware guy about how to start your own indie business (I\u0026rsquo;ll credit him sometime when I remember), and I remember one of the things he said that struck me the most: Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to burn bridges.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut I am afraid, and with good reason. Like I said, I\u0026rsquo;ve got a good job, it\u0026rsquo;s decent pay and I even enjoy the work a good percentage of the time. And of course, I\u0026rsquo;m also providing \u003ca href=\"http://clair.pinoyweb.net/?p=467\"\u003efinancial support for the rest of the family\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt becomes more frightening when I take into consideration what my passions are. The main ones right now are: gaming and web development. Taken together, it points in one direction: I should work on a web-based game. But the size of this task at this point is too huge for me to imagine, and the risks far too obvious. It would be very hard and it may take years to turn a profit, I would need some considerable financial base before doing this. And I would also need an idea of what game to do\u0026hellip;\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe second problem is focus. I lack focus. This I\u0026rsquo;ve known for a long time. Even if I decide on one course of action, I\u0026rsquo;m never sure that I would have the will to carry it on until the end. I can have focus and determination in the short term, i.e. a task that takes a week or so I can easily focus on. But the sort of life-changing ambitions I\u0026rsquo;m considering right now can\u0026rsquo;t be done in a week, and I fear that I will run out of steam half-way through and all will be for naught.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI need to overcome these problems. I need to overcome fear. Well, now that I think about it, it would be far easier to overcome fear if I knew that I had focus and determination.

I haven\u0026rsquo;t yet had the benefit of a weekend - I spent most of Saturday through Wednesday in the office. Yesterday, I was able to negotiate that I be allowed to take today (Thursday) off; Seeing as how Nov. 4 was also an RP holiday (celebrating the end of Ramadan) and they were asking me to come in anyway, they gladly agreed to swap my holiday.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnyway, the project I was working on at least proved to be slightly interesting. It was a popular open-source ERP software that we were customizing for the client. Now, I\u0026rsquo;ve never delved far into open source code before (although I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted do), so I daresay I hope the quality of other open-source code out there is at least better than this one. It may be a popular open-source business package, but the codebase seemed incredibly messy to me, and hard to pickup without having to go through traces and stuff.

Any nontrivial software system should have some sort of journalling scheme involved, as printlogging is usually part and parcel of the development process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, I would wish that life too had a journalling system, one more reliable and less arcane than that gift humans call memory. I sometimes have trouble remembering what I had for breakfast this morning. Okay, that\u0026rsquo;s a lie, I seldom forget about meals less than a week old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I do have a tendency to forget other things. Tasks to do, people I\u0026rsquo;ve met, appointments I\u0026rsquo;ve set. A Saturday or so (I forget when), I had set a training meeting at 10am. Of course, my job does not require me to be in the office before noon on Saturdays, so I conveniently forgot about the meeting while playing \u003ca href=\"http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/\"\u003eWorld of Warcraft\u003c/a\u003e, recalling such appointment only while taking a bath at 10:30am. (Luckily they didn\u0026rsquo;t mide me re-scheding to 11:30)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, frail as our memories are, we resort to other things to keep us on track. Paper, notebooks, to-do-lists, organizers, calendars, cellphones, PDAs, sticky notes and every so often, the proverbial rubber-band-around-the-finger. (Yes, I have done that, and yes I did forget what the rubber band stood for.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlogging, is of course, one of those outlets, one of those forms of introspection so commonplace on the web nowadays. I started quite some time ago, on another server, and have kept up, a bit sporadically if I might add. I\u0026rsquo;ve never been entirely too sure of my own reasons for blogging. Some parts ego, some parts experimentation, some parts therapy, perhaps some part exhibitionism? In any case, though I have considered several times to abandon this practice, especially when I have been too lazy to pursue it for months on end, I find myself giving it another go eventually. Because life should have an audit trail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShall I offer some excuse of why I have been so long without an entry? Some vague representations of WoW addiction, business at work or general laziness? I just did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, our story continues\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to be trying to get a phone. People have been harassing me for years about the fact that I don\u0026rsquo;t have a phone.

If there\u0026rsquo;s any better way or better place to look for the info than the way I describe here, tell me about it. 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, to find out what are the available phones and their features, I check the website of one of the major providers to see what handsets they list, since supposedly this tells me what models are available locally. FYI, I chose to use \u003ca href=\"http://www.smart.com.ph/SMART/Catalog/Handsets/\"\u003eSmart\u0026rsquo;s website\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, this helps me find phones which have features I like. But the Smart website only gives me prices offered by Smart when the phone is tied to one of their plans. Let\u0026rsquo;s assume I want a bit more flexibility and don\u0026rsquo;t want to be tied to the plan. I have no idea where to check the prices though, so I hit two auction sites instead: \u003ca href=\"http://ebili.com\"\u003eebili\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://bidshot.com\"\u003ebidshot\u003c/a\u003e, so I can get some idea what people are willing to pay for these models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEasy enough right? Check the features, cross-check the prices, choose a phone. Some notes on these websites:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmart: Why the hell is the list of phones not sorted in any logical order? None that I can see anyway. When I see a cheap, er, reasonably-priced phone on the auction sites, I want to check the features of that phone on the Smart website but it takes me a while to find it. Some sort of search feature would have been nice. (Or maybe there is one and I missed it?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEbili/Bidshot: Why the hell is the search result list not sortable in any way? If you have a grid of search results, I don\u0026rsquo;t see how difficult it is to implement sortable columns; every single webapp I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on has this feature! I was almost tempted to send them an email offering my services as a freelancer to implement reasonable searching features such as sorting and filtering. These are NOT difficult things to implement, I don\u0026rsquo;t know why we don\u0026rsquo;t see them in all websites; I can understand the performance concern if you\u0026rsquo;re potentially returning millions of hits (i.e. Google), but these searches have hits ranging in dozens, sorting performance hit should be minimal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is all, just wanted to rant.

And lo, I was lucky enough to find a copy of the fifth book of Stephen King\u0026rsquo;s epic western fantasy, The Dark Tower. It was a huge book, larger than my copies of the first four, but with the same cover style and by the same publisher, so it was the copy I wanted. I spent less than a hundred pesos on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so it was that I once again journeyed into the world/s of the Dark Tower, following the path of Roland of Gilead and his ka-tet of gunslingers along the path of the Beam, heading inexporably towards the Dark Tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark Tower series has always been a weird sort of hybrid. Primarily a western, set in a fantasy multiverse which intersects with multiple versions of our own reality, Roland and his posse find themselves facing robots, bears, wizards, psychotic trains, undead and such. This time they face \u0026ldquo;Wolves\u0026rdquo;, an unknown new enemy who plague a farming community along the path of the Beam. Like any good RPG-party, the gunslingers decide to offer aid to the people of the Calla, though not all would accept their help. In exchange, they are granted the power to travel back to New York, the nexus of all New Yorks, where they must protect the Rose, an incarnation or manifestation of the Dark Tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one thing I did not like about this copy: It had illustrations. Normally, that would be a good thing, but I find I did not really want to know what Roland of Gilead looked like, even to another person, as it spoiled my own vision of what the book tells me. That\u0026rsquo;s how good the series is — it\u0026rsquo;s the type of series where you form your own version of it in your head and you are completely drawn into its saga.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs always, the book is dark and compelling. Despite the hectic work schedule last week, I finish the thick book in less than four days, and the volume ends in cliffhanger, as the ka-tet is broken. Two more books to go before the end of their quest; I can only hope the last two come out in my preferred format soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
