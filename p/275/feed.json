I had actually seen Green Lantern first despite X1C showing two weeks before the DC movie. It\u0026rsquo;s a good time to be a comic book fan with all these comic book movies coming out; I saw Thor a couple of months ago and of course we still have Captain America to look forward to next year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt some level though I\u0026rsquo;ve started thinking that being a big comic book fan is actually a bit of a handicap when watching these big Hollywood adaptations of our favorite spandex-clad heroes, if only because we cringe twice at much at every small fault or piece of bad writing that we find in these movies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI may have subconsciously delayed watching X1C because one of my brothers had watched it while I was in Singapore and didn\u0026rsquo;t really give the gushing review \u0026ldquo;regular\u0026rdquo; people had given. And GL wasn\u0026rsquo;t getting such rave reviews on opening weekend either and there were rumors that even the studio was not confident in the movie. So I came into both movies with a bit of lowered expectations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy quick reviews of the two movies first then: X1C was fun and it was nice seeing an entirely new crew of mutants (more or less). I can forgive the ridiculous recruitment and training montages (and lol\u0026rsquo;ed at the cameo). It looks they didn\u0026rsquo;t bother keeping in continuity with the first trilogy and Wolverine: Origins, which is fine since Wolverine: Origins was ridiculous anyway. The ending felt a bit contrived in the same way that the ending of Smallville and Wolverine: Origins did \u0026ndash; mainly because they need to wrap up things to sync with whatever \u0026ldquo;continuity\u0026rdquo; they\u0026rsquo;re supposed to have. The movie feels a bit campy at times and it\u0026rsquo;s far from the \u0026ldquo;Dark Knight of X-Men\u0026rdquo; that some reviews made it out to be, but still a good watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreen Lantern was fun as well, though the writing left a bit to be desired for me. At some points the abrupt transitions and especially the poor portrayal of Carol Ferris reminded me of Smallville-quality writing at some point. It\u0026rsquo;s still a good movie to watch and the scale is definitely more epic than X1C, but it kind of left me hanging the same way Thor did: it\u0026rsquo;s like there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much that happened in the movie aside from the telling of the origin story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I was just spoiled by Nolan, but Batman Begins set a new height for me in terms of superhero origin movies, and the latest set have yet to reach that bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of Batman I\u0026rsquo;ve also just finished watching the DC straight to video animated feature \u0026ldquo;Under the Red Hood\u0026rdquo; which covers the death and resurrection of Jason Todd (duh, spoilers) and to be honest I found the climactic scene more well-written than the above two movies. But then again Under the Red Hood follows the comic book story arc more closely so I guess it\u0026rsquo;s closer to the type of stories I enjoy on a regular basis. In fact I find that the DC animated film line to be pretty good; not something I\u0026rsquo;d watch in a cinema or anything but enjoyable enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is just really more or less random ramblings about comic books and comic book movies so here\u0026rsquo;s something else I thought of while watching X1C: the problem with the character of Magneto or in general any character whose origin story or background is tied to a real-life historical event the same way Magneto\u0026rsquo;s is tied to the holocaust. See the problem is that comic book characters live in some sort of time-distorting reality bubble where they don\u0026rsquo;t grow old as fast as the readers do. Characters like Magneto however, have no choice but to grow old at the regular rate, since we cannot move the historical dates upon which their characters are based. In twenty to thirty years, Magneto will be a hundred years old regardless of what happens in X-Men continuity. How will they make X-Men movies then, will they have a hundred year-old Ian McKellen take the role? With the character of Magneto anchored in time, the fictional world of the X-Men remains tied to a particular era. They\u0026rsquo;ll probably come up with some handwaved solution about how his powers include not aging; or maybe they\u0026rsquo;ll take a bold leap and actually kill him off permanently (hey, they haven\u0026rsquo;t brought back Jean Grey for a while right?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a side note, the first character that I ever noticed had this problem was Bab from Pugad Baboy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway maybe that\u0026rsquo;s enough rambling for now. Looking forward to Captain America, Transformers 3, etc, etc. Despite my not being 100% satisfied with the current wave of superhero movies, it\u0026rsquo;s still a good time to be a comic book fan. 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",

playtesting time I had aside from a few random casual games the Friday before the GP. Oh well, we go with what we have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 1\u003c/strong\u003e I played versus another Filipino who was visiting Singapore from Malaysia. Apparently he had just come in this morning via bus and was running on only a couple of hours sleep. That didn\u0026rsquo;t stop him from wrecking me game one with a \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Phyrexian%20Obliterator\" target=\"_new\"\u003ePhyrexian Obliterator\u003c/a\u003e bearing a \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Lashwrithe\" target=\"_new\"\u003eLashwrithe\u003c/a\u003e. Yup, he was playing Monoblack control. I had actually mulliganned to five and he tore my hand apart with pinpoint discard before that Obliterator took me down in two swings. For game two I brought in Celestial Purges and Divine Offerings, taking out Mana Leaks and the Jace Beleren. I easily won game two off a Mirran Crusader that got his War and Peace on. Game three started off poorly for me as this time I mulled to four, keeping a one lander. Luckily I drew into what I needed and he was drawing mostly land. I managed to play a Hawk (refilling my hand) before he played a surprise sideboarded \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Torpor%20Orb\" target=\"_new\"\u003eTorpor Orb\u003c/a\u003e cutting me off from my equipment. He played a couple of creatures \u0026ndash; an Obliterator and a \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Vampire%20Nighthawk\" target=\"_new\"\u003eVampire Nighthawk\u003c/a\u003e before I managed to land a Jace that eventually allowed me to stabilize. By this time however, most of my creatures were out, though I well had the game under control. So I just proceeded to fateseal him every turn and finish him off with Jace\u0026rsquo;s ultimate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1-0 matches, 2-1 games\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 2\u003c/strong\u003e My round 2 opponent was\u0026hellip; er, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. He was definitely Singaporean and I think he was playing either Darkblade or Cawblade. But I did win, in 3 games!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2-0 matches 4-2 games\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 3\u003c/strong\u003e My round 3 opponent was definitely Caw Blade, and was another Filipino who was working in Singapore. He seemed even more inexperienced with the deck than I was though, as I saw when we had some exchanges like me blocking his Batterskull that had a Feast and Famine with my Hawk that had a Batterskull and Feast and Famine. Nevermind the fact that I had more toughness, he hadn\u0026rsquo;t even realized I had protection from his germ token. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the other details well, but I won in 3 games again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3-0 matches, 6-3 games\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the start of Round 4 they called the first feature match: Owen Turtenwald vs Steven Tan. I kind of did a double take when I heard the Steven Tan part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 4\u003c/strong\u003e My opponent was Singaporean, and he lead with forest into Birds of Paradise. I thought he was some sort of RUG but turns out he was straight RG Valakut. The matchup is as easy as I had read, since he has so few creatures to help him establish control and very little in the way of spot removal. A Mirran Crusader bearing War and Peace was enough to win game one. In game two he hesitated before keeping his hand after he had mulliganned to five and I decided to be merciless and give him the Eye of the Tiger (TM). He played turn two Explore and I answered with Spell Pierce. Turn 3 Cobra and I answered with Flashfreeze. Turn 4 Explore (still stuck on three lands) and I had the second Spell Pierce. By this time I had solid control and he would never be able to recover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4-0 matches, 8-3 games\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was feeling great at this point, but was well aware that by now I was in danger of running into pros, and my record against pros is not surprisingly quite bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 5\u003c/strong\u003e I actually thought I was paired against fffreak himself Brad Nelson, but it turns out it was a guy named Brandom Nelson. He was a scrawny American (reminded me somehow of Reid from Criminal Minds), so I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if he was related to Brad Nelson. I later found out he was actually fffreakslittlebro hence the name similarity and that they are step brothers or half brothers or something hence the difference in appearance. He was bringing Caw Blade as well, and the difference of playtesting showed up here quite easily. He played quickly; as soon as I had played a turn 2 Hawk he would ask me how many I was getting and would proceed to say, \u0026ldquo;then you\u0026rsquo;re done right\u0026rdquo; and start his turn while I was still shuffling. \u0026ldquo;No need to waste time,\u0026rdquo; he would murmur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got a Mystic first and went for Batterskull. My Mystic went for a Feast and Famine, I figured I would need to grind him out, treating it as a control matchup. I was probably already wrong here, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t have long to figure it out. His next creature was a Mirran Crusader and the turn after that he got a War and Peace on it (he never played the Batterskull), with Spell Pierce backup for my Into the Roil, and I died quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond game was worse for me, as I was low on lands and he kept me low with a Tectonic Edge on my sixth and seventh lands. I held him off for a while, countering a Jace and hitting a Batterskull with Divine Offering, but eventually he lands a Sun Titan and starts recurring Tectonic Edge and I have no chance. First loss down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4-1 matches, 8-5 games\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a bit heartbreaking, I felt like he knew the matchup inside-out (he probably did) and just crushed me at every opportunity. I went into round six a bit off\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 6\u003c/strong\u003e was against a Malaysian guy sporting RB Vampires. He led with a quick pair of \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Vampire%20Lacerator\" target=\"_new\"\u003eVampire Lacerator\u003c/a\u003es into a \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Kalastria%20Highborn\" target=\"_new\"\u003eKalastria Highborn\u003c/a\u003e. I remember going for the early Batterskull, but my notes don\u0026rsquo;t show me gaining life, instead losing it in chunks of four. I think he killed the Germ somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two he had the same opening, but this time I had more ammunition to hold him off. I would draw Celestial Purges and Into the Roils before I eventually managed to Jace into DoJ, but it took forever and I had to chump block quite a number of Hawks before I stabilized.. During this time he had managed to \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Crush\" target=\"_new\"\u003eCrush\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Manic%20Vandal\" target=\"_new\"\u003eManic Vandal\u003c/a\u003e away the equipment I was searching with my Mystics. I looked at the clock and saw that there were less than twenty minutes left in the round so I started speeding up the pace. I already had control but was at a low five life and had to resort to attacking with a Mystic bearing a Sylvok Lifestaff to bring him down from 12 while he tried to put away the last few points of damage. I lock him down with Tectonic Edges to keep him at less than four lands, but eventually he gets a creature through and drops me to 3 as he\u0026rsquo;s at 4. I Tectonic Edge the last red source he has and swing to bring him to 2. He draws his card and sighs showing me the \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Lightning%20Bolt\" target=\"_new\"\u003eLightning Bolt\u003c/a\u003e that would have killed me, then we shuffle up for game 3.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe barely had five minutes left as we started game three, and at that point I knew it was already pretty much a draw. He actually still managed to open with the 2 Lacerators and the Highborn, and followed up with a couple of Bloodghasts, but my hand was chock-full of condemns, celestial purges and into the roils, he had no chance to put me away in five minutes. So we ended in a draw. And in this vicious unforgiving grand prix day one, that draw might as well have been a loss and we both fell into do or die mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4-1-1 matches, 9-6-1 games\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, the table beside us was a Cawblade mirror between two Caucasians that fell into a draw as well, and they spent quite a few minutes talking among themselves on how they\u0026rsquo;ll handle it, as neither of them wanted to give up the win. Eventually they just got a draw as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 7\u003c/strong\u003e My Belgian opponent led with Island into Preordain and I had played so much Caw Blade I just assumed that was what he had. The second land however was a Mountain, followed by another Preordain and I realized I had fallen prey to the boogeyman matchup \u0026ndash; Exarch Twin. Well I figured I just had to be careful not to tap out, and indeed I managed to be aggrressive, going Hawk into Hawk into Mystic into Batterskull. Eventually as I attacked for with 4 creatures for 7 damage he flashed in the \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Deceiver%20Exarch\" target=\"_new\"\u003eDeceiver Exarch\u003c/a\u003e to tap down the germ and I kind of panicked as the only instant speed response I had in hand was an \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Into%20the%20Roil\" target=\"_new\"\u003eInto the Roil\u003c/a\u003e. I pondered whether to play it or not and at some point even tapped the four mana. If I sent it back to his hand immediately, he would just do the same thing on his next attack and then I would have nothing. So I held back and just dealt my 3 damage. Post-combat I played a Mystic to get Feast and Famine, hoping to grind out his hand, but as was pointed out to me later, it was a crucial mistake as I was left with only four mana untapped. On his turn he played the \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Splinter%20Twin\" target=\"_new\"\u003eSplinter Twin\u003c/a\u003e and I responded with Into the Roil, but had no mana to pay for the Mana Leak. The Twin resolved and we were on to game two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI resolved to play tighter as I boarded in Spellskites and Dismembers, but it was for naught as I was stuck at 3 islands and a plains for most of the game, with him keeping me off a fifth land via Tectonic Edges. He played a Manic Vandal for the first equipment my Mystic flashed in, and I dared not tap out after that since I could die at any time, which meant I was restricted to playing one two mana spell a turn so that I could keep up a Mana Leak available. Eventually I got nothing and that Manic Vandal actually went all the way (I drew a Dismember with too few life to kill him).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4-2-1 matches, 9-7-1 games, and that\u0026rsquo;s it for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally, the losses were due to the general lack of practice and playtesting which made them a bit frustrating. But that\u0026rsquo;s life I guess, and a consequence of putting things together at the last minute. At least I have more experience when I go to play in the upcoming Nationals Qualifiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ll probably skip Shanghai, despite it being a limited GP, as I\u0026rsquo;d like to limit the damage to international GP a year. I\u0026rsquo;m still not willing nor able to commit the amount of playtesting and practice time to compete at the international level apparently, but at least I\u0026rsquo;m already doing better than the 0-3 starts I got the last 2 GPs I attended. We\u0026rsquo;ll see where I go with Magic from here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",

I like bullet points, so here\u0026rsquo;s a summary of my trip:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProps:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epublic transportation. One thing Singapore and Hong Kong have in common: well-defined, convenient and tourist-friendly public transportation systems, namely trains and buses. It makes our local buses and trains here pale by comparison. The trains are well-maintained and more or less go everywhere including to and from the airport (there\u0026rsquo;s really no need to take an airport taxi unless you arrive some time after the trains close), and there are maps everywhere and machines that dispense tickets and such. The buses can get crowded but still well-organized. There are numerous bus stops and they identify the bus numbers that pass by that stop and many stops will also have maps and routes shown; buses are tracked via GPS so some stops will tell you how long until the bus arrives. They even have an iPhone app that helps you find your bus. Oh, and of course you can buy one of those reloadable cards that you can use to pay for buses and trains. Okay, I really liked the public transpo system. 😀\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMike and Tin (congrats again guys :D) and the rest of the Singapore guys who put up with the visiting team, especially since they let me crash at their place on my last night there.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e12 mbps internet at Mike and Tin\u0026rsquo;s place, which meant we were able to spend a couple of hours one night just watching stupid youtube videos continuously and letting me get my ass kicked at SSF4 online without any lag. Arr, makes me wish ISPs on our side weren\u0026rsquo;t so terrible\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eanime. Well, just the fact that I probably watched more anime over the weekend stay than I have over the past year or so. At least I now have some idea who these Fate/Stay Night people are.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eair travel. In general, my Cebu Pacific flights went smoothly (I even slept well on the flight back) and I breezed through customs and immigrations both ways without much concern. I\u0026rsquo;m always a bit worried about some unexpected problems like baggage getting lost (so I never check in baggage) or some problem with the bookings or my travel documents or whatever.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlops:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003every muggy weather, making it very uncomfortable to travel outside (to be fair, now that I\u0026rsquo;m back in Manila it feels almost the same here). It felt good to take a shower back at the hotel everyday\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOxford hotel for not having free internet and serving basically the same breakfast everyday. Oh and aircon unit that dripped on the couch; I actually woke up with water all over my iPad\u0026rsquo;s case (luckily not broken)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe Grand Prix Singapore venue, for being so far from the train station\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eme for trying to get into the driver\u0026rsquo;s side of the taxi\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSomewhere in between:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI guess I\u0026rsquo;m fairly satisfied with how I fared in the Grand Prix, despite my sloppy misplays at some point. At least I broke my curse of going 0-3 all the time in Grand Prix tournaments.

It\u0026rsquo;s not completely a bad thing, as I kind of enjoy wandering around by myself on foot. It\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;ve done in other countries I visited (usually at night), but didn\u0026rsquo;t really get the chance in Singapore because once I got back to the airconditioned room in the hotel, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really want to go out 😀\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs per usual in my travels to other countries, I did not spend much time shopping or sight-seeing or any touristy stuff like that. I\u0026rsquo;m not really a tourist kind of person. Overall the trip was ok it was great to be able to visit and meet up with friends, compete in the Grand Prix and see how daily life is in Singapore (still not inclined to work there though :p)\u003c/p\u003e\n",
