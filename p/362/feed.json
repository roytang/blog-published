Two 1/1s finished me off. He played incredibly well, never taking the bad draw for granted.

My turn, I topdeck the Demonfire, assuring victory! I swing, saps make it through and bring him down to 5. And thus my stupid move: I played the Squall Line first, and ANNOUNCE IT FOR 5.

My deck simply has no way to handle the life gain from multiple Martyr of Sands. I managed to win game 2 off a fast clock. Game 3 I had a good start as I managed to use several Acid-Moss to keep the Tron from coming online, but eventually he had me locked in again with Martyrs, Proclamation, Howling Mine, Chronosavants, etc. He was at 40+ life when he managed to play Akroma. I hold her off with Glare of Subdual and eventually get out enough guys that he\u0026rsquo;s forced to Wrath away the Akroma. But he has the Debtor\u0026rsquo;s Knell in play, and my sideboarded Moratorium Stones failed to appear. I can\u0026rsquo;t recall, but I may have made a misplay at some point when he hard-casted a Sunscour and I had a Hierarch in play, I forget if I had the mana open to save my guys. But I certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoss: 1-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2 vs UR Vore\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYay! I\u0026rsquo;ve faced UR Vore several times before, so I\u0026rsquo;m pretty familiar with how it plays, and I crush him easily game one, working around the counters and generally ignoring the land destruction thanks to the almighty Yavimaya Dryad. Game 2 I stall a bit, and he takes me down with an 8/8 Vore. Game 3 I\u0026rsquo;m back in business, hitting back-to-back Dryad and Acid-Moss into Herd tokens. I overextend a bit since he shows no sign of having Wildfire yet. Despite a Tidings and a couple of Sleight of Hands he does not draw the ‘Fire. I eventually empty my hand and play the hellbent Demonfire for the win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin: 2-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3 vs Marnel featuring Vesuvan Lockdown\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarnel is an officemante, and he and I were playtesting last night and his deck was a slightly difficult matchup for me \u0026ndash; I won 2 out of 4 games but both wins were based on really good draws. So he and I face off in round 3 and I\u0026rsquo;m like, \u0026ldquo;This is just a playtest, so we\u0026rsquo;re not going to draw, right?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarnel\u0026rsquo;s deck plays morph guys \u0026ndash; lots of \u0026lsquo;em. He\u0026rsquo;d only finished the changes last night. It\u0026rsquo;s an awesome deck and fun to play. And most importantly, people won\u0026rsquo;t know how to handle it! As long as he doesn\u0026rsquo;t play any insanely fast aggro, he\u0026rsquo;s got a good chance of winning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, I am not insanely fast aggro, and we go to a close game 3. During my last turn I\u0026rsquo;m at 2 and he\u0026rsquo;s at 5 with a SSS in play. He did the Thelonite Hermit + Vesuvan Shapeshifter bit during the last 2 turns, so he has a battalion of saps on his side and I will surely lose with his next swing. I decide to go for the draw: \u0026ldquo;Squall Line for 5?\u0026rdquo; But he shows me the Cancel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe loss means I don\u0026rsquo;t get top 8 status anymore, but this is just practice. 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoss: 1-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4 vs UW control\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve played this guy a few times before. He\u0026rsquo;s a nice guy, but he always plays blue =p I eat his deck alive. During Friday\u0026rsquo;s night testing I was able to handily beat a deck that had four Wraths and three Pyros, U/W is a pushover. I don\u0026rsquo;t even think I saw any offence. I finish with the Demonfire on game two and I love the surprised look on their faces when I do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin: 2-0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5 vs ugr beats\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometime during the match I morph a Thelonite Hermit and he\u0026rsquo;s like \u0026ldquo;Eh? Is there still Morph in Standard?\u0026rdquo; =/\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, this seems like a weaker version of Sea Stompy. I see no Slums or Plaxmantas or Snakes, and I know how to work around the permission. Win game one no problem. Game 2, I was at 9 and he had two mana open so I psyched myself out and did not Demonfire his Yavimaya Dryad + Moldervine Cloak. Oops, lost to Char on the next swing. Game 3, he has a bad draw and only gets two lands out early, plus birds and elves. I hit the Acid-Moss when he taps out for a Viper that trades with an Elephant. Demonfire and Thornscape Battlemage take out 2 birds, and he only has a Karplusan and a Llanowar Elf and a Giant Solifuge out. He\u0026rsquo;s at 5 I\u0026rsquo;m at 6, I pass the turn. He looks at his hand and swing with the Solifuge. I have a guildmage, a morphed hermit and the battlemage on my side, so the easy play is single-block the Solifuge and swing for six (with the Guildmage pump) the next turn. I\u0026rsquo;m about to do that, but I realize he hasn\u0026rsquo;t made a land drop yet! If I take 2 from the Solifuge, he can play Mountain, Char for the win! I do the double-block trading 2-for-1, since I\u0026rsquo;m ahead in board position anyway. He frowns and plays Island, go. I swing with the Guildmage, bringing him down to three, then play 2 more Guildmages. He frowns again, realizes he can\u0026rsquo;t play Char anymore, then offers the handshake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin: 2-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6 vs ugr tron\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheesh. This was even easier than the Vore from round 2. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I saw any offense. The magnificent Acid-Moss rears it\u0026rsquo;s ugly head again. And also my awesome power to cut Wildfires to the bottoms of decks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin: 2-0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 7 vs Monoblack Aggro\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter round 6 I was hoping I\u0026rsquo;d get paired with this guy\u0026hellip; I could take his deck any day of the week. Game one starts out like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Stomping Ground, go\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHim: Swamp, Rusalka\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Land, Assault on Rusalka\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHim: Swamp, Dark Confidant\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Land, Assault on Confidant\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHim: Swamp, Dark Confidant\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Land, Assault on Confidant (topdecked the Assault \u0026ndash; ah, Assault and Dark Confidant, you were made for each other)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eventually overwhelm him with Elephants. We go to game 2, and he has a not-so-awesome draw and plays four Bad Moons over the first five turns. He gets a swing in with a 5/5 Nether Traitor, but on my turn, I play the ever-so-awesome Glare of Subdual. I have the Ghazi in play, so I just keep pumping out saps to hold off the ever-increasing army of dudes. He made the mistake of telling me he was waiting for the Plagued Rusalka to come out (so he could finish off my saps with the Rusalka + Nether Traitor combination attack), so I alpha-strike him with just enough damage to kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin: 2-0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was my best constructed finish for this year: 5-2 (How sad.) I finish 11th, enough to win 3 booster packs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe breakout performance was however, Marnel\u0026rsquo;s Vesuvan lockdown deck, which he piloted to a 6-1 (Number 1) finish. Props to him, this deck is awesome and fun to play, both with and against. It\u0026rsquo;s also a very technically involved deck, there are lots of tricks involved, especially with Willbender. I wish I was as successful with my attempts to go rogue. =p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, good practice. I\u0026rsquo;m planning to play on each of the next 3 weekends as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "This tournament and three others for each Saturday of November are run-ups to the Time Spiral Gold Rush tournament in December. I\u0026rsquo;ve been agonizing over the past couple of weeks as to what I can play in the diverse new standard enivornment. In the end, instead of doing my usual thing and building an original decklist, I decided to work from an existing archetype instead. I believe that in order for me to become a better Standard player, I have to get more match experience before designing decks, since my thinking is still on a casual level most of the time.",

Well, my brother just hit 60 recently, so I suppose I should ask him after a few weeks what it\u0026rsquo;s like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then again, I\u0026rsquo;m the sort of person that likes multitasking, the thought of spending 12 or more hours in a day doing the same thing sends a shiver up my spine. So I doubt I\u0026rsquo;m ever really in any danger of getting addicted in that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne could argue that it\u0026rsquo;s a person\u0026rsquo;s own responsibility to make sure he doesn\u0026rsquo;t become overly addicted to any one thing, MMORPGs included. One would think that a person who allows himself to become addicted to MMOs would have just been addicted to something else had the MMO not existed. But MMORPGs are still a strange new thing to our society, one that we haven\u0026rsquo;t yet been taught how to handle, one that does not yet have those society-set levels that define how much is too much. And one cannot deny that the ability to interact with people from all over the world with an avatar of your own choosing would seem like a powerful opportunity for growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the worst pressures in the game supposedly come from other players. After reading the article, I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure I want to be involved in raiding (although I suppose it depends on what other end-game content is available), as a raiding guild can probably exert a lot on peer pressure for one to commit more time to the ever-addictive game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis phenomenon doesn\u0026rsquo;t really exist only for MMORPGs though, it\u0026rsquo;s just a lot easier because of the social factor involved. It can happen with offline games as well, especially open-ended ones. I once knew someone who brought her home computer to the lab at school for the sole purpose of being able to play The Sims while at the lab. And whenever I dropped by the Lab, there she was, happily clicking away to earn her Simoleans. MMOs like WoW are infinitely more deep than The Sims because of the interaction\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith other players and the constantly improving game content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all is said, Blizzard has made one hell of game, one that provides a virtual escape for many people. I suppose one should just be careful that it adds something to your life instead of taking away.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
