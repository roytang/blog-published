            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThe PH senatorial and local elections are on Monday. I almost didn\u0026rsquo;t want to write the usual election post, mostly because I was annoyed with and tired of the electorate and the politicians and the system and all that. But we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t give in to despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften when choosing who to vote, it will be difficult to find candidates who align perfectly with your values. You make compromises to prioritize those issues you think are more important. You settle on lesser evils to try to stave off the worse ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can be scary sometimes to make a judgment that \u0026ldquo;this candidate is great\u0026rdquo;, because you can\u0026rsquo;t really know a person right? And these candidates, you only see a sliver of their lives, what they project publicly, so it can be difficult to judge. But at least you should be openly rejecting those who are already projecting poor values: supporting murders, blind support for the administration, plunderers, criminals, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me, the most important issue facing the country right now is the need to provide a decent check and balance in the legislative branch, so for this reason, I will vote all of the Otso Diretso senatorial slate. Some of them aren\u0026rsquo;t the best choices, but the administration candidates are far worse. Even if you are not inclined to support the opposition, I strongly suggest you consider Chel Diokno. He\u0026rsquo;s the best candidate I\u0026rsquo;ve seen since the late Raul Roco. Gutoc, Alejano, and Aquino are the next best ones. Hilbay has had some flaky opinions, but he\u0026rsquo;s smart without a doubt, and a bar topnotcher. Roxas had a poor stint sa executive branch, but he was ok sa legislative. Macalintal and Tanada are the ones I have the least info about, but again, opposition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am considering leaving the remaining 4 slots open, will probably decide on election day. The pickings are slim. If only we had an option for downvotes instead, I could vote down the really bad choices like Marcos, Go, Revilla, dela Rosa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocal elections: The Quezon City mayoral choices aren\u0026rsquo;t very good. Belmonte has an air of incompetence. But her opponent Crisologo is as a friend described \u0026ldquo;an evil Ilocano warlord stuck in the 70s\u0026rdquo;, so in the choice between incompetent and evil, we have no choice but to choose incompetence. (There is a third candidate, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think he has a chance.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I will skip voting for the vice mayor and councilor slots. I have no info on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the QC sixth district, I\u0026rsquo;m lucky that our district has a liberal party incumbent who has made some house votes I agree with, so for me it\u0026rsquo;s still Kit Belmonte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParty list: Eh, IDK anymore. Maybe Akbayan or Magdalo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can see, I don\u0026rsquo;t have very strong opinions this time around, especially on the local level. I am not super optimistic about this election, as I suspect the electorate may very well disappoint me yet again. But still, duty is duty. And so we hope for the best while fearing the worst.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eSince I was going to be taking a long trip in a month, I was looking for some books to read on the plane and in airports and whatnot while waiting. I settled on a re-read of Robert Jordan\u0026rsquo;s Wheel of Time series, a pretty good time for it since by next year we may have a TV series from Amazon (hopefully better than Game of Thrones). Side note: Wheel of Time is also why I\u0026rsquo;m not optimistic that GRRM can finish ASoIaF in just two more books - Jordan took forever and died before he could finish WoT and even Sanderson who took over needed an additional three books to finish the saga.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s been a while since I read any of the books - I bought and read the final book \u003cem\u003eA Memory of Light\u003c/em\u003e when it came out, so that was around 2013. That means I followed the series for around two decades - I remember borrowing \u003cem\u003eEye of the World\u003c/em\u003e from a friend maybe around late high school/early college (circa mid 90s) and quickly going through the books until I was caught up. Wheel of Time was my first real epic fantasy series - I only read Tolkien later on and before that most of my fantasy exposure was limited to TV and movies. I enjoyed the first half of the 14-book series, then got \u003ca href=\"/2005/05/wheel-of-time-10-crossroads-of-twilight/\"\u003eannoyed by the pacing in the second half\u003c/a\u003e, and was relieved when Sanderson managed to satisfactorily land the plane with \u003ca href=\"https://tumblr.roytang.net/post/41200573244/so-i-finished-reading-a-memory-of-light-today\"\u003eMemory of Light\u003c/a\u003e. My annoyance with the later books may have been due to the fact that I had to wait for each one in turn to be released - it will be interesting to see how the series holds up for me now that I can read all the books in succession. I also like to think I\u0026rsquo;ve matured as a reader since then and will be able to appreciate the books differently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m also well behind my book reading target for this year, so doing a re-read of a long series gives me a good bump. Also, since the books have been out forever, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to bother to mark spoilers when I\u0026rsquo;m discussing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am however starting with a book I haven\u0026rsquo;t read yet - \u003cem\u003eNew Spring\u003c/em\u003e is a prequel novel that I never bothered to read before. The story takes place 20 years before \u003cem\u003eEye of the World\u003c/em\u003e, so it\u0026rsquo;s a good starting point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story follows the PoV of two characters introduced in \u003cem\u003eEye of the World\u003c/em\u003e - Moiraine Damodred, starting out as an Accepted with future Amyrlin Siuan Sanche at the White Tower in Tar Valon, and Lan Mandragoran, fresh off the tail end of the Aiel War and how their paths eventually intersect. Given the two main characters future, we can anticipate that the novel will end with them forming the Warder bond. The book is short - about half as long as \u003cem\u003eEye of the World\u003c/em\u003e - but as is typical of Robert Jordan, it takes a long time to get there, as most of the first half of the book centers around Moiraine and Siuan navigating the intrigues of the White Tower as the search for The Dragon Reborn begins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pace picks up a bit once Moiraine manages to leave the tower and crosses path with Lan and they realize the existence of the Black Ajah searching for the Dragon Reborn. Yes, reading this book before the rest means you are already aware the Black Ajah exists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven how at the start of this book Lan is openly disdainful of getting caught in Aes Sedai problems and how tight Moiraine and Lan are by the time of \u003cem\u003eEye of the World\u003c/em\u003e, I assumed there would be some big life-changing event near the end of the book that would cause him to change his mind and allow the Warder bond, but I was a bit whelmed by how it happened. One would think losing his oldest bondsman to the Black Ajah would Lan more wary of Aes Sedai, but all it took was a quick reminder from Moiraine about the stakes and he easily acquiesed to the bond. Oh well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finished the book in 3 days (as I said, quite short), but the other books in the series are at least twice as long, and there are 14 more books to go, so I think there should be plently leftover by the time the trip rolls around.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

When you have been reading (and speaking) English so much from an early age, you come to have an instinctive grasp of what is and what is not proper sentence construction. Some sentences just look right and some just look wrong. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying I have perfect mastery of the English language or anything. But I am for the most part capable of proper sentence construction. I like to think that being a programmer (or at least, a good programmer) correlates with a tendency towards good grammar as well, given how the syntax rules of programming languages are even stricter than the rules of English grammar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to be pretty anal about it too. I would correct most people given any opportunity, especially online in forums and social media and what not. These days I\u0026rsquo;m less inclined to do so, at least for strangers on the internet whose first language may or may not be English, unless the grammar is especially atrocious or the poster was asking for it in some way. I guess the advice in the following tweet mostly applies for me these days:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHere\u0026#39;s what I was taught about manners: Correcting someone\u0026#39;s \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/grammar?src=hash\u0026amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003e#grammar\u003c/a\u003e in public is rude.

Speaking good English is often seen as a sign of privilege. I imagine even foreigners make some judgments based on how good your English is; I imagine that my \u003ca href=\"/2019/04/i-got-a-us-visa/\"\u003eUS Visa interview\u003c/a\u003e might have been a bit more difficult if I wasn\u0026rsquo;t fluent. That being said, it may be a thing that\u0026rsquo;s on the downturn, given the recent rise of anti-intellectualism locally (or is it really recent?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will still often correct friends and family though. The people who know me well know that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t signify any ill will or malice on my part, just a lingering obsessive desire for correct grammar. It\u0026rsquo;s the same way a slightly misaligned painting hanging from the wall would bother other people (okay, that would bother me too).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion: I had to review this post a few times to make sure I made no grammatical errors, that would be embarrassing.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

This is not entirely inaccurate, though I prefer not to tinker with real world stuff because of my poor dexterity. My tinkering is usually limited to software and tech devices. I\u0026rsquo;m always willing to try different things to figure out how to get software to work. I guess this contributes to my aptitude for software development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was thinking about this because there\u0026rsquo;s some contrast when I\u0026rsquo;m working with non-technical people who easily get frustrated with why things don\u0026rsquo;t work. They often won\u0026rsquo;t even try simple things like restarting something or pushing buttons to see what happens. I guess there is some level of fear or intimidation involved, they are worried that if they try things they don\u0026rsquo;t understand they might break something. While that\u0026rsquo;s a concern, modern tech is a lot more resilient and uh, well, shall we say \u0026ldquo;idiot proof\u0026rdquo; than back in the old days, but I guess that\u0026rsquo;s difficult to communicate to someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a technical background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally though, with the modern internet giving video tutorials for most anything, there is little reason to not be a tinkerer these days, but I guess if you didn\u0026rsquo;t grow up with that mentality it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to adjust especially when you\u0026rsquo;re older. For younger people who grew up on the internet just trying to push whatever buttons until you figure out what you want seems to come naturally with the usage of tablets and smartphones and such. My nieces certainly handle modern technology a lot better than their grandparents do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world needs more tinkerers and technical people anyway, and maybe a tad less of people like salesmen, marketers and propagandists.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI follow a lot of strangers \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/roytang\"\u003eover on Twitter\u003c/a\u003e, each one usually for a different reason that I find interesting. Sometimes they follow me back for one reason or another, and it gives me a little bit of anxiety. The anxiety is because here is this person whose content I like, who followed me back probably because of an interaction we had, and she is expecting that my tweets will be more of the same kind of content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut often it\u0026rsquo;s not. I don\u0026rsquo;t write about the same kind of thing all the time - one only needs to look at this blog to see that. I write on a variety of topics that interest me, from \u003ca href=\"/tags/software-development/\"\u003estuff I learn working as a software developer\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"/tags/movies/\"\u003emovies\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"/tags/games/\"\u003egames\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"/tags/tv/\"\u003etv shows\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"/tags/philippines/\"\u003ethings that are going on in my country\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"/tags/quotes/\"\u003equotes I like\u003c/a\u003e and all other kinds of stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a while I considered that blogging might be more effective if I had a more focused blog, instead of this chaotic willy-nilly mess I\u0026rsquo;ve refused to give up on since 2002. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried starting topic-centered blogs before, about stuff like \u003ca href=\"/tags/mtg/\"\u003eMagic the Gathering\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"/tags/comics/\"\u003ecomic books\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"/tags/royondjango/\"\u003esoftware development using Django\u003c/a\u003e, but most of those efforts collpased and I just absorbed the contents back into this blog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think having a focused blog depends really on your goals. Like, if your goal is to have a blog with a lot of followers and to grow your audience and to monetize through ads or newsletters or other methods, then focused, specific content is the way to go. But for me and this blog, as I like to remind myself, I\u0026rsquo;m writing largely for myself. This blog and this website are my presence on the internet, more than any social media account. Thus, it should reflect all my interests in totality, not just the ones that I can monetize or get me more work or whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m reminded of how sometimes on Twitter famous people like tech personalities will comment on something like politics and they\u0026rsquo;ll get people who are disagreeable and go \u0026ldquo;I follow you for your tech content, please keep your politics out of this\u0026rdquo;, which is ridiculous. Just because a person is primarily known for a certain thing doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean their opinions and personalities can be limited to that thing only and for all time. People are multi-faceted, they have many views and many interests and they should be allowed to express themselves on whatever topic they like (within reasonable limits obviously no to hate speech thanks.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a barely related blog note: something I\u0026rsquo;ve been putting off for a while, I merged categories and tags on this blog. It just seems to make more sense. I probably broke some links somewhere though, I\u0026rsquo;ll figure it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

(For some reason Arena gives me a warning that Teferi requires a sideboard!) The control matchups seem manageable, depending on draws. Fast decks (i.e. RDW) are a bit more challenging, might need some cheaper spot removal like Moment of Craving. I did manage to ultimate Kaya for 20+ damage a couple of times already, so that\u0026rsquo;s fun. I don\u0026rsquo;t have that much time for testing though, so I imagine this is a list that I will be optimizing over time. Any suggestions are welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

With War of the Spark now out and the metagame not yet established, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d be foolish and waste my wildcards on some brewing. As a reminder, I\u0026rsquo;m still an F2P player on Arena, so wildcards are precious and few lol. I did have some 50k in gold and a few gems saved up when War of the Spark hit, so i have already played a few sealeds (only 1 got to 7 wins) and opened quite a few packs.",

The season was ok, I enjoyed the classic Trek references and all the timey-wimey stuff. The Orville had a great season, with the introduction of a new enemy empire and possibly one of the best TV space battles of all time.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI already wrote about Avengers Endgame a bit in \u003ca href=\"/2019/04/were-in-the-endgames-now/\"\u003eyesterday\u0026rsquo;s post\u003c/a\u003e, but that was a bit rushed and I had more thoughts, so here we are. I figured I might as well get everything out. There will be unmarked spoilers for Avengers Endgame and Agents of SHIELD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore even going into the movie that was seemingly sold out everywhere despite being on almost every cinema screen in the Metro, I was thinking to myself what a phenomenon. Endgame is the culmination of a decade\u0026rsquo;s worth of movies, 22 in total, and even some number of shows, something unrivalled in all of movie history. It\u0026rsquo;s a new form of serialized event entertainment - even though there have been movie franchises with continuity before, most have been limited to trilogies, and the MCU blows them all out of the water. In my head it\u0026rsquo;s more akin to an extended HBO or Netflix series, one that only gets three episodes a year, and each episode is an event in that you can go to the cinema and watch it with your friends. And Endgame was here, trying to put a bookend on all of that, an entire decade worth of stories, with dozens of characters and the stakes no less than half the universe. The scale of it is mind-boggling and very ambitious, and if they dropped the ball on this one it would be so terrible and a huge waste and it would take another decade to even attempt to conclude another story in this manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe movie starts with the cold open of Clint and his family getting dusted. This could have easily been done as a post-credits scene in Infinity War, but having this here allows them to remind the audience of the stakes involved at the very start. (And saves them having to credit Jeremy Renner in both movies.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNext we get the trailer scene of Tony in space recording his message to Potts. The trailer makes this out to be kind of a hopeless-we\u0026rsquo;re-about-to-die situation for Tony (and Nebula), but the movies resolves it quickly by having Carol come in to save them at the last minute. At first I was confused a bit about whether we were going to see the Captain Marvel post-credits scene in this movie, but they save some time by having all of that (including introducing Carol to everybody and explaining Thanos and all) happen off-screen. Tony gets back to Earth but he\u0026rsquo;s still pissed at cap and they part ways.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWith Nebula now on Earth, they know where Thanos is and the plan is to go beat him up, get the stones and use that to resotre all the dusted people. But Thanos has destroyed the stones, making the snap apparently irreversible. Thor is frustrated and goes for the head this time, and we timeskip five years.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBoth the timeskip and the length of it caught me a bit off-guard, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting it. I can imagine that Infinity War could\u0026rsquo;ve ended here too (if not for the pesky detail of Carol not yet being introduced.) Aparently five years was not enough for the people of the world to move on. That\u0026rsquo;s understandable, but I would have assumed they would clean up the mess a little bit.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNext we have the rat that saves the world. Pure blind luck gets Scott out of the Quantum Realm; the only reason it took five years to get to this point is that rat was lazy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eContinuing the MCU tradition of trying to complete the Community cast, we get a 2-second cameo by Ken Jeong/Senor Chang. Later on we also get a slightly longer cameo from Yvette Nicole-Brown/Shirley!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eScott gets to meet grown-up Cassie, setting up the stage for her Phase 4 adventures as Stature, and perhaps, the Young Avengers? Who else would be there?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAfter some meandering, Scott makes his way to the Avengers compound, and finally explains his ludicrous timey-wimey plan of using the quantum realm to do a time heist. They need someone smart to figure this out so they go to Tony, and we get to meet his daughter Morgan (I would guess at 4 years old). Tony dismisses their plan as some fantasy Back to the Future-type nonsense. Apparently (as would be explained further on), Back to the Future rules do not apply in the MCU - changing the past does not affect the future. I initially thought they would try to use time travel to go back and redo the battle of Wakanda, this time with more foreknowledge and Carol on their side and thus stop the snap from even happening, but this throws that out the window. There\u0026rsquo;s no getting around it now - the snap is irrevocably part of MCU history and future films will have to work around that or otherwise deal with the consequences.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThey need another smart guy, so they go see Bruce, who is now Smart Hulk. Not what I was expecting, though not unprecedented from the comics. Banner has had a weird character arc since Age of Ultron, going from permanently Hulk to unable to Hulk and now both Banner and Hulk.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTony figures it out and comes around, so they try to get the gang back together to do the Time Heist. Rocket and Bruce go to pick up Thor, who is now a depressed fat drunk idiot apparently. Far Thor is a bit of a disservice to the character - but given that during the last few movies he\u0026rsquo;s lost his mother and his father and his girlfriend and his home and his posse and half the remaining Asgardians and he feel responsible for the snap because he didn\u0026rsquo;t go for the head, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a little justified. Hey, at least Valkyrie and Korg survived, so that\u0026rsquo;s something.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNatasha tracks Clint swordfighting some Yakuza in Tokyo and gives him hope.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSo the Time Heist crew are: Steve, Tony, Bruce, and Scott going for the three infinity stones in New York 2012, Rocket and Thor going for the Ether in Asgard 2013, Nebula, Rhodey going for the power stone on Morag in 2014, and Clint and Natasha going for the Soul Stone in 2014 as well. They only get one round trip each, so no one is allowed to fail\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI was pleasantly surprised all the appearances of characters from previous movies: the Ancient One, Rumlow, Agent Sitwell, Loki, Alexander Pierce, Frigga, even Natalie Portman\u0026rsquo;s Jane Foster! Did they actually get Portman to shoot a scene gain, or just reused footage from Dark World? (I assume the latter). Tt\u0026rsquo;s amazing that they were able to shoot new scenes with actors like Tilda Swinton and Robert Redford and not have that info leak\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSome great throwback moments include:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0026ldquo;I can do this all day\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yeah, yeah\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe Ancient One punching Bruce out of the Hulk\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe elevator scene from Winter Soldier turned on its head by Cap whispering \u0026ldquo;Hail Hydra\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCap, Iron Man and Hulk going back to the battle of New York made sense, since they could blend in during the fight somehow and Tony has access to Stark tower\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThor does his blubbering idiot thing but gets a bit of his mojo back after talking to his mother and finding out he was still worthy to summon Mjolnir\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOnce you know that Clint and Natasha are going for the Soul Stone, you already know one of them has to die; the only question was which one. Natasha unfortunately, did not have a spouse and children to go back to\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRhodey and Nebula successfully conk out idiot Peter Quill and grab the Power Stone from him. It\u0026rsquo;s weird that they chose to go back to this time instead of say, after Gotg1 when the power stone was safely in the hands of the Nova Corps. I guess they figured it was easier to get it from Quill rather than try to infiltrate Xandar, but coming back to this time creates an opportunity for Nebula to get her wifi network crossed with 2014 Nebula and so 2014 Thanos finds out about the entire Time Heist and sends 2014 Nebula back to 2023 as a sleeper agent\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSteve and Tony hop to 1970 as their back up plan for getting the tesseract. Steve catches a glimpse of Peggy, but she looks a bit too young considering she should be 50ish at this time. Tony meets up with Howard and I am momentarily confused because I am more familiar with Dominic Cooper than John Slattery but here we are. Howard saying Tony is about to be born tells us Tony is more than 50 in 2023, quite old already as well. Oh, and Jarvis is here too.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Time Heist is successful! Everyone but Nat makes it back home, and they mourn her for all of ten seconds before going to build their own Infinity Gauntlet. She probably deserved more than that, but she is still slated for an upcoming movie, however that works, and this movie is all about a sendoff for Cap and Tony, so she gets less focus\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e(As the third act is beginning, I suddenly get the urge to pee, but I can\u0026rsquo;t go now! And I\u0026rsquo;m in the middle of the row so going would bother a lot of people and I end up uncomfortably holding it in for an hour. This is my excuse in case I screw up some facts below)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2014 Nebula brings 2014 Thanos and his warship through the time machine into the present day. One would wonder how they got enough Pym particles to shrink the entire warship, but presumably they had enough time to study and clone the tech before 2014 Nebula called to them. The ship did not pop out full size in Avengers compound as I expected, instead appearing in the sky above\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBruce prepares to use the gauntlet, and without explanation everyone suits up, as if expecting they\u0026rsquo;re about to be attacked by the Mad Titan they thought they killed a while back. Bruce snaps, and a phone call confirms the undusting worked, but then they get space bombarded by Thanos\u0026rsquo; warship\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eClint is left alone to run away with the gauntlet to protect it from beasties. The original three (Steve, Tony and Thor) go face to face with Thanos directly. Thor, probably bursting with a chance to redeem himself, dual wields Stormbreaker and Mjolnir and uses the lightning to get out his sweatpants and fashion himself new armor and braid his beard. They go at it\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2014 Gamora frees 2023 Nebula and they go save Clint just when 2014 Nebula was about to take the gauntlet from him. Bruce is trying to keep the rubble from collapsing on Rhodey, Rocket and himself as Scott heads their way\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThanos vs the original three is a close fight, but the Mad Titan has them on the ropes when suddenly Steve wields Mjolnir! Completely predictable, but it\u0026rsquo;s something the fans have been clamoring for since Age of Ultron. Thor cheers \u0026ldquo;I knew it!!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn spite of everything, Thanos beats them back, shattering Steve\u0026rsquo;s shield. Steve struggles to get up, barely breathing, and all seems lost when he gets some radio comms from somewhere. It\u0026rsquo;s Sam! Right, all the dusted people are back! Took them long enough! \u0026ldquo;On your six\u0026rdquo; is a throwback to their jogging days back during Winter Soldier\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMagic portals from Doctor Strange\u0026rsquo;s peeps pop up all over, and the reinforcements are here: T\u0026rsquo;Challa, Shuri, Okoye and the armies of Wakanda! Sam, Bucky, Wanda, Quill, Drax and Mantis! Peter Parker, Spider-man! Pepper in the Rescue Armor! Hope van Dyne! Valkyrie and the Asgardians! Wong and his magic friends! 2014 Gamora and 2023 Nebula! Scott goes Giant-Man and busts Bruce, Rhodey and Rocket out of the rubble! Thanos calls down his armies, the Black Order and the Leviathans from the battle of New York. Everyone is geared up for a rematch of Wakanda, and Steve finally utters those magic words: Avengers Assemble! (We\u0026rsquo;re already assembled, Steve!). Hands down the best moment of the movie!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNot much to say about the battle itself, its great and everyone has their moments. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a problem with the whole girl power moment after Carol comes in\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTony\u0026rsquo;s response of \u0026ldquo;I am Iron Man\u0026rdquo; as he snaps his gauntlet is weird but I understand why it\u0026rsquo;s there. His journey begins and ends with that line. His body can\u0026rsquo;t take the power of infinity and he dies. Pepper tells him its time to rest\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTony gets a long funeral scene, and some characters notably appear for the first time in the movie: Janet van Dyne, Maria Hill, Nick Fury and some teenager I don\u0026rsquo;t recognize but later find out is supposed to be the kid from Iron Man 3. Some posts are also naming him as \u0026ldquo;Iron Lad\u0026rdquo;, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t jive with the Young Avengers Iron Lad origin, but I suppose it\u0026rsquo;s a possible future something\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnd now, the weakest part of the movie\u0026rsquo;s plot: Steve going back to the past to return the infinity stones (and Mjolnir) to where they got them, to minimize timestream damage. So many questions:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhy is Steve the only one to go? Hank Pym is back, they can make more Pym Particles again.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhy is his shield whole again? Did Shuri repair it?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDid he go back to Asgard and inject the ether back into Jane Foster?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow did he make the tesseract a cube again? How did he put the mind stone back into the sceptre which he didn\u0026rsquo;t bring?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow did the reunion with Red Skull on Vormir go? Did he get a refund on the price paid for the Soul stone?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere are a bunch of timey-wimey problems but probably there are multiple ways to justify things and you shouldnt think about them too hard and just accept them. For the record, here is what I believe. Presumably, returning the infinity stones to where they got them removes the branch timeline that was created when they originally got them. This means:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReturning the time stone to the Ancient One means the events of Doctor Strange still happen in the prime timeline, and that time stone was the same one Thanos used in Infinity War\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReturning the sceptre to Agent Sitwell means it still has the same mind stone used in Age of Ultron etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReturning the space stone (now Tesseract) to the SHIELD vaults means it does all of its stuff in the prime timeline as expected, and is still the same space stone used in Infinity War\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReturning the ether to Jane Foster means the events of Dark World still unfold as they did\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAll of these are merged back into the prime timeline via \u003ca href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAlreadyChangedThePast\"\u003eTV Tropes: You Already Changed The Past\u003c/a\u003e, so they all already happened in the prime universe. This means four of the stones used in Infinity War and later destroyed were also the same ones used in Endgame\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHowever, there are at least two changes Steve would have been unable to repair:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLoki escaping with the Tesseract in 2012\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe removal of 2014 Thanos, Gamora, Nebula and all of Thanos\u0026rsquo; crew from their time. This means it was also unnecessary to return the power stone and soul stone to this branch timeline, but I guess they did it anyway\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnother mystery is in what timeline did Steve get his last dance with Peggy and hence grow old etc. The fact that he was able to appear on the bench as an old man shortly after being sent back implies to me that he grew old in the prime timeline (in yet another instance of You Already Changed The Past), and that Peggy simply kept the real identity of her husband a secret to her dying day\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe real problem with this whole affair character-wise is that it means Steve became selfish and chose to live out his life given the chance, instead of going back to his friends as expected. I like to think that seeing Peggy again in 1970 made him realize he was always meant to be with her and thus made him decide to do what he did\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHanding off the shield to Sam: I expected it to be Bucky, given that in the comics he got to be Cap before Sam, but this is okay too. Though I think Steve could\u0026rsquo;ve given Bucky a few parting words as well\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eQuill pretty much got the short end of the stick in IW/EG: Fans hate him now for screwing up the battle on Titan, his girlfriend is dead, and now his leadership of the Guardians is in question\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNotable deaths/absences:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2018 Gamora truly dead and gone. No explanation given for what happened to 2014 Gamora, as she wasn\u0026rsquo;t shown being dusted. Presumably we\u0026rsquo;ll see her and Thor again in Guardians 3\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNo Vision this time, but presumably Shuri would be able to restore him sans mind stone, especially since he and Wanda are slated for a Disney+ show\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNatasha dying was sad, but she is slated for a solo movie, and EG leaves at least two outs for her coming back: one is via a Soul Stone refund as mentioned above, and another is Bruce saying he tried to bring her back when he did the snap\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn Agent Coulson appearance would have been nice, although he presumably died after the end of the last season of Agents of SHIELD. This movie also leaves Agents of SHIELD in a weird place: in the last season they had Infinity War happening concurrently with the season finale, and they delayed the start of season 6 until after Endgame, but given that they now have to live with a 5-year time gap where half the people are dead, IDK if they\u0026rsquo;ll have to adapt their scripts to that\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn future movies, they now have access to a time machine! They can\u0026rsquo;t change the past, but they can do silly things like bring back dead characters to help lol\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFuture movies also have to deal with the fact that half the population skipped ahead 5 years and also that the world is a mess. Things certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t look like a mess in the Far From Home trailer though. Presumably Peter Parker\u0026rsquo;s friends Ned, MJ and Flash all got dusted in IW so that they are all still the same age in Far From Home\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhew, I wrote a lot! I guess it\u0026rsquo;s justified given how much I liked the movie and the scale of it and everything. As I mentioned in the spoiler-free review, they could end the MCU here and it would be fine. A fitting end and tribute to the past decade of movies. I am even tempted to watch it in the cinemas a second time, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll have even more insights then!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The set is packed with planeswalkers summoned to Ravnica by Bolas\u0026rsquo;s schemes, which means mechanically that a lot of new planeswalker design space is being explored. The spoiler season was well-executed (despite some leaks during the last week), allowing us to see the story unfolding through the cards in a clearer way than ever before: from the dreadhorde invasion of Ravnica, the counterattack by the guilds, the arrival of the Amonkhet God-Eternals, and the death and betrayal that soon followed. It remains to be seen what impact the set will have on the gameplay and the meta, but from lore and flavor alone it\u0026rsquo;s already a win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEndgame #2: Avengers Endgame\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, the spoiler-free review (mirrored from \u003ca href=\"https://tumblr.roytang.net/post/184473737480/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e, I figured there\u0026rsquo;s no reason to publish there exclusively):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvengers: Endgame spoiler-free review!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI watched Endgame exactly 365 days after watching Infinity War!
