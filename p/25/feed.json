What I saw: lots of people and cars already in the streets, just like it was pre-virus. Of course this time, around 95% of people are masked. (Maybe 1 in 10 weren\u0026rsquo;t wearing their masks correctly though.). I went into the nearby Jollibee to see what it was like. Not as many people inside, and the guard took my temp told me to stand aside before later motioning me to get into a particular queue. The queues are spaced (should have taken pictures), and there\u0026rsquo;s tables in front of the cashiers to keep you from getting too close.

Basically an explosion in confirmed cases; over 50% jump from last week. Large jumps in deaths and recoveries too, thought not as alarmingly large as the cases. Regardless of the DoH\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;tardy\u0026rdquo; / \u0026ldquo;fresh\u0026rdquo; massaging of the data, it looks bad, and the explosion in cases kind of aligns with the last days of the ECQ.

The virus is still around, but both the US and my own country have gotten distracted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe US is in its second week of police brutality/black lives matters protests. Meanwhile, our government took on a sidequest of trying to enact a wide-ranging and easily abusable anti-terror bill, triggering some smaller (by comparison to the US).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven\u0026rsquo;t written about the terror bill, mainly because I haven\u0026rsquo;t had the opportunity to dig into it too deeply.

We don\u0026rsquo;t actually get that many terror attacks pulled off, the last big one was Marawi (which I heard some Congressmen citing, tbf), which was back in 2017. And that was mostly a problem with Islamic militants. I don\u0026rsquo;t hear any of the bill proponents talking about how specifically the limits on govt powers holds them back. How would these added powers prevent another Marawi? Did they actually have intel leading up to the Marawi siege that they couldn\u0026rsquo;t act on due to limited powers? I find this difficult to believe because\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewhat about the authorities\u0026rsquo; history of impunity? It\u0026rsquo;s hard to believe that they are being restricted by the law in anti-terror activities when they don\u0026rsquo;t seem to let the law get in the way for much lesser things. I guess this is the crux of the issue for most people, one of trust. Even if you say there are safeguards in the law, they are still easily abusable. The bill extends the detention period for terror suspects to I think is it 30 days, extendable? But given the speed (or lack thereof) of local courts, even if you challenge any violation of the safeguards, the challenge may take longer to resolve than the detention period. Maybe we should consider cleaning up our justice system first? People wouldn\u0026rsquo;t object if our systems were trustworthy\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, also China banned mocking their national anthem in HK, or something to that effect.

Having an open API allows me to cross-post from my site to Twitter every time I write a blog post, and also archive all my tweets from that platform back into my own site. FB API used to be a lot more open as well, but as they continued to flub their personal data management, their API got more and more closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe open API also means services like \u003ca href=\"http://rssbridge.chamallow.com/\"\u003eRSS Bridge\u003c/a\u003e can exist, allowing Twitter feeds to be followed via open formats like RSS/Atom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"twitter-moderation-is-less-evil-than-facebook-moderation\"\u003eTwitter moderation is less evil than Facebook moderation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of them are actually fairly terrible and inconsistent (surely a consequence of operating at that scale without corresponding scaling up of moderation efforts), but at least Twitter is not afraid to at least fact-check Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"twitter-has-better-public-content\"\u003eTwitter has better public content\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlright, this one might be totally subjective or anecdotal based on my own Twitter follows and setup, but I find that public discourse is generally better on Twitter compared to Facebook. It might be due to some of the factors above, and maybe some level of luck/privilege/good filtering on my part. I mean, you can find bad actors and low-quality discussions if you go looking for them, but why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not saying Twitter is perfect. There is certainly a lot of room for improvement, especially technically. But compared to Facebook, I think Twitter is much less of a garbage fire maybe because (a) I don\u0026rsquo;t feel constrained to follow mainly family and friends; Twitter feels more like it can be a window to part of the larger world; and (b) the existence of Tweetdeck and better filtering tools means I don\u0026rsquo;t have to suffer through ads or other such inanity every few posts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: It seems a bit weird to be publishing this right now when the world seems to be on fire. I follow a lot of Americans so a lot of the racism and police brutality-inspired chaos dominates my Twitter timelines at the moment (as can be seen in the Tweetdeck screenshot above). But I think this is also a good illustration of how useful Twitter\u0026rsquo;s filters and options are. If you chose to, (or needed to temporarily, for your sanity maybe?) you can probably block out these events from your timeline completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is certainly a lot of room for improvement especially from the technical side; \u003ca href=\"https://mastodon.technology\"\u003eMastodon\u003c/a\u003e comes to mind as a superior platform in this regard, but that platform doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the scale of Twitter yet, which limits the interesting interactions that can come up. I find a lot of smart and interesting interactions still happen on Twitter, so it\u0026rsquo;s not yet something I\u0026rsquo;m willing to give up.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The tardy ones are the ones that were delayed by 4 or more days due to validation or some other reason.

Only a two week MECQ transition period, and not really any time to evaluate what the effect that has had on the case numbers.

Basically, many states are responding to protests against police brutality with\u0026hellip; police brutality. Bold move Cotton. I\u0026rsquo;m not an American, but this resonates with me a lot because to see this kind of thing happening in a country that purports to champion human rights, how much worse can it be in a country like ours or a dictatorship like China where they don\u0026rsquo;t even give lip service to the concept?

I give my support to those protesting, and hope they achieve the reforms their country needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne would question why I (and maybe the world) focuses so much on what happens in the USA, given that violence and brutality happen in a lot of other countries too.

It should punish Black people who break the law, but protect cops who break the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a meaningful difference between reactionary and progressive, left and right. It\u0026rsquo;s the difference of property rights vs human rights ‚Äì whether you exact the right to hoard while others starve, or the right not to starve while others hoard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s the difference between pluralism and elitism: whether you think some of us were born to be ruled over, or whether you think we should have a government selected by its people to serve those people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s the difference of equal protections and duties under the law, as opposed to impunity for the powerful and the legalized oppression of the powerless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis resonates with me a lot because \u0026ldquo;equal protections under the law\u0026rdquo; may be a pretty big ask in this country when individual citizens find it difficult to apply judgement equally to both those they support and those they don\u0026rsquo;t. Double standards abound, both for the government and many of the citizens. There are a lot of people in this country who support the people in power blindly because of some form of tribalism; they chose this person so they feel they have to support them no matter what, no matter how incompetent, no matter how blatant the abuses are, and so on. It\u0026rsquo;s a weird case of trying to justify a purchase after the fact, even if it turned out to be horrible, out of some sense of pride, maybe? People hate being wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m reminded of someone I used to know who was an avid supporter of a particular candidate during the 2016 elections. Whenever he would fail to convince us of the merits of his candidate (or be unable to answer our concerns about his human rights record, etc), he would simply say \u0026ldquo;you guys just don\u0026rsquo;t trust him\u0026rdquo;. Which is a really weird thing to say because why trust any politician based on anything other than his track record and what he says or does? It always felt like he had already decided to trust this candidate and that nothing else mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like so many people in this country are so used to our politicians taking advantage of them that they have become hostage to this form of \u0026ldquo;rule\u0026rdquo;: ordinary people are subject to the harshness of the law, while for those in power, the law must be \u0026ldquo;tempered with compassion\u0026rdquo;. Being progressive and believing in pluralism in this country requires that we challenge those norms wherever we can, that we hold the powerful to account, regardless of political affiliation. It can be challenging to get people to look beyond their tribalistic nature, but it\u0026rsquo;s something we need to figure out if we are to survive and evolve as a truly democratic \u0026ldquo;rule of law\u0026rdquo; society and not devolve into some kind of right-wing populist authoritarian \u0026ldquo;rule of men\u0026rdquo; wasteland (if we aren\u0026rsquo;t already there yet).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing back to the Doctorow quote (which I\u0026rsquo;ve already strayed from a bit\u0026hellip; the last few paragraphs turned out a little ranty about the state of the country, but I\u0026rsquo;ve actually already rewritten it a couple of times to be\u0026hellip; less ranty I guess?), this model of how \u0026ldquo;the right\u0026rdquo; thinks can be a useful tool when engaging in debate or discussion with others (something I am less inclined to do these days). The two sides of this model are mostly incompatible, thus when discussing with anyone you can ask yourself (or them directly) which side of that divide they lie on. (I don\u0026rsquo;t imagine anyone would say out loud they believe people in power deserve special treatment, because that sounds absurd. Or evil. But that might just be the leftist perspective in me.) Whether they agree with you or not, at the very least it gives you a model in which to frame further discussion, or even to decide whether further discussion would even be worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisclaimer 1: Doctorow is of course primarily left-leaning, hence his bias towards these definitions. It would be interesting to see what the equivalent definitions would be on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisclaimer 2: Every individual is slightly different. I use \u0026ldquo;the right\u0026rdquo; in quotes here to indicate that the generalizations are describing a significant subset of people who might consider themselves \u0026ldquo;right-wing\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;conservative\u0026rdquo; or whatnot. I use this label more for this particular way of thinking rather than a political alignment. (And I dislike labelling people anyway, as much as possible.)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve basically been using GMail as my main email account since I first got access in 2006ish. \u0026ldquo;Main email account\u0026rdquo; means I use it as the primary access point for all my other online accounts. GMail was certainly revolutionary when it came out, and had a lot of benefits: it was fast, easily searchable and had a lot of free storage. But in the modern day, there are significant disadvantages to using GMail:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eyou don\u0026rsquo;t control your account; it\u0026rsquo;s rare, but anecdotally people have lost access to their GMail accounts for some perceived infraction, and when that happens you have no way of recovery or appeal\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eyou\u0026rsquo;re fueling a surveillance capitalism machine\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eit can \u003ca href=\"/2020/05/1263160405737607170/\"\u003elook unprofessional\u003c/a\u003e to be using free email, especially for official or business correspondence\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first bullet point is the biggie for me. One such story came across the Hacker News front page a while back and I can only imagine the nightmare it would be for me to lose access to my Google account. Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve started a conscious effort to slowly but surely decouple myself from my dependencies on Google Services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat meant migrating my online accounts to use another email, primarily one I control. I already had this domain \u003ca href=\"https://roytang.net\"\u003eroytang.net\u003c/a\u003e, so there\u0026rsquo;s no reason to not use emails with that domain. The only risk to using an email on your own domain is that if you forgot to renew your domain, or otherwise lose control, you are screwed. So\u0026hellip; don\u0026rsquo;t let that happen I guess?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only question was what email service provider to use? I\u0026rsquo;m still on Webfaction hosting, and they do provide email accounts, but I\u0026rsquo;m planning to move away from them before the end of the year \u003ca href=\"/2019/03/rip-webfaction/\"\u003edue to the GoDaddy purchase\u003c/a\u003e, so probably best not to be reliant on their email service. If I wanted more control over the risks, I could of course run my own mail servers, but I\u0026rsquo;m not ready to go that far yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first one I tried was \u003ca href=\"https://protonmail.com/\"\u003eProtonMail\u003c/a\u003e because yay, end-to-end encryption! I used it for a couple of months first before paying for anything (using a custom domain email requires a paid plan). Unfortunately, I felt like the additional security wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth the trouble of not being super portable. Accessing via mobile required their app, can\u0026rsquo;t use any generic email client. I also wanted to be able to access via a desktop client like Thunderbird or Mail on the Macbook Air, but that required some sort of SMTP bridge, and it seemed like a bother. Every time I set up a new machine I\u0026rsquo;d need it? I\u0026rsquo;m not super security-conscious, so I decided to keep the protonmail account as a secondary account, in case I did come to a situation where e2e encryption was absolutely critical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI next tried \u003ca href=\"https://www.migadu.com\"\u003emigadu.com\u003c/a\u003e as an email provider, based on \u003ca href=\"https://cmpwn.com/@sir/102452352875414214\"\u003ethis recommendation thread\u003c/a\u003e by Drew Devault over on Mastodon. Their web settings aren\u0026rsquo;t super refined, but everything was relatively easy to setup. And their free tier includes support for custom domains and multiple mailboxes per domain, so that\u0026rsquo;s a big plus. I\u0026rsquo;ve been using them now for a few months and am generally happy with the service. (They did have a short bout of server access issues around the time the covid19 thing started getting around, but they resolved it pretty quickly.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter choosing an email service provider, the next step was setting up emails and shifting over all my online accounts. Migadu\u0026rsquo;s support for unlimited mailboxes meant I could have separate email addresses for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003econtact email for other online accounts\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epublicly accessible contact email on the website\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eprivate email for communication with friends\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eetc\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ended up updating over 50 online accounts to point to the new domain email. Not all in one go, as that\u0026rsquo;s terribly boring, but a few at a time over the course of the last few months. That covers social media services, gaming services, financial services, dev tools, and so on. The upside of all this effort is I got to do a kind of audit of all my online accounts, which ones could be deleted/deactivated, which ones needed new passwords, which ones have poor security measures, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheoretically, I only need to do this once. An advantage to using custom domain emails is that if you\u0026rsquo;re unhappy with your underlying email provider, you can switch to a different one while retaining the same email addresses, no need to update emails in all your other online accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, I had no intention of using webmail anymore, so I ended up installing Thunderbird (it\u0026rsquo;s been a while old friend) for accessing these accounts, and also set up the Mail app on the Macbook Air. For the phone, I installed K-9 mail, although I\u0026rsquo;m having an issue with that currently where it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be doing background syncing of mails. Not a super critical issue, as I mostly don\u0026rsquo;t want to be pinged real-time by email anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m still keeping the GMail account of course, a lot of people still know me by that email address, but now I have a largely reduced footprint and dependency on it. And as mentioned, I\u0026rsquo;m also keeping the ProtonMail account for any security-conscious communications. So I ended up having to manage a lot more email addresses, but hopefully everything will be a bit more organized, with every account having a specific purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA while back I got an export of my Foursquare/Swarm data. If you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar, these were a pair of apps that were used for \u0026ldquo;checking-in\u0026rdquo; to particular locations, with a sort of gamification system where if you checked in at a place often enough, you would earn points and eventually become \u0026ldquo;Mayor\u0026rdquo; of the venue. The idea being that owners of those venues might give some benefits to those who check-in often at those locations (AFAIK, this never really caught on in the Philippines). I wasn\u0026rsquo;t a super active user of Foursquare/Swarm, I had maybe 500ish check-ins from 2010-2017 when I stopped using it. Some people are still using it up to now and have thousands of check-ins, although as far as I can tell it\u0026rsquo;s no longer very popular in the Philippines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I thought having this data would be handy so I put it up as location data on this site. It also gave me an excuse to figure out how to render OpenStreetMap. (The location pages are one of the few pages that have JavaScript on this site.) The \u003ca href=\"/locations/\"\u003elocations page\u003c/a\u003e shows a map of all the visited locations and a listing of the locations grouped by country, and for the Philippines, by city (where available). You can click through to individual locations to see how often I\u0026rsquo;ve checked in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, one of the venues with the most number of check-ins for me is \u003ca href=\"/locations/4d27f36c8292236a41e814bb/\"\u003eBBQ Chicken\u003c/a\u003e, a now-closed Korean-themed BBQ chicken place in Ortigas near where I used to work. Another one with a lot of check-ins would be \u003ca href=\"/locations/4bbbfea5ed7776b032413f51/\"\u003eMurphy\u0026rsquo;s in Makati\u003c/a\u003e where we did a lot of quiz nights from 2011-2013. Obviously, the location data isn\u0026rsquo;t complete and doesn\u0026rsquo;t capture all my visits, since I didn\u0026rsquo;t use Foursquare/Swarm that religiously anyway. I\u0026rsquo;m certain I\u0026rsquo;ve eaten at BBQ Chicken more than the 18 times I checked in!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-about-privacy\"\u003eWhat about privacy?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually telling the internet where you are all the time might seem a bit anathema to the more privacy-conscious modern world, but I do like having a history of where I\u0026rsquo;ve been. I even have location tracking enabled on my phone via Google Maps so that I can have a timeline of where I am on a day-by-day basis. I\u0026rsquo;ve used it more than once to answer queries like \u0026ldquo;do you know if we went to \u003cplace\u003e in \u003cmonth\u003e of last year?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;When did you last go to \u003cstore\u003e ?\u0026rdquo; Obviously it\u0026rsquo;s not for everyone and I fully understand the privacy ramifications of Google having all my location data and feeding the mightly global surveillance capitalism machine, but for me right now it\u0026rsquo;s an acceptable tradeoff. As for the foursquare data, I was using foursquare back when I was less privacy-conscious that I am now, so I my attitude is like, that particular dataset has been out in the world for years, I can\u0026rsquo;t put the toothpaste back in the bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, I did scrub some old check-ins from this data (and the corresponding data on Swarm and on Twitter if it was cross-posted)) that was a bit too close to home. I know this data potentially allows bad guys or assassins or whatnot to figure out where I live, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d at least make it a tiny bit more difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-now\"\u003eWhat now?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is just a neat little thing that probably only I will care about, as it lets me see some of the places I\u0026rsquo;ve been to. And I probably won\u0026rsquo;t be using 4sq/Swarm again, so the dataset probably won\u0026rsquo;t be growing. That being said, I do want to add some future features like grouping the check-ins according to trips, so I can see all the particular places where I went to on particular trips. Many of my trips are missing data though; for example, my only check-in in France was in the airport, and not at any of the touristy places we went to. I may try to supplement this data with selected extracts from my Google Maps location history (hopefully it\u0026rsquo;s easy to figure out!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also don\u0026rsquo;t know where to put the locations page in the menus lol. I\u0026rsquo;ll figure it out sooner or later!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
