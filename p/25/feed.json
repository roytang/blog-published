            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eNothing in the cinema this month (going to the cinema is expensive!). I did watch a couple of animated movies this month:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDragonball Super: Broly. I have some vague recollection of watching the original Broly movie, and I believe this one is much better. DBS Broly is a slightly more nuanced character than just \u0026ldquo;random raging monster\u0026rdquo; from the previous non-canon movie. The animation was okay, you could tell the animators were having fun with some of the battle parts. Also, I watched the English dub, and I just realized Goku\u0026rsquo;s voice is super annoying, so I pity the Americans who had to grow up with that voice.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eJustice League vs the Fatal Five. I\u0026rsquo;m still a bit behind on the DC animated stuff. I liked this one because I think it handled Jessica Cruz fairly well, and it got me backreading Justice League Odyssey for more Cruz.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTV-wise, since I got a \u003ca href=\"/2019/11/new-video-card/\"\u003enew video card\u003c/a\u003e and have a second monitor again, side-watching is back on the menu, so I was able to catch up with some of the ongoing series: Modern Family (meh), Simpsons (meh), Rick and Morty (ok so far, only 3 eps in).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught Season 3 of The Toys That Made Us on Netflix. Not as fun as S2 for me since that one had Transformers, and I only have secondary interest at best in the toylines for S4, but some of the stories here were pretty interesting, like they say that the giant robot from Japanese Spider-Man was the one that inspired sentai robots! What! The TMNT ep was also pretty good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArrowverse is still going on (somehow), with their upcoming big-deal Crisis crossover kicking off in mid December. Surprisingly, Arrow itself has been pretty good this season (perhaps because no Felicity? lol), followed by Flash, with Supergirl dead last. I am not fond of Lena\u0026rsquo;s heel turn in Supergirl, I felt like it was a disservice to the character who when introduced was desperate to get out of her brother\u0026rsquo;s shadow. I haven\u0026rsquo;t been watching Batwoman, even though it\u0026rsquo;s part of the crossover, we\u0026rsquo;ll see what happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI managed to watch the first ep of Mandalorian, but haven\u0026rsquo;t had time yet for the most recent eps. It\u0026rsquo;s not the sort of thing I\u0026rsquo;d side-watch, so I have to dedicate time for it. I better do that before the spoilers catch up with me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext month I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCrisis on Infinite Earths\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStar Wars: Rise of the Skywalker\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",

I guess minor spoilers follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummary: A reasonable Fallout-esque RPG from the makers of Fallout: New Vegas. It\u0026rsquo;s not as expansive or quite as nonlinear as their previous games, but it\u0026rsquo;s pretty serviceable and there\u0026rsquo;s a reasonable amount of stuff to do. A decent purchase, though I chafe at buying games at full $60 price these days lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy notes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esetting is a far future corporate dystopia in a remote human colony. Or at least, a caricature of a corporate dystopia. Your main enemies are evil corporations, which appeals to my recent disdain for capitalism. There are no intelligent alien races to interact with, but plently of wild animals\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe space map shows something like 6-7 inhabited planets in the cluster, but you really only interact with 3-4 of them so that\u0026rsquo;s disappointing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethere are some gorgeous environments on those planets though\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efeels a bit like Fallout, with the general aesthetic hewing closely to Fallout\u0026rsquo;s 40s/50s vibe. Even the loading screens and movie advertisements are throwbacks to monster flicks from that era.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ealso feels a bit like Mass Effect, mainly with you getting a ship and the shuffling between worlds and the companion system\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI would say the companions are not as fleshed out as the Mass Effect ones though. Some of them are a lot less fleshed out than others. One of them is basically just a cleaning robot that you stuck a gun to, and he has no further storyline. Also, tbere is no companion romance option, but completing companion questlines unlocks an extra perk for them (though this isn\u0026rsquo;t clearly indicated when it happens, you have to check their status screen)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePhineas Welles gives a strong Rick Sanchez vibe\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt isn\u0026rsquo;t a true open world, more like a forest of smaller open world areas\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere are a lot of quests to do, at least at the start, and they do a good job of putting the other quests in your path so that you naturally feel like you\u0026rsquo;re running into them. Towards the last third of the game, new quests seem to taper off though\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eActually, by the last third of the game, everything felt a bit same-y. I was definitely less enthused to play towards the end.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCombat especially doesn\u0026rsquo;t have much variation. Either enemies run at you with melee weapons or shoot at you from afar etc. I wish I used a more sniper-rifle style with scoped hunting rifles, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t. There is a version of VATS (which only you can use so somehow its a superpower), but it\u0026rsquo;s more like a bullet time effect to help you aim\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI like the voice acting, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty decent, although as always it\u0026rsquo;s noticeable when multiple NPCs have the same VA\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLoad time between areas can be a bit horrendous, sometimes as long as 1-2 minutes, or does it only feel that way?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt feels like you earn a lot of money, but there isn\u0026rsquo;t really anything to spend it on. There\u0026rsquo;s no reason to buy anything from shops, you\u0026rsquo;ll get more than you ever need just from looting and picking up stuff.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a respec machine on your ship, which is cool, since it means you can commit skill points without too much fear of screwing up. However, I never really felt the need to respec during my run. I did respec after finishing the game to do some achievements though.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLevel cap is 30. I did all the quests I could and I got to the cap before the point of no return, so that was annoying. I even went with nonviolent solutions a lot of the time, so if you were one of those guys who like to kill all the enemies instead, you\u0026rsquo;ll hit the level cap even earlier. You won\u0026rsquo;t be able to max a lot of skills. I like to be a \u0026ldquo;jack of all trades\u0026rdquo; kind of guy, so my skill distribution was fairly spread out and I was only able to max one skill.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFor some reason, the game has a plethora of consumable items. I suspect these are mainly to support the hardest difficulty (supernova), as on normal difficulty there was never any reason to use a consumable other than the standard \u0026ldquo;Heal X HP\u0026rdquo; item.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finished the game yesteday, on normal difficulty. I actually started out on hard, but then, surprise, I had a hard time at the start. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be too stressed so I downgraded to medium for the rest of the run. I got the \u0026ldquo;good ending\u0026rdquo;, that is to say, the one where you \u0026ldquo;defeat\u0026rdquo; the corporate master class, such as they are. Normal difficulty is relatively stress-free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI usually want to go for 100% achievement completion, but this game had one that requires finishing on the highest difficulty, so that\u0026rsquo;s another run altogether. Presumably the second run would be much faster since I don\u0026rsquo;t have to do everything any more. I might get around to it someday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScreenshots follow!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Even we the citizens have little respect for rules and laws and try to skip around them when we can. This is why we have fixers, and connections, and patronage. We trade on favors to get us out of trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if needed to be said, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t saying that literally every single person participates in fixing and patronage to get around the rules. Most probably only a minority ever do so. The majority try to just keep their heads down and live their lives, and in doing so, they tolerate those who do participate in such corruption of the rules. This is what I meant, that we as a culture, are too tolerant of such activities, even sometimes praising those who manage to circumvent rules or laws as \u0026ldquo;madiskarte\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTangential story time: Some time ago, I was visiting with people in another area, and the conversation turned to one of the people present who had run for public office (councilor) some years ago, and he was asked why he didn\u0026rsquo;t win. His answer: \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Wala e, mas malakas maglagay yung kalaban.\u0026quot;\u003c/em\u003e  (The opponent was better at bribing voters.) The response elicited laughter from those around. Whether the response was based on fact or merely a speculative joke, the way it is discussed so casually and even among people they barely knew (me) is reflective of how we have normalized corruption in our society. There is no shame associated with it, it is talked about openly as a fact of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to say, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t want to make a scene, I\u0026rsquo;ll just keep quiet and live my life, and I\u0026rsquo;ll be a good citizen and I won\u0026rsquo;t participate in corruption myself,\u0026rdquo; but even if you do so, systemic corruption still affects you. Even if you\u0026rsquo;re an informal worker who doesn\u0026rsquo;t pay taxes; the cost of corruption isn\u0026rsquo;t only in lost taxes, it\u0026rsquo;s in lost public services and opportunities lost to connections and patronage. Normalized corruption also means more rules need to be introduced to rein it in, and more rules means more people want to try to break those rules, leading to some kind of vicious cycle. The increased red tape brought about by corruption even feeds the beast and inconveniences the rest of us who just want to be good citizens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven our current leadership, I had been thinking recently about what an actual good administration would look like. In my view, the point of presidency shouldn\u0026rsquo;t just be to execute the laws, but to provide an example of leadership for the people, in that he/she inspires the people to be better. I don\u0026rsquo;t yet know how it can be done, but for any one president to be able to turn this country around, he needs to be able to inspire the citizenry to not just be good citizens, but to be better than that. A great president will need to understand that the success of his term doesn\u0026rsquo;t depend solely on him and his appointees, but rather on each citizen taking a stand against the normalized corruption in our culture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis might be a bit difficult for a president limited to a six year term, certainly a lot of political will is needed. And not the kind that you \u003ca href=\"/2016/11/10155101341788912/\"\u003esquander on political favors\u003c/a\u003e. A tall order, but we as a country should be better for the trying. Again, maybe someday.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIt was a bit more than a year ago that I decided to \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/site-migration-from-wordpress-to-hugo/\"\u003ehaphazardly and suddenly migrate from Wordpress to Hugo\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s a good time to look back and reflect on that decision and consider where we are now, and how to move forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI am extremely happy with the site\u0026rsquo;s browser performance. It currently scores an insanely high 96 on \u003ca href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Froytang.net\"\u003eGoogle\u0026rsquo;s Pagespeed tool\u003c/a\u003e, and I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I I know how to close the remaining 4% gap. (I just need to get around to it.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003egenerally all the advantages listed in the original post a year ago. I\u0026rsquo;m particularly happy with managing the posts through the file system, especially with a decent editor like VS Code. I don\u0026rsquo;t miss Wordpress\u0026rsquo;s clunky editor at all.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBad:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe main sticking point right now is that the build time is really high. I have a Travis build script setup that automatically builds the hugo site from source whenever I push a new commit, then the output is committed to a second repo, which is the one deployed to the live site every 15 minutes. This build right now takes on average around 8 mins, which is ridiculous. The hugo build itself takes around 3 mins, the rest is copying files and git clones and push and so on. The build times really skyrocketed when I did the \u003ca href=\"/2019/10/archive-of-my-own/\"\u003esocial media archiving\u003c/a\u003e, since the number of markdown files skyrocketed from around 1000 to almost 16,000. For sure, a lot of it is the fault of the theme I am using on this site, because I am adding a lot of features like static comments, image resizing, monthly archives, a bunch of taxonomies, and so on. I don\u0026rsquo;t blame Hugo at all, and I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure any other static site generator would simply choke on the amount of posts I have. There are surely a lot of optimizations that can be done, but even if I manage to pare down the template generation to bare minimum, I am most probably hitting the limits on disk I/O. As mentioned in \u003ca href=\"https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/performance-expectations-for-large-number-of-pages/21887\"\u003ethis discussion I had on the Hugo forums\u003c/a\u003e, simply copying the entire content folder already takes 30 seconds on my local computer, so that is the bare minimum I could go. This is not an intolerable problem, but it means I don\u0026rsquo;t have immediate feedback when I push a post, it can take at least 15 minutes or more for recent changes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere are also a number of dynamic features I want to implement, which are impossible with just a static website. I have a python web app backing the static hugo site which I use for things like search, comments, and so on, but basically there is nontrivial effort when I want to implement new things. This is even less of an issue than the last one, mostly because I enjoy working with Python anyway lol.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe build performance is such a big issue for me that I briefly considered the option of migrating back to Wordpress. Ha! I\u0026rsquo;m not ruling it out, but the fact is I find managing posts through the Wordpress interface to be extremely clunky, especially compared to my current set up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother option would be to write my own database-backed webapp. This is something I\u0026rsquo;ve done before after all, and again, I enjoy working on Python anyway. But it\u0026rsquo;s a lot of work, so maybe shelve that for now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving forward, I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to stay with my current static hugo + dynamic python support, and try to optimize the build time as much as I can. I will probably be on the look out for possible alternative solutions, some other blogging software perhaps, or some other hybrid approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThis is a follow up to my previous \u003ca href=\"/2019/08/the-great-memory-scare-of-2019/\"\u003eposts\u003c/a\u003e about my \u003ca href=\"/2019/09/two-backups/\"\u003e2019 PC troubles\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was still encountering game crashes even after reinstalling the OS, so the most likely culprits now were either the video card or the power supply. I sent the video card over to my brother for him to test on his PC to see if he encountered the same symptoms. Sure enough, he couldn\u0026rsquo;t even run the 3DMARK Time Spy test without immediately crashing, which was the same when it was on my PC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince then I\u0026rsquo;ve been running on onboard graphics only, which luckily could still handle things like Starcraft II, Magic Arena and Eternal. Oh, and I had to live on a single monitor, like a savage!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI began canvassing last month for a new video card. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to get anything super expensive, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d keep the budget under 10k PHP (around $200). I also have a preference for NVidia/GeForce since the one time I tried an AMD I had an overclocking issue and had to replace the card within a couple of months (this was almost entirely my fault though!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven that, the best (most recent) NVidia card in my price range was this year\u0026rsquo;s GTX1650. Unfortunately, reviews said this was not good value for money, as it was comparable in performance to the older and slightly cheaper AMD RX570 card. I also looked at a couple of cards above my budget line, namely the recently released GTX1650 Super and GTX1660 Super. The price difference between the two wasn\u0026rsquo;t too high, so I figured the 1660S was a better deal overall, but it was around $100 more expensive than the RX570.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the choice now was the cheaper RX570, which would be an upgrade anyway over my old GTX 970, or the more expensive GTX 1660 Super. Getting the more expensive card was a bit more future proof, but the problem is that this rig overall is already going on 4 years old, so I might need to upgrade everything again in a couple of years anyway. I figured it was better to get the cheaper card first then decide a few years down the line whether I needed a complete refresh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, when I checked my nearby PC part stores, neither the RX570 nor the GTX1660S were in stock. (The first one due to high demand, the second due to maybe being too new?). Against my instincts, I decided to just order online from Lazada.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not yet a fan of buying electronics online in the Philippines. Online purchases for me are fine for digital products or physical things that are relatively cheap. But for expensive electronics, I have some anxiety that there\u0026rsquo;s so much that could go wrong. And I had some friends with bad stories about shady/sloppy Lazada sellers too. I also prefer getting my components from a store because (a) I don\u0026rsquo;t have to wait for delivery; and (b) I can ask them to test the part right there and then to make sure no issues before I bring it home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this case I had no choice, so online it was. Luckily, I found that one of my nearby PC part stores EasyPC was also a Lazada seller, and they had RX570 in stock online. I settled on a Gigabyte 4GB RX570, then waited the requisite number of days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe package arrived yesterday, a day earlier than predicted. I unboxed it and set about installing the card. I have some anxiety as well about installing PC parts myself, as I\u0026rsquo;m always worried that I\u0026rsquo;ll do some damage via static electricity or my sweat dropping down into the PC case or something like that. But this time went smoothly. These new video cards are nice because they have back plates making them easier to grip. The only problem I encountered was that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have an extra screw to pin the card unto the back of the case (I\u0026rsquo;ll get one later).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, plugged the card into pci-e, connect the 8-pin power connector, plug in both monitors, then boot! Success! I got my 2nd monitor back!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI installed the latest AMD drivers, then to verify everything was fine, I ran the 3DMARK Timespy benchmark test. The test scored my system at \u003ca href=\"https://www.3dmark.com/spy/9343394\"\u003earound 3600+\u003c/a\u003e, which wasn\u0026rsquo;t too bad. Comparing to results using my old card and the same CPU, those scores were around 1700+, so there\u0026rsquo;s a significant improvement. With the 1650, it would have been 3600+ as well. The results said I\u0026rsquo;m only better than 19% of all results, but that\u0026rsquo;s ok, I\u0026rsquo;m not looking for super high end graphics at super high resolutions and I rarely care about framerate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext were the game tests!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStarcraft II at Ultra settings: No crashes! Which is great, since all of this started with SC2 anyway\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStreet Fighter V: Smooth! I had tried SFV before with onboard graphics, but it was basically super slow.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTales of Berseria: Smooth! I chose this game because I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to play it. It didn\u0026rsquo;t do too well with the onboard graphics either.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDragon Ball Fighter Z: Smooth!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlright, everything looks good! I\u0026rsquo;ll probably be testing the card with a few other games over the weekend, but otherwise everything looks great!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Recently I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing it in the afternoons or early evenings, but walking in the mornings has the distinct advantage that if for some reason I am unable to do it (maybe because I was super tired from the previous day, or the weather doesn\u0026rsquo;t cooperate, or just plain laziness), I have the rest of the day to catch up on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis of course assuming I am able to wake up early enough. I don\u0026rsquo;t use an alarm anymore nowadays, I find that that I don\u0026rsquo;t need to. I\u0026rsquo;m not one of those people who don\u0026rsquo;t understand how morning people can exist; I don\u0026rsquo;t have a problem naturally waking up early in the morning, unless I\u0026rsquo;m in one of my extended \u003ca href=\"/2019/08/out-of-sync-with-the-world/\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;out of sync with the world\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e phases (in which case I have a bigger problem). Lately my sleep cycle has been pretty good. I\u0026rsquo;m able to naturally wake up early even though I usually go to sleep past 12. (I simply catch up with a couple more hours sleep after breakfast.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Philippines isn\u0026rsquo;t one of those countries where sunrise time varies greatly depending on the season. Dawn usually breaks sometime between 5-6 am, even this late in the year. So walking outside at this time gives you the chance to see the sky transition from a drab night gray to whatever color it wants to be that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe streets aren\u0026rsquo;t very busy at 5 AM, though some of the usually busy intersections already have a short queue, a hint of things to come for the days ahead. And even at this early hour, school buses are up and about picking up kids. At 5AM! What time are those kids waking up, 4:30? That\u0026rsquo;s insane. When I was in grade school, I think the earliest I got up was around 5:30, and even then I was basically a zombie that my mom had to drag to the sink so she could splash some water on my face. I understand that these days in Metro Manila, early pickups are necessary due to the traffic situation, but I really feel for those kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA number of establishments are already open at 5AM, including the neighborhood bakery, the nearby Jollibee (24 hrs) and Starbucks (I think also 24 hrs)? On the streets there are already jeeps queued up and filling with passengers, again waking up early to face the menace of Metro Manila traffic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy walk usually takes around 45 minutes. It\u0026rsquo;s not quite the \u0026ldquo;recommended\u0026rdquo; 10k daily steps that I used to be able to do, but we\u0026rsquo;ll get there someday. For now, I turn down the road leading back to our subdivision and look forward to breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The Play Design team supposedly looks at sets around a year before release, so responsibility for the failures in playtesting that led to the unbalanced environments in 2018 and 2019 largely fall on them. They came out with an article yesterday \u003ca href=\"https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/play-design-lessons-learned-2019-11-18\"\u003eacknowledging the shortcomings of Play Design\u003c/a\u003e, so at least they are aware and taking responsibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the bannings are caused by one or more of the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003echeating on mana costs (aetherworks marvel, once upon a time)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esuper pushed cards (oko, veil of summer, smuggler\u0026rsquo;s copter)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003elinear, parasitic mechanics they didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to balance (energy)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ecards that faced less opposition after rotation (field of the dead)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, if I were the play design team, I would pay special attention to these things as they pass through play testing:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e3 mana planeswalkers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003echeating on mana costs\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003enew mechanics, especially linear, parasitic mechanics\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ecards that generate free resources for no additional cost (field of the dead)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ecards whose answers are rotating out\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days I really only play Standard on Magic Arena, not much on paper, but it\u0026rsquo;s still interesting to follow.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t use \u003ca href=\"https://www.inoreader.com/\"\u003eInoreader\u003c/a\u003e anymore, but a recent blog post of theirs recently appeared in my feeds that mentioned \u003ca href=\"https://blog.inoreader.com/2019/11/new-feature-sort-by-magic-and-article-popularity-indicators.html\"\u003ethey implemented \u0026ldquo;sort by magic\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e. This was a feature that \u003ca href=\"/2009/10/5149594629/\"\u003eGoogle reader had 10 YEARS AGO\u003c/a\u003e! There hasn\u0026rsquo;t been much innovation in the feed reader space in the last decade it seems, which is totally understandable given they are mostly tools used by internet \u0026ldquo;power users\u0026rdquo;, and mostly by older netheads, so the target market isn\u0026rsquo;t very large.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I talk about \u0026ldquo;feeds\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;feed readers\u0026rdquo;, I\u0026rsquo;m not talking only about RSS and the associated readers, but anything that lets me aggregate contents from a set of sources. This includes most social media streams (Twitter, etc), I guess Indieweb microformats readers (though I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried these a lot), and apps like \u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/\"\u003eFlipboard\u003c/a\u003e (which I typically use for my morning news).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecently I installed a self-hosted \u003ca href=\"https://tt-rss.org/\"\u003eTiny Tiny RSS\u003c/a\u003e to take the place of my primary RSS feed reader. I also previously tried Inoreader and Feedly. The jump to TTRSS was mostly to avoid the free account limitations on those services. TTRSS is fine and it\u0026rsquo;s serviceable, but there\u0026rsquo;s still a lot of improvement I would like. I think about feed reader features a lot because (a) I like reading content from a wide variety of sources and feed readers help me do that; and (b) even back when Google Reader was still around I was kicking around the idea of writing my own feed reader. It\u0026rsquo;s one of those side projects that I want to build for myself but never get around to it. I\u0026rsquo;ll note down a couple of features I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about in the past decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first flaw I find in most readers (including social media feeds) is that they typically treat all feeds the same way. In reality, I would like to be able to treat some feeds differently. I can think of at least two categories:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efeeds where I don\u0026rsquo;t mind missing some of their content (since I don\u0026rsquo;t always have time to read), and don\u0026rsquo;t mind just browsing their latest content like a magazine. Flipboard is great for this. Most social media feeds on the other hand seem to want to pull you away from this model by having their feeds be \u0026ldquo;algorithmic\u0026rdquo;. And for traditional RSS readers, having unread counts for this type of feed doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense, and only annoys me and my compulsive need for zero unread counts.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efeeds where I don\u0026rsquo;t want to miss any of their content. Maybe because it\u0026rsquo;s a particular source that I enjoy reading, or because it\u0026rsquo;s a feed I set up for notification purposes or such, or maybe the source is an events page where I want to know all the events they set up. Basically feeds that have a high signal-to-noise ratio for me (although ideally all the feeds I follow have high S/N ratio.) For this kind of feed, the unread counts in traditional RSS readers make sense.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI imagine there could be some in-between categories as well, possibly customizable. Something like a feed where I have unread counts, but also automatically mark as read articles that are too old? IDK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered this when I realized I could import my \u003ca href=\"https://roytang.net/2019/08/1167000875090378752/\"\u003eYoutube subscriptions as RSS\u003c/a\u003e. That gave me a whole lot of new feeds to follow, but I realized it was kind of a waste of time because most of the channels I follow are there for me to browse through when I\u0026rsquo;m looking for entertainment, but usually not the kind of content I want to regularly appear in my feeds. (So they\u0026rsquo;re under the first type.) Importing them basically added a lot of noise to my feed reader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFacebook actually had something like you could add friends to a \u0026ldquo;Close Friends\u0026rdquo; list, and their posts would be prioritized for you and appear in your notification bar. I don\u0026rsquo;t FB much anymore, so IDK if this feature is still around, but as I recall you can\u0026rsquo;t use it with Pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother feature I\u0026rsquo;d like is grouping posts by topic, or the ability to highlight \u0026ldquo;related stories\u0026rdquo; for an article from other sources that I\u0026rsquo;m also following. For example, if there\u0026rsquo;s some breaking news story, and the article about this from NewsSourceA appears in my feed, I could maybe see a link to related articles about the same topic from NewsSourceB, NewsSourceC, and so on that I also follow. Or maybe choose to mark the topic as read or block further content about this topic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is one of my major grips when using Flipboard, especially for the \u0026ldquo;Latest news\u0026rdquo; sections. There\u0026rsquo;ll be like 5 different articles about the latest Trump meltdown, and I encounter them at different points in the feed. I don\u0026rsquo;t mind reading about Trump meltdowns, but it would be more efficient if I could have each instance only appear in my feeds once. I understand this may be a bit challenging since it involves some automated content analysis though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must admit I haven\u0026rsquo;t explored too much the paid features of services like Feedly or Inoreader, so maybe they support something similar to these features already. (I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s unlikely though. And I\u0026rsquo;m not really up for paying the monthly fees haha.) In addition to traditional RSS readers though, I\u0026rsquo;d also like my reader to be able to support following other kinds of sources like social media, ActivityStreams-compliant streams (Mastodon, etc), microformats feeds, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe someday I\u0026rsquo;ll get around to finally building that feed reader I wanted for myself!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

In the old days, if you weren\u0026rsquo;t at the meetup point at the appointed time, you knew the other party was standing there tapping their feet impatiently not knowing whether you were actually still coming, so it was much more of a big deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

As the months went on, the stakes have escalated in the wake of widespread anger at the way the police are brutally cracking down on protests. Many incidents of violence have been reported, mainly from the police, but some from the protestors as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not from Hong Kong, but I admit some fondness for the British territory - I\u0026rsquo;ve \u003ca href=\"/tags/hong-kong\"\u003etravelled there a few times\u003c/a\u003e and I worked for a Hong-Kong based company for more than a decade, so I know quite a number of people working there even now. I was hesitant to write down my thoughts on the current crisis, as things were moving and escalating quickly, and there was a good chance that whatever I write might be overtaken by events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand in support of the protestors, and I am hopeful that they succeed, although I am not optimistic. They are standing against China, the fascist juggernaut of the modern world, and the odds of victory are low. This week, the police have laid siege to university campuses, and recently the \u003ca href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/hong-kong-university-campus-like-a-warzone-as-night-time-battle-breaks-out-20191113-p53a1f.html\"\u003epolice have evacuated mainland students\u003c/a\u003e from HK, which seems to me as an indication that we are nearing some kind of tipping point, something akin to 1989\u0026rsquo;s Tiananmen massacre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe international response has been tepid at best, although both houses of the US legislature have passed or are preparing resolutions condemning the police brutality. Private companies have been embroiled in controversy for censoring efforts to voice support for the protestors, in a blatant example of how capitalism will not stand in support of freedom if it contradicts the bottom line. The gamer-relevant example is of course Blizzard, who suspended and censored Hearthstone pro Blitzchung for delivering this post\u0026rsquo;s title during a livestream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hong Kong protests are perhaps a microcosm of many of the problems faced by modern society: inequality, authoritarianism, state surveillance, police brutality, the indifference of capitalism, and even China itself. As the decade winds to a close, perhaps the HK revolution and its eventual outcome (whether that be the successful repression of the protests by China or a full-blown rebellion) provide a stark preview of what to expect in the decade to come. Indeed, Hong Kong is the revolution of our time.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a lot more uncommon for me to go to places like Ortigas or Makati nowadays, but when I do I almost always take the P2P bus. The P2P (Point-to-Point) buses were introduced in Metro Manila I think around late 2015/early 2016, as a pricier alternative to the usual city buses. The fares are more expensive, but the buses are also much more comfortable and they don\u0026rsquo;t make stops along their route, only at the endpoints, so their travel time is faster compared to the usual city buses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring a recent P2P trip, the bus driver had another person with him that he mentioned was an \u0026ldquo;apprentice\u0026rdquo;, basically a new hire that was shadowing him to learn the route. During the 45 minute ride, the two of them talked quite a bit about the P2P business model (from the POV of the driver/employee of course). I learned some interesting things so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d write about it. All of these points I just overheard from the two so maybe take it with a grain of salt especially in regards to accuracy of numbers etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe more senior driver had only been in this job since July, but he seemed very satisfied with how much he was earning.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUnlike regular drivers and their boundary system, P2P drivers are salaried, with a daily salary of around P700 + P150 allowance. They are required to render 8 hrs/day for their daily pay.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThey are given an incentive based on the number of people they carry over a day. The example given was if you manage to ferry 225 people in one day, you get a P300 incentive; 300 people is a P500 incentive, and so on. From what I gather, 300 riders is already very high for a single day. The senior driver says this route is comparatively better than the other route (also from the same general endpoint), since that other route is longer and it\u0026rsquo;s harder to meet the incentives.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThey also have overtime pay, around P85-P100 per hour (the two had conflicting info).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe more senior driver says the job is pretty good, \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;basta masipag ka.\u0026quot;\u003c/em\u003e He always drives as many trips as he could to get as much overtime as possible; he sometimes finishes at 11pm, then just eats and goes home to sleep. \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Wala naman akong libangan\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e, he says. (This saddened me a bit.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe senior driver mentioned that they get paid on the 10th and the 25th, but there\u0026rsquo;s also a daily salary?? I think like maybe the allowance is given daily because he said \u0026ldquo;hindi ka magugutom kasi may pera araw-araw\u0026rdquo; or maybe the incentive is given daily? The overtime pay he has to file his extra hours, so that\u0026rsquo;s not a daily thing.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe senior driver says that his last overtime filing was for 100+ hours. At P100/hour that\u0026rsquo;s more than P10K, so not bad.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe senior driver says in this job, your driver\u0026rsquo;s license is much \u0026ldquo;safer\u0026rdquo; than a regular city bus driving job. He claims the traffic authorities \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e apprehend P2P drivers. Presumably because it\u0026rsquo;s a government project? The apprentice says \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;ah kaya pala hindi ka nagseseatbelt\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e, and the senior driver says yes, he never wears the seat belt, even when there\u0026rsquo;s a cop standing right in front of the bus. By contrast, if a cop spotted any normal city bus driver without a seat belt, that would be an automatic infraction.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGiven the economics of his job, the senior driver says he doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel the need to compete with the city bus drivers (\u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;hindi na ko nakikipaggitgitan\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e), and his drive is more relaxed since he doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about picking up passengers etc. \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Parang naglalaro lang.\u0026quot;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe apprentice used to work as a 10-wheeler truck driver (hauling cargo). He says the pay was a bit higher in his last job, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t give him benefits (overtime, SSS, philhealth, etc). This seems illegal to me??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously I\u0026rsquo;m not from the same economic bracket as those targetted to work in this occupation, but it seems like a pretty good gig, compared to normal city bus driver jobs at least. I\u0026rsquo;m glad the economics are working out for both the drivers and the service providers, as the P2P buses are a pretty good alternative option for those who can afford it.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
