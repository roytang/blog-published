            "title": "Comics Review: House of X/Powers of X",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhile you slept, the world changed.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven\u0026rsquo;t reviewed any comics on this blog for a while, so today we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about Jonathan Hickman\u0026rsquo;s triumphant (so far) return to Marvel: House of X/Powers of X and the upcoming Dawn of X wave of books. Spoilers abound so be aware. Also while writing this I realized how absurd comic books must seem to nonreaders, but really that\u0026rsquo;s what makes it all fun! (I mean, the Justice League is also crazy right now too!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the unaware, House of X and Powers are X are two 6-issue miniseries to chart a new direction for the X-Men books moving forward. The architect of this new direction is writer Jonathan Hickman, known for his big status quo-changing ideas. His previous run on Avengers culminated in the multiverse-changing events Infinity and Secret Wars 2, so expectations were high for his X-Men run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoX/PoX is really two miniseries that are closely intertwined, enough to be considered a single 12-issue maxiseries. And Hickman is certainly presenting some big ideas, some of it retconning a lot of what was previously known in the X-Men\u0026rsquo;s history. The main conceit is that Moira MacTaggert is revealed to be (and always has been) a mutant - with the power to reset the timeline back to her birth if she dies after her mutant powers have manifested. Prior to the current storyline in HoX/PoX, Moira has lived through nine of her own timelines, and she has used each successive timeline to figure out how to get mutantkind to \u0026ldquo;winning\u0026rdquo; in the inevitable conflicts against humanity and technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 12 issues of HoX/Pox are told in a nonlinear fashion, with the opening issue of House of X showing Xavier\u0026rsquo;s new plan for mutantkind to become an independent nation on the living island of Krakoa - a far cry from Xavier\u0026rsquo;s dream of \u0026ldquo;coexistence\u0026rdquo; that has defined the X-Men since the very beginning. House of X tells the story of the establishment of this mutant nation, and the incredible resurrection workflow developed using a combination of mutant powers that means that the trope that X-Men don\u0026rsquo;t stay dead is now canon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowers of X covers the Moira affair, what happens in her different timelines and what she discovers. In this week\u0026rsquo;s final issue of Powers of X, we get the final revelation that she discovered in her sixth life: there is no victory. Mutantkind loses, and they always lose, inspite of the belief that mutants were the inevitable successor to humanity. This leads to her decision in her tenth life to try a completely new approach: to get all the mutants (heroes and villains) working together for a common cause. And to do this, she has to break Charles Xavier, whose optimistic dreams never work out and inevitably lead to conflict with others like Magneto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 12 issue maxiseries has concluded, but we are still left with a lot of burning questions. For me, foremost in my mind is: is this really the main 616 Marvel universe? All signs point to yes, but the main issue is that this is a massive upheaval of the X-Men status quo. Typically a writer during his run will introduce some fresh ideas but somewhere down the line some other writer will roll back some of those changes and we revert to some version of the status quo. This feels different, like there\u0026rsquo;s no coming back from it, because the fundamental nature of the mutants and their conflicts has forever been changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is also unclear at this point what the endgame is for Moira and Charles this time around. How does the Krakoa plan change the inevitable loss to an artificially-evolved post-humanity? There are still redacted portions of Moira\u0026rsquo;s notes in the last PoX, and she refuses to let any precogs live on Krakoa, implying she (or they) still have something to hide about the future. It would have been naive to assume all our questions would be answered before the end of Hickman\u0026rsquo;s run (which may end up being 2-3 years long, comparable to his Avengers run.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring a previous issue, precog Destiny also implied that Moira may live up to 10 or 11 lives, and Moira is only on her 10th. It is still possible that this current timeline gets \u0026ldquo;reset\u0026rdquo; at some point and Moira gets to live an 11th life, albeit she may have to do so without her mutant powers. That 11th life could still possibly be the 616 as we know it, although that would mean the rest of Hickman\u0026rsquo;s run would be reset later on, so that seems even more unlikely. In order for this current timeline (Moira X) to stick, she would have to be depowered, so that when she eventually dies the timeline doesn\u0026rsquo;t reset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m trying to imagine what the X-Men are going to look like post-Hickman. If it\u0026rsquo;s true that mutantkind \u0026ldquo;always loses\u0026rdquo;, then his run has one of two outcomes: (a) whatever Moira is planning succeeds and mutantkind wins, establishing itself as the successor to humanity, and in which case I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what future X-Men stories look like after that; or (b) Moira\u0026rsquo;s plans fall apart, and mutantkind loses yet again. (b) seems far more likely, with Destiny pretty much introduced as Chekov\u0026rsquo;s gun that Mystique is going to demand be used later on. Of course, knowing Hickman, all of this may very well culminate in some sort of status quo-shattering climax a few years down the line that nobody would have expected. (I certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t predict a multiversal collapse at the start of his Avengers run!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome other minor notes and questions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI kind of still question the inevitability of mutants losing since there it at least one known timeline where mutants \u0026ldquo;won\u0026rdquo; and humanity was reduced to almost nothing, and that was Age of Apocalypse (though, the mutants kind of ruined that timeline for themselves).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe mutant resurrection engine seems quite fragile, since it\u0026rsquo;s reliant on five different mutants (six counting Xavier), so any one of them dying could disable the resurrections permanently\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewhile we understand why Charles behaves so radically different from previous incarnations (because Moira had succeeded in breaking him), a lot of the other X-Men still feel very out of character, especially the cultish behavior in House of X #5\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe introduction of Dominions, godlike entities existing outside of space and time, is a completely new addition to Marvel cosmology AFAIK\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewhy is all of this happening now? After all these years, why have Moira, Charles and Erik decided to start their Krakoa nation at this point in time? What was the triggering event?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI haven\u0026rsquo;t said much about the art in these two series, because the implications of the story are already a lot, but the art is great, although by the end  a lot of the faces seemed a bit samey to me. But I especially like a lot of the coloring work, especially in the X2 timeline and during the assault on the Mothermold\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, there are a lot of other details and questions arising out of the maxiseries, which we assume Hickman will resolve during the next few years of X-books. Regardless of where his run ends, just the beginning of it is already a huge success in that it has sparked a lot of discussion about the X-Men and their future in the online communities, not to mention being the best-selling comic book titles for the past 12 weeks. The hype is real, and is a fresh shot in the arm to a franchise that was a bit weakening after years of the \u0026ldquo;mutant extinction\u0026rdquo; following House of M back in 2005. I have no idea where Hickman is taking us during this run, but I dig it, and I\u0026rsquo;m down for the ride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePS I\u0026rsquo;m still angry about this (from House of X #1):\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#274311800566ef3afc3555fe9169ef39-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2019/08/1159134490913988608/EBYSqotU4AEXMCK_hua7b7d377ee7f1ae65756de1ae4f7c242_140650_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Well, that’s annoying\" title=\"Well, that’s annoying\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eWell, that’s annoying (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"274311800566ef3afc3555fe9169ef39-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2019/08/1159134490913988608/EBYSqotU4AEXMCK.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eWell, that’s annoying\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"10 Oct 2019 12:00am\"\u003e10 Oct 2019 12:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2019/08/1159134490913988608/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA post about making a guy \u003ca href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/own-my-tweets/\"\u003emaking an archive of his twitter data\u003c/a\u003e made the rounds lately, so I figured I should make my own post about my ongoing efforts in this regard. I mentioned in an \u003ca href=\"/2019/08/ephemeral-social-media/\"\u003eearlier post\u003c/a\u003e that I like being able to use social media to dig through my own history. But as the first link above says, these social media sites can go away since nothing lasts forever. In the spirit of the \u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/own_your_data\"\u003eIndieweb principle to own your data\u003c/a\u003e, for the past few months I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on archiving most of my social media content on my own site. I also intend to cut down on my social media accounts and activities, and having a backup of all the data on my own site helps with that effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRequirements and considerations:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI wanted my content from external sites to appear on this site, not necessarily as a post. I would create new content types as necessary\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePrivacy: I would only import content that I considered okay for public consumption. Actually almost all of my social media accounts are fully public, except for Facebook, where I restrict access because I use it to post pictures of family. More on this when I talk about importing from facebook.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eComments and reactions: Ideally I would be able to preserve comments and reactions to my content as well (tweet replies/likes, fb comments/reacts, quora comments, etc), but that kind of runs afoul of the privacy requirement, since technically those commenters did not consent to me publishing their comments on my own site. I decided to be more conservative with this regard. Also it would have required a massive effort, since most of the backup data exports did not include third party comments. Only selected comments from certain sources are included in this site.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSyndication links: As much as possible, I wanted to retain links to where an entry originally existed. Many of my older entries have been cross-posted across different social media platforms, so they will have multiple syndication links.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother question is if I were to import content from Twitter, Facebook, etc, how would they appear on the blog? Would they be imported as posts and it will all be one giant mess, etc? I decided to maintain my traditional blog posts as the primary focus of the site, and the content from social media would largely be confined to some new sections (these are meant to map to \u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/posts#Types_of_Posts\"\u003eIndiweb post types\u003c/a\u003e):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/notes/\"\u003enotes\u003c/a\u003e: microblog-like status updates\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/photos/\"\u003ephotos\u003c/a\u003e: photos, sketches, screenshots, and definitely memes. Basically anything with an image\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/links/\"\u003elinks\u003c/a\u003e: links and bookmarks shared from various places\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/replies/\"\u003ereplies\u003c/a\u003e: replies to content on other sites. This is mostly just twitter replies at the moment.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/reposts/\"\u003ereposts\u003c/a\u003e: reposts/shares of content on other sites. This would include twitter retweets and tumblr reblogs.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also wanted two types of home page: one is the more traditional homepage listing only the most recent posts, while another would be a firehose of all posts+the above content, currently \u003ca href=\"/stream/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. Unfortunately, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t (yet) figure out how to paginate this page with Hugo, as the pagination support is limited to the homepage and listing pages and not to custom pages. Maybe someday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically, I wrote a hodgepodge of different python scripts to import data from various social media sources into this hugo blog. It has been a huge effort, and frankly the sort of thing I only expect someone as insane as me would do. The scripts are \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/roytang/blog/tree/master/utils/importers\"\u003eavailable on this blog\u0026rsquo;s own repo\u003c/a\u003e, but they are not portable at all and highly specific to my use cases and require certain temp files I keep around on my local filesystem that are unavailable in the repo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome technical challenges I encountered:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLink rot. As much as possible I wanted to preserve the intent of the original items. This meant following and resolving link shorteners so that the original URL would be preserved in the archive here (instead of say, the t.co URL twitter uses or bit.ly that twitter used to use). But those shorteners didn\u0026rsquo;t always resolve to the same URL as they did before. Some sites have changed their structure so that the original URLs are no longer available and they just redirect to their homepage, etc. Some sites like imgur deleted old images from when they were starting out (they no longer delete any images as of now), so their links would resolve to something like \u0026ldquo;imgur.com/removed\u0026rdquo;. Some URL shortener services are no longer around (like ping.fm), so for those entries crossposted using ping.fm, the contexts are forever lost. Some reposts What is archived here now represents a \u0026ldquo;best effort\u0026rdquo; at trying to reconstruct the original content as it was.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePermalink scheme. Given the link rot issue above, I needed to make sure I chose a reasonable permalink solution for the new content types, since I would want to avoid changing the permalinks in the future.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDeduplication. Since I had a lost of content cross-posted across different social media sites, I had to do some amount of duplicate detection. i.e. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want the same content to be posted under two separate entries, one from twitter and one from tumblr. This involved some rudimentary matching based on content and date posted. The matching was challenging since the date posted wouldn\u0026rsquo;t always be consistent across platforms\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHugo performance and limitations. With all this data imported, the number of content pages shot up from around 1000+ to roughly 15,000+, pushing the Hugo static generation to its limits. Generation time shot up from \u0026lt; 10 seconds to \u0026lt; 2 minutes. For a while, it was even reaching as long as 5-10 minutes, forcing me to do some template optimization to keep the performance reasonable. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how much further I could optimize my templates; I tried switching to some other themes to see if they fared any better with this amount of content, but the generation times were generally in the same ballpark. Perhaps I will revisit this again in the future. I\u0026rsquo;m also starting to miss some features of dynamic sites, like the ability to create custom queries, something like \u0026ldquo;list all replies tagged #mtg\u0026rdquo;, which are proving difficult if not impossible to do with Hugo. There\u0026rsquo;s also that limitation on the homepage pagination I mentioned earlier. I do still like having the entire site be statically generated, perhaps in the future I will explore my options for more versatile lists and searches.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ll also discuss each import source a bit, and the particular challenges each one posed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/quora\"\u003eQuora\u003c/a\u003e: I had already been planning to stop using Quora since I spoke about it \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/quora/\"\u003ein a previous post\u003c/a\u003e. Since Quora has no concept of exporting a backup of your data, importing my Quora posts involved a little bit of JS console sorcery and a little bit of web scraping as well. I imported each answer I had as a post on this site. After this import, I expect to no longer be using Quora. I\u0026rsquo;ve also unsubscribed to all their summary emails. It\u0026rsquo;s too bad, there\u0026rsquo;s often some interesting content there, but more and more it feels like Experts Exchange.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/goodreads\"\u003eGoodreads\u003c/a\u003e: For a while I used to use Goodreads to track my reading and post book reviews. Although Goodreads did provide a data export, it was kind of barebones, and importing required a lot of manual work. Luckily, there weren\u0026rsquo;t that many entries to import. I imported all of the book reviews into this blog as posts, and any further reading I can just talk about on the blog directly. I do not expect to be using Goodreads again.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/plurk\"\u003ePlurk\u003c/a\u003e: Plurk is an old social media site that I used around 2010-2011, mainly because a certain friend group of mine was very active there. Looks like everyone stopped using it around 2012-2013ish though. Their data export was very good, and I was able to import all the plurk content (most of it crossposted from twitter via ping.fm) and I included the plurk comments too. (Those comments were all public anyway.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/tumblr\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e: I\u0026rsquo;ve had the \u003ca href=\"https://tumblr.roytang.net\"\u003etumblr blog\u003c/a\u003e since 2008! I enjoyed using the Tumblr account mainly because there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of memes there and there\u0026rsquo;s content I follow, but I realized a while back I could just follow them via RSS. All my tumblr blog content has been imported either as notes, links or reposts. I don\u0026rsquo;t expect to be using tumblr much moving forward, although I still like it as a syndication endpoint; I may eventually re-enable syndicating my content to tumblr. I also have a second (currently inactive) \u003ca href=\"https://ireadcomicbooks.tumblr.com/\"\u003etumblr blog focused on comics\u003c/a\u003e that I have not yet imported, as the content there is primarily comic book covers and excerpts. I may do so in the future.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/pocket\"\u003ePocket\u003c/a\u003e: I use Pocket mainly for link sharing, so all the stuff from Pocket gets imported as links. I still intend to use Pocket moving forward, and there is an active script that imports new links I\u0026rsquo;ve shared.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/ireadcomicbooks\"\u003eWordpress\u003c/a\u003e: My blog was previously running on Wordpress before migrating to Hugo of course, so no importing of the original posts was necessary. I did, however run a short-lived comic-book focused Wordpress blog (a predecessor of the Tumblr) from 2012-2013 on the ireadcomicbooks.com domain (no longer active). I imported the posts and comments from that old blog into this one.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/youtube\"\u003eYoutube\u003c/a\u003e: I imported a selection of videos uploaded to my Youtube channel, mostly game videos and sketch timelapses. That account also had some videos uploaded by my niece, but those are her content not mine, so they were not migrated into this blog. I expect to still occasionally use Youtube for video uploads (since it\u0026rsquo;s very convenient for general internet sharing), but very sporadically so I don\u0026rsquo;t have any automated migration set up.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/flickr\"\u003eFlickr\u003c/a\u003e: I don\u0026rsquo;t use this much anymore, but I did have a few photos uploaded here, so they are now merged into this site.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/roywantsmeat\"\u003eroywantsmeat\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"/source/royondjango\"\u003eroyondjango\u003c/a\u003e: roywantsmeat was the blogger incarnation of this blog. \u003ca href=\"http://roywantsmeat.blogspot.com/\"\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s still up!\u003c/a\u003e. I mostly did this import to get syndication links since presumably all the posts from that blog had been imported to Wordpress and then to this blog. But that was not true! Apparently there were some missed posts, so some content gets to live again. \u003ca href=\"http://royondjango.blogspot.com/\"\u003eRoy on Django\u003c/a\u003e was a second short-lived blogger blog I had, focused on Python/Django, now the posts from their contain syndication links back to blogger as well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/twitter\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e: Twitter is still my most actively used social media channel, so a whole bunch of tweets have been imported as notes, replies and reposts. A lot of the past content was cross-posted from other sites though. I have a script that actively imports new tweets as notes, replies and reposts. I also had a \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/roy_mtg/\"\u003esecond twitter account dedicated to mtg\u003c/a\u003e, tweets from that account have been imported as well. If you reply or like a tweet that points to one of my blog posts, they are also automatically imported as comments to that post. (This is not retroactive.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/instagram\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e: Instagram was challenging to import. This was actually the first import I attempted. There was a data export, but the problem was it did not provide any way to derive the original instagram URL. For a while I researched on how the instagram slug was derived, thinking maybe it could be algorithmically determined. Eventually I gave up and looked for other means. Since there is currently no public API access, I had to use a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/realsirjoe/instagram-scraper\"\u003escraper library\u003c/a\u003e to get the instagram URLs then used some matching algorithm to combine them with the data export, and voila I was able to import all the entries as photos. I still plan on using Instagram moving forward (primarily for sharing sketches), but currently there is no viable way to automatically import newer entries. I tried using \u003ca href=\"https://ownyourgram.com/\"\u003eOwnYourGram\u003c/a\u003e for a while, but that \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/aaronpk/OwnYourGram/issues/85\"\u003eran into some trouble\u003c/a\u003e after some Instagram changes broke their scraping algorithm, so we\u0026rsquo;re stuck.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/facebook\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e: Ah, this was the most challenging import of all. The challenges were (a) first, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want all of my FB content to be publicly available on this blog, so there was a lot of manual vetting/review that had to be done; and (b) Facebook\u0026rsquo;s data export (both JSON and HTML formats) did not make it easy to get the URL for any given post, I had to do some scraping to get the correct URLs; and (c) the data export wasn\u0026rsquo;t even very complete; among other things it didn\u0026rsquo;t include visibility settings (would have helped with the manual review) or the application used to post (would have helped with deduplication); and (d) the data model wasn\u0026rsquo;t straightforward, since a given URL could refer to a post, a photo album, a single photo, etc and some items wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even have a single canonical URL, multiple URLs could be pointing to the same thing. I actually ended up rewriting the import script completely (you can see in github I have an fb2.py) after I\u0026rsquo;d already imported some posts. While I will still be probably using FB moving forward (for sharing family photos mostly), I do not intend to import any further Facebook posts into this blog. (Any content which could be public will be cross-posted elsewhere instead)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you weren\u0026rsquo;t keeping track, moving forward I generally still intend to still be regularly using Twitter, Instagram, and sometimes Youtube, and somehow syndicate that content back to this site. In some future update, I will probably attempt to reverse this. That is, change it so that I post on this site, and the content automatically gets syndicated to Twitter/Instagram/etc as appropriate. This is \u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/POSSE\"\u003eIndieweb POSSE principle\u003c/a\u003e, which makes a lot of sense, assuming I am able to overcome the technological hurdles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now, the archive is available for your perusal.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "A post about making a guy making an archive of his twitter data made the rounds lately, so I figured I should make my own post about my ongoing efforts in this regard. I mentioned in an earlier post that I like being able to use social media to dig through my own history. But as the first link above says, these social media sites can go away since nothing lasts forever.",

Unfortunately, I never did end up using it for anything significant, and every couple of years they have to warn me they\u0026rsquo;re going to delete it, so I figured I\u0026rsquo;d just get the content off of it and let it die. If I ever wanted a wiki again, a markdown-based one powered by Hugo would be much more appropriate anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only significant piece of content I had there was a custom set design for a theoretical second set of Legends block. This was a riff on how Coldsnap was released supposedly the final set in the as-then uncompleted Ice Age block.
