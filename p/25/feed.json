            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI like Wikis (probably because a previous employer used them a lot) so in 2005, I got an \u003ca href=\"http://roytang.pbworks.com\"\u003eaccount at PBWiki\u003c/a\u003e (now \u003ca href=\"https://www.pbworks.com/\"\u003ePBWorks\u003c/a\u003e) which let you set up your own Wiki. Unfortunately, I never did end up using it for anything significant, and every couple of years they have to warn me they\u0026rsquo;re going to delete it, so I figured I\u0026rsquo;d just get the content off of it and let it die. If I ever wanted a wiki again, a markdown-based one powered by Hugo would be much more appropriate anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only significant piece of content I had there was a custom set design for a theoretical second set of Legends block. This was a riff on how Coldsnap was released supposedly the final set in the as-then uncompleted Ice Age block. I figured the older sets deserved the same treatment too and so I started putting together a hypothetical second set for Magic\u0026rsquo;s first expansion Legends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do not claim to be a very good set designer for Magic, all content here is based on prevailing design ideas from more than a decade ago and are presented as-is.

Here are \u003ca href=\"/notes/2019/09/1171737237135867906/\"\u003esome of my nitpicks\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s not what would\u0026rsquo;ve been the best ending for the X-Men series which was really one of the pioneers of the superhero movie revolution (alongside Raimi\u0026rsquo;s Spider-Man), but that\u0026rsquo;s what we got. At least it ended with a big fiery bird explosion in the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also watched Part 7 of \u003cstrong\u003eThe Ranch\u003c/strong\u003e on Netflix. The Ranch is one of those weird family comedy/drama shows that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t normally seem to be in my spheres of interest, especially since the show is probably a lot more appealing to conservative/right-wing viewers. (It\u0026rsquo;s often punctuated by country music and the characters regularly criticize Hillary Clinton and mock the idea of climate change.) I will not admit that I got into it mostly because of Elisha Cuthbert. It is a moderately enjoyable show, the kind you don\u0026rsquo;t mind having run in the background while you\u0026rsquo;re doing something else, although it did lose a bit of its comedy punch with the firing/writing off of Danny Masterson (\u0026ldquo;Hyde\u0026rdquo; from the 70s show) last season due to #MeToo issues, and the guy they replaced him with hasn\u0026rsquo;t been super impressive thus far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlow month again this time. The lull should pick up in October once the fall US shows start off. And there\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of movies I want to watch too but some combination of laziness and lack of time always puts them off.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I\u0026rsquo;ve been having an issue where sometimes in some games, my displays (I have two monitors) will die (go completely black), but the game goes on running for a while (I can hear the audio), then after a couple of minutes or so the audio also stops so I can\u0026rsquo;t really do anything except do a hard reboot. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried VNCing into the PC to see what\u0026rsquo;s going on after this time, but it\u0026rsquo;s not accessible over the network so I assume it\u0026rsquo;s dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crashes happen most often while playing Magic Arena (says a lot about the game!), but I\u0026rsquo;ve also had it happen once or twice on Starcraft 2 and Borderlands 2. I don\u0026rsquo;t play very demanding games graphically. I can\u0026rsquo;t identify any specific action that causes the crashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome other things I\u0026rsquo;ve tried:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eattach my 2nd monitor to onboard graphics, keeping the main monitor connected to the vidcard. In this case when the crash happens, the main monitor goes black, while the 2nd monitor still has a display, but is frozen\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eremove my 2nd monitor (I thought I might be overtaxing the graphics card by having two of them??)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003echecking for memory (RAM) issues. I did have some RAM issues a couple of months ago, but that turned up to be due to a dirty connector, and it was causing crashes not just in games but in general Windows usage, so I think this is a different issue now\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003echecking for disk issues. I actually found some bad sectors on my secondary drive and ended up replacing it. But even if I ran everything from my primary (SSD) drive, the graphics crashes still occur\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ereinstalling/updating device drivers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eresetting Windows 10 (yup, I went that far)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all of these, I\u0026rsquo;m still encountering these crashes so I\u0026rsquo;m seriously considering replacing the graphics card now, but I\u0026rsquo;d like the be sure that it\u0026rsquo;s a graphics card issue and not something wonky with the motherboard, as my purchasing decisions will be different if the motherboard was the problem (I might as well get a new PC then).

            "title": "The Climate Strikes Back",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThis past weekend was supposedly some global climate strike, led by young activists. I don\u0026rsquo;t actually know if there was a local counterpart to these activities, as obviously I did not participate. Good for the young though. Between the climate activists and HK protesters, the modern youth still give me some hope for humanity. Anyway, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna step into the melee here and start rambling about things I may or may not be fully informed about, feel free to correct me or tell me I\u0026rsquo;m being an idiot or whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHope to be able to resolve climate change? Not so much. The science is irrefutable, and all signs indicate to us being well past the point of \u0026ldquo;can we stop it?\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;can we mitigate its effects?\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s not that I\u0026rsquo;m pessimistic, but the way the world works lately, it is difficult to be optimistic all of the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did read a couple of interesting twitter threads about it over the weekend. The \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/rcolvile/status/1174957970431496192\"\u003efirst thread\u003c/a\u003e discusses how the current climate activist movement, epitomized by 16-year old Greta Thunberg, is too extremist in their views. I was unable to verify, but one of the examples was that many of the activists reject technological solutions such as carbon recapture and economics/market incentive-based approaches. The perception of some commenters in the thread is even that the movement is a thinly-veiled cover to promote socialistic ideals. And indeed, some \u003ca href=\"https://globalclimateconvergence.org/climate-strike/\"\u003eclimate strike demands\u003c/a\u003e include universal healthcare and education, things largely perceived as socialist policies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second thread discusses why one might be against market-based approaches: there is a sentiment that the current crisis is brought about by markets and industries\u0026rsquo; overreach, so it feels weird to be relying on those very same markets and industries to bail us from our situation, because in a way that would make them \u0026ldquo;heroes\u0026rdquo; and let them \u0026ldquo;get away with\u0026rdquo; the vast damage they have done in the first place. (I wish I could find the link for this second thread, though it is an admittedly lesser point, I am surely not giving it justice.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously not every group has the same demands, and citation needed, etc etc, but the perception of these movements including demands that are ideologically extreme contribute to making it difficult to save the planet. The truth is that everybody, everywhere should be doing anything and everything they can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am largely in agreement that the current climate crisis is brought about by human excess, and can even partly be blamed on runaway capitalism and consumerism. In my head the analogy for this is something like a person who pushes and abuses his body to do all this fun stuff and then the doctor tells him he\u0026rsquo;s dying and he needs to change his lifestyle in order to become healthier, but he\u0026rsquo;s really set in his ways so that\u0026rsquo;s something really hard for him to do, so instead he grasps at straws and follows miracle cures or looks for technological solutions to avoid the lifestlye change.. And that\u0026rsquo;s where we are now, we pretty much abused and extracted as much as we can from the planet to feed our runaway growth and now we\u0026rsquo;re hitting the limits of the ecosystem and the ecosystem is starting to fight back against us like the parasites we are. And while the real solution requires a severe lifestyle change - we have to give up things like meat and airplanes and all that - that\u0026rsquo;s not something we are willing to do. So we grasp at straws and hope that somehow science or economics can save us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a self-proclaimed man of science, I still do think that our best hope of salvation lies in some sort of as-yet-foreseen innovation. But in the meantime, we can\u0026rsquo;t just twiddle our thumbs, we need that lifestyle change anyway, in light of our ever increasing population, if we are to continue to survive in this world. Something about our way of life has to give, in order for it to be sustainable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI say this, though many of the prescribed changes are quite difficult for me as well. I suspect my personal carbon footprint is below average, mainly because I don\u0026rsquo;t travel as much especially compared to the average Metro Manila denizen. I don\u0026rsquo;t drive, and I don\u0026rsquo;t take vehicles except maybe 2 or 3 times a week at most, and I use public transpo when I can and will often opt to walk whenever it\u0026rsquo;s feasible. (I do take plane rides like 2-4 times a year, but I also know people who fly a lot more often than me.) Where I fall short would be giving up meat (or even reducing intake). Since my diet is largely meat, this is mostly a nonstarter for me, so I implore people to eat less meat on my behalf lol. Or at least cows, cows are the worst, or so I heard. I\u0026rsquo;m also pretty bad at conserving power, given that I often leave my computing machines online and idle just for the convenience of not having to boot again. Such is life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes it can feel like my personal effort doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter, because people like me living in third-world countries aren\u0026rsquo;t the most egregious offenders in terms of damage to the climate. We can all do our small parts, but the larger effects can only come from the leading countries of the world, and is here that my doubts about their capability to bring about meaningful change come into play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, we can\u0026rsquo;t fight the planet. If we are living in excess, the planet will find a way to humble us for our excesses. The question is moving forward, how much of our modern lifestyle can survive this crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

In the old days, I\u0026rsquo;d also be installing stuff like an image viewer, a media player, a file compression program, putty (for ssh), and so on, but with modern OSes all of those are largely unnecessary or can be replaced by cloud services so these days the list is significantly shorter.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

And by crash I mean the displays dying although the PC continues to run for a short while thereafter and after which they proceed to apparently stop operating completely. It only happens when playing games, and most often when playing Magic Arena and sometimes (rarely) when playing Starcraft 2 or Borderlands 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven that I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to try swapping out the video card just yet, and I had already tried doing all the driver updates during the previous episode, I decided it was time to try a more extreme approach. I was going to re-install Windows 10.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI say \u0026ldquo;extreme\u0026rdquo; even though reinstalling my OS is not something I wasn\u0026rsquo;t used to. Back in the days of \u003ca href=\"/2007/12/today-is-a-good-day-to-nuke-your-xp-install/\"\u003eWindows XP\u003c/a\u003e I used to reinstall my OS multiple times in a year, if not in a month. It\u0026rsquo;s only unusual now because Windows 10 managed to go four whole years without giving me even a hint of a bluescreen or any sort of issue like this, so props to MS for improving the stability of their OS. That being said, running an OS over such a long period means a significant amount of cruft has probably been installed and uninstalled and reinstalled over the years, with most of the details long forgotten which leads to a sort of OS rot. So in any case, I figured a reset was due anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did the research first, and apparently Windows 10 provides the reset option itself, I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to make an install USB or anything like that. And the reset happens \u0026ldquo;in place\u0026rdquo;, theoretically without needing to reformat your partitions or displacing your user files, which was good. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t put much stock in theory, so of course for safety, I had to make a backup first. If I had needed to reset Windows 10 two weeks ago I would have been out of luck because I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have had any space to backup critical stuff. Luckily, there was a bit of coincidental foresight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n    On \n    \u003ca href=\"/2019/09/1172359392714358784/\"\u003e\u003ctime datetime=\"2019-09-13 04:00:35\"\u003e13 Sep 2019 4:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n    I wrote:\n    \u003cblockquote\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eI had been waffling on getting a new external HD for a while, but a couple of days ago one of my friends posted about her backup drive failing at 6yo and I was like \u0026ldquo;all my drives are older than that\u0026rdquo; lol\u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo around last week I purchased a 2TB Seagate Backup Plus, so I had a bunch of space available for backups. Now, there is a generally recognized backup rule where any critical data should be backed up using a \u0026ldquo;3-2-1\u0026rdquo; rule; that is: 3 different places, 2 different media types, and 1 offsite. This is a bit too much for a home-based setup where my critical backups consist mostly of documents, family photos, mail archives, old chat logs and such, so I figured having two copies of the stuff I wanted backed up would be sufficient. One copy would remain on my secondary HDD on the desktop, and a second copy on my new Backup Plus. (And yes, that means I was living without the second copy before, which spoiler alert for the end of this story, was very dangerous.) In theory for anything that I didn\u0026rsquo;t mind backing up to the cloud for privacy reasons, I already had a third copy there via Google Drive and/or Dropbox, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t been too religious with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, backups created, we proceed with Operation Fresh Start:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#4a83c7ac30ee244d164999938df27714-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2019/09/1174123501470408704/EEtTGYIUwAAu1jV_hu370031b005503e42e8d76ab384a1fb83_19213_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"I am almost certainly going to regret this lol\" title=\"I am almost certainly going to regret this lol\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eI am almost certainly going to regret this lol (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"4a83c7ac30ee244d164999938df27714-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2019/09/1174123501470408704/EEtTGYIUwAAu1jV.png\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eI am almost certainly going to regret this lol\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"20 Sep 2019 12:00pm\"\u003e20 Sep 2019 12:00pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2019/09/1174123501470408704/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;20 minutes or longer\u0026rdquo; was pretty much a lie (or a programmer\u0026rsquo;s estimate, as you will), and it took more like half a day. But it went smoothly more or less. Afterwards I had to reinstall a bunch of software (more on that in the next post!). And then I tried using the PC for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince my main purpose was to avoid the crashing, the first test was running Magic Arena. Sure enough, no crashes since the reset, all the games finished smoothly etc. Pretty good!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow for the bad news: I was getting terribly slow read/write times on my secondary 2TB HDD. At first I thought there was some ridiculousness with Windows Explorer or other background processes gumming up the worst, so I booted into Ubuntu (using a USB boot drive) to see if copying from the disk would be better there. (Side note: I miss having an Ubuntu desktop, but discretion is the better part of valor, so maybe I won\u0026rsquo;t try to dual-boot it just yet). Sadly, Ubuntu told me there were some 40,000+ bad sectors on the 2TB drive (!) which meant it was almost certainly failing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily I had the foresight to do backups beforehand and got all the critical stuff. Or not. It turns out I forgot to archives a whole 20+ gigs of photos from my Mom\u0026rsquo;s old PC after that PC\u0026rsquo;s hard drive had died. And violating the backup rule, there was no other copy of those photos anywhere else!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe secondary drive was still there, so my first instinct was to power through and try to copy them off that drive but this turned out to be impractical as it was taking forever. Then I remembered that before using the old PC (which she inherited from me after I bought this current one), my Mom had been using a small ASUS netbook whose display had died. I confirmed with her that all the photos from the PC had come from that netbook, and happily I was able to boot it up and connect it to an old VGA monitor so I could copy her files from there. It took the better part of a day, but I was able to save most of her files. Whew! I\u0026rsquo;m backing these up to her Google Photos account as soon as she remembers to give me her creds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, the next problemw as what to do with my current desktop\u0026rsquo;s 2TB drive. A couple of consecutive chkdsk runs (both of which took more than a workday to finish) confirmed the worst: many bad sectors and many unreadable segments. It would certainly not be prudent to continue to use it, it had to be replaced. I considered just replacing with a 500GB SSD, but I needed the 2TB capacity. Not just for the critical stuff, but mostly for game installations as well and also I had been running a Plex media server off this desktop so there were a bunch of movies and TV series eps there. It was ok to lose them to a reformat, since most of them could be re-downloaded, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t go to a smaller capacity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really liked the idea of getting a second SSD though (to help with load times), so I considered getting both a 500GB SSD \u003cstrong\u003eand\u003c/strong\u003e a new 2TB HDD but this was a bit of an expensive option. Then I learned about the existence of so-called SSHDs or Solid State Hybrid Drives. Basically they\u0026rsquo;re normal HDDs except they come with a small SSD cache to boost read/write speeds for commonly-used files. Basically you\u0026rsquo;re getting something a bit faster than a normal HDD, but not with the capacity costs of a full-blown SSD. Not a bad idea, and I convinced myself to try it out. The 2TB Seagate Firecuda looked like a good SSHD to try out, and it was a quite a bit less expensive than my previous option of an SSD+an HD. I wanted to get one today!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, all the shops I called didn\u0026rsquo;t have any in stock, so I went ahead and ordered one from Lazada (slightly pricier). I\u0026rsquo;m a bit wary about ordering electronics online, because of warranty issues and such. But what the heck, I should risk my money every so often. Purchased! Ordering online meant I\u0026rsquo;d have to wait a few days for the delivery, so until then I have to live only with my primary 250GB SSD. Luckily this is sufficent to play Magic Arena and SC2 and write on this blog and SSH to work servers etc. I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to install most Steam games or download videos and such until the new drive gets here though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am hopeful that the failing hard drive was the cause of my recent gaming crashes and that replacing it solves the issue. All of the offending games were previously installed on the 2TB secondary so it\u0026rsquo;s a decent hypotheses. Both Arena and SC2 have been behaving since I moved them to the SSD, so signs are good. That being said, this HDD failure combined with the previous episode is pretty much an indication that my PC is getting on with age. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping it will last me a few more years still, but that is more the optimist in me than anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn summary:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ebackups good\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003egonna try out an SSHD\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epc might be dying.
