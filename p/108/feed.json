Minions can only be summoned on empty spaces adjacent to one of your units. During your turn, each unit can either: attack an adjacent enemy; or move up to two spaces, then attack an adjacent enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving a board and unit movement greatly enhances the \u0026ldquo;positioning matters\u0026rdquo; mechanic as compared to Hearthstone. In HS, it only mattered whether minions were adjacent, to the left or to the right. In Duelyst, you can position minions to prevent enemies from reaching your General, or to restrict enemies from moving completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat means a number of spells and abilities care about positioning too. Each of the available Generals has a Bloodborn spell (BBS), the equivalent of Hearthstone\u0026rsquo;s Hero Power. One of the Generals has a BBS which allows her to deal damage to all enemy units in the same column as the opposing General. This means you have to be careful where you place your minions whenever her BBS is active! There are spells that affect a small area (2×2 or 3×3 and so on). There are spells that care about adjacency (\u0026ldquo;Destroy target minion that is not nearby any general\u0026rdquo;). And so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFactions and Generals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearthstone has different heroes, and each hero has a different card pool available. By contrast, Duelyst has factions and Generals. Each faction has its own card pool, and of course there is a global or \u0026ldquo;neutral\u0026rdquo; card pool as well. Each faction also has two Generals, each of which has a different BBS. The factions and Generals encourage a lot of different playstyles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#7893d4dff4403b69eaab48e91d493637-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2017/02/review-duelyst/20170216154217_1_hu2712e8d2214bb80d8b8cbb3f52aa2fad_388288_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"7893d4dff4403b69eaab48e91d493637-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2017/02/review-duelyst/20170216154217_1.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"18 Feb 2017 1:30am\"\u003e18 Feb 2017 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome factions like the Songhai are more focused on spell-based damage and backstabs.

Hearthstone is also more reliant on RNG than Duelyst is, although I can\u0026rsquo;t say that will hold for the future. I enjoy some level of RNG as it creates variance, but the randomness means a higher chance of losing due to bad luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find competitive play on the ranked ladders for both Duelyst and Hearthstone to be about the same. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying either meta is healthy, but as I see it there are more viable decks in Duelyst ladder as compared to HS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I\u0026rsquo;ve already spent a bunch of money in MTG, I don\u0026rsquo;t like spending money on digital card games. So for both HS and Duelyst, I am strictly free-to-play (F2P). Both games offer similar monetization models (pay money for booster packs/cosmetics) but I was able to get further up the ladder in competitive Duelyst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#b2f9e96959d46d69b74fdfb70152125d-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2017/02/review-duelyst/20170131192316_1_hub7a52f37225406efe877da2275b8d6f8_162003_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"b2f9e96959d46d69b74fdfb70152125d-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2017/02/review-duelyst/20170131192316_1.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"18 Feb 2017 1:30am\"\u003e18 Feb 2017 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn my first full month (December), I was already able to get to Duelyst\u0026rsquo;s Gold Division. This should be similar to around rank 10 in HS. After a lot (and I mean \u003cstrong\u003ea lot\u003c/strong\u003e) of grinding from Diamond rank, I managed to hit the S-Rank Division last month. This is the equivalent of HS\u0026rsquo;s Legend rank. The highest rank I ever got in HS was around rank 6 or 7.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I think Duelyst is more skill-based than HS, why did I find it easier to get to S-Rank than HS\u0026rsquo;s Legend rank? Two reasons come to mind:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI found Duelyst games more fun\u003c/strong\u003e. This means I was playing Duelyst on a daily basis since it started. At the start, I played regularly because I wanted to get Steam Achievement completion. But I found myself enjoying the game and continuing to play even after that. There are also a lot more variance in decks being played on the Duelyst ladder. By comparison, HS ladder seemed to be almost 50% the one best deck (used to be Midrange Shaman, nowadays Pirate Aggro\u0026hellip; ) while the other 50% are trying to beat it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt was easier to get the powerful cards and build the tier one decks in Duelyst\u003c/strong\u003e. The pricing of packs is about the same (100 gold), but on average I could earn around 100-150 gold per day from Duelyst\u0026rsquo;s quests, compared to 40-60 for HS. The drop rates for Legendaries (highest rarity in both games) is higher in Duelyst as well. Unlike HS, Legendaries in Duelyst are not restricted to one per deck, you can play as many as three. This meant you need more of them, which annoyed me at first. But I think that\u0026rsquo;s counterbalanced by the higher drop rate. For comparison, I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing HS for more than a year and have only gotten two premium (golden) Legendaries. Three months into Duelyst and I\u0026rsquo;ve opened the same amount of premium (prismatic) Legendaries. (Well, this comparison may be skewed since I open more Duelyst packs due to the increased gold rate.) Another factor was the Bloodborn expansion, which you could complete by playing enough to grind 3900 gold. That expansion came out in December, and I completed the set early in January. This set gave me access to many useful cards that were important in the meta. This allowed me to build a tier one deck and reach S-Rank in January. Even after that deck was nerfed, I was also easily able to shift to another tier one deck from another faction. In HS, I still haven\u0026rsquo;t found a new competitive deck after Midrange Shaman.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Future\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first I told myself I would stop playing Duelyst after I completed the Steam Achievements. Then I said I would stop playing after I got to S-Rank. But I\u0026rsquo;m still playing it now. By comparison, I now launch HS once or twice a week, and I don\u0026rsquo;t clear the quests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuelyst is still a young game \u0026ndash; the second expansion just came out last December. So in the future it may yet be plagued with the problems Hearthstone currently has. The developers have shown themselves to be responsive in nerfing problematic cards and shaking up the meta though. Whether they are able to keep this up remains to be seen. In the meantime, I\u0026rsquo;m willing to keep playing as long as the game is still enjoyable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",

The MIT license is an example of a very permissive license. Other licenses may provide \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"complexword\"\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"668k1-3-0\"\u003ea number of\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan data-offset-key=\"668k1-4-0\"\u003erestrictions. Can you integrate with closed-source software? Can you distribute binaries without the source? Do you need to put some kind of attribution somewhere in your software? Another thing to look our for are the so-called viral licenses. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"hardreadability\"\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"668k1-5-0\"\u003eViral licenses specify that if you integrate their code into your system, then the terms of that license apply to your own software as well\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"668k1-6-0\"\u003e. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"hardreadability\"\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"668k1-7-0\"\u003e These can be very dangerous from the standpoint of a company developing a commercial product\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"668k1-8-0\"\u003e. The most well-known example of such copyleft licenses is the GPL. Integrating GPL code into your system will often mean your software needs to be open source as well. While more open source is good, it may not be in the best interest of your company, so tread \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"adverb\"\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"668k1-9-0\"\u003elightly\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"668k1-10-0\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"74amj-0-0\"\u003eWhich version of the library will you use? Many open source libraries will release updates on a regular basis. There may be some compatibility issues depending on the version you use. For example the popular open source CMS WordPress releases regular updates. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"hardreadability\"\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"74amj-1-0\"\u003eIf you are integrating with WordPress, you need to decide which version you are supporting\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"74amj-2-0\"\u003e. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"hardreadability\"\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"74amj-3-0\"\u003eYou will also need a plan for upgrading to future versions and ensuring compatibility\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"74amj-4-0\"\u003e. (See the next item.)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"9tfrc-0-0\"\u003eHow will you handle bugs and updates in the version you\u0026rsquo;ve chosen? \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"hardreadability\"\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"9tfrc-1-0\"\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s happened that our system was having problems due to a bug in an open source Javascript rich text control library\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"9tfrc-2-0\"\u003e.

That was out of the question. I ended up having to apply a fix to our local version only. This meant that we now had a different version from the \u0026ldquo;official\u0026rdquo; released version. This may lead to further compatibility problems in the future. You should also be aware of licensing issues here too. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"hardreadability\"\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"9tfrc-7-0\"\u003eThe license may \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"complexword\"\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"9tfrc-8-0\"\u003erequire\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"hardreadability\"\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"9tfrc-9-0\"\u003e that you submit any modifications to the community as open source contributions\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"9tfrc-10-0\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"d3jml-0-0\"\u003eIs there an active help and support system for the software? The demands of enterprise software development often need timely support. There was a time we had to use a certain open source document management system. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"hardreadability\"\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"d3jml-1-0\"\u003eWe later discovered that it was very hard to get help on any issues encountered, either from official channels or the community\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan data-offset-key=\"d3jml-2-0\"\u003e. This led to many difficulties and issues in that project. You might also want to check popular programming forums such as StackOverflow. Check how many questions about that library usually remain unanswered. If the number is low, that\u0026rsquo;s a good indicator that you might have trouble looking for help later on.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhat dependencies does the library have? You might want to make sure the dependencies don\u0026rsquo;t have any problems with the previous items above.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe great thing about modern software development is that we have a large number of open source libraries available to use and draw inspiration from, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you can just willy-nilly pick up just any library. The above questions provide a good starting point for evaluating open source libraries for your use.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "title": "Working with Client-Server Programs",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eBack when I was starting out as a software developer, webapps weren\u0026rsquo;t really a thing. Not as much as they are now anyway. My company provided training to new hires, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t get any web development training at the time, even though they already had a few web development projects in play at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead my initial training involved mostly development of so-called client-server software. This was software that was installed and run on the client machine but they would connect to a remote database server. Up until the early 2000s most enterprisey-type systems used these kinds of program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was trained in using mostly two tools:  Borland Delphi and Oracle Forms and Reports. These were the sort of tools that would have been billed as reducing the need for specialized programmers or developers. They featured drag and drop user interfaces to design forms or report layouts. The Oracle tools featured robust database integration that let you drag and drop to associate form fields to database tables and fields. Supposedly even people with minimal training would be able to do the work of application programmers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn practice of course, the only people patient enough to work with these tools in-depth were the programmers themselves. And client requirements always eclipsed the capabilities of these tools, such that expert programmers were still needed to push the tools to their limits and beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTools like Oracle Forms and Reports had a lot of problems with modern software development practices. For one thing, the \u0026ldquo;source\u0026rdquo; files weren\u0026rsquo;t actually text files. They were mostly binary format files with some PL/SQL interspersed, and could only be opened in the proprietary IDE that only Oracle provided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBinary formats meant that while they could reap some of the benefits of source control (namely version history and such), actually figuring out the differences between revisions involved opening up both versions in the IDE and comparing each item/script/setting in the two files. Doing things like global find and replace were also a pain in the ass, especially in systems that had hundreds of forms. It was so bad I remember spending some time trying to reverse engineer the binary format so that I could attempt to make some of this work easier. No dice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother issue was that Oracle\u0026rsquo;s IDEs were notoriously buggy. Their Reports IDE in particular often had me incensed. If you dragged the wrong thing to the other wrong thing, you would crash the IDE entirely. In fact, we had a list of things to avoid doing that would crash the entire IDE entirely. The built-in text editors were so bad, I often had a entirely separate text editor open in a separate window so I could copy-paste PL/SQL code there for any complicated edits. (Back then we were for some reason fond of \u003ca href=\"http://www.crimsoneditor.com/\"\u003eCrimson Editor\u003c/a\u003e although it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as full-featured as \u003ca href=\"http://www.ultraedit.com/\"\u003eUltraEdit\u003c/a\u003e or as reliable with updates as \u003ca href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/\"\u003eNotepad++\u003c/a\u003e) This was actually also sometimes a problem as some versions of the Reports IDE also had a crash on paste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of my first two years of work involved maintenance of Oracle Forms-based systems (with some Delphi work thrown in occasionally). I didn\u0026rsquo;t get an introduction to web development until late into the second year of my career. I was so impressed with web development I made a mock-up of one of the really complicated screens from one of our Oracle Forms projects and it seemed so pretty. I secretly hoped we could convince our clients to port them over to a web application. (1) No dice again; and (2) I probably would have regretted such a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know I would have regretted it because some number of years later, we got a project to migrate an existing client-server system to a web application. The original application was written in Powerbuilder. I figured it was a fairly straightforward reverse-engineer and implement as a webapp, but nooooo. One of the higher-ups decided that to save on costs, we should look into attempting to automate the porting process somehow. We were to write translation software that would take the Powerbuilder source and convert it into the appropriate web application screens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was ridiculous for a good number of reasons, but as a tech lead, I had to look into it and had to prove it was in fact not viable (Spoiler alert: it was not). The first concern was that Powerbuilder also had a binary format. This was solved when I found that someone had already written a tool to export Powerbuilder binaries into some kind of text format. It was a bit crude, but it was a way forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second concern is that client-server form behaviors do not map well to web applications. My favorite example of this is editable grids. These are some kind of excel-like grids that were commonplace in client-side systems. And when users upgrade their legacy systems to web apps, they inevitably expect that their editable grids should work the exact same way on the web as they did on the client-side forms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack then Javascript-backed editable grids were still in their infancy, and each one we tried had their own sets of problems and limitations which would lead to some number of client complaints. Some clients even wanted editable grids that could accept copy-pastes from excel! Yeah, we had to develop Google Sheets! I personally had to roll my own editable grid framework from scratch at least once too. I ranted so often against client\u0026rsquo;s editable grid requirements that a few developers often quoted something I said in one of our internal chat rooms:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cjaeger\u003e you say \u0026ldquo;editable grid\u0026rdquo; i hear \u0026ldquo;problems\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway yeah, porting client-side behavior to a web framework would not have been straightforward. At least not to the way our internal web development framework liked to do things. In order to have any kind of reasonable mapping, I would have needed to build some kind of Javascript rich-client framework (or see which ones of the emerging ones we could use). That also meant rewriting a lot of the backend code to support a bunch of new operations. It was a lot more work than the expected output of \u0026ldquo;a series of steps to easily or automatically migrate PowerBuilder source code to web applications.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I raised that the idea was not viable, I was asked to give a more detailed explanation. This involved taking one of the more complex Powerbuilder source files, putting it into an Excel, and line-by-line explaining how and why that line could or could not be translated into a web application. As an alternative option to an automated porting program they wanted a guide or process so simple that even junior developers with minimal experience could follow the guide and port the programs quickly. I think they eventually went with this approach. (Which was closer to our normal reverse-engineer-and-reimplement methodology.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days web applications are the norm and client-server programs are a thing of the past. They were relics of a different age. The browser is our universal client now, on the desktop at least. On mobile, \u0026ldquo;apps\u0026rdquo; are effectively client-server programs, though they have a different set of advantages and limitations. Maybe in the future mobile apps will converge as well, into a unified browser client \u0026ndash; although probably mobile browsers need to be more feature-rich before this convergence can take place. My historical disdain for client-server programs carries over to mobile apps though \u0026ndash; I don\u0026rsquo;t like to use too many of them, although that is a story for another blog post.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
