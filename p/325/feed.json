Jerry Shaw is an ordinary loser working at Copy Cabana when he comes into seven hundred fifty thousand dollars and a whole lot of terrorist hardware in his apartment, facilitated by a mysterious woman who contacts him via his cellphone. The FBI bust his apartment and suddenly he\u0026rsquo;s a fugitive on the run for reasons unknown to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me, the gauge of how good an action movie is how difficult it is for me to see how it ends. For Eagle Eye, it started out a bit slow, then became action-packed without explanation then got to the middle where the plot was developed, and by that point I thought I had a pretty good handle of where it was going. Except I was wrong. And towards the end of the movie there were a few moments of \u0026ldquo;Oh, so that\u0026rsquo;s what it was for!\u0026rdquo; which was a pretty good indication. There was a bit of a cop out at the ending, but I guess that they want this to be a \u0026ldquo;feel-good\u0026rdquo; action movie so whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re not yet tired of Shia Lebouf and his half-dorky antics, the movie\u0026rsquo;s not a bad way to waste a couple of hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"flockcredit\" style=\"text-align: right; color: #ccc; font-size: x-small;\"\u003e\n  Blogged with the\u003cbr /\u003e \u003ca style=\"color: #999; font-weight: bold;\" title=\"Flock Browser\" href=\"http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock\" target=\"_new\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e Flock Browser\u003cbr /\u003e \u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

I opened two Mythic Rares which was obviously above average. As a side note, I don\u0026rsquo;t know about the secondary market effect but when opening boosters, Mythic Rares are absolutely a home run. You find yourself excited to open every Alara booster in hopes of ripping a Mythic!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo game blow-by-blow this time. I went 3 and 1, losing in round 2 to an Exalted deck.

that I managed to borrow an Ajani Goldmane on the day of the PTQ and swapped it out for a Wilt-Leaf Liege.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a couple more tournament reports to wrap up after this, so I\u0026rsquo;ll make this quick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1 vs Faeries: 0-2 loss. The opponent was a guy from HK; luckily I\u0026rsquo;m pretty used to talking with HK-accented people, so we had almost no communication trouble at all. The only time I couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand him was when he tried to bounce something using Cryptic Command, I had no idea what the phrase he was using for bouncing was! I made a misplay in game two by playing a Spectral Procession from my hand instead of from under Windbrisk Heights when it was available. I also had a sideboarding problem where I didn\u0026rsquo;t think he would have Stillmoon Cavaliers (and hence had no Moonglove Extract). Those same cavaliers helped him stabilize at 3 life to take game two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2 vs Demigod DW: 2-1 win. My opponent didn\u0026rsquo;t board out Ashenmoor Gougers, which are so bad in this format. He was stuck on three lands for game three, and I had a Forge-Tender on the board to stop Spout, and he couldn\u0026rsquo;t cast the Soul Snuffers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3 vs Unknown Deck (I have something scribbled in my notes, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t read it!): 2-1 win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4 vs Gbw No Doran: 0-2 loss. In game three, he had two Stillmoon Cavaliers that I didn\u0026rsquo;t see at all in the first two games. Those guys went all the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5 vs Little Kid GW: 2-0 win. It was fun for the Stillmoon Cavalier to jump on block 5/6 flying indestructible vigilance guys. His two big guys on the board were no match to my seven + Mirrorweave in game one. In game two, apparently he boarded in Runed Halo, which are pretty bad vs Spectral Procession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6 vs Doran the Explorer: 2-1 win. My opponent drew no Firespouts in game three; he really had no chance here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 7 vs Demigod DW: 2-0 win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTournament record: 5-2. I finished the PTQ in 14th place, good enough to win 4 booster packs. My prize rares were: Balefire Liege, Glamerdye, Ashling the Extinguisher, Scarecrone (Not so good)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched the finals of the Grand Prix of course. The official coverage is okay, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t capture some of the unique FIlipino elements. Even though I was still playing in the PTQ during the quarters, we immediately knew that Luis Magisa had won his match since every Filipino in the crowd watching literally burst into cheers. Contrast to the lackluster clapping when Magisa lost to a Japanese Faerie player in the semis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the awarding ceremony, the crowd was very rowdy, chanting \u0026ldquo;Burger! Burger!\u0026rdquo; when Luis Magisa accepted his giant check. (\u003ca href=\"http://bryanbibat.blogspot.com/2008/09/on-cheeseburgers.html\"\u003eBry would hate that\u003c/a\u003e.) The winner of the event, Sugaya pandered to the crowd as well, more than willing to pose for photos after accepting his giant check. (His get-up was ridiculous.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of players were asking name players such as Tomoharu Saito or Raphael Levy to sign some cards for them; I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s good for us to treat them that way. They\u0026rsquo;re Magic celebrities sure, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think their signature adds anything to the cards. It\u0026rsquo;s ok to look up to them for their gameplay or deck ideas or what not, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think we should idolize them or anything \u0026ndash; they\u0026rsquo;re still Magic players like the rest of us, except they\u0026rsquo;re more willing to devote their time to the game.\\And someday, we\u0026rsquo;re going to have to rise up and challenge their dominance of Magic in the Asia-Pacific region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s all for GP Manila, hopefully we can have another big event in the Philippines soon. Props go out to the people at \u003ca href=\"http://www.neutralgrounds.net/\"\u003eNeutral Grounds\u003c/a\u003e for organizing the event and being able to support 600+ people even though the DCI people were only expecting around 400+.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Grand Prix Manila 08 has come and gone and is in the history books. While the Wizards official coverage gives you the play-by-play and the results, I’ll see if I can’t provide any interesting stories about my first constructed Grand Prix event.\nFor the PTQ on day two, I decided to just use the Kithkin build we made for Paul, except that I put in Stillmoon Cavaliers maindeck, taking out Knight of Meadowgrain.",

I keep a two-lander with some good creature control spells. He starts with a Forest and I realize he\u0026rsquo;splaying some sort of monogreen elves deck. Unfortunately, it was a bad keep for me and my hand never got past the 2 lands. My notes show I never dealt a single point of damage in this game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI board in Sowers and Austere Commands. For game two, the tides are reversed, as I gain two life off a Kitchen Finks and never change my life total after that. An early Wren\u0026rsquo;s Run Packmaster that got Sower\u0026rsquo;ed basically won me the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor game three, we didn\u0026rsquo;t have much time, with barely 15 minutes left in the clock. However, my opponent had to mulligan to four cards, so we started with twelve minutes left on the clock. Not enough time for the control deck to win normally, I instead went aggro with Finks. I sowered the first creature he played \u0026ndash; a Wren\u0026rsquo;s Run Vanquisher, planning to aggro with it. Unfortunately, the very next turn he managed to play out a second Vanquisher AND a Packmaster, following up later turns with two consecutive Colossus, making it difficult to advance on the ground. I had managed to bring him to 3 life by this point, but then he slowly started climbing up in life via Sapseep Forest. We hit time and it was clear neither of us could win in the five extra turns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a bit frustrated at this point since I was wondering whether he took too long in mulliganning, but I realized three minutes for three mulligans seemed reasonable. On the fifth turn I offered \u0026ldquo;Would you like to concede?\u0026rdquo; but neither of us would give way so my first round ended in a draw. I was well in control of the game and would have won easily if we only had ten or fifteen more minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was one thing I had not planned \u0026ndash; I would be hitting extra time more often than not; I needed to learn to play faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch Record: 0-0-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame Record: 1-1-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 2.\u003c/strong\u003e He led with Silvergill Adept and mostly islands, so I figured I was up against traditional UW merfolk. Unfortunately not! His deck had loads of card advantage: Silvergill Adept, Wistful Selkie, Sage\u0026rsquo;s Dousing, Familiar\u0026rsquo;s Ruse (to reset the Adepts and Selkie!) which made it difficult for me to keep pace with mass removal. He also had the usual Reejerey and Mirror Entity. But the biggest problem for me had to be the Inkfathom Infiltrators, who needed a Firespout to be killed (could not be Shriekmawed!) I eventually lost game three to a pair of Infiltrators that I was unable to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 0-1-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame record: 2-3-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously not a very good start. However, it could only get better, right? (Famous last words)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 3.\u003c/strong\u003e This one was traditional UW merfolk. I lost game one to an aggro rush, making a mistake of walking a Cryptic Command into a Cursecatcher (curses, haven\u0026rsquo;t fought against those in a while!) In game two I managed to take control and win the game. In game three, I had a nice hand: 3 lands and four relevant spells (Firepout, Cryptic Command x2, Kitchen FInks). However, all 3 lands were filter lands! I figured it was okay\u0026hellip;  i had two draws to get there, and drawing any other non-filter lands would get me running. Of course, it turned out to be a bad keep, and I never went beyond those 3 lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 0-2-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame record: 3-5-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point I was thinking of dropping since I knew an X-2-1 record wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make it in, given the high attendance. My opponent seemed to think otherwise, so I decided to proceed. (She later turned out to be wrong)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 4.\u003c/strong\u003e I was facing a ramp-style Doran deck, with Fertile Grounds to accelerate into fatties such as Chameleon Colossus and Cloudthresher. I won game three off playing three Runed Halos (two of them for Chameleon Colossus), and my opponent complained about how he\u0026rsquo;d been Runed Halo\u0026rsquo;ed all day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I finally won!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 1-2-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame record: 5-6-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 5.\u003c/strong\u003e He starts out with a Plains and a Stalwart, and I know the enemy. My chances are good as long as he doesn\u0026rsquo;t have that 1-2-3 punch autopilot draw. Oh wait, yes he did \u0026ndash; almost. I stayed alive but had to use up my Shriekmaw to take out a Wizened Cenn, which meant I was helpless against the Burrenton Forge-Tender and Spectral Procession that followed. He got an even more insane draw on the next game; I could only remember that I was unable to fight back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatch record: 1-3-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame record: 5-8-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point I was tired of losing and decided to drop. I remember ticking drop on my result slip, but based on the play history at the DCI webapp, I actually got a match loss for the next round. Huh. Oh well, I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like contesting it \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;m sure the guy appreciated the free DCI rating points (I lost about 20-30 in that one)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, my Grand Prix was over \u0026ndash; I spent the rest of the day watching my teammates play and watching feature matches. It was great seeing Levy, Saito, Shuhei, etc. in action. The Japanese especially, they make their moves quickly, never hesitating, it\u0026rsquo;s amazing. We also got some Chameleon Colossuses and Makeshift Mannequins signed by the artist Darrel Riche.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBonus Tournament Report: Switch playing 5-color Elementals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003caddress\u003e\n  The following section is unedited from a Yahoo Messenger conversation!\n\u003c/address\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(20:45:21) switch_nftzu: round 1: RDW (with deuses of calamity instead of demigods) 1-2. apparently, this guy went 3-0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(20:45:31) switch_nftzu: round 2: QnT 1-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(20:45:40) switch_nftzu: round 3: faeries 2-0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(20:45:59) switch_nftzu: round 4: mana acc/landie: 2-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(20:46:40) switch_nftzu: round 5: doran (though i didn\u0026rsquo;t know until the last turn, where he played a treefolk harbinger, and i noticed one too many draws) 2-0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(20:47:27) switch_nftzu: round 6: doran 2-0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(20:48:28) switch_nftzu: round 7: RDW 2-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(20:48:40) switch_nftzu: round 8: cairn wanderer 0-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(20:56:21) switch_nftzu: round 1: lost in extra turns to a topdecked redcap when i was down to 2: was playing for the draw\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(20:56:32) switch_nftzu: round 2: death by oona\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(20:49:35) switch_nftzu: wins: rd 3: guy didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to play the deck (e.g. snakeform on colossus before declaring attacks)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(20:50:19) switch_nftzu: rd 4: win game one, beat down by oversoul \u0026amp; colossus, mull to 5, kill turn 2 and turn 3 devoted druids, he gets stuck on 3 lands long enough for me to bash\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(20:51:11) switch_nftzu: rd 5: he had no plays game 1 except for austere command, he mulls to 6 on game two, has 2 lands and 6 cards in hand by turn 2: game loss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(20:52:55) switch_nftzu: rd 6: round after riche signs colossi, they immediately pay dividends by stomping in game 1. game 2 he gets down runed halo on gouger and horde, i get him down to 2 white vivids and 1 black vivid, all with no counters with fulminator mages for a few turns, eventually bash with 8/8 colossus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eswitch_nftzu: i think he faerie macabres the two fulminator mages in the grave\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(20:55:42) switch_nftzu: rd 7: i suppose colossus wins me game 1, last life standings were 11-12 against me. i flag a bit (2 land, smokebraider hand against a deck with spout) and get chomped by demigod. round three: harbinger for smokebraider, smokebraider. he thoughtseizes and chooses colossus over fulminator. i kill his vivid, harbinger for fulminator, kill his next vivid, leaving him with a filterland for maybe 6 turns where i case another smokebraider, mulldrifter and eventually lark to fetch the fulminators to kill his only land and have a fulminator in play\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(20:55:49) switch_nftzu: you saw my death in round 8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, I did see him die in the final round \u0026ndash; to a 4/4 Protection from Black, red and white, protection from converted mana cost 3 or greater, first strike, lifelink, vigilance monster.

He was well ahead \u0026ndash; having something like eight creatures to his opponents two, and didn\u0026rsquo;t even bother taking down the opposing Ajani Goldmane instead going straight for the head.

While the \u003ca href=\"http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpman08/welcome\"\u003eWizards official coverage\u003c/a\u003e gives you the play-by-play and the results, I’ll see if I can’t provide any interesting stories about my first constructed Grand Prix event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGrand Prix Manila, Day Zero\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI met up with Switch and Alex at the venue (Megatrade hall in SM Megamall) early and got in by 10 am. I had originally been planning to play the grinders with Kithkin; but since I was planning to play five-color control in the main event I figured I might as well get some practice in and hopefully get 3 byes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, I was unable to assemble it in the morning; so I had somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 minutes to assemble it after signing up for the second trial. The mistake was that I didn’t have a 5-color control decklist to reference, and I built it with only 25 lands. We had to buy Runed Halos from the dealers (they were a bit cheap)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 25 land count would come back to haunt me, as I kept a two-land hand in the first round of the first trial and never recovered. I believe my opponent then was from South Korea and was playing Doran. I quickly lost and was thus eliminated from the trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStubbornly, I thought it was only bad luck and went in for another trial. In round one I faced a Kithkin player from Singapore. I was able to keep him under control and win in two games. In round two I faced Elementals, a pretty bad matchup for 5-color control in general, but even worse when I only had 25 lands! Two Fulminator mages sealed game one for him, and in game two I managed to get myself hit by Mind Shatter for 5! Obviously I quickly lost and was dropped from the trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Ang brutal naman ng trials!\u0026rdquo; – Alex\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex gave it a try as well, playing Kithkin, but lost in round one of his trial as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwitch on the other hand, had decided to give limited a try, playing sealed deck in the Super FNM tournament. He only managed a 1-2 record before dropping; at least he had a card pool with a Reflecting Pool!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe spent the rest of the day watching grinders, trading and building a deck for Switch. We had decided to assemble an elementals build for him and the Reflecting Pool he got from the Super FNM would help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the day, more than 480 players had signed up for the Grand Prix. The turnout would be larger than expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGrand Prix Manila, Day One\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwitch, Alex and I again made it to the venue early. Paul made it just before they closed off registration. The turnout was a lot more than expected and the venue couldn’t handle it, so they had to cut the registrants at 640.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are the decks we

I didn’t have a regular playtest group, and I needed some people to bounce ideas off. I formed a mailing list on Yahoo Groups and added the following (last names withheld unless they request it):\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\"\u003e\n  Mike \"Switch\" – Switch and I have known each other forever and basically started playing Magic around the same time.

You know, with Tundras/Wraths/Swords to Plowshares/whatever. Paul doesn’t play often, but he said he wanted to play, so I said we’d just build him a deck that would be easy to play.

I proposed the following plan: For the grinders on Friday, I would play the Kithkin deck, and we would assemble Switch’s deck on that same day. For the GP proper, I would assemble a five-color control deck similar to Gerry Thompson’s GP-winning decklist.\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\"\u003e\n    Next: The Grinders\n  \u003c/p\u003e",

I decided to write a simple message board application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrote the message board pretty quickly using Django; it took me about 2-3 hours to have a bare-bones message board up and running. (I was watching Speed Racer at the same time.) The UI is horrendous of course, but it\u0026rsquo;s functional, with categories and topics, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow to deploy the message board app somewhere. After a bit of searching around, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any suitable free Django webhosting. So I went with the backup plan: I\u0026rsquo;d upload the project to the Google App Engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve had a Google App Engine account for a while now, but haven\u0026rsquo;t done anything with it yet. Unfortunately, a Django app can\u0026rsquo;t be ported directly to GAE as Google has their own datastore implementation which won\u0026rsquo;t work with Django\u0026rsquo;s models. So I spent the rest of the day porting/rewriting the message board app for use with GAE. Google has their own guide for this sort of porting here: \u003ca href=\"http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/django.html\"\u003eRunning Django on Google App Engine\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome problems encountered when porting:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCan\u0026rsquo;t seem to use the list_detail generic view; I get errors about undefined user attribute on the request\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSometimes after editing a view, I get random \u0026ldquo;NoneType has no attibute get\u0026rdquo; errors. Restarting the dev_appserver fixes this.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUnlike Django, GAE models don\u0026rsquo;t have an \u0026ldquo;id\u0026rdquo; primary key. Instead, you must use object.key() which returns some sort of hash string (making for very inconvenient urls)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m having \u003ca href=\"http://random-encounters.appspot.com/forum/cat/CxIIQ2F0ZWdvcnkYAww/\"\u003eerrors raised during 404s\u003c/a\u003e; the problem is mentioned in \u003ca href=\"/forum/cat/CxIIQ2F0ZWdvcnkYAww/\"\u003ethis thread\u003c/a\u003e which should already be fixed but I\u0026rsquo;m still encountering it.

PTQ is the same day as WoW TCG Nationals. There aren\u0026rsquo;t enough tables, so around 40% of the players need to wait for tables to be freed up before they can play. As you can imagine, this makes for long rounds, around 1 hour and 45 minutes each.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1 vs Kithkin: 0-2 loss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs usual, I got trampled in game one and managed to fight him off in game two only to lose by the slimmest of margins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2 vs Elementals: 1-2 loss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe card advantage off Mulldrifters (and Mannequin\u0026rsquo;ed Mulldrifters) really hurts here. I can hold off his forces and manage to get a Hallowed Burial to take away all his guys in game three, but he has a full grip so he just untaps and shows me the Horde of Notions while I\u0026rsquo;m at five life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBah! With the lack of tables and losses, I tell DJ to drop me from the tournament as we report the result. I figured it wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth it. But then I remembered a guy I was trading with would arrive around 6 PM, and it was only 3:30 (yes, it was 3:30 and we were still in round 2), so I took it back and went in for some more punishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3: 2-0 win vs B/W Runed Halo deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the lack of tables we\u0026rsquo;re forced to play at the nearby Dim Sum place (luckily they didn\u0026rsquo;t chase us away). The kid is a nice guy, but he\u0026rsquo;s playing in his first tournament and he learned Magic barely three weeks ago. He has nice cards though \u0026ndash; his deck had Rune Halos, Archons of Justice, Hallowed Burial, Oona. Unfortunately, he had too many do-nothings \u0026ndash; first time I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Goldenglow%20Moth\"\u003eGoldenglow Moth\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Greater%20Auramancy\"\u003eGreater Auramancy\u003c/a\u003e in a constructed deck (I know you need to click the links \u0026ndash; I doubt you know what those cards are!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crush him without any opposition. I give him some friendly words of advice, although I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how he felt taking them from someone who was 0-2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4 vs Faeries: 2-1 win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get Bitterblossom advantage in game two. In game three, I won the race by tapping him down with Cryptic Command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5 vs Demigod: 2-1 win\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot your usual Demigod deck, as he has random Creakwood Lieges and Bitterblossoms. But I saw the Demigod in game one, so Crib Swaps were boarded in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won game one. In game two I saw a hand with two lands, two Silvergill Adepts and a Banneret and I figured it was good. Except when I played my first land I realized I had kept a Mutavault and a Sunken Ruins. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t cast anything before he killed me. I came back in game three and won without taking any damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, I\u0026rsquo;m feeling a streak, thinking maybe I can still win 3 more in a row to hit 6-2. This is a lie; at every point in the tournament I\u0026rsquo;m thinking I can win all the remaining ones. I just mentioned it here because obviously I would be disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6 vs QnT: 0-2 loss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn game one, I was at 10 life and he was at 14, and I figured a 2nd Bitterblossom would close the gap so I risked it. On his turn, he hit me with Profane Command for 4, bringing back Kitchen Finks, giving me 3 turns to live and 16 points to chase. I try to Cryptic Command my own Bitterblossom on the fatal turn, but he showed me his own command and would have none of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn game two I\u0026rsquo;m stuck on two lands, with Dousings, Adepts and a Banneret in my hand, but I have colored mana this time. I play the Adepts first, hoping to draw into lands. I don\u0026rsquo;t draw anymore and am forced to play the Banneret, which gets wiped away in a Firespout. In hindsight, since my hand had 2 Dousings (and I drew the 3rd one shortly after), I should have led with Adept, then Banneret, giving me 3 power on board and 3 turns of countermagic available. He was stuck at four lands all game, so that play might have been enough. Since I didn\u0026rsquo;t do it, he managed to play a Chameleon Colossus which takes me down for 20.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve had enough, I\u0026rsquo;m out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal record: 3-3 matches, 7-8 games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s too much. I can\u0026rsquo;t play this deck at the Grand Prix. The wins are too marginal, and the Kithkin matchup is too much of a tossup. I need to think about how I\u0026rsquo;m going to modify it (or what deck to audible into)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I\u0026rsquo;ve practically won; despite Ajani\u0026rsquo;s vigilance, I could tap down his army with the Command (and bounce Ajani), and the effect from Pollen Lullaby still applies so they won\u0026rsquo;t untap before my army gets another swing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he says done, I don\u0026rsquo;t untap and draw my Cryptic Command. At this point, I have seven lands in play and an active Mirror Entity. I look at the life totals and see he\u0026rsquo;s at six. Somehow, what goes through my head is that the Entity could kill him in one swing. So I did! And I immediately pumped for seven!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spirit tokens were all of course, still quite untapped as I had not yet played the Cryptic Command. T_T\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow, what a lapse. I had to write \u0026ldquo;MISPLAY\u0026rdquo; in all caps so that I never forget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames: 2-3, Matches: 1-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 3:\u003c/strong\u003e PWC Special vs Demigod Red\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got lucky in both games 2 and 3 as he drew far too many land and couldn\u0026rsquo;t finish me off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames: 5-5, Matches: 2-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile waiting for the next round, I did a few playtest games with Joel \u0026ldquo;gjarkeld\u0026rdquo; Bantilles playing Kithkin, so I could get a better feel for the matchup. I don\u0026rsquo;t usually name drop here, pero gusto raw ni Joel mabanggit sa blog ko e!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 4:\u003c/strong\u003e PWC Special vs Kithkin/Mirrormaster\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond time around, I have a better idea how to fight the matchup. The main defensive key in game one is the Banneret into Sower opening. Even if they kill the Sower, it\u0026rsquo;s like you time walked them since they didn\u0026rsquo;t do anything for a turn. If you do get to untap with the Sower, you\u0026rsquo;re iin good shape. I won game one this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor game two, I sided into board control:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-4 Merfolk Reejerey, -2 Peppersmoke, -1 Mirror Entity, -1 Bitterblossom, +2 Hallowed Burial, +2 Shriekmaw, +2 Eyeblight\u0026rsquo;s Ending, +2 Pollen Lullaby\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled out the Reejereys because I didn\u0026rsquo;t want him to be a Mirrorweave target. (More on this in round seven!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won game two in three quick swings according to my notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames: 7-5, Matches: 3-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 5:\u003c/strong\u003e PWC Special vs Justice Toast\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember reading somewhere that Justice Toast was an underdog to Merfolk, so I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too worried. I figured as long as I could stick a Bitterblossom or hit the Merfolk aggro engine, I should be fine. None of those things happened in two games!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames: 7-7, Matches: 3-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHay\u0026hellip; I was thinking of dropping at this point, but I figured I needed more play experience for the GP (I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to play in the last 2 Sunday GPTs)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 6:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePWC Special vs Kithkin (again)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure whether he was in fact playing Mirror Master since in game one he showed me only the Goldmeadow tapper and Rise of the Hobgoblins and a million plains. I boarded -2 Peppersmoke, +2 Hallowed Burial since I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won both games off the Banneret into Sower plan, since he didn\u0026rsquo;t draw any Unmakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames: 9-7, Matches: 4-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 7:\u003c/strong\u003e PWC Special vs Kithkin yet again\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was expecting I would win round 5 since my tendency seems to be to gravitate towards a 5-2 record. Unluckily I was paired againt Joel (whom I mentioned above; dapat daw sabihin ko \u0026ldquo;Hayup yung si Joel!\u0026quot;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn game one he dropped me to below 10 quickly, but I stabilized a bit with a Bitterblossom. He was still at 20 and I had an entity, so I figured I needed to get a creature advantage and then entity him to death. I thought about it for a bit, then played a second Bitterblossom. I was hoping that either I would draw a Cryptic Command or he would have 1-2 turns without drawing creatures, in which case the Bitterblossom advantage would be enough. Unfortunately I went to as low as 2 and we still had equal counts and the next draw was a land, so I scooped for game two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went with the same board plan as round 4 here, bringing out the Reejereys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn game two I hit every Kithkin with removal as soon as it game down, then went into Bitterblossom mode, and we were racing again. I eventually won due to winning a Pollen Lullaby clash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn game three, he had a quick start and all I had were Bitterblossoms and Sage\u0026rsquo;s Dousings. Even if had drawn a Sower to stop the tide, he had Moonglove Extract and Unmake in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoel commented that I should have boarded out the Dousings, and instead kept in the Reejereys (more creatures). In retrospect he was probably right, especially since I was on the draw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my fist at him and swore vendetta (not really), and then signed the match slip for my disappointing finish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinal Record:\u003c/strong\u003e Games: 10-9, Matches: 4-3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the deck:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, I\u0026rsquo;d say there\u0026rsquo;s about a 60-70% chance I\u0026rsquo;ll be playing this deck at the Grand Prix (even though I\u0026rsquo;ve been known to make deck switches at the last minute)! I went 2-2 against Kithkin today, and 2-1 against other decks. One of the Kithkin losses was arguably due to sheer stupidity/lack of focus, so there\u0026rsquo;s definitely room for improvement there that should come with practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow to figure out the QnT matchup\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Going in, I had an idea that my matchup against red was not very good (same as Faeries I guess), so I groaned inwardly when my opponent started with a mountain and a Figure of Destiny. This was not a good matchup to play my first game with this deck. I lost the two games without putting up much of a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames: 0-2, Matches: 0-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 2:\u003c/strong\u003e PWC Special vs BRg Goblins\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, the \u0026ldquo;g\u0026rdquo; here is for the flying side of Firespout. My opponent started game one with Mountain, Tattermunge Maniac. I play a land and pass. He swings with Maniac, I drop to 18. I play another land and pass. He swings with Maniac, I drop to 16. He prowls out Earwig Squad (!) and I lost 3 Cryptic Commands from my deck. EOT, Nameless Inversion on the Earwig Squad. I play a land and a Banneret. He swings with the Maniac again. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to trade my mana discount for 2 points of damage, so I let it through and drop to 14. Obviously, he has a second Earwig Squad, this time taking out 3 Reejereys from my deck (I was holding the fourth Cryptic Command, obv.) I play another Nameless Inversion for 1 black mana, then untap and lay down a Bitterblossom. Quite possibly a mistake, as he then plays a Squeaking Pie Sneak and a Mad Auntie, then swing with the Maniac for 3. Next turn he plays a second Mad Auntie, and my lone Faerie token won\u0026rsquo;t be able to hold off those hordes. I scoop for game two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh and wonder if I\u0026rsquo;ll be going home early. I board out 1 Bitterblossom, 1 Mirror Entity, bringing in 2 Eyeblight\u0026rsquo;s Ending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second game goes quick; he doesn\u0026rsquo;t have much action and I have a turn 2 Bitterblossom. I hold him off with Peppersmokes and Nameless Inversions while accumulating Faeries, then bring down the surprise Mirror Entity to win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame three is anticlimatic, as he draws no black sources and my fish easily stomp over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames: 2-3, Matches: 1-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 3:\u003c/strong\u003e PWC Special vs Faeries\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe mulls to six in game one, and I have a Bitterblossom first. He gets me down to one, but I resolve a Mirror Entity and the tokens swarm in for twelve damage to win the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe mulls to five and I don\u0026rsquo;t take a single point of damage in this game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames: 4-3, Matches: 2-1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 4:\u003c/strong\u003e PWC Special vs Doran\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI win the first game since my Bitterblossom came out before his. I board in Wispmares for his Blossoms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two I lose to a turn four Chameleon Colossus that I have no answer for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame three I made a play mistake that may have cost me the game. He had Doran out and was beating down, I had Wispmare and Nameless Inversion in hand but didn\u0026rsquo;t play out the Wispmare, still hoping to catch a Bitterblossom (which I later found he sided out!) After passing the turn, I realized I could\u0026rsquo;ve killed Doran with those two cards and the Wispmare would survive to counterattack. I did that play the following turn and got rid of Doran, then started rallying with a Bitterblossom. We hit the time limit here, but due to Bitterblossom I would die in turn four of extra time; meaning I had to win with a lethal attack on turn two. It\u0026rsquo;s turn one; I\u0026rsquo;m at two life and he has no blockers; he plays out Treefolk Harbinger and tutors for Crib Swap, putting it on top. That Crib Swap didn\u0026rsquo;t matter; what mattered was the Crib Swap he had in hand. On turn two, during my upkeep, I drop to one life and he turns one of the active Faeries into a changeling, and suddenly I\u0026rsquo;m short by one point of damage to win the game (the Harbinger can block my ground guy!). I need to topdeck: any sort of removal (to clear the blocker) or Wispmare (to clear the Bitterblossom) or Cryptic Command. I go into my draw step and rip\u0026hellip; a swamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m signing the result slip and I keep thinking about if I had played that Wispmare a turn earlier, I would\u0026rsquo;ve had an extra point of damage to work with\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames: 5-5, Matches -2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of going home and back to the metaphorical drawing board, but the people I\u0026rsquo;m playing with convince me to keep going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 5:\u003c/strong\u003e PWC Special vs Monoblue Merfolk/Wizards\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHooray, someone actually made a deck with the Sage of Fables/Glen Elendra Archmage combination!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lose game one for some reason, but then I board in Pollen Lullabies. I never win the clash on these things, but the fog effect is more than enough to win me games two and three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames: 7-6, Matches: 3-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 6:\u003c/strong\u003e PWC Special vs Doran\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame one he has only two lands for like five turns, so it\u0026rsquo;s a blowout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two he puts up a fight and we reach a stall where has Doran and Vexing Shusher on the ground at nine life, I\u0026rsquo;m at ten life with Bitterblossom, some faeries and some fish on the ground. On his turn he declines the attack and instead goes for Profane Command for eight (not even reserving mana for the Shusher!), losing me 8 life and taking out one of my Reejereys. He figures he\u0026rsquo;ll just stall the ground with Doran and Shusher and let my own Bitterblossom take me down. I\u0026rsquo;ve been chump blocking the Doran with Faerie tokens for several turns now, so he figures I have no removal among the two cards in my hand. He finds out he\u0026rsquo;s wrong when I show two Eyeblight\u0026rsquo;s Ending at EOT, leaving him open. I swing with everyone without even counting, and it\u0026rsquo;s exactly nine points of damage, enough to win the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames: 9-6, Matches: 4-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne more round, rankings are up and I\u0026rsquo;m at 22.

I stabilize at around 10 life with a blossom in play and manage to take the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two he goes turn one Figure of Destiny; turn two attack, pump; turn three Ram-Gang, attack for 5, etc. I make a misplay when I let one of my tribal lands come into play tapped on turn two (instead of leaving mana open for the Nameless Inversion in my hand.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame three is too close, but I correctly counter a Flame Javelin when it matters, leaving him only with a Puncture Blast to shoot me when I\u0026rsquo;m at five (with Bitterblossom in play of course!) the turn before I swing for lethal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinal Record:\u003c/strong\u003e Games: 11-7, Matches: 5-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eX-2 finish is good enough for me to land in the 16th spot, and I win\u0026hellip; 3 boosters! The only good rare I get is Cascade Bluffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis deck is awesome and fun to play, but having Bitterblossom out against red or doran is really scary and leads to quite close finishes. I don\u0026rsquo;t know yet about the Faerie matchup (only fought one, but seems positive) and the Kithkin matchup (none encountered!), although I think the Pollen Lullaby would work well against the Kith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext week: PTQ Berlin!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
