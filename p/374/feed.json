I\u0026rsquo;m not bad about the PC having problems per se, I\u0026rsquo;m fairly sure it\u0026rsquo;s currently impossible to make 100% defect-free electronics. What I\u0026rsquo;m particularly pissed at was the poor customer service. Their phone lines are almost always busy, their testing of components was not done properly (it was only after they replace the mobo and the power supply that they found out that it was a faulty hard drive that caused the problem, forcing me to have to wait another three weeks for a replacement drive\u0026hellip; but I just went out and bought a new one anyway\u0026hellip; ) and it\u0026rsquo;s hard to get to them because of their office hours, and\u0026hellip; I could go on and on. I guess the distinct disadvantage of buying from cheaper stores is that the customer service is poorer. Or maybe I\u0026rsquo;m just unlucky. In any case, my next PC will be an Intel one, this time I\u0026rsquo;ll probably buy one of those pre-assembled \u0026ldquo;Package\u0026rdquo; PCs from a mall outlet, just to have a basis of comparison.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNew mailing list! \u003ca href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rpg-skies/?yguid=108755291\"\u003eRPG-Skies\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAm tired, more later.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eGood plot twists you could see from a mile away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, we had arrived at the theater too late to catch the start of the last showing of \u003cem\u003eGangs of New York\u003c/em\u003e, so we had to settle with the second choice. _The Recruit _didn\u0026rsquo;t get as much critical acclaim as \u003cem\u003eGangs\u003c/em\u003e, but what the heck, Al Pacino in a spy thriller? How could I lose?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story is simple enough. Colin Farell plays James Clayton, a young man just out of MIT, recruited by CIA agent William Burke (Pacino). Clayton is obsessed with finding out what happened to his father, who was lost in an accident some fifteen or so years ago. Pacino taunts him by dropping the occasional hint about his father\u0026rsquo;s fate, and Clayton throws away the promising career he would have had in Engineering to join the CIA. The third entry to this little affair is Leila, Clayton\u0026rsquo;s batchmate at the Farm, a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echick who may or may not be a double agent, but definitely has the hots for him. The three of them expectedly get involved a complicated plot involving double agents, unofficial operatives and the standard amount of secret agent sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best parts of the movie involve the CIA training. We get a glimpse into the kind of psychological warfare business they teach the recruits at the training centre affectionately called \u0026ldquo;The Farm.\u0026rdquo; Here Al Pacino does what he does, drilling his principles into his students: \u0026ldquo;Trust no one.\u0026quot;; \u0026ldquo;Nothing is what is seems.\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Everything is a test.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weakest part has to be the character of James Clayton himself. The character of Leila puts it best: Why the hell does James feel like doing anything he can to please Burke? James never has any real motivation for following Burke like he was the Messiah. Aside from that mysterious star on the CIA wall at Langley (which may or may not be related to his father), there is nothing stopping James from just calling it quits and heading home. Hell, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have wanted to go through that training,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esecret agent or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall: Enjoyable enough, despite the predictability of the overall plot. Ending is a bit disappointing, but only a bit, as it leaves an important plot point hanging. I hope we see these characters again sometime\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Square stock will be bought out for Enix stock at 0.81 Square per 1 Enix. The Square president will be head of Square Enix, the Enix board remains in place, they\u0026rsquo;ll move into Enix headquarters in Shibuya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll currently announced releases will go on as scheduled. A FF/DW merger may be in the offing, but no definite plans, and probably only as a side release. No personnel will be let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquaresoft is: Final Fantasy, Chrono, Xeno, SaGa, Mana and assorted other titles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnix is: Dragon Quest/Warrior, Soul Blazer series, 7th Saga, Actraiser, Tri-Ace (Star Ocean, Valkyrie Profile), and a lot of stuff that never made it outside Japan. Enix also has a deal with GameArts on co-developing the Grandia series.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSony, one of Square\u0026rsquo;s major stockholders, will have it\u0026rsquo;s shares diluted to 8% of Square/Enix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNamco, another game company also has some stock in both Square and Enix, and is the publisher of Xenogears\u0026rsquo; prequel, Xenosaga.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquare also has a US publishing deal with EA, set to expire at the end of the year. (This last tidbit may not mean anything\u0026hellip; )\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquare also recently acquired the Quest team (responsible for Tactics Ogre series) and the rights to the Ogre Battle franchise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, what can we see?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst off, Enix will be in control, at least at first. Although the Square guy will be Pres, the Pres can always be overridden by the board, and the Enix board will remain in place until they hold a stockholder election thingy, whatever that\u0026rsquo;s called. You might think this is bad \u0026ldquo;Oh no, Enix is in control, that means FF is doomed!\u0026rdquo; Of course not. They\u0026rsquo;re not stupid. The fact is that Enix being in control of the company\u0026rsquo;s vision and direction makes more sense in light of Square and Enix\u0026rsquo;s overlapping powers. Square develops most of it\u0026rsquo;s products in-house, while Enix publishes a lot of products from other developers like Tri-Ace and Gamearts. Therefore, it makes more sense for Enix to be in control of administrative/business stuff, leaving Square staff to focus on what they do best — game development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what does this mean to us as gamers? In the immediate future, nothing really. All the currently announced projects are unaffected: we\u0026rsquo;ll still get FFXI, FFXII, FF:Crystal Chronicle, FFTA, Unlimited Saga, etc. The only thing I\u0026rsquo;ve found people to be questioning on message boards is whether FF1-2 (which still doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a definite announcement of a US release) will have an English version. This is a possible concern, as Enix didn\u0026rsquo;t even bother to release an English version of their own DW4. Who knows, maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll get a collection of DW4 and FF1-2? 😛 (Addendum: FF1-2 has been announced for US release.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut after the immediate future, what then? Square Enix will almost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecertainly continue the Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior lines. The future for the Chrono series also seems bright, as the original Chrono Trigger was a collaboration between Square and some of Enix\u0026rsquo;s creative staff. Stuff from Tri-Ace and GameArts will probably go on as before, seeing as these development studios are mostly independent of Enix anyway. And if we\u0026rsquo;re lucky, we\u0026rsquo;ll get another Soul Blazer trilogy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I worry about are Square\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;secondary\u0026rdquo; RPG series: SaGa and Mana. Now that Square Enix will have two \u0026ldquo;big\u0026rdquo; series under it\u0026rsquo;s roof, will they still have time to develop these still-young series?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough not really related to the merger, things also look bright for fans of FFTactics. Aside from the upcoming FFTA, Square\u0026rsquo;s acquisition of Quest and the Ogre Battle franchise means we\u0026rsquo;ll probably see more FFT/TacticsOgre type games coming from them. Combined with the unique gameplay perspective of Tri-Ace, who knows what interesting games will come out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been looking around on message boards after the news came out, and it seems a lot of people are worried about how Enix might screw up Final Fantasy, or Square screw up Dragon Warrior or anything like that. To this, again I say: They\u0026rsquo;re not stupid. FF and DW, although they have the same roots, are completely different series now, and their different styles again reflect how Square and Enix can complement each other\u0026rsquo;s strengths. Well, I guess DW will benefit the most, as it\u0026rsquo;s sorely lacking in FFs specialty: really good graphics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother concern that has been raised has been the possibility of a monopoly in RPG games. With this merger, a lot of the big RPG names are now under one roof. Won\u0026rsquo;t the lesser competition cause more lackluster RPGs to be put out? Maybe, but I doubt it. Square Enix still can\u0026rsquo;t afford to let up on the quality, as there are still a good number of other good up-and-coming series out there: Suikoden (Konami), Wild Arms (Sony?), Tales (Namco) and Breath of Fire (Capcom) all still have quite some following and good potential. In fact the above titles will probably slug it out for the Number 2 Console RPG Developer slot\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, the opinions I\u0026rsquo;ve read on the web are mixed: some are good, some are bad. My own personal take is that it\u0026rsquo;s good; mergers generally mean two companies wanting to capitalize on each other\u0026rsquo;s strengths, not share each other\u0026rsquo;s weaknesses. Let\u0026rsquo;s just wait and see, and hope for the best. 😛\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The Bourne Identity stars Matt Damon as rogue CIA agent/amnesiac Jason Bourne. In his quest to uncover his own identity, Jason travels all around Europe pursued by the CIA\u0026rsquo;s agents and dragging along an innocent gypsy girl who just happened to be his best shot for a ride to Paris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I haven\u0026rsquo;t read the book in ages, so I can\u0026rsquo;t say for sure how faithfully the story translates to the movie (although as I recall there was a lot more traipsing across Europe — I may be wrong though) so I have to judge the movie on its own merits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn its own merits, the movie falls short of my expectations. Mainly because I was expecting some fast-paced action, but most of the time it\u0026rsquo;s just Jason and Marie running and hiding from the CIA. It\u0026rsquo;s more of an action/thriller than a straight action flick — Jason spends a lot of time trying to uncover the conspiracy behind his pursuers. However, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to pull off either the thriller part or the action part very well. The thriller part doesn\u0026rsquo;t fly because we know what\u0026rsquo;s going on well before Jason does — the movie shows us what\u0026rsquo;s going on at CIA HQ, how his boss travels to Paris to mete him, et cetera. The action part doesn\u0026rsquo;t fly because the thriller parts get in the way. DOn\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, there are some cool action stunts here — Jason riding a free-falling body down the center of a spiral stairway to gun down one of the CIA agents — but they are few and far between. Also, the director seems to enjoy some sort of shaky, jarring camera work — not really a problem but occasionally\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eannoying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall: Good enough, I suppose. The director is no Robert Ludlum\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebut the story is told well enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch5 id=\"austin-powers-in-goldmember\"\u003eAustin Powers in Goldmember\u003c/h5\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo I make you horny baby?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother Austin Powers movie? Well I knew what to expect — more of the same. I got what I expected, but that isn\u0026rsquo;t really a bad thing. As usual with Austin Powers movies, some parts tend to drag on, while some parts are simply \u0026ldquo;laugh-out-loud\u0026rdquo; funny. This time, Dr. Evil enlists the aid of 70\u0026rsquo;s criminal mastermind Goldmember in a nefarious plot to extort money from the world leaders (as if you didn\u0026rsquo;t know.) Austin himself gets some help (aside from the requisite Powers girl Beyonce Knowles as Foxy Cleopatra) — from none other than his dear old dad, legendary secret agent Nigel Powers (played by Michael Caine) This one has a bit more story than the first two — you get to find out more about Austin and Dr. Evil\u0026rsquo;s history, and some strange plot twists ensue. Expect the return of such characters as MiniMe, Fat Bastard and Dr. Evil\u0026rsquo;s wayward son Scott. Also a new character on the side of British Intelligence is played by Wonder Years star Fred Savage\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe funniest parts are mostly during the opening sequence and towards the end. Expect more gross, insensitive and blatantly offensive humor, more naked bodies, more Fat Bastard crapping, more silhouette jokes, more making fun of MiniMe, hollywood cameos, movie spoofs and the like. This time however, things don\u0026rsquo;t stay the same. Some changes in the status quo happen towards the end and this will obviously not be the last Austin Powers movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall: I liked the second one better, but this one\u0026rsquo;s good too. As is the case with Austin Powers movies, it\u0026rsquo;s not for the easily offended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch5 id=\"signs\"\u003eSigns\u003c/h5\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrop circles? This isn\u0026rsquo;t the X-files is it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf the three movies I saw this week, \u0026ldquo;Signs\u0026rdquo; was the one I was looking forward to the least. The trailer didn\u0026rsquo;t really give me a good impression — looked like some cheap X-Files ripoff with Mel Gibson as Fox Mulder. As it usually happens, turns out I was wrong about the whole thing \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;Signs\u0026rdquo; is one helluva good movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s get it out first: \u0026ldquo;Signs\u0026rdquo; is about an alien invasion. We\u0026rsquo;re talking spaceships and green men. However, unlike movies like Independence Day which tell the story of how the world comes together to defeat an alien menace, \u0026ldquo;Signs\u0026rdquo; tells the story of how a family comes together to survive fear, paranoia and green men knocking on their door. All of the Independence Day stuff happens, but never at the forefront of the story — the giant spaceships are there, somewhere in the background, shown on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story is about a farmer and his family in a small rural town. Overnight, mysterious crop circles appear in his fields. Later on, more signs appear — prowlers around their house, strange radio noises. As a former minister, Mel Gibson faces what he fears the most — the idea that there is no God, and that he and his family are left to fend for themselves against whatever threat is there lurking in the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe movie is extremely well-written, with all the characters playing their parts well, and all the elements coming together towards the end to make a whole lot of sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall: Go see it. Now. Unless you\u0026rsquo;re like my kid brother who would probably get nightmares just thinking about an alien invasion.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m pissed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday I went to Ortigas for a job interview with a nameless IT company where my cousin Rachel works. I was quite optimistic too — the position was for a \u0026ldquo;Java Trainee.\u0026rdquo; I was more than willing to be trained, and a trainee position meant you didn\u0026rsquo;t have to be proficient in Java right? Turns out I was wrong. =( Apparently they needed someone with some experience in Java, preferably with a project or two under his belt. I tried to convince the interviewer that I had a lot of raw talent and learn pretty fast anyway, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t got any high hopes. That pissed me off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven worse, I had gone to Ortigas with just enough cash to make the trip back and forth. I had left a good two hundred bucks at home ‘coz I forgot to pick \u0026lsquo;em up and put \u0026lsquo;em in my wallet. I was thinking of trying out the arcade version of Capcom vs SNK 2, maybe buying a CD or two. But no! Now I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even grab a bite on the way home. That pissed me off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater that night, my mother was watching \u0026ldquo;While You Were Sleeping\u0026rdquo;, and I was feeling so depressed I was wondering what would happen if I ended up like Sandra Bullock at the start of the movie — alone, and working a dead end job as a ticket seller. Sigh\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s not just the fact that I\u0026rsquo;m still unemployed — it\u0026rsquo;s been a good nine months now and I\u0026rsquo;ve kinda gotten used to that. It\u0026rsquo;s the realization that despite whatever work I\u0026rsquo;ve done in school, I can\u0026rsquo;t get a job. It\u0026rsquo;s as if everything I learned in college was useless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was finishing up in UP, everything seemed simple — I\u0026rsquo;d graduate and all my troubles would be over. I\u0026rsquo;d get a job at maybe Canon or Intel, save a bit, buy a new computer and a PS2, et cetera. To tell the truth I was probably spoiled by those teachers that kept telling us that simply being graduates of the State University was good enough to land a job. I ought to sue those teachers for mental anguish or something. I graduated from one of the hardest course at one of the best universities in the country, and I can\u0026rsquo;t land a job. Gosh darn it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter thinking about this, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d evaluate my own skills to see what could be done. Lemme see, I can do:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmbedded software. Since I did two thesis-level projects involving embedded software, I reckon I\u0026rsquo;m fairly good at this. The problem is that I\u0026rsquo;ve only come across one job opportunity where this skill would be useful, and I never got a callback (and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought it was a pretty good job for me too.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProgramming. This would be great, until I acknowledge that while I\u0026rsquo;m a programming genius, I don\u0026rsquo;t actually have any application-level programming experience under my belt. I\u0026rsquo;m good a coding, optimizing programs, finding solutions to tough problems, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never been part of a large-scale software project, even though I could probably do it all myself, in theory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeb Development. I know HTML and various scripting languages, can use Macromedia Dreamweaver and Flash, what can\u0026rsquo;t I do? The problem comes up again: I know it all in theory, but lack the experience. It\u0026rsquo;s not like I\u0026rsquo;m churning out webpages at a dime a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edozen, and most places looking for web developers ask for some level of experience. Curses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrite. Or at least I like to think I can. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound very profitable to be writing for a living\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSigh, that\u0026rsquo;s it. Pretty sad, huh? The main problem seems to be most of what I can do is self-taught and relies on my raw talent instead of actual experience. What is it with the world? Why can\u0026rsquo;t they just recognize my genius and overlook my lack of experience? I learn impossibly fast anyway, anything I don\u0026rsquo;t know I can pick up quickly. Argh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh well, at least now I feel better, having put my thoughts into words. This journal thing is probably really healthy for me. I get to whine without burdening anyone with my problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s still some hope, at least. Sir Louie, the ECE guy Tito Ferry set me up with, said he\u0026rsquo;d ask around, although he did recommend I learn a few more skills by taking some short courses at APC, an IT school near SM North. I\u0026rsquo;m a bit hesistant about that though — short courses will undoubtedly cost money, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to bother my parents about cash any more than I have to. It\u0026rsquo;s bad enough I can\u0026rsquo;t help them make ends meet\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnything else? Lately we\u0026rsquo;ve been watching Excel Saga (ridiculosuly funny! Pedro!!!) and Scryed. AXN is showing two new anime series: Ayashi no Ceres and Gensomaden Saiyuki. And they brought back Monday night anime, so more anime all around. Oh yeah, the A/V cable for our PSX is apparently busted. Which probably explains why I got rather pissed off today. Just when I was gonna get adult Rei back into the party! Without the PSX to distract me, I had no choice but to face my real-world problems\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e=(\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, I guess I have no choice but to keep going and hope for the best. I got a nice quote today from \u003cem\u003eCastaway\u003c/em\u003e, from Tom Hanks of all people:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I know now I have to keep on breathing. Because the sun will rise tomorrow, and you never know what the tide will bring.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n",

You know how sometimes you see those videos about promoting world peace or saving the environment and they have a bunch of kids singing some corny song? This was like that, except that Seymour suddenly walks onscreen. He walking along in a tralala manner surrounded by little kids the same way you would imagine Jesus or Buddha or Gandhi or something, and the kids were singing along with him. Then when I paid attention to the song, I realized they were singing something about ridding Spira of monsters!

It\u0026rsquo;ll take them several minutes to get up here, and by\nthen it\u0026rsquo;ll be mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to the bright patch of snow the Shumi were guarding and lean down,\nlooking for that sensitive spot. There! There it is! Finally! It\u0026rsquo;s been so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweating slightly, I close my eyes and focus on the goal. I can feel it there.\nThat power. That rush. I reach out with my mind, and take it for myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes! An incredible rush comes over me, too much for me to handle. I fall over\nfrom the shock. I can feel it come over me, overwhelming me with unbelievable\nforce. It fills my body and soul, flowing through my veins, invigorating every\ncell of my body. God, yes! This is what I live for, this power, this\noverwhelming power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rush passes, all too quickly. More, I need more. As I reach down to draw\nmore of that power, the gate of the dome opens, and five Shumi warriors come\nout, determined looks on their faces. I smile and reach out my hand to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir eyes widen in fear as they realize what is about to happen. But it\u0026rsquo;s too\nlate. I feel the power flow through me again. Outwards this time, another\nincredible rush, though not as good as the first one. I feel the energy course\nthrough my veins, flowing out my outstretched arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Shumi don\u0026rsquo;t have time to think. They move to scatter, but they are slow, too\nslow. Before they can take a single step, a scintillating white light, with the\nfaintest hint of green appears around them, surrounding them, bathing them in a\npure white glow that makes the surrounding snow look like an oil slick. Their\nfaces recoil in fear, and the white glow seems to pulse for an infinite time,\nbefore finally exploding into a thousand brilliant shards of pearl and emerald.\nThe glow settles, and there is nothing left. Not even a trace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow free of distractions, I reach down and continue to extract more of that\npower. That sweet, flowing power. I look around, seeing the carnage I had\ncaused, and I realize that they were all right after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy name is Squall Leonhart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I am an Ultima junkie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-fin-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAuthor\u0026rsquo;s rants: \u0026ldquo;What?

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI originally wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to have a rant today, but while surfing the web I thought about one of the things I like about it: personal websites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s right, personal pages. Some people might argue that personal pages are like the dregs of the internet. And they\u0026rsquo;re probably right. Given that any random joe-on-the-street can get on Geocities and build his own website, (like \u003ca href=\"http://royness.vze.com\"\u003eroyness.vze.com\u003c/a\u003e for instance) we\u0026rsquo;re certainly bound to see all sorts of stuff (and accordingly, all sorts of crap) on the internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee, that\u0026rsquo;s the thing: \u0026ldquo;All sorts of stuff.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s pretty much the same way Forrest Gump describes a box of choc\u0026rsquo;lates: You never know what you\u0026rsquo;re going to get. And occasionally, you get some good stuff. And for people like me, who are obsessed with the trivial, stuff is good. The same way that people browse through bargain bins looking for good deals, I like to browse through personal pages looking for something read-worthy (or even better, download-worthy.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem with most personal pages on the ‘net however, is that they are crap. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong there are a lot of good ones out there. (Try \u003ca href=\"http://www.toastyfrog.com\" target=\"_top\"\u003eToastyfrog\u003c/a\u003e or maybe \u003ca href=\"http://www.seanbaby.com\"\u003eSeanbaby\u003c/a\u003e) But the fact is that a whole lot of websites are done by people just learning to do HTML or trying it out. Not that being a newbie is a bad thing; the bad thing is when you make a website just for the sake of having one, just so you can say you know how. Websites built in this manner typically end up the sort that\u0026rsquo;s filled with all sorts of tricks like animated GIFs, scrolling marquees or a ton of Javascript. Lots of flash but not much content really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are some tips for people who want to make their own website:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHave something to offer.\u003c/strong\u003e Many people build personal sites with the attitude of \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s my website, what do you care what I put on it, anyway!\u0026rdquo; Yeah well, if you don\u0026rsquo;t care what people think about it, why are you putting it up on the net? Leave it on your computer if that\u0026rsquo;s your attitude. Websites are put up for public consumption, so there has to be something there for people to consume. If you\u0026rsquo;re going to put up a website, make sure you have something to offer the public other than an \u0026ldquo;under construction\u0026rdquo; page. Otherwise, you\u0026rsquo;re just wasting people\u0026rsquo;s bandwidths aren\u0026rsquo;t ya? When you\u0026rsquo;re just starting out with the idea of \u0026ldquo;I want to have my own webpage\u0026rdquo;, it might be hard to think of what your webpage can offer the world. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be anything big or extra popular, you can start small. I originally put this website up just to host some fanfiction. (And then I put up more and more stuff\u0026hellip; ) You can put up your writings, reviews of things you like, links to interesting places, info about yourself, announcements about events you\u0026rsquo;re involved with, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBe original.\u003c/strong\u003e This is hard to do in today\u0026rsquo;s web. Most of the things people put up on their websites can undoubtedly be found elsewhere on the web. What can you do to set yourself apart from the crowd? Use more original content, or if you\u0026rsquo;re lacking in that department, look for different ways to present your content. An example would be when I was first learning HTML, I tried to make a Rurouni Kenshin web site. At first I was going to put in info about the characters, story etc. But after looking around a bit, I saw that there were already many websites around for this popular anime series. So instead, I put up info about the fighting styles and techniques of the RK characters, something that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find at that time. (Don\u0026rsquo;t try looking for this so-called RK site of mine, I took it down a long time ago. I still have the files and may revive it someday though.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKnow what contrast is.\u003c/strong\u003e Look at \u003ca href=\"http://www.geocities.com/i_am_obsessive/\"\u003ethis site\u003c/a\u003e and you\u0026rsquo;ll know what I mean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon\u0026rsquo;t try to do everything at once\u003c/strong\u003e There are people who make websites with the idea that their site will be \u0026ldquo;next big thing\u0026rdquo; of the internet. It won\u0026rsquo;t, trust me. Not anytime soon at least. Although there are a lot of crap sites, there are also a lot of good sites, and the best ones have developed from small sites with a limited following to being read by millions. You, with your meager resources and staff of (probably) one can\u0026rsquo;t hope to achieve that overnight. Start small, focus on what your site can provide to your viewers right now instead of trying to be a really big thing. See that site I linked to above? The front page says \u0026ldquo;Your number one sorce for your anime needs.\u0026rdquo; Not only is that misspelled, but it\u0026rsquo;s so far from the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKnow how to spell and know how to write proper English (or whatever language is your choice).\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0026rsquo;ll cite the above link as an example again. How do you expect your readers to take your website seriously if you can\u0026rsquo;t even spell \u0026ldquo;sorce\u0026rdquo; properly? Go back to school first, then make a website. Additionally, you may want to leave the l33t sp33k for mIRC, unless that\u0026rsquo;s what your audience expects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWrite for your audience\u003c/strong\u003e That way, they can come back later. Don\u0026rsquo;t do things like writing in l33t when your viewers will probably hate it. For a personal site, your initial audience is probably going to be mostly you, and maybe some friends and family. When you want to start attracting more people to your site, you may also consider writing for people who think like you. This are the best kind of viewers, as they will like what they see and will usually come back for more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKnow how to take criticism\u003c/strong\u003e Actually, this is advice for being on the internet in general. Remember that the internet is a public medium, and anything you offer on the internet can be criticized by anyone. A lot of stupidity on the internet comes from people not knowing how to take criticism. Study the criticism and correct your mistakes. Accordingly, I want to apologize in advance to the owner of the site I\u0026rsquo;ve been using as a bad example — I have nothing against you, yours was just the website I had open at the time of this writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHave links.\u003c/strong\u003e Links are always good because if the rest of the website is bad, at least there\u0026rsquo;s a chance of finding something better to read. If your website could have only one thing, have links.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDang, this turned out longer than I thought it would. I have a lot more to say on this topic, I\u0026rsquo;ll say them next week. Later!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I stopped playing the game a month or so ago out of sheer irritation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the uninitiated, H:RBE is a tactical RPG for the PSX, released during the last year the PSX. The game is similar in some respects to games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre, with an emphasis on turn-based squad-level combats. Unlike FFT and TO\u0026rsquo;s similar Active Time system, H:RBE uses a system called RAP, where each character can perform as many actions as he wants provided he still has the RAP gauge to pay for it. The more RAP you use, the sooner your next turn comes, and vice versa. I bought this game hoping it would be at least comparable to either FFT or TO. Was I disappointed? Read on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Good:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRAP. RAP is good. The fact that you get to decide how to allocate your time, and the fact that you can control when your characters get to act. This is good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShoot. Shoot is good, a nice ability that adds a different tactical angle to the game, emphasizing the importance of position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSession. Since Shoot is good, it follows that Session must be good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDifficulty. Yes, difficulty is good, to a certain extent. Hoshigami brings a new level of difficulty to the table that we didn\u0026rsquo;t get to have in the ridiculously easy FFT. Veteran gamers were looking for a level of difficulty closer to that of the old favorite, Tactics Ogre. The game\u0026rsquo;s difficulty is actually still good (albeit good on the masochistic side) but the actual difficulty is overshadowed by the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s _tedious_. Read on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bad:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLack of variation. You basically have only five things to do: attack, shoot, move, cast spells or use items. And spells do only one of three things: deal/heal damage, or create/heal status or break equipment. Where\u0026rsquo;s the Haste spell? Protection spells?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong battles. The lack of variation wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be so bad if you didn\u0026rsquo;t have to endure it for hours at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo saving between successive battles. That was a bad, bad, design boo-boo. You\u0026rsquo;ve been fighting for hours on end, and you\u0026rsquo;re almost finished, when a lucky archer drops the bomb on Elena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBad AI. You know what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about. Archers who don\u0026rsquo;t understand the trajectory of their weapons. Enemies who kill each other. Soldiers who attack even if the hit chance is 0%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnforgiving design. Permanent death. Underlevelled party has no chance against higher level party. Masses of enemies thrown at you. It\u0026rsquo;s like the designers decided that instead of simply working on tactically challenging battles, they would throw lots of enemies at you, at higher levels than you would expect and hope that you have the tactical ability to overcome this. It was a good idea except for the fact that LOW-LEVEL CHARACTERS STAND NO CHANCE AGAINST HIGH-LEVEL CHARACTERS. Even if you\u0026rsquo;re only two levels behind, your damage and hit rate become so pitiful that you simply won\u0026rsquo;t survive one-on-one, what more two-on-one. The game would\u0026rsquo;ve been 300 times better if either a) story battles had the same level as you; or b) The number of units on each side are comparable. As it is, the only real reliable way to win in battles is through either Coinfeigms or leveling-up. Which wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be so bad except that\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevelling-up is tedious. Since you will almost never meet enemies in the Towers who are at the same level as yours, you\u0026rsquo;re stuck fighting lower level goons while occasionally hitting yourselves for EXP. And not only that\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevelling up Coinfeigms is tedious. Yes it is. The interface is so bad; every time you engrave your coin, you must go back to the top of the list of seals and look for the seal again. Given that you often want to engrave your coins multiple times with the same seals, the game becomes unnecessarily tedious. Adding to this is the \u0026ldquo;random\u0026rdquo; factor involved in engraving. I\u0026rsquo;m sure during development it seemed like a neat concept and all, but in practice all it means is that you have to occasionally save in-between engravings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeity/DEV system. Good idea, poor execution. Some of the abilities are simply worthless, and some are strictly better. You will seldom need to change your abilities around. Status-enhancing abilities are generally useless at 10%, slightly better at 25%. Champion sounded cool, except in practice you never want to have anyone with low HP. Furthermore, the system is unbalanced. Sonova people simply suck, despite their HP Bonuses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo randomness. All battles are fixed. No hoping to meet an Uribo here, folks, each battle gives you the exact same opponents every time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ugly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethat sad, sad battle theme. I end up unplugging the audio cord on the TV whenever I play Hoshigami.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, what went wrong in this game? The thing is that the designers thought people wanted a difficult game, so they made a difficult game. The problem is that they achieve that difficulty through repetitiveness, redundancy and tediousness. On the GameFAQs message boards I read an analogy comparing Hoshigami to Chess. The difference between Hoshigami and Chess is that in Chess, both sides start with the same pieces, and you win or lose based on your own tactical decisions. In Hoshigami, not only does your opponent get more pieces than you, they\u0026rsquo;re all bishops and knights while you\u0026rsquo;re stuck with a platoon of pawns. And you have to play that game of chess some 50 times, without losing, ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

There must have been several hundred people crammed into less than two hundred square meters of mall area, interspersed with some twenty cubicles filled with various displays and banners. What madness is this you ask? What product could be so enticing that hundreds of otherwise sane people to participate in such a gathering, jostling for space and risking being elbowed, stepped on or maybe even pick pocketed? The answer was employment. That most important symptom of security that people crave especially in tough times such as these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, my friends, it is a job fair. Hopeful job-seekers from all over the capital converge upon this establishment in the commercial district and hope to find gainful opportunities in these otherwise difficult times. I am one of such hopefuls. Weaving amongst the crowd and perusing various company paraphernalia, I search for the perfect job for one of my skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s one, an engineering job, sounds promising. Oh, it\u0026rsquo;s in Bulacan, a good three hours away from home. No thanks. Hmm, there\u0026rsquo;s an opening in this Japanese company. Wait, I already applied for that a couple of months ago. How about a teaching job at some technical college? No thanks, there are better schools out there for me to teach at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle at my own audacity. For someone who had been unemployed for a good six months now I was being extremely picky. How many job applications had I botched over the past six months? At least three that sounded promising. And for no apparent reason aside from the vague \u0026ldquo;I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t like it there\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not the right job for me.\u0026rdquo; Sometimes I wonder what it is I really want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe that\u0026rsquo;s the problem. For someone who spent the last few years of his engineering studies whining about how he should have shifted to another course, I had no real idea about what it was I wanted to do. Well, no practical idea at least. I know I eventually want to work in interactive entertainment software (read: computer games), but that\u0026rsquo;s not really a plausible option right now. Aside from that, nothing. I have no idea where to go or how to get there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know I need a job. Heaven knows I\u0026rsquo;ve sponged off my folks long enough. But what job? I look at the hordes of people applying for boring, everyday office jobs and I shake my head. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to end up some office drone who can\u0026rsquo;t break out of his routine. I don\u0026rsquo;t want a job that is tedious and boring. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be some staff engineer doing the same things day in and day out. I want to learn, I want to be challenged, I want to expand my horizons. I want a job that\u0026rsquo;s exciting, constantly unpredictable, a job where being unable to adapt can only cause disaster. I don\u0026rsquo;t want a job that asks me to be tied down for two to three years. I hardly have enough attention span for a semester of classes, how could I stand being in the same job for several years? I don\u0026rsquo;t want a job that\u0026rsquo;s mundane, mediocre or ordinary. I want something different, something exciting, something that amazes people when they ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I\u0026rsquo;m being unrealistic or a bit too idealistic, as is common for me at times. But I remember one time when I asked one of the guys I went to college with what he was planning to do after his studies. He said something about joining a big company and rising up the corporate ladder. What kind of dream is that, to be someone else\u0026rsquo;s employee? And this was someone who would later on graduate with honors! I would rather be self-employed, risking my own money on a venture that may or may not succeed. If you fail, then you try again. At least you rise and fall through your own decisions, your fate belongs to you, and not to some anonymous board of directors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlas, that\u0026rsquo;s not possible for me right now, not when I don\u0026rsquo;t have a shred of cash. And until I do, I am left with little choice but to undergo some mind-numbing mundanity of a job. Gainful employment is a necessary evil for now, so onward I march, ever searching for an ideal job that will tide me through until such time that I find the means to take my destiny into my own hands. My time will come, someday.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

What product could be so enticing that hundreds of otherwise sane people to participate in such a gathering, jostling for space and risking being elbowed, stepped on or maybe even pick pocketed?",

Six months (okay three) of hard work and preparation (well alright, occasionally glancing at my books) and what do we get? A bunch of questions chosen seemingly at random. The Math and Electronics parts were good enough actually, and I felt pretty confident there. The second day was bad. The Communications exam might as well have been a random set of questions about cookie dough and displacer beasts. Me, Marc and Dennis went through at least a hundred questions in various topics an hour and a half before the exam but not one of the stuff we reviewed came out. Instead we\u0026rsquo;re bombarded with questions about obscure standards and various laws. *Sigh*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe I\u0026rsquo;m just sour-graping because I didn\u0026rsquo;t make the \u003ca href=\"#\"\u003etop ten [link broken]\u003c/a\u003e. Then again I was expecting at least Dennis to make it in, but no such luck. Are there any other UP studes in the top ten? I don\u0026rsquo;t know, and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I care anymore. Oh well, that\u0026rsquo;s the breaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finished \u003ca href=\"http://alexandria.rpgclassics.com/game.php?game=166\"\u003eTales of Phantasia\u003c/a\u003e yesterday, finally. I must\u0026rsquo;ve been playing it for about half a year before I managed to finish it. Emulators are really bad for your attention span — I\u0026rsquo;ve got a Seiken Densetsu game near the end but I haven\u0026rsquo;t touched it for maybe a year now. Anyway, I went and kicked Dhaos butt, even though I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to complete the better subquests, complete Arche\u0026rsquo;s spells or even get Gremlin and Shadow. Maybe another time. Or if Namco decides to be nice and release it for the PSX. Oh yeah, I put up the ending save state \u003ca href=\"#\"\u003ehere [link broken]\u003c/a\u003e. Hopefully one of these days I can finish the Ranma RPG, SD3 and DQ5, not necessarily in that order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing Hoshigami lately. When I first bought it and tried it out I thought it was a horrible game. It\u0026rsquo;s quite hard, and you will easily die if you don\u0026rsquo;t know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. Now I realize the reason I was having such a hard time was because I was trying to play it like FF Tactics or Tactics Ogre. Instead, the RAP gauge encourages an entirely different way of thinking. You have to learn how to conserve your RAP, to know how to use the turn sequence properly, when to shoot and when not to shoot, and when to attempt a session. Granted, knowing all this stuff doesn\u0026rsquo;t make the game that much easier — but I find myself enjoying it once I familiarized myself with the different tactics. Sadly, very few people will be able to appreciate this game. I\u0026rsquo;m in Chapter 2 and I\u0026rsquo;ve already burned 20 hours of game time and probably a lot more in real-time — I tend to lose battles often. =P\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following web sites are graciously hosting some of my fiction, so be nice and visit them: \u003ca href=\"http://www.icybrian.com\"\u003eIcy Brian\u0026rsquo;s RPG Page\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"#\"\u003eLaura\u0026rsquo;s Sailor Moon Shrine [link broken]\u003c/a\u003e (although why a SM shrine would have FF fanfiction is beyond me. =)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast week we saw The Count of Monte Cristo. Two more weeks before Spiderman, and a full month before the next Star Wars movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, and have you ever wondered where you could get \u003ca href=\"#\"\u003eRPG Books online [link broken]\u003c/a\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

So I will publish it with an arbitrarily chosen date of March 1, 2002.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfficially, this rant should be available upon the re-opening of the NFT Zu webpage, version 4.something. As much as I\u0026rsquo;d like to babble on about anime or fanfiction, several of my associates here at the Zu know a lot more about those than I do. So I\u0026rsquo;ll stick to something where I can claim some sort of specialized knowledge: video games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLately, I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing Legend of Mana. It\u0026rsquo;s a little-known Square game for the PSX, the fourth installment in the Seiken Densetsu series of games. It\u0026rsquo;s a quirky little game, but what will strike you most about the game is the amazing graphics. No, I\u0026rsquo;m not talking about FFVIII-style FMVs or such. I\u0026rsquo;m talking about the detailed hand-drawn animations. The characters are portrayed by detailed sprites, the backgrounds are colorful,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehand-drawn landscapes, nothing like the mundane realism of FMV-based games. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, I\u0026rsquo;m not knocking FMV. I certainly appreciate a great CG movie in a game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut these days practically every game and its mother has FMV, and frankly, I tend to grow tired of it. What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with good ol\u0026rsquo; 2d animation? We see a lot of games pushing the envelope as far as 3d CG FMVs are concerned, but where are the games pushing the envelope of 2d animation? As Legend of Mana and games like Parappa the Rapper show, there are certainly games and stories which are much better told in 2d animation than the mundane 3d videos of today. And for all their technical sophistication, 3d engines are still far more limited than what hand-drawn animation could show us, visions far closer to the artist\u0026rsquo;s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eimagination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo where are all the 2d RPGs? Sadly, outside of Square and Capcom, no one seems to be capable of thinking for themselves and differentiating themselves from the pack. In this case the console RPG scene suffers from a common problem: lack of innovation. Aside from a couple of industry leaders, few companies can afford to \u0026ldquo;try something different\u0026rdquo; when they have sales to make. It\u0026rsquo;s far easier to do what everybody else is doing than to try out something which may or may not sell. The 2d RPG seems to be going the way of the handheld, as practically all 2d RPGS these days are being announced for GBA only, with the PS2, XBOX and GC all geared towards powerful 3d apps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranted, all of this might be chalked up to the fact that I\u0026rsquo;m an old-school gamer of sorts, and you could argue that \u0026ldquo;3d is the wave of the future!\u0026rdquo; But if you look at Legend of Mana, and its younger SNES brother Secret of Mana, you can\u0026rsquo;t help but see how 2d animation has improved by leaps and bounds over the years, albeit unnoticed compared to the attention 3d animation has been getting. Five years ago, all these 3d games were getting noticed because they were bringing us something new, a greater sense of realism than what 2d animation could bring. Back then 3d WAS the wave of the future. Today, it IS the future, and 3d games are the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enorm, and 2d animation offers us something different, something fresh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat am I saying? I want to see more 2d games, RPGs specifically. I want to see more Saga games, more Mana games, more Breath of Fire. I want to see new sprite-based RPGs. I want to see more fantasy worlds that look fantastic, more anime cut-scenes. Is it all too much to ask?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-Thinking about getting a GBA before a PS2\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Haven\u0026rsquo;t read the books myself, but the game is well done, and is still enjoyable despite its age (I think it was released in \u0026lsquo;92 or such).

There\u0026rsquo;s around a month and a half left before the exam, but so far I\u0026rsquo;ve only reviewed most of the electronics topics. (The reviews are in 3 parts: electronics, communications and mathematics.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother thing I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing was working on my own RPG. The Palefire thing was great, but it seems no one in the group has time to do it anymore. While I still want to do Palefire, it\u0026rsquo;ll have to go to the back burner while everyone gets their acts together. Since I don\u0026rsquo;t have a new comp yet, no RPG programming of any sorts going to take place soon. Right now it\u0026rsquo;s mostly design, world-building, and setting the rules into place. I don\u0026rsquo;t even have a very solid plot yet, but I want to thresh out the world before focusing on the plot. Good luck to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings I\u0026rsquo;m not doing: Learning more Japanese (which I promised myself I would do); Studying more programming (same); Writing fiction. I\u0026rsquo;d update the \u003ca href=\"http://www.fanfiction.net/s/566295/1/\"\u003eMecis story\u003c/a\u003e but I found the first part of it severely lacking. When I have time, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably rewrite it altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

She looked up to her companions. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s amazing.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKai simply nodded at her. He had seen all this before, and every time a new SeeD\ncame to watch the launch process the reaction was always the same. He looked at\nthe other SeeD beside him, Mecis\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;special friend\u0026rdquo;, as she put it. Laguna\nHilmark looked on at the launch process in a bored sort of way, as if it was\nnothing out of the ordinary, even though this was his first time at Lunar Gate\nas well. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s up, Laguna?\u0026rdquo; Kai said, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s something, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Yeah, well,\u0026rdquo; the 21-year old SeeD drawled, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it before in the training\nsimulations.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKai smiled. \u0026ldquo;Training isn\u0026rsquo;t much compared to the real thing, kid.\u0026rdquo; Laguna and\nMecis had been SeeDs for little more than three years now, but they had spent\nmost of their time in administrative functions rather than actual combat duty.\nThis was only Mecis\u0026rsquo; second assignment outside of Garden, but Laguna had far\nmore actual combat experience, and he tended to act like nothing surprised him\nanymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Next please.\u0026rdquo; The technician handling the launch pods gestured towards them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Mecis, you\u0026rsquo;re up.\u0026rdquo; Kai gave her a friendly pat on the back. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;ll be fine.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Er, yeah\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Mecis said not a bit nervously, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s safe right?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaguna put an arm around her to reassure her. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry.

He had known these\ntwo since they were cadets at Trabia, being one of their instructors, and he\nknew that Mecis always had a tendency for travel sickness. \u0026lsquo;She should be fine\nif Laguna\u0026rsquo;s with her\u0026rsquo;, he figured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaguna helped Mecis into the launch capsule. \u0026ldquo;It would help if we could all go\nat once you know,\u0026rdquo; he muttered a bit loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Yes, it would, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u0026rdquo; Kai replied before the technicians could respond.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s just your luck that the other launch units are being serviced today. Don\u0026rsquo;t\nworry, you\u0026rsquo;ll be launched right after her.\u0026rdquo; Laguna, Mecis and another SeeD were\nbeing assigned to guard duty at the orbiting Lunar Base, and Kai was there to\nsee them off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaguna ignored him and turned to Mecis. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll be fine, okay, I\u0026rsquo;ll be there\nright after you.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMecis smiled back at him, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about me.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaguna smiled as well. Stepping down, he closed the hatch and moved away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Launch error correction, plus 2. Orbital correction, minus 1. Corrections\ncomplete.

Acting as a magic-enhanced catapult, the device propelled\nMecis\u0026rsquo; Launch capsule upwards at a precalclated angle, going at more than twice\nthe escape velocity. The launch generated a powerful wake, and it was several\nseconds before Laguna noticed Kai had said something to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Laguna said to the senior SeeD even as his hearing recovered from the\nmomentary shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I said,\u0026rdquo; Kai repeated, \u0026ldquo;This is gonna be the last mission for the two of you,\nisn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaguna said nothing and looked up at Mecis\u0026rsquo; capsule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything flashed by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt a bump. Then another. And another. She started to regain her senses,\nand Mecis felt slightly queasy. \u0026ldquo;Why did I agree to this?\u0026rdquo; she thought ruefully\nto herself. The hibernation process initiated at the Lunar Gate prevented her\nfrom moving around, but she was still flly conscious. Finally gathering enough\nstrength to look around, she glanced out the transparent glass hull of her Lunar\nCapsule. Everything was still moving too fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother bump rocked the capsule, and she realized that the bumps were being\ncaused by large energy nets that served to slow the capsule\u0026rsquo;s momentum as it\nhurtled towards the Lunar Base. Another bump, then another. After one more bump,\nshe realzed the capsule\u0026rsquo;s speed was relatively slower now, and that it was in\nfact about to come to a halt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking outside, she saw the Lunar Base, a massive space station set into orbit\nby the Esthar government more than a hundred years ago. \u0026ldquo;Amazing,\u0026rdquo; she said to\nherself, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s larger than I thought.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour figures dressed in white appeared around her capsule. \u0026ldquo;Astronauts,\u0026rdquo; Mecis\nrealized, as the four figures started to bring her capsule towards the space\nstation. They loaded her capsule into a large machine, some sort of relay device\napparently. The device carted her capsule into the Lunar Base\u0026rsquo;s Dock Area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt a few more bumps, and the next thing she knew, she was inside a large\nhangar-like structure. She heard a faint voice over the transceiver on the\ncapsule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Initiating quick thaw.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith relief, Mecis felt the temperature around her start to increase. Slowly,\nthe numbess vanished from her body, and she was able to move. The capsule hatch\nopened, and she started to step out. As she looked around, she was surprised to\nsee her capsule was suspended off a wall roughly ten meters off the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry,\u0026rdquo; she heard a voice, \u0026ldquo;Gravity\u0026rsquo;s off.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMecis recognized the voice as belonging to Rez, the other SeeD she had met at\nthe mission briefing. Turnin towards him, she saw him floating around,\nsurrounded by several more astronauts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;You okay?\u0026rdquo; Rez asked her. He was a tall, blond-haired guy, probably no more\nthan 20 years old. Mecis didn\u0026rsquo;t know much about him, except that he was from\nGalbadia and that they would be working together at the Lunar Base for the next\nthree months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMecis nodded. \u0026ldquo;Just a bit woozy.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t go seasick now.\u0026rdquo; Rez said cautiously. Mecis smarted at the comment. Kai\nknew she was conscious about her travel sickness, but went ahead and mentioned\nit on the way to Lunar Gate anyway. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so gonna smack him when we get back,\u0026rdquo;\nshe thought to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped out of the capsule, and felt herself floating in mid-air. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s like\na Float spell,\u0026rdquo; she thought to herself. She recovered her duffel bag from the\ncapsule and floated towards Rez and the astronauts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s with the luggage?\u0026rdquo; Mecis asked Rez. Rez was carrying not only the\nstandard SeeD duffel bag, but also an additional backpack he wore over his\nshoulder. It was unusual for SeeDs to carry more than the duffel bag during\nmissions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRez shrugged. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a heavy packer.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMecis was about to reply when one of the astronauts spoke. \u0026ldquo;Third capsule\nincoming.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Looks like your boyfriend\u0026rsquo;s coming in.\u0026rdquo; Rez commented. Mecis didn\u0026rsquo;t answer and\njust looked out the transparent glass walls of the hangar. She saw another Lunar\nCapsule come in from the distance, and row upon row of vibrant energy nets\nappeared in front of it. As the Capsule hit each net, it lost a bit of speed,\nuntil if finally slowed to a crawl. The four astronauts loaded the capsule into\nthe waiting relay machine, and she saw how the machine manuevered the capsule\ninto a nearby tube. The capsule shot out and reappeared near where her own\ncapsule was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Initiating quick thaw.\u0026rdquo; Mecis realized the voice was coming over a loudspeaker.\nShe saw Laguna\u0026rsquo;s capsule glow momentarily before the hatch opened. Laguna\nstepped out, dragging his bag behind him. Unlike Mecis, he quickly adapted to\nthe zero-gravity condition and immediately went over to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;You okay?\u0026rdquo; Laguna said to her. Mecis detected a bit of fatigue in his voice and\nreplied. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m fine. You look like that trip shook you a bit.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;No, I just need a bit of sleep that\u0026rsquo;s all.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMecis smiled at his reply. Laguna would never admit to being shaken by anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey heard Rez call out to them. \u0026ldquo;If you lovebirds are ready, we gotta go see\nthe director.\u0026rdquo; He was already being escorted by a couple of astronauts towards a\nnearby doorway. A couple more astronauts moved towards the pair, motioning them\nto follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s go,\u0026rdquo; Laguna said to Mecis. The astronauts guided them to the doorway and\ninto another room. The door shut behind them, and the astronauts slowly moved\nthem towards the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Locking gravity.\u0026rdquo; The same voice spoke over the loudspeaker. Mecis felt a\nfeeling of weightedness start to appear around her, similar to how a Float spell\nwore off. She and the others gently landed on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Gravity lock complete. Welcome to Esthar Lunar Base.\u0026rdquo; The door on the other\nside of the hallway opened and the astronauts motioned them towards it. The\nvoice spoke again, \u0026ldquo;Please follow the right-hand corridor to report to the\nDirector. Thank you.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three SeeDs stepped out into the corridor. It opened into three paths, one\nheading left, one heading right, and a stairway goind up. \u0026ldquo;Well, time waits for\nno one,\u0026rdquo; Rez said as he went down the right-hand hallway. Laguna and Mecis\nfollowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Check it out!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMecis was looking out the large glass window in the hallway. The window provided\na clear view of the surrounding space. At a slight distance from the space\nstation, there was a huge circular structure that seemed to be filled with some\nsort of translucent crystal. A humanoid figrue dressed in blue could be seen\ninside the structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Man, you get amazed easily, don\u0026rsquo;t you?\u0026rdquo; Rez needled her, \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s Rinoa\u0026rsquo;s Tomb.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I know what it is!\u0026rdquo; Mecis shot back, slightly annoyed. Rinoa\u0026rsquo;s Tomb was the\nreason the Esthar Lunar Base was built. Rinoa Heartily, the last sorceress in\nhistorical record, was being kept in suspended animation within the crystal\nprison. Shortly after participating alongside SeeD in the last Sorceress War,\nshe was struck with a fatal disease that was impossible to recover from. Fearing\nthat her death would cause her powers to be passed on to a new, more powerful\nsorceress, she had willfully succumbed to the suspension process. And she had\nremained in this same place for the last hundred years, a grim reminder of the\ndanger posed to the world by the sorceress powers. And a grim reminder of why\nSeeD\u0026rsquo;s vigilance was needed at all times. She had seen pictures of it before of\ncourse, but the view from this close was completely different. One could see\ncompletely into the crystal prison, and Mecis could almost see the expression on\nher face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;She seems so\u0026hellip;sad.\u0026rdquo;, Mecis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Sad? What are you talking about? She\u0026rsquo;s a sorceress!\u0026rdquo; Rez retorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about!\u0026rdquo; Mecis replied. \u0026ldquo;Rumor has it that her lover\nwas a SeeD!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Oh, please, that\u0026rsquo;s just an urban legend.\u0026rdquo; Rez said. \u0026ldquo;Why would a SeeD become\ninvolved with a sorceress?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaguna, having had enough of their witty reparte, nudged Mecis. \u0026ldquo;Come on, the\ndirector\u0026rsquo;s waiting.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Just three of you this time? Garden\u0026rsquo;s getting overconfident aren\u0026rsquo;t they?\u0026rdquo; Dr.\nKasim was the head of the Lunar Base staff and director of the Sorceress\nResearch project. \u0026ldquo;Or are they too busy fighting other people\u0026rsquo;s wars?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMecis seethed at the insult. Ever since the last Sorceress had been defeated,\nSeeD had made a name for itself as a powerful mercenary force. The current head\nof Garden, Cid IV had justified it by saying Garden needed the money to maintain\nit\u0026rsquo;s vigilance against the Sorceresses. This, along with SeeD\u0026rsquo;s tendency to\nunfairly prosecute suspected potential Sorceresses had considerably dimmed\nSeeD\u0026rsquo;s reputation worldwide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;That was an unnecessary comme-\u0026rdquo; Mecis was cut off as Laguna nudged her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaguna saluted the director and spoke. \u0026ldquo;Sir, with all due respect, three SeeDs\nare more than enough to handle any threat that may appear, and Garden\u0026rsquo;s\npeacekeeping operations are all geared towards protecting the peace of the\nworld.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Yeah, whatever.\u0026rdquo; The director looked over the assignment sheet Laguna had\nhanded him. \u0026ldquo;Laguna Hilmark.

The director picked up a metallic card from his desk and tossed it to\nLaguna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s the pass for your quarters, take the elevator further down the hall to\nsub-level III.

Laguna shot him\na hard look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Heh, you said the wrong thing.\u0026rdquo; Mecis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Garden Code Article 45 Paragraph 12.\u0026rdquo; Laguna recited in a monotone. \u0026ldquo;SeeD\nmembers are forbidden from having relations while on duty.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Sheesh, you\u0026rsquo;re really anal about the rules, aren\u0026rsquo;t you?\u0026rdquo; Rez said, \u0026ldquo;Lighten\nup.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Whatever.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I call this room!\u0026rdquo; Mecis said, entering the bigger bedroom.

Rez followed, tossed his bags unto the\ntop bed and walked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Where are you going?\u0026rdquo; Laguna asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m gonna go take a look around.\u0026rdquo; Rez said casually as he walked out of the\nquarters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t get into any trouble,\u0026rdquo; Laguna called after him as he went on unpacking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMecis stepped into their room after Rez walked out. \u0026ldquo;Isn\u0026rsquo;t he tired? He\u0026rsquo;s okay\nthough, isn\u0026rsquo;t he?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaguna looked up at her. \u0026ldquo;Yeah, I guess. He\u0026rsquo;s a bit weird though.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve worked with him before, during the Timber mission. \u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Against the Forest Owls?\u0026rdquo; Mecis had heard the story from Laguna before. The\nForest Owls were a revolutionary group led by pro-Sorceress fanatics. Laguna had\nbeen assigned there a year ago to defend Timber after a potential Sorceress was\nrumored to have been found in that area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Yeah,\u0026rdquo; Laguna nodded, \u0026ldquo;He was kind of a loner and was really quiet, like he\ndidn\u0026rsquo;t like what was going on.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMecis shrugged. \u0026ldquo;He seems fine to me.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Well, you should get used to him, we\u0026rsquo;ll all be working together for the next\nthree months.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Laguna\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaguna hesitated before asking. \u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;After this mission, are we\u0026ndash;?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaguna sighed. Mecis had wanted to retire from SeeD after this mission. While\nshe was a tough girl, she was physically weak compared to other SeeDs, which was\nwhy she had preferred to take administrative functions during her tour of duty.\nShe was tired of her and Laguna constantly being in danger because they were\nSeeDs, and had wanted to start a peaceful life in her hometown of Winhill.\n\u0026ldquo;Didn\u0026rsquo;t the Headmaster at Trabia invite you to be an instructor?\u0026rdquo; Laguna said to\nher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Yeah, but\u0026hellip;I dunno. I\u0026rsquo;d still be a SeeD.\u0026rdquo; Even as an instructor, SeeDs could\nbe called to combat duty at any time if needed. Mecis sighed, \u0026ldquo;Do you still want\nto\u0026ndash;?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s just that if we quit,\u0026rdquo; Laguna replied, \u0026ldquo;then what would I do?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMecis smiled. \u0026ldquo;You could be something ordinary. Like a barber!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaguna shook his head. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re being silly. Tell you what. Let\u0026rsquo;s wait \u0026lsquo;til this\nmission is over. After this one, we\u0026rsquo;ll go on vacation, and we\u0026rsquo;ll decide then,\nokay?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMecis smiled at him again. A vacation was better than nothing. \u0026ldquo;Okay.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKai was walking down a hallway in the Tears Point research facility, several\nkilometers from the Lunar Gate. He stopped at a door marked \u0026ldquo;Lunar Observation\nControl\u0026rdquo; and made his way in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was a large array of computers and monitors. Several heads craned to\nlook at him when he entered, and all but one went back to their work after they\ndid not recognize him. Sienna Balmont, commander of SeeD\u0026rsquo;s Dincht division\nresponsible for Esthar, nodded to him. \u0026ldquo;Did the launch go well?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKai nodded back. \u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re fine. They should be resting up at the Lunar Base by\nnow.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Well, they\u0026rsquo;re going to need that rest,\u0026rdquo; Sienna muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Readings here indicate unusual activity on the surface of the moon over the\npast few weeks.

Apparently, the time has come for another Lunar Cry.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTBC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAuthor\u0026rsquo;s Rants:\nWell, this is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing a multi-part \u0026lsquo;fic, so wish me luck!\nAnyway, I know nothing much happened in this part, but I just wanted to lay the\ngroundwork for some future events. I wanted to include the first major plot\nevent in this one, but after writing the above, I felt it would be a bit too\nlong, so I\u0026rsquo;ll just cut it here. Between the cheesy title and the happenings\nhere, can you guess what this \u0026lsquo;fic will be about? Stay tuned.\nOn a side note, if FF8 is my least favorite FF game, why am I writing about it?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s because the story was so weak I have to supplement it myself, lol.

Whee! Got some positive ones. I\u0026rsquo;ll try to write more soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI downloaded a free Win32 C++ compiler+GUI. It\u0026rsquo;s Dev-C++, available at \u003ca href=\"http://www.bloodshed.com\"\u003eBloodshed Software\u003c/a\u003e. Also, I downloaded some of the old Win32 programming lessons from ReliSoft. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably redo all the work since my previous trials had been lost in an HD formatting a while back. The sad thing is that the DirectX SDKs are unbelievably huge, 100+ Megs, even the older DX5.0, so I probably won\u0026rsquo;t be doing any DX programming \u0026lsquo;til I get a new computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearning Japanese? Well\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m working on it I guess. I checked out some lessons at \u003ca href=\"http://www.japanese-online.com\"\u003eJapanese-Online.com\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;ve gone through them before, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t really follow through so I forgot. =)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnything else?

I tried it out a bit, but now I\u0026rsquo;m stuck. =( It\u0026rsquo;s really weird. Hulk Hogan appears in it! Except that he\u0026rsquo;s named MaxBomber or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore new links:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.htmlgoodies.com\"\u003eHTML Goodies\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehas a lot of info for would-be webmasters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.happyhacker.org\"\u003eHappy Hacker\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eteaches you some neat hacking tricks, all of \u0026lsquo;em legal!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
