Which is often quite handy, especially when facing a\nlarge group of plant-like creatures that can tear me apart with their limbs or\npetrify me with a single drop of their saliva.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA simple flick of my wrist and a small burst of concentration is all it takes,\nand three of the plant-creatures explode into ice shards. Six more appear to\nreplace the fallen ones. I had hoped I would never have to use these powers\nagain. Fate seemed to have a different opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFreya walked silently along the street of Treno. She wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to come\nback here for a while, with all the events over in Burmecia. So she wanted to\ntake one last stroll before she took the ride to Lindblum. The moon cast a pale\nglow over Treno at this time of day. Strange that for a city that never\nsleeps, it looks its brightest when the moon is full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFreya stopped at the stairway leading to the street near Dr. Tot\u0026rsquo;s house. A lone\nfigure was sitting at the landing on top of walkway. Recognizing the hat, Freya\nwalked up and sat down beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Hey, what\u0026rsquo;s wrong?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure gave a start, apparently noticing Freya for the first time.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh\u0026hellip; I\u0026hellip; well\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s nothing, I guess\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Did you visit Dr. Tot?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Y-yeah.

A faint\nscreeching sound echoed in the distance and Freya recognized it as the familiar\nhum of the railway cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Guess that\u0026rsquo;s my ride,\u0026rdquo; she said to no one in particular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Vivi, behind you!\u0026rdquo; The voice belonged to Blank, one of the Tantalus Crew. He\u0026rsquo;s\na nice guy, always looking out for other people. It\u0026rsquo;s a good thing he\u0026rsquo;s looking\nout for me right now, as I spin around to see a giant green tentacle about to\nslam down on me. As he jumped up to take on the offending vegetable, I threw a\nquick bolt of lightning at his sword, and his enchanted blade took the target\ndown in one blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate fighting, but I\u0026rsquo;m glad I decided to come along with the Tantalus. Back\nhere, to where it all began. For me and my brothers at least, although we can\u0026rsquo;t\nsay we were born here, this is where our souls came from. The excuses we have\nfor souls at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Come on, we\u0026rsquo;re almost there!\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s Marcus, another one of the Tantalus Crew.\nI pointed a finger, and a large ball of flame exploded against the plant walls\nbefore us, opening the way deeper into the maze of plant-life that was the Iifa\nTree. Or what remained of it anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBargaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at the avian doctor. He knew it would come eventually, but to hear\nsomeone say it was an entirely different matter all together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Doctor Tot\u0026hellip;are you sure\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; His high-pitched voice trailed off. \u0026ldquo;There must\nbe something you can do.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoctor Tot sighed. He always hated to be the bearer of bad news. He adjusted his\nspectacles and looked at the young man with sadness in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry\u0026hellip;I\u0026rsquo;ll conduct some more tests with the samples I took but\u0026hellip; I can\u0026rsquo;t\npromise anything.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;What about the other tests?

He hated being\nthe bearer of bad news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother wall breaks down, and we rush forward, stopping suddenly at the edge of\nwhat seemed to be a deep semicircular crevice with walls made of green foliage.\nAs if on cue, twigs, branches and leaves gave way inside the crevice, revealing\nnumerous spider-like plant-creatures, the same ones we\u0026rsquo;d encountered before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tantalus Crew almost cringed at the sight of these hordes, but their\nattention was drawn by Marcus\u0026rsquo; outstretched hand. \u0026ldquo;Over there!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNear the center of the crevice, two human like figures lay on the ground,\nunmoving, and right at the base of the Iifa Tree. Without hesitation, we make\nour way across the valley of beasts. I provide covering fire as Blank and Cinna\nmake their way toward the two figures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Just as I thought,\u0026rdquo; Blank says, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s the same thing as the petrified forest.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinna inspects the first body. \u0026ldquo;This one\u0026rsquo;s dead. Looks like he\u0026rsquo;s been this way\nfor weeks.\u0026rdquo; Marcus and I turn to look at the body, and heave a sigh of relief\nwhen it\u0026rsquo;s not the one we\u0026rsquo;re looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Must\u0026rsquo;ve been Kuja. Poor sap,\u0026rdquo; Blank said. But our attention was already held by\nthe other figure, a somewhat short humanoid form, encased in stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Zidane.\u0026rdquo; I manage to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Ouch!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEiko had been one her way to Doctor Tot\u0026rsquo;s residence when she collided with a\nsmall figure apparently in a hurry. Apparently, the other one was as surprised\nas she was, as both of them were knocked back a bit by the collision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Watch where you\u0026rsquo;re\u0026ndash;\u0026rdquo; Eiko looked at the one she had bumped into. \u0026ldquo;Vivi?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVivi dusted himself off and looked at the young summoner. \u0026ldquo;Oh, hi Eiko. Excuse\nme, I\u0026ndash;\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Hey!\u0026rdquo; Eiko said, grabbing Vivi\u0026rsquo;s arm before he could dash off, \u0026ldquo;Where do you\nthink you\u0026rsquo;re going? I\u0026rsquo;ve been looking all over for you! You made me wait up at\nthe auc\u0026ndash;\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEiko was surprised to be cut off as Vivi shook off her hand. \u0026ldquo;Sorry, Eiko, but I\ndon\u0026rsquo;t have time for this right now, okay?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;What? Is there a problem? Some sort of emergency?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Problem? Of course not!\u0026rdquo; Eiko was astonished to hear a hint of sarcasm in\nVivi\u0026rsquo;s voice, a tone she\u0026rsquo;d never heard from the black mage before. \u0026ldquo;The world is\nsafe remember? We went out and saved the world! Why should there be a problem?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Vivi, what are you\u0026ndash;?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;We went all the way to a different world, faced the spirit of destruction, and\nthat\u0026hellip; that monkey Kuja is dead!\u0026rdquo; Vivi\u0026rsquo;s voice was completely different from his\nusual shy tone, even though his featureless face revealed nothing. \u0026ldquo;Everything\nshould be great! Everyone should be happy!\u0026rdquo; Vivi shook his hands around him in\nfrustration. Eiko noticed sparks starting to form around her erstwhile friend.\nPeople had started to stop and stare at the ranting little boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Vivi, I think you should calm down.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Calm down? Look at what\u0026rsquo;s happened to us! The princess hasn\u0026rsquo;t spoken to anyone\nsince Zidane\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Vivi\u0026rsquo;s voice trailed off, \u0026ldquo;And now I\u0026hellip;I\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Tendrils of energy\nstarted to twirl around his cone-shaped hat, totally unnoticed by the now\nranting mage. \u0026ldquo;We went out and gave everything for everyone! It shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be\nlike this!\u0026rdquo; The ground around Vivi suddenly burst into an explosion of flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Aaah!!!\u0026rdquo; Eiko was knocked off her feet and was thrown to the nearby wall.\n\u0026ldquo;Ou\u0026ndash;ch!!!\u0026rdquo; The nearby townspeople were forced back by the sudden blaze. Despite\nall the events that had happened lately, exploding flames were never a good\nthing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVivi stopped and noticed the flames swirling around him. \u0026ldquo;Wha\u0026ndash;? Oh no!\u0026rdquo; He\nturned to see a slightly scorched Eiko trying to stand up. He looked down at his\nown hands to see traces of the flames still lingering on his gloves. \u0026ldquo;Eiko, I\u0026ndash;\u0026rdquo;\nNot knowing what to say, Vivi ran off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEiko heard footsteps behind her and turned to see Doctor Tot approaching from\nhis residence. The doctor adjusted his spectacles, and turned to help Eiko get\nup. \u0026ldquo;What happened here?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;re running now, as hard and as fast as we can. As soon as the Supersoft had\ntaken effect, a large bulbous head had appeared from the Iifa Tree, as if\ndefending it\u0026rsquo;s home from a robbery. Marcus had taken the unconscious Zidane over\nhis shoulders, and we made our way back to daylight. By the time we reached the\nTantalus, I was exhausted, and nearly drained of my power. The Benero brothers\nwaved us on board, and the engines roared to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight behind us however, the mass of tentacles at the base of the Iifa Tree\nstarted to move. They shot out, with the bulbous head just behind them, as if\nordering them to prevent our escape. I drew upon my last remaining reserves and\ntried to hold them off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaku ordered the liftoff, and the Tantalus took to the air. Three tentacles shot\nout, two of them latching onto the Tantalus\u0026rsquo; bow, the other onto the tail. More\ntentacles came out as the ship was swung around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaku came out armed now, \u0026ldquo;The ship\u0026rsquo;ll break apart if this goes on!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmarant nodded grimly to the guard as the gate closed behind him. He hefted his\npack over his left shoulder, and looked towards the station. The night was\nyoung, and he had a long way to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Mr. Amarant?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmarant turned around at the high-pitched voice. It\u0026rsquo;s the kid, he thought to\nhimself. The \u0026ldquo;kid\u0026rdquo; was seated on a small knoll just outside of the Treno city\ngate. Judging from the dew gathering around his hat, he\u0026rsquo;d been there for a\nwhile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Are you leaving too?\u0026rdquo; He heard the kid say the words, but he couldn\u0026rsquo;t see how\nhe spoke. Not that it mattered. Amarant was never one to try to figure\neverything out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Yeah. I still got some \u0026lsquo;unfinished business\u0026rsquo; elsewhere.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Oh. I see. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s leaving then\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; The kid\u0026rsquo;s voice trailed off with a\nfamiliar tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Yeah. You\u0026rsquo;re the last one left. Still got business with the doc?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Well\u0026hellip; I\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; His bright eyes seemed to affix themselves to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmarant grunted. \u0026ldquo;Guess what the brat told me was true, huh?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;B-brat?\u0026rdquo; The kid looked up, \u0026ldquo;You mean Eiko?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Yeah. She kept pestering me about cheerin\u0026rsquo; you up.\u0026rdquo; Amarant turned to go. \u0026ldquo;Not\nthat I care, mind you.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmarant took a couple of steps, then, as if changing his mind, stopped in\nmid-stride. \u0026ldquo;You wanna live forever, kid?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;W-what?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmarant went on without turning around. \u0026ldquo;Everybody goes sometime you know.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re luckier than most, \u0026lsquo;coz you know when to expect it. But people like me,\nthat brat, even that goof-off knight or that guard by the gate, we have no idea.\nWe could be dead tomorrow for all we know.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;M-Mr. Amarant\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;But you don\u0026rsquo;t see us sittin\u0026rsquo; on a hill wonderin\u0026rsquo; why we gotta die, do you?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;If you think sitting there feeling sorry for yourself is the best you can do,\ngo ahead.

I\ncouldn\u0026rsquo;t hear above the noise of the battle. Baku, Marcus and Cinna came\nforward. Cinna took the helm, and the others tried to hack off the offending\nplants.

Final Fantasy VI and all\ncharacters involved are copyright of Squaresoft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAuthor\u0026rsquo;s note: This story takes place before the start of FF6.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Stop, thief!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the shopkeeper shouting after him, and grimaced. A couple of\nyears or so ago if someone told him he\u0026rsquo;d be stealing food off merchants in South\nFigaro, he\u0026rsquo;d laugh in their faces. He was a different man then, with different\nworries. The man he was today couldn\u0026rsquo;t be bothered to think about such things as\nhonor or ethics. He was too busy thinking about food, and money. And his\nresearch of course. He had to do his research. What did it all mean otherwise?\nThe months of living off stolen food and money, moving from place to place,\nrobbing scholars and merchants alike, living as a thief. Damn, he said to\nhimself. These aren\u0026rsquo;t the thoughts to be having while being pursued by Imperial\nTroopers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Hurry up, Biggs, he\u0026rsquo;s getting away!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis somewhat stout companion was lagging a step or so behind him,\nadjusting his brown helmet. But he couldn\u0026rsquo;t afford to slow down and wait for\nhim, he thought as he saw his quarry turn right into the next alley. This had\nbeen the chance they were waiting for, a chance to prove themselves to their\nsuperiors. He sped up the chase as his prey knocked down a couple of merchant\nstalls in his haste to get away. He looked around and tried to figure out where\nhis target was heading. Biggs was still right behind him, panting, but still\nrunning. They had known each other since they were kids back in their hometown,\ndreaming of becoming Imperial Generals. He looked back to his friend and shouted\nan unnecessarily rough command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Biggs, he\u0026rsquo;s headed for the west side exit! Get the Guards to cover that\nside!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiggs nodded at Wedge words, and turned down the next corner to alert\nthe Figaro Guards on the west side. He was a bit miffed at Wedge\u0026rsquo; tone. They\nwere, after all, of equal rank, having been Sergeants in the Imperial Army for,\nwhat, two years now? His mind flashed back to the time he and Biggs were\npromoted, how happy they were that they were one step closer to their dream. He\nremembered that dream and forgave his friend\u0026rsquo;s words. He was merely excited\nafter all, since this capture would undoubtedly lead to a promotion. He caught\nsight of the Figaro Guardsmen at their post, and stepped up his running a notch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn, he\u0026rsquo;s still right behind me, the object of the soldiers\u0026rsquo; attention\nsaid to himself. He was a pretty fast runner, but this guy was hot on his tail.\nHe glanced back at his pursuer as he jumped down the steps from the rampart to\nground level. He looks young, he thought to himself, probably hasn\u0026rsquo;t even been\nin the service five years, a private or a sergeant at most. He considered\nstopping and pulling out the dirk in his belt, as the guy probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t\nstand a chance. But he hated killing, and avoided it whenever he could. Besides\nthe guy just needed to hold him off for a few minutes before the Guard could\nsurround him. No, I\u0026rsquo;ll just stick to the plan \u0026ndash; out the west side wall and off\nto Narshe. He turned the corner, stopped and fell back as he caught sight of the\nseven or eight Guards at the gate, with an Imperial Soldier commanding them. Oh\nwell, it was a bad plan anyway. He looked back to see the other soldier about to\npounce on him. He drew his blade and parried just before the sword cut off his\nleft arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Hey, take it easy! I\u0026rsquo;m a thief, not a murderer!\u0026rdquo; Not yet, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Hmph. I know who you are.\u0026rdquo; Wedge made a feint, hoping to fake out a\ncounterattack. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve had reports of your activities in this area for some time\nnow. And your time is up.\u0026rdquo; When his opponent failed to counter, he followed\nthrough, hoping to catch him in the right shoulder with a quick thrust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Sorry, kid,\u0026rdquo; the thief said as he knocked the incoming blade to the\nside.\n\u0026ldquo;But there\u0026rsquo;s no way I\u0026rsquo;m letting myself get caught here.\u0026rdquo; He turned around\nquickly, letting the man\u0026rsquo;s thrust slide harmlessly behind him, and proceeded to\nknock him down with the hilt of his blade. He heard the soldiers coming before\nhe saw them, so he started running again as his opponent fell to his knees,\nhands massaging the back of his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Wedge, what happened?!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about me, just go get that guy!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Biggs attended to his defeated partner, the thief looked back to see\nseven Figaro Guards in hot pursuit. Damn, I guess I\u0026rsquo;ll have to go out the other\nside. I guess I\u0026rsquo;ll be hiding in a cave again for a couple of days. He changed\nhis mind when he saw the guards gathered at the east side entrance. He sighed to\nhimself as he turned and ran up the stairs to the ramparts. Why did I always\ncome back to South Figaro anyway? South Figaro was well-manned, both by Figaro\nGuards and Imperial Soldiers, mainly because most of the trade between the\nEmpire and Figaro passed through here. That meant a lot of merchants to steal\nfrom, but it also meant you had a hell of a time escaping. Uh oh, he muttered as\nhe saw the two Imperial Soldiers who had chased him earlier right in front of\nhim. He looked around, jumping off the rampart was out of the question, there\nwere three guards on the ground level just waiting for him. And the other four\nwere right behind him. He stopped, shrugged, and turned to the two Troopers, a\ndespondent look on his face. It\u0026rsquo;s not like he was worried about getting\ncaptured. After all, he\u0026rsquo;d been captured before, and he would probably be out\nagain in a couple of days. What bothered him was that the chase was over. That\nwas all he really lived for these days, the thrill of the chase. That and\nhis\u0026hellip;research of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I guess you got me.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Like I said, your time\u0026rsquo;s up. By order of the Imperial Magistrate, you\nare\nunder arrest, Locke Cole.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiggs produced a pair of shackles and Wedge grabbed Locke, pinning his\narms\nbehind him. He was about to snap on the shackles when the Figaro Guards came up\nto them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Release this man to our custody,\u0026rdquo; the Guard Commander said to the two\nTroopers. \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s wanted by the King of Figaro for crimes against the nation of\nFigaro.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;What? This man is wanted under Imperial Law, and we came here\nspecifically\nto bring him to the Emperor\u0026rsquo;s justice.\u0026rdquo; Wedge said. Although officially, they\nwere just stationed here as part of the \u0026ldquo;diplomatic envoy\u0026rdquo; to Figaro, they had\ntaken it upon themselves to prove their abilities to their superiors by catching\na notorious thief. \u0026ldquo;It is our duty to bring him back to the Imperial Capital for\nsummary execution.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExecution? Yeah, right. Locke wasn\u0026rsquo;t worried about that. He felt a bit\nmiffed though, being fought over by two sets of soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, Sergeant,\u0026rdquo; the Guard Commander said, emphasizing Wedge\u0026rsquo;s\nrank.\n\u0026ldquo;But this man was captured on Figaro territory, and the King\u0026rsquo;s Guards get first\ncrack at him. We\u0026rsquo;re allies, yes. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t give your Imperial Army\nauthority in these lands.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was here again. It seems he was here every night. Wherever he was,\nhis\ndreams almost always brought him back to this place. A place he hadn\u0026rsquo;t visited\nfor little more than a year now. Kohlingen.\nIt seemed only yesterday he was living in this quiet little town, an\naspiring treasure hunter. He used to love this place. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t very well off,\nbut he had a house here, a cozy little place he had inherited a long time ago.\nHe loved the people here, the atmosphere, and the scenery. And Rachel. Of\ncourse, there was always Rachel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t be silly Locke,\u0026rdquo; Rachel had said to him as they sat at their\nusual\ntable at the town\u0026rsquo;s only restaurant. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve been in those caves a million\ntimes. What makes you think you\u0026rsquo;ll find anything new today?\u0026rdquo; She always needled\nhim about his \u0026lsquo;job\u0026rsquo;, or lack of it as the case may be. But she loved him. Of\nthis he was sure. He would never be able to provide for her in the way her\nparents wanted, but he knew he loved her as well, and that he would always take\ncare of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Just a feeling I got,\u0026rdquo; he had said with his usual air of confidence.\n\u0026ldquo;There was an unusual cleft I saw the last time I was in there. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure\nthat there are other artifacts in there like the last one.\u0026rdquo; He had found an\nancient spear in the cave before, and a scholar had verified for him that it was\nindeed an artifact, from the War of the Magi perhaps. Which was why he wanted to\nexplore the caves more. Rachel always worried about him, and he hated worrying\nher. But a few more artifacts like that, and the two of them could probably be\nset for life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;No good will come of these \u0026lsquo;artifacts\u0026rsquo; you know,\u0026rdquo; had Rachel said in\nher\nmost lecturing tone, \u0026ldquo;the War of the Magi ended a thousand years ago, and\ndigging up long-forgotten weapons won\u0026rsquo;t help the peace any. Who knows, one of\nthese weapons you excavate could catch the interest of the Empire. What would\nhappen to Kohlingen then?\u0026rdquo; Rachel\u0026rsquo;s father was a scholar, a historian who\nstudied the War of the Magi. So her father always told her of the horrible\nstruggle that ended a thousand years ago, and how they should all learn from\nhistory\u0026rsquo;s mistakes. She smiled at him, \u0026ldquo;After all, if something were to happen\nto our little town, where would we live when we got married?\u0026rdquo; Locke\u0026rsquo;s face went\nred at the memory of her smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocke woke up to the sound of a voice from the other side of his cell\nwall.\nOh well, he said to himself. I\u0026rsquo;ve dreamed the same dream a thousand times\nanyway. The voice behind the wall repeated itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Locke said to the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Hey, you\u0026rsquo;re awake.

Now he was a famous thief.\nWith an enthusiastic fan. He curled up and tried to get back to sleep. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re\nthinking of someone else, just let me sleep.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently his excited prison mate hadn\u0026rsquo;t heard him. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m Lone Wolf, the\npickpocket.

You are planning to escape,\nright?\u0026rdquo; Another two-bit crook, Locke figured. They were being held in the prison\nin the basement of Figaro Castle. The Guards had taken him here after a rather\nheated argument with the two Troopers. He figured he\u0026rsquo;d stay for a couple of\ndays, if only to take advantage of the free food. But his \u0026lsquo;friend\u0026rsquo; behind the\nwall didn\u0026rsquo;t need to know that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not gonna escape.

A couple of guards walked up\nto his cell, one of them carrying a candle. Behind them, Locke could see the\nsilhouette of a tall, robed man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Locke Cole?\u0026rdquo; The robed man turned to the guard for confirmation. \u0026ldquo;The\nKing\nwishes to see you.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocke wondered what the King of Figaro would want with him as the Guards\nopened his cell and brought him to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Be strong, man!\u0026rdquo; His unseen friend spoke out to him again, albeit in a\nmore subdued voice. \u0026ldquo;You can get out of this!\u0026rdquo; He never heard from that guy\nagain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdgar Roni Figaro, king of the small nation of Figaro, was in his throne\nroom. You\u0026rsquo;d think someone who was royalty would be surrounded by servants\nwilling to do his every bidding. But Edgar didn\u0026rsquo;t really like servants hovering\naround him, except for the occasional pretty servant girl perhaps, but not\ntoday. Today, there were greater concerns to be met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe king of Figaro was conversing with a bearded old man standing in\nfront\nof his throne.

He complied and walked\ninto the room with no hint of awe or majesty at Figaro\u0026rsquo;s throne room. It was\nmajestic, yes, worthy of a king, but nothing he had not seen before. The guards\nbrought him before the throne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Kneel.\u0026rdquo; The guard gruffly ordered, and Locke felt his head pushed to\nthe\nground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Get up, you know I hate that.\u0026rdquo; Edgar said.

He\u0026rsquo;s younger than\nI thought, Locke said to himself, what does he want with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocke looked around the room and took note of any means of escape. There\nwere six other guards, aside from the ones holding him, and two more outside the\ndoor; the fat old chancellor who had taken him out of his cell; and an old man\nstanding to the side, trying to remain unnoticed. Who is he? Some sort of\nservant?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the king speak again and focused his attention to the throne.\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you for bringing him here, Chancellor.

Locke felt the\nshackles\ncome off, and rubbed his wrists to warm them. He saw the king nod to the other\nguards, and they accompanied the chancellor out the throne room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;With all due respect your highness,\u0026rdquo; Locke finally said, \u0026ldquo;You sure you\nwanna be alone with me? I\u0026rsquo;m a dangerous thief you know.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdgar smiled. No respect for authority in this one, he thought to\nhimself.\nHe looked to the shadows on the wall, and the old man stepped forward. Locke\nfinally got a good look at him, although he still couldn\u0026rsquo;t recognize the man.\nThe old man spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Yes, we know all about you Locke Cole.

There\u0026rsquo;s\nno\nway Figaro\u0026rsquo;s army could stand up to the Empire. They\u0026rsquo;ve only used a fraction\ntheir power to dominate the Southern Continent, and even the King of Doma is\nhaving a hard time against them!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s exactly why Figaro is still openly an ally of the Empire.\u0026rdquo; Edgar\nexplained. \u0026ldquo;We have no intention of meeting them in war, as that would only\nresult in a bloody loss. But once Doma falls, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty certain that Figaro\nwill be their next target.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;We have no means of fighting them, really,\u0026rdquo; the old man continued,\n\u0026ldquo;Except\nwith our hearts and with our minds. We have supporters scattered throughout the\nEmpire, waiting for our word. We have people disrupting Imperial supply lines,\nsabotaging their machinery. We may not be able to topple them today, or anytime\nsoon, but we will eventually. But we need help. We need more people.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;People like you,\u0026rdquo; Edgar said, looking directly at Locke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;What do you think I can do?\u0026rdquo; Locke said, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just a thief.

He had wanted to show\nRachel\nthe buried ruins he had found in one of his explorations up on Mt. Kolts. With\nall the artifacts there, he was pretty sure they would be pretty much set for\nlife. It had taken him a while to convince her to come with him, but he\neventually got her to agree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, I\u0026rsquo;ll watch over you every step of the way.\u0026rdquo; He grinned at\nher\nas they strode up the mountain path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sure you will,\u0026rdquo; Rachel replied, \u0026ldquo;the same way you were watching\nover\nthat bar girl the other night, eh?\u0026rdquo; She smiled at him teasingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Hey, I told you, she looked just like my cousin!\u0026rdquo; Locke smiled right\nback\nat her. \u0026ldquo;The cave\u0026rsquo;s just beyond the next bridge.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;d better hurry,\u0026rdquo; Rachel said, pulling close to him. \u0026ldquo;If my parents\nfind\nout I\u0026rsquo;ve been gallivanting with you\u0026ndash;\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;\u0026ndash;they\u0026rsquo;d chase me out of Kohlingen, right.

I can see the bridge already.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel had stopped at the summit just before the bridge. She looked off\ninto the southward horizon, at the small town seemingly a lifetime away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;South Figaro looks so\u0026hellip; small from up here.\u0026rdquo; This was the first time\nshe\nhad ever climbed a mountain, and the natural beauty she could see amazed her. \u0026ldquo;I\ncould see for miles\u0026hellip; everything is so\u0026hellip; pristine\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;C\u0026rsquo;mon Rachel, you\u0026rsquo;re the one who told me to hurry!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Oh\u0026hellip; yes.\u0026rdquo; She said, hurrying over to him. \u0026ldquo;I would be a little more\nexcited if you maybe told me what it is we\u0026rsquo;re going to see.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not gonna believe what awaits us up here!\u0026rdquo; Locke said as he\ncrossed\nthe bridge. \u0026ldquo;Come on, it\u0026rsquo;s worth a fortune!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything else had seemed to happen in slow motion. It was a moment he\nhad\nrelived time and again. His footing had been wrong, and he had felt the bridge\nbegin to give way. He heard her shouted warning, but had been caught unawares\nwhen she threw herself at him. He had been so surprised that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to\nput up any resistance. He had felt himself pushed back to the far end of the\nbridge. He had stumbled clumsily, and his instinct took over as he jumped clear\nof the collapsing bridge. He had looked back, and she was not there. He ran to\nthe edge of the ravine, shouting her name without hearing anything. He had\nclimbed down after her, and everything else was a blur. Rushing her back to her\nfather\u0026rsquo;s house, the worried looks on her parent\u0026rsquo;s faces, the relief when the\ndoctors said she\u0026rsquo;d be fine, and finally, that blank look on her face when she\nwoke up to him. No gleaming eyes or bright smile. Simply an emotionless stare,\nas if she had never seen him before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer parents had been outraged, but he had just sat there, not knowing\nwhat\nto do or say. He tried to speak, but Rachel\u0026rsquo;s father wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even hear of it.\nHe was chased out of Kohlingen by nightfall, nowhere to look or turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0026rsquo;t remember how he had wound up in South Figaro, or how long he\nhad been there. He didn\u0026rsquo;t know how he was able to survive, living off food he\nfound or stole off the streets. Somehow, he found himself under the care of an\nold scholar who had retired to South Figaro. The weeks of desperation had taken\ntheir toll on him and he was bedridden for several days. But he had found\ncomfort with the old man who listened to his story, the only one he ever told it\nto. He had poured his heart out, sometimes with tears running down his face, as\nhe recounted Rachel\u0026rsquo;s tragedy. Luckily, his newfound friend had with him a\nglimmer of hope that brought him out of his stupor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t be sure about this, you know,\u0026rdquo; The old scholar had droned in\nhis\nmonotone voice, \u0026ldquo;But I seem to recall an old chap a while back who had done\nresearch on this sort of thing\u0026hellip; memory loss and recovery, I believe.\u0026rdquo; Locke\nremembered how his face had lit up when he realized what the old man was saying.\nA cure? Rachel\u0026rsquo;s condition can be cured?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Well, as I said, it\u0026rsquo;s somewhat of a long shot,\u0026rdquo; the old man said, \u0026ldquo;but\nI\nthink the old chap was one of the Empire scientists.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so his hunt had began. After thanking his benefactor, he had set off\nfor Imperial territory, determined to find a cure for her recovery. He lived by\nstealing off merchants and Imperial officers, traveling throughout the Southern\ncontinent, asking scientists and researchers about this so-called cure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd all for what? Locke asked himself as he considered the offer being\nmade\nto him. He had been searching for almost a year now, with not even a single\nclue. He was wanted for numerous crimes throughout the empire, but he couldn\u0026rsquo;t\neven sneak into the fortress at Vector to question their scientists. Maybe, this\njob was the right thing for him to do? No, he decided. He had already devoted\ntoo much time and effort to what he was doing, it all had to mean something, he\nhad to do it, for Rachel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry,\u0026rdquo; He replied to Edgar and the old man, \u0026ldquo;I understand your\nneeds,\nbut there are some things I just have to do, some things that are more important\nto me.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdgar frowned a him. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think I have to remind you that you\u0026rsquo;re a\ncriminal under my jurisdiction.\u0026rdquo; He looked straight at him, \u0026ldquo;I hold your life\nin my hands.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Is that supposed to be a threat?\u0026rdquo; Locke said mockingly, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve escaped\nworse fates than this before.\u0026rdquo; He stood there defiantly, as if daring Edgar to\nstrike him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Now, now, no need to be hostile to each other\u0026rdquo;, the old man said\nsoothingly. The two backed down a bit. He looked at the young king. \u0026ldquo;Edgar, no\nneed to be rough with him, is there? I\u0026rsquo;m sure you can arrange a \u0026lsquo;pardon\u0026rsquo; for\nthis young man, can\u0026rsquo;t you? So that he can consider our offer.\u0026rdquo; He turned back to\nLocke. \u0026ldquo;Please take the time to consider it, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to decide now.\u0026rdquo; The\nold man looked at Edgar, \u0026ldquo;Well?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;All right, tell you what,\u0026rdquo; Edgar sighed resignedly, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll tell some of\nthe\nguards at the night shift to take an early break around midnight, okay? Just\ndon\u0026rsquo;t hurt any of my guards.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man nodded and turned back to Locke. \u0026ldquo;We can\u0026rsquo;t force you to help\nus, that isn\u0026rsquo;t our way. But please think about it. If you wish to contact me,\ntalk to Arvis of Narshe, I\u0026rsquo;m sure you know him.\u0026rdquo; He smiled at Locke. \u0026ldquo;My name is\nBanon.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Or, you could just get yourself caught again,\u0026rdquo; Edgar grinned as he went\nto\ncall the guards back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocke nudged his chocobo to go just a bit faster. He was anxious, and at\nthe same time worried. He hadn\u0026rsquo;t been back to Kohlingen for the past year, but\nhe needed to go back now. He needed to reassure himself that he was doing the\nright thing, to remind himself what he was fighting for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis conscience had been bothering him since the guard brought him back\nto\nhis cell. He had wanted to catch a couple of hours sleep before midnight, but he\nkept thinking about what it is that he was he was doing. He was on a wild-goose\nchase, he could recognize that, for some cure that may or may not exist. But he\nhad to do it, because he owed it to her, to fight for her. To protect her. But\nnow, he had turned his back on people who needed him, people he could help, to\npursue this unknown cure. Had he met the right choice? He would know when he saw\nRachel again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure enough, the guards left around midnight, and Locke had been the\nonly\nprisoner awake. He had looked around warily, still not sure what to make of the\nsituation, but then started to work on the cell\u0026rsquo;s lock. Nothing too difficult,\nhe was out of the dungeon in three minutes. He had promised not to hurt any of\nthe guards, but he had to knock a couple of them unconscious and steal a\nchocobo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now here he was, just a couple of miles to Kohlingen now, and he\nwould\nsee her again. He didn\u0026rsquo;t need to talk to her, just to see her. To remind himself\nof what he was doing, and why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff the horizon, in the direction of Kohlingen, he sighted a thick\npillar\nof black smoke rising from the ground. Worried, he kicked his chocobo into high\ngear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sight was disturbing. The slightest traces of dawn had begun to\nappear,\nand the rays of light seemed to grotesquely outline the destruction that had\nhappened here. Several houses were burned to the ground, some had collapsed on\nthemselves, now simply a heap of wood and rubble. As Locke rode into the city\nand through the empty streets, he could feel several eyes looking out of the\nhouses that were still standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;What the hell happened here?\u0026rdquo; Locke pondered for a moment before his\nheart\ntook over again. \u0026ldquo;Rachel!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got off his Chocobo, and took a shortcut down a narrow alley. Looking\naround, he saw that most of the brick-and-mortar houses here had survived\nwhatever it was that caused this carnage, so he figured Rachel and her family\nwould be alright. His stomach turned as he saw the remnants of their house\ncollapsed on the ground like a random pile of rocks. He stood there gaping for\nseveral moments before he heard someone call out to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Master Locke!\u0026rdquo; Seymour, Rachel\u0026rsquo;s family\u0026rsquo;s manservant, came running up\nto\nhim. He was a skinny man in his late forties, and he was often sympathetic to\nLocke and Rachel\u0026rsquo;s relationship even when his master didn\u0026rsquo;t approve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Seymour!\u0026rdquo; Locke said in relief, \u0026ldquo;What happened here? Where\u0026rsquo;s Rachel?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;It was the Empire, sir!\u0026rdquo; Seymour spilled, as he stopped in front of\nLocke,\ngasping for breath. Even though he was almost fifty, he had always insisted he\nwas healthy enough to run a marathon. \u0026ldquo;They came through here last night, saying\n\u0026lsquo;Imperial enemies\u0026rsquo; had been hiding here.\u0026rdquo; He looked around. \u0026ldquo;They burned down\nand destroyed houses and buildings with some new weapon they had. MagiDuck, or\nsomething such, sir! A ghastly meld of monster and machine, a weapon of\ndestruction\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; He looked at Locke, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s good to see you again, sir, despite\nthe circumstances\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Rachel!\u0026rdquo; Locke almost shouted, \u0026ldquo;Where is she? Is she alright?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeymour hesitated before replying. \u0026ldquo;Best you go see for yourself sire,\nshe\u0026rsquo;s at Largo\u0026rsquo;s right now.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocke nodded, and hurried off. \u0026ldquo;Thanks, Seymour. Get some rest, you\nhear?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePutting aside his concerns for Seymour\u0026rsquo;s health, Locke made his way to\nthe\nherbalist\u0026rsquo;s shop. Old Largo, the medicine man of Kohlingen, had done many good\nthings for him back when he was still climbing mountains and all. Hopefully,\nRachel would be alright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been sitting on this bench for half a day now. He felt so\nuseless.\nAll his efforts, all his sacrifices to find a cure for Rachel, and what happens?\nHe\u0026rsquo;s not there for her at the time she needed him most. Largo had told her what\nhappened, how their house had collapsed on top of them. Seymour and the others\nhad dug through the rubble, expecting to find only their dead bodies. Rachel\u0026rsquo;s\nparents didn\u0026rsquo;t make it. But surprisingly, Rachel did. She had been holding\nsomething in her hand when they found her, gasping for breath, bruised and\nbattered all over. She had been delirious and weak as they carried her to\nLargo\u0026rsquo;s for treatment, mumbling all the way. Once they laid her down on a bed,\nshe had promptly collapsed and had not awakened since. She had dropped whatever\nit was she was holding, a small pendant which had given her something to live\nfor, which Largo had seen fit to give to Locke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fingered the small pendant Largo had given him, and opened the\nlocket,\nthe same way he had been doing for the past few hours. The picture inside was a\nbit burned at the edges, but he could nonetheless see their faces so clearly.\nLocke and Rachel. They had taken this picture several months before the\naccident, and she had promised to treasure it forever. He closed the locket and\nslammed his fist into the ground as he recalled Seymour\u0026rsquo;s words. \u0026ldquo;She was\nmumbling your name all the way, sir, even before we found her in the rubble, and\nup to the time she fainted.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;So bloody useless,\u0026rdquo; he muttered to himself, \u0026ldquo;What the hell have I been\ndoing this past year, what the bloody hell has it all been for?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered Largo telling him about her condition. He said she was in\nbad\nshape, and that it was a miracle she survived. He had given her some medicine to\nkeep her from the brink of death. But that was the best he could do. He didn\u0026rsquo;t\nknow whether she could be revived in any way. The herbs would keep her like\nthis, in a form of suspended animation, for a long while, but that was the best\nhe could do. For all intents and purposes, it was as if she were already dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloody useless, Locke repeated to himself. What could he do now? Raise\nthe\ndead? A slight rain began to fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Master Locke,\u0026rdquo; he heard Seymour\u0026rsquo;s voice behind him, \u0026ldquo;You should get\nsome\nrest. And get out of the rain, sir.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored him for a while, and eventually Seymour\u0026rsquo;s voice vanished from\nhis hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next dawn found him still in the spot, staring lazily at the\nherbalist\nshop across the street. The rain had stopped a few hours before, but he was\nstill quite drenched. He felt his eyelids starting to fall, for the umpteenth\ntime now, and snapped himself awake. He heard footsteps behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry.\u0026rdquo; The voice was the old man\u0026rsquo;s. The one he had met in Figaro\nCastle. What did he say his name was? Oh yeah, Banon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I came up here as soon as I\u0026rsquo;d heard.\u0026rdquo; The old man sat down beside him.\n\u0026ldquo;We\nknew of your history with the girl here in Kohlingen, and we knew that was why\nyou didn\u0026rsquo;t want to join us. Too bad things had to be like this.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocke\u0026rsquo;s silence disturbed him but he went on, \u0026ldquo;Listen, about the\noffer\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nBanon wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what to say, but he decided to press on, \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;we understand if\nyou choose to decline. After all it must be a difficult time for you ri\u0026ndash;\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll do it.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;\u0026ndash;ght now. Eh?\u0026rdquo; Banon turned to him in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Rachel would\u0026rsquo;ve wanted me to help you guys, I guess,\u0026rdquo; Locke said\nresignedly, \u0026ldquo;She always said the Empire would someday threaten Kohlingen. I\nnever really listened to her.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Locke\u0026ndash;\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about me. I\u0026rsquo;ve had a long time to think about things. I\nsacrificed a lot of things trying to bring back the Rachel I knew, only to have\nthe Empire take her away again. I owe it to her to fight for the ideals she\nbelieved in. I have to do this now, or else, it all has no meaning.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man nodded. \u0026ldquo;Very well.

He stood up and looked down at himself. \u0026ldquo;I guess I should\nclean up a bit, huh? Maybe Largo\u0026rsquo;s awake already.\u0026rdquo; He started towards the\nherbalist\u0026rsquo;s shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Oh and Locke,\u0026rdquo; Banon started to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocke looked at him questioningly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Welcome to the Returners.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efinis\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The\nproblem was, this time he didn\u0026rsquo;t recall anyone in particular smashing him\ninto the sky. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t even recall being at the Dojo for the last\nthirty minutes.

Ranma\u0026rsquo;s brain, which normally could not handle anything\nmore complicated than one of Ryoga\u0026rsquo;s schemes, was working overtime.
