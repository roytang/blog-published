            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s 1:30 in the morning, and I plan on being at work by 8AM, so I\u0026rsquo;ll just throw out a quick book review before I buzz off to meet the sandman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeil Stephenson\u0026rsquo;s Cryptonomicon is the only book I managed to finish out of the three I took with me to Bicol. And I actually started reading it about a month and a half earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a word, the book isÂ \u003cem\u003ewordy\u003c/em\u003e. Stephenson has a lot to say, and it takes him 1100+ pages to do it, whereas if I were writing this story (or weird amalgamation of stories, such as it is), I would probably do it in around half that amount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two stories actually, not three as the book\u0026rsquo;s back cover suggests. But those two stories actually start off in around fifty separate threads that start to come together only halfway through the book. This is one of the reasons why it took me a month and a half to get through the first half of the book; once the plot started to get going, everything went a bit faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCryptonomicon is basically about a slick hacker-type dude named Randall Waterhouse, or Randy for short. While reading this book, whenever Randy\u0026rsquo;s name is mentioned, I always visualize young Randy Orton, legend-killer and youngest ever WWE champion. This is the second reason why I was able to read the second half faster. Once I started to imagine it was Randy Orton, there was always the possibility of a book-ending RKO in the next page! Anyway, the first (and main) story arc is about young Randy\u0026rsquo;s involvement in an ambitious startup setting up operations in Southeast Asia. Lots of stuff about finance, cryptography and politics finds its way into young Randy\u0026rsquo;s story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe secondary story arc is about World War II. Unlike the modern-day Randy storyline however, this one has more than one main player, so the WWII story is a lot more fragmented. The most important players are Lawrence Waterhouse (Randy\u0026rsquo;s grandpa), who works for the Allies as a top-notch codebreaker, boasting such friends as the famous (to computer geeks at least) Alan Turing; Bobby Shaftoe, a US marine who seems to have accomplished more during the war than Douglas McArthur himself; and finally Goto Dengo, a Japanese miner whose role in the story is not readily apparent until the halfway mark. (A lot of things improve around the halfway mark.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, here\u0026rsquo;s the main problem with the novel. There are all these POVs, and it jumps around a lot, so there\u0026rsquo;s a tendency to get confused, and every so often Stephenson pulls out a chapter that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have anything to do with any of the earlier chapters, so you\u0026rsquo;re like \u0026ldquo;Crap! Another subplot I have to keep track of!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I digress. And so does Stephenson. Not only do the POVs jump around between chapters, but each chapter is liberally interspersed with a short discussion of the weather, Asian cultures, corruption at the NAIA, cryptography, mathematical analysis of horniness, military idiosyncrasies and a bajillion other topics; enterprising high school students looking for a term paper could simply copy one of the book\u0026rsquo;s chapters, find-and-replace some names, and get at least a B. Normally it\u0026rsquo;s okay, but there\u0026rsquo;s simply a lot of stray tangents in this book, and not all of them I found interesting, and were simply glossed over. Not surprisingly, I liked the parts about cryptography.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really hated this book at the start, as I found it a very hard read, but after I got past the halfway mark it got a lot easier. I guess my main problem with the start was I had no idea why all these random, seemingly unrelated subplots were coming out; I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if there was a point and it was all going to come together later, or Stephenson just lets his mind wander. Luckily, it did all come together later, in a somewhat plausible way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll-in-all, the book is okay, but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend it to a non-geek, or to someone faint of heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, that was a short review. ðŸ˜€\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAs I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned before, Daet is a small town. When I was there, I was mentally comparing it to the UP Diliman campus. Main reason being, we had a tendency to walk everywhere we went. Just like in UP, everything was literally within \u0026ldquo;walking distance\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; the beach, the church, the cemetary, etc. So in my mind, the UP Diliman campus and Daet, Camarines Norte occupy roughly the same area, even though technically, one is a university campus and the other a full-sized town. (On a tangent, the transportation within Daet is strictly limited to tricycles only, which would imply it being logically smaller than UPD, which has jeepneys.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, anyway, there was a lot of walking going on. We walked everywhere. Ocassionally, I would get to walk with my father. My dad, he\u0026rsquo;s basically a nice guy. It\u0026rsquo;s always nice to see that while we\u0026rsquo;re walking around town, he has to stop and chat with somebody in every other store. Daet has lots of these little stores, side-by-side in the residential areas: hardware stores, bakeries, general merchandise, etc. And my dad seems to know someone and has to exchange tales of how things have been going, hey-have-you-met-my-son-can-you-find-him-a-girlfriend, that sort of thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, maybe this sort of thing isn\u0026rsquo;t that irregular, why do I bother talking about it? After all, my father grew up in this town, it\u0026rsquo;s to be expected that he knows people all over the place, right? Not to me. I mean, growing up I knew a small part of Quezon City, but I was never that chummy with that many people. I guess it\u0026rsquo;s just a small town thing that never fails to amaze me: Everybody seems to know everybody else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother thing about my dad that occasionally surprises me: he\u0026rsquo;s a story-teller. Like I said, whenever he meets one of these everyday people-on-the-street types, he spends a few minutes chatting with them. Those few minutes are invariably filled with some short story (only occasionally mildly exaggerated) about how his sons have jobs now, how things were when he worked overseas, what happened to his long-lost cousins, etc. When I watch him talking like this to long-lost friends and the occasional relative-whose-name-I-should-probably remember, I am quite a bit envious. I want to be like that, I want to be able to spout out interesting anecdotes on demand, I want to be able to grab people\u0026rsquo;s attentions with my words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, unlike my dad, I don\u0026rsquo;t have much life experience to speak about. I haven\u0026rsquo;t been to that many places, haven\u0026rsquo;t done that many interesting things. I guess I really need to get out more\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

So I took a taxi, just outside Megamall. The driver had to ask me where I was going, and luckily my choice of destination was favorable to him. Now, to be honest, I really hate taxi drivers who choose passengers based on where they\u0026rsquo;re going. Not only is it illegal, it\u0026rsquo;s annoying. So I didn\u0026rsquo;t really like it when he turned out to be a chatty driver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn our way down East Avenue, near the LTO offices, he told me how he had spent the whole day there yesterday to get his taximeter calibrated. Now, the government recently declared an increase in taxi fares, so taxis have been lined up in droves along East Avenue for days now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason, I found myself interested. He told me about how he was there since 5 in the AM, sleeping in his taxi (apprently a new one, or so he said) He told me about how the chairman (of what exactly, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure) didn\u0026rsquo;t know anything about cars and had to call a senior citizen employee to help her sort it out. She didn\u0026rsquo;t know much, he said, but she had guts. She stuck to it all day, stopping only to eat, making sure everything was in order, enduring the verbal abuse of the taxi drivers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said he was impressed with her, a diminutive woman in her late thirties, a bit attractive, apparently single. She hunched when she sat down, but when she walked, she stood tall \u0026ndash; she knew how to carry herself. She was new to the office, he said, but she was eager to learn and she meant well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a good storyteller, relishing the details of his story, I wish I could do it justice. I came away impressed, and not a bit ashamed. I was ready to dismiss him as another nobody, someone who couldn\u0026rsquo;t learn anything in life but how to drive a car. But the way he spoke, the words he used, they spoke of a subtle intelligence, a stoic understanding of events around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should chat with taxi drivers more often.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

You start to notice this certain person. You find her sweet and friendly. You like the way she looks, the way she talks, the way she smiles. She\u0026rsquo;s pretty cute, she\u0026rsquo;s smart, and her smile is enough to melt your heart. You hang out with her every so often. You find something about her that turns you on. Pretty soon you find yourself thinking about her more than usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is it about her that has your interest? You\u0026rsquo;re not sure. You don\u0026rsquo;t even know her that well. She\u0026rsquo;s not the type of person you always thought you\u0026rsquo;d fall for. She\u0026rsquo;s not a super-beautiful hot babe. She doesn\u0026rsquo;t give any special indication that she\u0026rsquo;s even remotely interested. But your heart doesn\u0026rsquo;t give a damn, you love her anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou start to worry about how you\u0026rsquo;re feeling. You wonder whether you should try to get close. Or maybe you should be upfront and tell her how you feel. You agonize for weeks; all the words left unsaid, swimming around in your head, yearning for release. You want to be careful. But you want to shout your love from the rooftops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. In a moment of weakness, it comes out. Your first mistake. You tell her how you feel. Verbally, by SMS, by email, by chat, by hand-written note, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. It all starts coming out. Like a fool, you pour your heart out, believing that your love for her is enough; enough for her to give you a chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo such luck. She won\u0026rsquo;t even consider it. She can only be your friend she says. You walk away, sad, shattered, dejected, not knowing what to do. It rips away your heart, the fact that you love her so much, you feel so strongly for her, yet she cannot return even a fraction of the intensity of your emotion. You feel so helpless, so powerless over this situation that means the world to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou ask yourself what went wrong. Did you say something stupid, did you do anything wrong, did you blow it? No, she says, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with you, it\u0026rsquo;s me. Bullshit, you say to yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou try to keep on hanging out with her, to be her friend, as she says. But you can\u0026rsquo;t . Every moment you spend with her is infinity of torture. You want to speak out, tell her how you feel, remind her that there\u0026rsquo;s someone loving her. Seeing her is pure agony. In yet another moment of weakness, you make your second mistake. You tell her you still love her, you tell her you\u0026rsquo;re still there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe refuses to talk about it; she says she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to feel the guilt. Damnit! You blame yourself, asking why you always say the wrong things at the wrong time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon, things become awkward between the two of you, and you drift apart. You see her everyday, but you barely talk. You still feel the same way, but you can\u0026rsquo;t even comfortably spend time with her anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou tell yourself that you should just try to be her friend. You bottle up your feelings, try to set them aside. They eat away at your heart, tear apart your soul. Running into her becomes a double-edged sword; you\u0026rsquo;re glad to see the smile on her face, but you\u0026rsquo;re saddened by the awkward silence that exists between you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou start to question yourself. You start to ask God what you did to deserve this sort of pain. Are you really so unattractive, so unremarkable, that the girl of your dreams won\u0026rsquo;t even consider you? Was it really too much to hope that this girl could at least look beyond your outer shell and try to get to know the real you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou start to doubt the girl you fell in love with. Maybe she wasn\u0026rsquo;t as nice as you once thought? Maybe she\u0026rsquo;s an evil, heartless bitch? Maybe she\u0026rsquo;s no more special than you are, maybe you\u0026rsquo;ve put her up on a pedestal, and maybe you\u0026rsquo;d just be disappointed if the reality did not match your expectations? Is she really worth all this pain?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou start to think about how you feel. Are you really in love with her? Or do you just want her because you can\u0026rsquo;t have her? Are you in love with the real her, not just some made-up idea of her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;This is madness!\u0026rdquo; you finally conclude. \u0026ldquo;There has to be more to life than this\u0026hellip;  Why should I waste so much of my time and energy pining over this woman, a woman who will probably never even consider me, a woman whom I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure why I\u0026rsquo;m attracted to?\u0026rdquo; You come to a decision. You will get rid of these feelings, these emotions; push them away to some dark corner of your soul and leave them to rot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you do it. It pains your heart to do so, but you start to avoid her. You don\u0026rsquo;t talk to her unless you need to. Whenever you think of her, you throw yourself into your work, your hobbies, your friends, anything to rid your mind of her lingering presence. You do what it takes. You pull out that part of your heart that remembers her smile, and you bury it inside, deep inside, so that you may never feel those painful emotions again. You kill that part of your soul that knows how to love and how to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is living pain and torture, but eventually you manage to do it. You manage to regain control of your mind, heart and soul. You\u0026rsquo;re finally at peace. All is right with the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then you see her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe greets you, talks to you, compliments you, smiles at you. And suddenly all your hard work fades away. Your world is no longer your own. You\u0026rsquo;re falling in love, all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou recognize it, and you accept it. You are able to survive, because somehow, through all those moments of pain, heartbreak and despair, a light shines through. Every so often, you manage to get some time to sit with her, talk to her, see her smile. And those moments, while very rare, are also very precious. Those moments are pure, unadulterated bliss, and you wish there was a way to make them last forever. They are no more than fleeting instants between oceans of pain, but somehow, those few moments are enough to make all of the loneliness worthwhile\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the cruel, vicious cycle repeats itself\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",
