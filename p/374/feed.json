If the gate is open, we save around two minutes of walking, otherwise we have to spend some extra five to ten minutes walking back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlvin: But it\u0026rsquo;s probably open!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy: We don\u0026rsquo;t know that. We don\u0026rsquo;t have enough information on the gate\u0026rsquo;s state to determine whether it\u0026rsquo;s open or not. Right now, according to quantum mechanics, that gate is both open and closed, and we can\u0026rsquo;t determine whether we should take it or not until we actually walk up to the gate! It\u0026rsquo;s Schrodinger\u0026rsquo;s gate!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlvin: Tell you what, when we get to the seminary, we\u0026rsquo;ll split up, you take the direct route, I\u0026rsquo;ll go for the gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy: Huh? I don\u0026rsquo;t see what your experiment would prove. It makes no sense to compare the travel time of a person taking the direct route and a person going through either the closed or open gate. We know the outcome depends only on the current state of the gate. A more sensible experiment would be to have two people try to go through the gate, but one of them will find it closed, one of them will find it open, and\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlvin: Let\u0026rsquo;s just do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe split up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I get home, I ring the doorbell.

But I don\u0026rsquo;t see what this little experiment proves, after all, if we were in the same situation again later, this experiment doesn\u0026rsquo;t help us make a decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlvin: Basta.

A short while after, I also picked up his next two books, \u003cem\u003eBakit Baliktad Magbasa ng Libro Ang Mga Pilipino?\u003c/em\u003e (Why Do Filipinos Read Backwards?) and \u003cem\u003eAng Paboritong Libro ni Hudas\u003c/em\u003e (Judas\u0026rsquo; Favorite Book).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Bakit Baligtad\u0026rdquo; focuses on the Philippines, its people, its quirks and its problems. \u0026ldquo;Paboritong Libro\u0026rdquo; is a lot harder to classify, as it jumps across several topics, with the unifying theme being the chapters named after anagrams of the seven deadly sins. At least I think that\u0026rsquo;s the unifying theme\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Paboritong Libro\u0026rdquo; is also the better of the two books. Or at least the easier read, as \u0026ldquo;Bakit Baligtad\u0026rdquo; had a tendency to be a lot more serious and preachy, which might turn off people looking for a light read. Also, \u0026ldquo;Bakit Baligtad\u0026rdquo; contains a significant amount of non-original material, from the \u003ca href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=bobong+pinoy\u0026amp;sourceid=mozilla-search\u0026amp;start=0\u0026amp;start=0\u0026amp;ie=utf-8\u0026amp;oe=utf-8\u0026amp;client=firefox-a\u0026amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official\"\u003eapparently-now-defunct Bobong Pinoy website\u003c/a\u003e and from several online forums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, after reading \u0026ldquo;Bakit Baligtad\u0026rdquo;, I realized the particular appeal of Bob Ong\u0026rsquo;s books\u0026hellip; all of them, including the first one, read like they were written on the internet. Maybe in a blog or something. Each book is like some sort of running commentary on some part of life in general; (the first book was about education, the second about the Philippines; I\u0026rsquo;m still not sure what the third book was about) That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s so hard to pin down, it leaves you with that internet feeling of \u0026ldquo;hey-when\u0026rsquo;s-the-next-update?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth books are generally hit-or-miss though, with a bit more hit than miss, same as the first one. Some good parts, some you\u0026rsquo;d want to sleep through. They\u0026rsquo;re good for the price they\u0026rsquo;re at. In any case, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably pick up his next book as an impulse buy if I see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy favorite part of these two books (I\u0026rsquo;m not sure which book it was in anymore) was a list of amusing signs found all over the Philippines. One of them is described as such: \u003ca href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en\u0026amp;lr=\u0026amp;c2coff=1\u0026amp;client=firefox-a\u0026amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial\u0026amp;q=%22danger+wall+is+falling%22\u0026amp;btnG=Search\"\u003eon a cracked lopsided wall along Libis, QC: Danger Wall is Falling!\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHehe, that cracks me up, and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why.

            "title": "Games: Legend of Zelda -- Minish Cap",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThe last Zelda game I played (as in, to the end) was Link To The Past, and I think it was on David\u0026rsquo;s old SNES. Or it may have been on ZSNES, I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sure anymore. Before that was the first Zelda, which I actually finished on its original console!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeems that the years have been kind to the Zelda formula: Octoroks and Tektites on the world map, Bats, Skeletons and Wizrobes underground, Boomerangs and Arrows to throw about, Pieces of Heart to collect, Swords, Bottles, hidden passages, name it, it\u0026rsquo;s all here. I miss Dodongo though. :p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing to note about the Zelda series\u0026hellip; they\u0026rsquo;re really good with level design, and the use of space. The overworld of Minish Cap is a good example. The land of Hyrule is relatively smaller this time around compared to Link To The Past, but the game mechanics of having the ability to occasionally shrink to insect-size and the ability to unlock new areas with kinstone fusions mean you\u0026rsquo;ll be visiting most areas several times, making the most of the space. Of course, there\u0026rsquo;s the usual Zelda mechanics of passageways hidden by bombs, secrets accessible only with the use of tools, etc. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s just that I haven\u0026rsquo;t played a Zelda game for so long, but I\u0026rsquo;m just amazed at how much stuff they can pack into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe puzzles were ok, the usual block puzzles and stuff. Nothing too difficult, but not too easy either. I wish they had put some super-difficult puzzles for optional sidequests though. (The sidequests here mostly rely on collecting kinstones.) I think something along the lines of Lufia II\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;World\u0026rsquo;s Most Difficult Trick\u0026rdquo; would have been nice. I was particularly disappointed by the \u0026ldquo;walking\u0026rdquo; puzzles in the final dungeon, where you have to walk over a certain set of tiles continuously without repeating any tiles. The two such puzzles I encountered were straightforward. Why introduce that type of puzzle if it was going to be so easy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoss battles were ok, with some difficult ones being the Octorok in the Temple of Droplets, and any battle that needed me to split into four. I guess the clone battles would have been easier if I had gotten the \u0026ldquo;fast spirit bar charging\u0026rdquo; upgrade thingy. The final boss was moderately difficult, but then again I only had two bottles. With four bottles I might have started yawning. :p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was in college and had more free time, I would have surely completed everything there was in the game, but these days, I just finish it and be done with it. (Same with Star Ocean 3, I only managed to beat one optional dungeon and boss.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall Minish Cap is a good game, as I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure every Zelda is. The designers are still pretty good, not many boring parts in the game (the figurine thing was boring though\u0026hellip; mainly because the interface was so tedious.) Made me wish I had had a chance to play the N64/GC outings.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Not that I don\u0026rsquo;t like my PS2, the games are great and all. But think about how PC gaming will always be superior to console gaming because of compatibiliy.

This is why I like the idea of the GBA, even though I\u0026rsquo;ve never actually owned a gameboy. I see all these nice GBA titles around and I figure even if Nintendo releases a new GB-style handheld, it\u0026rsquo;ll be backward compatible and I can play those suckers!

I knew we had pirated copies of both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpiderman 2 \u0026ndash; failed. The PS2 wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even play the disc. Instead it made a wonderful churning noise that made me quickly hit the eject button. This is Sony\u0026rsquo;s best form of copy protection: In my experience, our PS2 can only play somewhere between 30% \u0026ndash; 50% of all pirated discs out there. I don\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026hellip; it may just be our PS2 model. Sometimes if I particularly like a game, I will buy 2-3 pirated copies until I find one that agrees with our PS2. This is why I have 3 copies of \u003ca href=\"/2005/01/games-star-ocean-till-the-end-of-time/\"\u003eStar Ocean: Til The End Of Time\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaruto 2 \u0026ndash; failed. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the disc. I tried searching through all the PS2 DVD cases we have, but I was unsuccessful. In the average pinoy techie\u0026rsquo;s house, there would be hundreds of audio CDs, VCDs, data CDs and DVDs, many of them pirated. Finding one specific disc outside of its case is a nigh-impossible task. Going out and buying a new (pirated) copy would be far easier \n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnotebase-1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf piracy is so problematic, why use pirated discs? Because frankly, the alternatives are roughly 10 times more expensive. At least. This is especially true for PS2 games; last I checked PS2 games retail for around 4000 pesos around here (more than 80 dollars) By comparison, PC games retail for roughly the correct dollar-equivalent prices. \n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnotebase-2\"\u003e[2]\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt should be noted that I have NEVER bought original PS2 games \n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnotebase-3\"\u003e[3]\u003c/a\u003e\n, while I have bought several original PC games. Not only that, but if things continue as-is, I will NEVER buy original PS2 or PS1 games, even though there are some games I would like to own originals of \n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnotebase-4\"\u003e[4]\u003c/a\u003e\n. The astute Pinoy gamer would note that the price of even PS1 titles is still roughly around 3000-4000 pesos, which makes no sense at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder what compels store owners to sell PS2 originals at these prices? Are there so many piracy-conscious console owners that they are able to fuel such a high demand for PS2 originals that result in high prices? Who buys at these stores?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t know why games (and digital media in general) have to be the same cost or more expensive in a third world country where people obviously have less money than developed nations. Of course, I am not saying we are entitled to lower prices because we are poor. But don\u0026rsquo;t companies who sell these consider that selling to citizens of developing nations at lower prices would be better than the zero sales caused by high prices/piracy combination?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the future, I may be more compelled to buy console originals online, especially if I can find good deals on used copies. Well, at least as soon as I become more confident about buying things online.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The latter parts start to get serious once the author gets to his college years; he goes into serious stories of dropping out of college, taking a vocational course and eventually becoming a teacher, where the book comes full circle (and a bit preachy as well).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book is hard to classify; it\u0026rsquo;s not exactly comedy, it\u0026rsquo;s not exactly serious. It\u0026rsquo;s more like the author kept a running blog since he was in grade school and published it all.
