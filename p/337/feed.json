However, in IE, the change event will fire every time you scroll rapidly through the combo box options using a mouse wheel. This is troublesome because it spams the server with requests, and there\u0026rsquo;s no guarantee the requests come back in the correct order, hence the client-side state may become inconsistent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, our previous workaround was that we would introduce a timeout to the change handler, such that it would wait a fraction of a second before actually dispatching the request. If in that short time, another change event comes in, we cancel the previous timeout and start a new one, thus preventing spamming multiple requests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, while this seems to be working, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit hackish and I\u0026rsquo;m wondering if there\u0026rsquo;s any better approach. Is there a different event we can hook to so that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t fire repeatedly when scrolling with the mouse? Or should we just disable mouse-wheeling altogether (onmousewheel=\u0026quot;return false;\u0026quot;)? Firefox does not seem to support mouse-wheeling thru combo boxes, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if disabling mouse wheeling is a serious usability no-no or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan anyone recommend other solutions?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAs you might have heard, there was a helluva storm in the Philippines yesterday, and I was pretty much stuck at the \u003ca href=\"http://whatwouldjtdo.blogspot.com/\"\u003eTitan Hobby Shop\u003c/a\u003e for most of the day. Luckily, that meant I get to play in the Zendikar prerelease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy Zendikar prerelease record: 1-3 =/ I had a decent pool and went with a UW build, but I played too loosely and the stars just weren\u0026rsquo;t aligned. My pool was very bad value-wise as well, having mostly \u0026ldquo;nice\u0026rdquo; rares like \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Lullmage%20Mentor\"\u003eLullmage Mentor\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Lorthos,%20the%20Tidemaker\"\u003eLorthos, the Tidemaker\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy sealed pool had \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Blade%20of%20the%20Bloodchief\"\u003eBlade of the Bloodchief\u003c/a\u003e, which I was a bit skeptical about, but it\u0026rsquo;s pretty good in a situation where you\u0026rsquo;re always trading creatures or you have lots of removal. It would probably be lots better in a vampire deck though. The Legendary Octopus was pretty good if you got to untap with it, obviously. I also had \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sphinx%20of%20Lost%20Truths\"\u003eSphinx of Lost Truths\u003c/a\u003e but it was never able to save me in time. The \u0026ldquo;loot 3\u0026rdquo; ability isn\u0026rsquo;t very good when you only have one card in hand, so you better make sure you have a lot of guys to hold the fort while you wait for the seven mana to kick it. \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sphinx%20of%20Jwar%20Isle\"\u003eSphinx of Jwar Isle\u003c/a\u003e is a lot better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to face \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sorin%20Markov\"\u003eSorin Markov\u003c/a\u003e in one game, and although he costs six, that first ability is a game breaker, especially against my U/W sealed, which had tons of small guys that easily get eaten by his vampire abilities. I lost that game T_T\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won only one pack (actually I won off a BYE \u0026gt;.\u0026lt;), and the pool was so bad, I sold off the pool and the prize pack (contained \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Bloodghast\"\u003eBloodghast\u003c/a\u003e) so that I could join a booster draft. Nothing else to do anyway!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI first picked a \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Verdant%20Catacombs\"\u003eVerdant Catacombs\u003c/a\u003e, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t get heavily into black. I got some late pick \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Bladetusk%20Boar\"\u003eBladetusk Boar\u003c/a\u003e and found myself settled into RG. I won the draft on the back of my special ability to mana screw opponents, and thus managed to salvage some prize packs from nowhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Zendikar, I\u0026rsquo;m still not sure what to make of Zendikar limited. If you get enough cheap allies you can make a blazingly fast deck. The best common ally is in white (\u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Kazandu%20Blademaster\"\u003eKazandu Blademaster\u003c/a\u003e), but I think it\u0026rsquo;s possible to build good curves using any color combination of allies, except possibly black which has no 2 or 3-drop ally. I had the red Ally that makes all your guys FTKs, but he never became relevant, six mana may be too high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Spire%20Barrage\"\u003eSpire Barrage\u003c/a\u003e was a nice late game finisher, obviously way better than \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Lava%20Axe\"\u003eLava Axe\u003c/a\u003e. Red seems ok in Zen limited as there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of common removal \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Burst%20Lightning\"\u003eBurst Lightning\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Inferno%20Trap\"\u003eInferno Trap\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Torch%20Slinger\"\u003eTorch Slinger\u003c/a\u003e and of course the aforementioned \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Spire%20Barrage\"\u003eSpire Barrage\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSealed is a lot slower than draft as usual; I was watching one sealed game where one guy managed to kick \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Rite%20of%20Replication\"\u003eRite of Replication\u003c/a\u003e, but he targeted \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Shoal%20Serpent\"\u003eShoal Serpent\u003c/a\u003e and hoped for the land drop next turn rather than target \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Kor%20Hookmaster\"\u003eKor Hookmaster\u003c/a\u003e to win the game on the spot. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t count on the big kicker spells for draft though, they might be too slow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Baloth%20Cage%20Trap\"\u003eBaloth Cage Trap\u003c/a\u003e is pretty good; people like to play their \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Trusty%20Machete\"\u003eTrusty Machete\u003c/a\u003es and \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Expedition%20Map\"\u003eExpedition Map\u003c/a\u003es early so you have a good chance for early beats. I had a \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Scute%20Mob\"\u003eScute Mob\u003c/a\u003e, but never had a good chance to play him. Maybe if I had a \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Vines%20of%20Vastwood\"\u003eVines of Vastwood\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, enough rambling now. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if I do well in the release events next week.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
