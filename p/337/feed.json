Not medieval fantasy or sci-fi or anything like that, but fantasy in modern-day settings. Neverwhere takes place in London, a place with which the author seems intimately familiar. Except that his fictional London is divided into two cities \u0026ndash; London Above, which is the normal everyday London, and London Below, a temming network of underground locations where people fall through cracks and disappear. Something like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur protagonist is an ordinary guy, who meets a resident of London Below, and is thereupon plunged into it\u0026rsquo;s mad, mystical world, where the familiar laws of reality seldom seem to apply. The plot is nothing extraordinary, one you may have read in some form or other: Our intrepid hero meets an interesting cast of unlikely allies and they band together on a quest, ultimately saving the universe. Something like that. It\u0026rsquo;s Gaiman\u0026rsquo;s writing that stands out though; his flowery prose and florid descriptions brings the fantasy world of London Below to life, presenting a striking contrast to the protagonist\u0026rsquo;s boring life in London Above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, a good read.

I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to be trying to get a phone. People have been harassing me for years about the fact that I don\u0026rsquo;t have a phone.

If there\u0026rsquo;s any better way or better place to look for the info than the way I describe here, tell me about it. 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, to find out what are the available phones and their features, I check the website of one of the major providers to see what handsets they list, since supposedly this tells me what models are available locally. FYI, I chose to use \u003ca href=\"http://www.smart.com.ph/SMART/Catalog/Handsets/\"\u003eSmart\u0026rsquo;s website\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, this helps me find phones which have features I like. But the Smart website only gives me prices offered by Smart when the phone is tied to one of their plans. Let\u0026rsquo;s assume I want a bit more flexibility and don\u0026rsquo;t want to be tied to the plan. I have no idea where to check the prices though, so I hit two auction sites instead: \u003ca href=\"http://ebili.com\"\u003eebili\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://bidshot.com\"\u003ebidshot\u003c/a\u003e, so I can get some idea what people are willing to pay for these models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEasy enough right? Check the features, cross-check the prices, choose a phone. Some notes on these websites:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmart: Why the hell is the list of phones not sorted in any logical order? None that I can see anyway. When I see a cheap, er, reasonably-priced phone on the auction sites, I want to check the features of that phone on the Smart website but it takes me a while to find it. Some sort of search feature would have been nice. (Or maybe there is one and I missed it?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEbili/Bidshot: Why the hell is the search result list not sortable in any way? If you have a grid of search results, I don\u0026rsquo;t see how difficult it is to implement sortable columns; every single webapp I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on has this feature! I was almost tempted to send them an email offering my services as a freelancer to implement reasonable searching features such as sorting and filtering. These are NOT difficult things to implement, I don\u0026rsquo;t know why we don\u0026rsquo;t see them in all websites; I can understand the performance concern if you\u0026rsquo;re potentially returning millions of hits (i.e. Google), but these searches have hits ranging in dozens, sorting performance hit should be minimal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is all, just wanted to rant.

It\u0026rsquo;s hard to stop!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn case you haven\u0026rsquo;t heard, World of Warcraft is Blizzard\u0026rsquo;s MMORPG take on it\u0026rsquo;s famous RTS series, and it\u0026rsquo;s one helluva good game. It looks excellent, the gameplay is terrific, people don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be assholes, etc. The only real downside is that it\u0026rsquo;s hard to stop playing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlizzard seems to have hit the sweet spot of the mythical RPG spiral: you always have that urge to go for one more creep, one more quest, one more level, and it repeats ad infinitum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s very hard to get bored with the game, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re a true-blue follower of the Warcraft series. You get to immerse yourself in famous locations and meet characters and heroes from the RTS games. You get to do quests, literally dozens of quests throwing themselves on you. You get to customize your character. You get to wander off to gather obscure ingredients. You get to interact with other players, challenge them, fight alongside them, raid whole cities with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve tried a few other MMOs before, and none really struck me so hard as WoW\u0026hellip; other games get you hopelessly stuck in the levelling \u0026ldquo;grind\u0026rdquo;, but WoW throws so much stuff to do at you that it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to forget about that level bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recommend the game to any serious gamer, even to those who primarily like single-player RPGs. Because honestly, you can play WoW just like a single-player RPG with a vast multitude of quests (except that you occasionally get some other characters helping you out randomly).

And lo, I was lucky enough to find a copy of the fifth book of Stephen King\u0026rsquo;s epic western fantasy, The Dark Tower. It was a huge book, larger than my copies of the first four, but with the same cover style and by the same publisher, so it was the copy I wanted. I spent less than a hundred pesos on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so it was that I once again journeyed into the world/s of the Dark Tower, following the path of Roland of Gilead and his ka-tet of gunslingers along the path of the Beam, heading inexporably towards the Dark Tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark Tower series has always been a weird sort of hybrid. Primarily a western, set in a fantasy multiverse which intersects with multiple versions of our own reality, Roland and his posse find themselves facing robots, bears, wizards, psychotic trains, undead and such. This time they face \u0026ldquo;Wolves\u0026rdquo;, an unknown new enemy who plague a farming community along the path of the Beam. Like any good RPG-party, the gunslingers decide to offer aid to the people of the Calla, though not all would accept their help. In exchange, they are granted the power to travel back to New York, the nexus of all New Yorks, where they must protect the Rose, an incarnation or manifestation of the Dark Tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one thing I did not like about this copy: It had illustrations. Normally, that would be a good thing, but I find I did not really want to know what Roland of Gilead looked like, even to another person, as it spoiled my own vision of what the book tells me. That\u0026rsquo;s how good the series is — it\u0026rsquo;s the type of series where you form your own version of it in your head and you are completely drawn into its saga.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs always, the book is dark and compelling. Despite the hectic work schedule last week, I finish the thick book in less than four days, and the volume ends in cliffhanger, as the ka-tet is broken. Two more books to go before the end of their quest; I can only hope the last two come out in my preferred format soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Even the normally apathetic Engineering students were being woken out of their political stupor by outrage at the turn of events by the Estrada-friendly senators. Everywhere you go in UP, people would be asking you if you were coming to the big rally on EDSA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday? Today, the conversations are like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Mag-gimik dapat kami bukas sa Makati eh\u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;May rally daw bukas ah?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Oo nga, bad trip nga eh\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s the biggest problem facing the power-hungry vultures looking for a quick way to oust Gloria. Right now, people just don\u0026rsquo;t care. At least not the people that matter, not the average middle-class joe too busy earning a living, yet not poor enough to be part of a hakot crowd. The current crisis has apparently not yet reached it\u0026rsquo;s breaking point, despite the calls from different sectors for Gloria\u0026rsquo;s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy not impeachment, which is a legal avenue made available by the 1986 constitution specifically for such situations? The opposition argues that it is an administration trap, that her allies would merely squelch the investigation. This is madness. The administration would not dare do such a thing, as they know full well the trigger of Erap\u0026rsquo;s downfall was the second envelope fiasco, and any similar attempt at whitewash would be too much of a risk. One of the reasons why not many people aren\u0026rsquo;t too enthusiastic about extraconstitutional methods \u0026ndash; they haven\u0026rsquo;t even tried the legal remedies yet.

When I first heard they were making a Fantastic Four movie, my first reaction was, \u0026ldquo;Uh\u0026hellip; that can\u0026rsquo;t be good.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plot is barely servicable\u0026hellip; the thing that really made me think \u0026ldquo;suxxor\u0026rdquo; was how Victor von Doom\u0026rsquo;s role was handled. I mean, in the comics, Doom was a monarch, ruler of Latveria. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t a madman bent on revenge. He was a madman bent on world domination!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the comics, Dr. Doom is like a machiavellian villain, craving for power, but never exposing himself directly to harm. He\u0026rsquo;d always get his minions to do dirty work for him, and just when the Fantastic Four thought they had him — damn, it was a Doombot all along! Curse you, Doom, you got away again! In the movie, Dr. Doom is like, \u0026ldquo;Holy crap, I\u0026rsquo;m bankrupt and Richards stole my girlfriend! I\u0026rsquo;ll use these newly-acquired non-canon cosmic powers to kick his ass! And maybe get into a punching contest with the Thing, or see if I survive a supernova.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother thing, the FF hardly do anything \u0026ldquo;heroic\u0026rdquo; here. The only time they really do a public service (the scene at the bridge) would have been avoided if the Thing wasn\u0026rsquo;t who he was. Yet, despite this, the people of New York (hm\u0026hellip; was it New York? Well, the Baxter Building was there, so\u0026hellip; ) easily accept them as heroes. This is ridiculous. Movie Spiderman did a whole lot of good deeds, but he received also a whole lot of crap before people started to realize he was a hero. And he\u0026rsquo;s just wearing a mask. What makes people think the people would so easily accept someone like the Thing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Thing is of course, the most tragic member of the FF, and a good part of the movie focuses on the problems caused by his transformation and his desire to find a cure. To compensate, he gets all the funny scenes, such as they are. There\u0026rsquo;s one that reminds me an old Simpsons joke: \u0026ldquo;Your fingers are too fat for this phone\u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best thing about this movie? The Fantastic Four are represented quite accurately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Edit 11-Jul-2005: Actually, the best parts were those involving the Thing and the Torch. Reed was pretty much what I expected, but Sue\u0026rsquo;s character was quite weak, and at some points Jessica Alba seemed uncomfortable with it. It can\u0026rsquo;t be helped though, as before Franklin was born, Sue Storm-Richards had the weakest character development in the comics, and her lacking role in the movie simply reflects that.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worst thing about this movie? Doctor Doom and the people of New York are not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best line in the movie?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s clobbering time.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Regarding this, we can only focus on those conversations which imply the President speaking directly to the man on the other end of the phone. With this in mind, I present the following excerpts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConversation between man and a woman on 29 09:43 hotel 2004\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: Hello\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: Hello, ma’am, good morning. Ok ma’am, mas mataas ho siya pero mag-compensate po sa\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLanao yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: So I will still lead by more than one M., overall?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: More or less, it’s the advantage ma’am. Parang ganun din ang lalabas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: It cannot be less than one M.?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: Pipilitin ma’am natin yan. Pero as of the other day, 982.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: Kaya nga eh\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: And then if we can get more in Lanao..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: Hindi pa ba tapos?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: Hindi pa ho, meron pa hong darating na seven municipalities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: Ah ok, ok.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe damning words in this excerpt come from the man named Gary: \u0026ldquo;Pipilitin ma\u0026rsquo;am natin yan.\u0026rdquo; (Liberal translation: We will try to make it happen) It implies that Gary was telling GMA that he would do something to manipulate the results to create a 1 million margin of votes. The observant reader should note that (a) GMA did not ask the man Gary to do anything. However, Gary implied doing something illegal which she should have spoken against; and (b) Any manipulation at this point does not seem aimed at stealing a victory, but rather making the victory appear to be a decisive victory\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConversation between Gary and an unidentified woman believed to be PGMA on 02 22:29 hotel June\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col start=\"4\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: Hello, ma’am. Good evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: Hello, dun sa Lanao del Sur at Basilan, di raw nagmamatch ang SOV sa COC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: Ang sinasabi nya, nawawala na naman ho?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: Hindi na nag-match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: Hindi na nag-mamatch? May posibilidad na hindi magmatch kung hindi nila sinunod yung individual SOV ng mga munisipyo. Pero aywan ko lang ho kung sa atin pabor o hindi. Dun naman sa Basilan at Lanao Sur, ito ho yung ginawa nilang magpataas sa inyo, maayos naman ang paggawa eh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: So nag-mamatch?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: Oho, sa Basilan, alam nyo naman ang mga military dun eh, hindi masyadong marunong kasi silang gumawa eh. Katulad ho dun sa Sulu, sa General Habatan. Pero hindi naman ho, kinausap ko na yung Chairman ng Board sa Sulu, ang akin, patataguin ko muna ang EO ng Pagundaran na para hindi sila maka-testigo ho. Na-explain na ho yung sa Camarines Norte. Tomorrow we will present official communication dun po sa Senate. Dun ho sa sinasabing wala hong laman yung ballot box. Na-receive\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eho nila lahat eh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: Oo, oo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: Tumawag ho kayo kanina ma’am?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: Yeah, about that Lanao del Sur at Basilan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: Iaano ko na lang ho, nagusap na kami ni Abdullah dun sa kwan kanina. About this, iaano ko ho, wag ho kayong masyadong mabahala. Anyway, we will take care of this. Kakausapin ko rin si Atty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacalintal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, the damning words come from the man named Gary: \u0026ldquo;Dun naman sa Basilan at Lanao Sur, ito ho yung ginawa nilang magpataas sa inyo, maayos naman ang paggawa eh.\u0026rdquo; (Literal-and-not-too-gramatically-correct translation: In Basilan and Lanao Sur, the increases they did for you, they were done well.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese two excerpts are the most important because, as far as I can tell, these are the only ones that imply the President\u0026rsquo;s direct knowledge of cheating done on her behalf. If they avoid, can get rid of, explain away or otherwise cancel out these two excerpts, GMA can easily avoid culpability from the rest of the transcript. For all we know, there could be some wacky explanation that has a small probability of being true. (\u0026ldquo;One million votes? No, we were talking about one million man-minutes spent counting the ballots!\u0026rdquo; — Okay, so I\u0026rsquo;m not very creative right now. Submit your own wacky explanation!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs she guilty of electoral fraud? Maybe. This tape at best constitutes what I believe to be called prima facie evidence. As we all should know by now however, wiretapped conversations are not admissible in any court of law in the Philippines. Not even in an impeachment trial, which is not really a court of law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome other notes on the tape:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere are two other known entities on the tape who can be convicted of electoral fraud. One is of course, the man known as Gary. The other is Robert Barbers. These are the most important people that need to come out and speak their side.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe man named Gary is obviously Comelec Commissioner Garcilliano, as he is explicitly named several times.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe phone being tapped was obviously Garcilliano\u0026rsquo;s, as his side is the participant in all conversations.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s all on this matter for now. I will raise more of my own opinions in a later post.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Even if you wanted to pick up new music, the only ones you\u0026rsquo;ll hear on the radio are the popular ones which you\u0026rsquo;ll likely hear from other people anyway.

The movie is less about Batman\u0026rsquo;s crimefighting adventures and more about Bruce Wayne\u0026rsquo;s journey from being a angry, confused rich orphan to the billionaire playboy/costumed vigilante popularized by the earlier films.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe movie captures the essence of Batman\u0026rsquo;s character perfectly. It\u0026rsquo;s all about fear — Bruce overcoming his fear of bats and eventually turning that fear into a symbol to strike terror into the hearts of criminals. The Batman here is nowhere near Joel Schumacher\u0026rsquo;s colorful crusader, or Adam West\u0026rsquo;s *Biff*Pow*Sock* type of action. This Batman is a true dark knight, striking from the shadows, unseen, terrifying. I can just imagine the rumors rippling through the underworld during the movie: the Batman is a terrifying monster; he can fly; he can command bats; he is darkness incarnate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two villains that appear in the movie \u0026ndash; Ra\u0026rsquo;s Al Ghul and Scarecrow \u0026ndash; complement the general fear and deception theme of the movie. Jim Gordon\u0026rsquo;s character is great, although it\u0026rsquo;s a bit weird for me to see Gary Oldman in the role. As for Katie Holmes, well, her character didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to have an important enough role from my point of view. Michael Kaine is a worthy Alfred Pennyworth, and this Alfred seems a bit more smartass than those that appeared in the earlier movies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, worth the watch. The tantalizing hint at the end of the movie suggests a sequel, but the question is, who will play the Joker?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, we watched in the new cinemas at SM North. Nice, everything seems a lot roomier and the seats were comfy. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to see what the comfort rooms were like as the movie had me glued to my seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

After some experimenting, I figure it out. \u0026ldquo;Next\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Previous\u0026rdquo; are based on the sort order in the list of messages. Since the default is sorted by date descending (newest first), \u0026ldquo;Next\u0026rdquo; corresponds to Yahoo\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;older\u0026rdquo; by default. Which is kind of hard to figure intuitively.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn the grid that lists mail messages, I wanted to test if the columns would wrap any words that were too long.

Apparently, the Yahoo ID \u0026ldquo;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345\u0026rdquo; was already taken.

I actually had to change the Outgoing name, which was set to the original account name. Why doesn\u0026rsquo;t it update the mail setting when I change the (global) Yahoo account setting?

As I suspected\u0026hellip; Yahoo compensates for the unwrappable words by expanding the grid cell, breaking the layout. This was a problem I encountered before in the webapps at workand I still don\u0026rsquo;t have a solution that would work in all browsers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m also interested in how popular webapps handle timestamping, so I try this out as well. For the uninformed, timestamping means handling the case where two people both try to edit the same record at roughly the same time. If there\u0026rsquo;s no handling, the person who updates first usually has his changes lost, without any notification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI try it out first with Yahoo Address Book and Notepad. Both experiments fail\u0026hellip; there\u0026rsquo;s no timestamping. I tested it by opening a record (Address Book entry/Notepad note) for updating in two separate Firefox tabs. I update one tab and save, then update the second tab and save. Changes made in the first tab are lost.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWell, I guess that\u0026rsquo;s okay, since technically, only one person at a time is expected to access these webapps. So I do something else. I create \u003ca href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/roytang/\"\u003ea Yahoo Group\u003c/a\u003e . I get two moderators, me and a dummy email account. I login with both accounts, using Firefox for one and IE for the other. I try to update the group description with one account, then the other. Bam! First guy\u0026rsquo;s changes are lost, without notification! If this were some sort of mission-critical webapp, that would be a dangerous bug.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m sleepy.

Is this still true today, with the advent of digital audio editing? Would people who edit conversations be able to create fake voices that accurately mimic the voiceprint of other people?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould there be a way to check if the recordings really have been altered? I don\u0026rsquo;t know if the mobile service providers routinely keep logs of phone calls\u0026hellip; but if they do, it should be easy enough to check the recordings against any originals logged by the phone company. Although I guess it would be optimistic to assume that even if they did keep recordings, they would be able keep all their tapes since June of last year. That would consume an awful lot of space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess that means this is really a wiretap. Of course, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to imagine how the term applies since mobile phones don\u0026rsquo;t have wires. I\u0026rsquo;m not really aware how one \u0026ldquo;taps\u0026rdquo; wireless technology. Does it involve some sort of interception of the communications? I would think such communications would be encrypted such that only the authorized recipients would be able to receive and decrypt them. But maybe that\u0026rsquo;s too much to expect\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",
