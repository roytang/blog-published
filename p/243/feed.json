There is very little banter as the Avengers take the fight to a threat from beyond this world. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how well Spider-man is going to fit in here, this looks to be an Avengers book that\u0026rsquo;s all about getting down to serious business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book starts with the core six Avengers from the recent Marvel movie but soon enough Captain America has to make the call to bring a larger roster into play. Based on the terrific design graphic at the start and end of the issue, we\u0026rsquo;re looking at a full roster of 24 Avengers, at least for the initial Avengers World story arc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#81664473092512808d3edf6f2684fe9e-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2012/12/pick-of-the-week-avengers-1-2012-12-08/avengers_hu1f2215385290af2c15e5d252248e52b2_1402774_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"81664473092512808d3edf6f2684fe9e-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2012/12/pick-of-the-week-avengers-1-2012-12-08/avengers.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"8 Dec 2012 3:49pm\"\u003e8 Dec 2012 3:49pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI have high expectations for Hickman\u0026rsquo;s Avengers run, and the first issue only serves to whet my appetite.

Writer Dan Slott is very excited for the last two issues of the Amazing Spider-man run and has been hyping it up.

But that may have been a product of reading too many preview pages so that basically the only surprise I got was the shock ending of what Red Skull was doing to Xavier\u0026rsquo;s corpse. The second issue felt a lot better though, there were some scenes that I felt were quite well-written - Havok receiving the old man\u0026rsquo;s thanks, the scenes with the mutants while watching Honest John\u0026rsquo;s broadcasts, how Rogue manages to escape her captors, etc. Also, how great of a villain name is \u0026ldquo;Honest John the Living Propaganda?\u0026rdquo; Heh. (I think he\u0026rsquo;s a new guy introduced by Remender, I can\u0026rsquo;t find any info from before this issue). I\u0026rsquo;m not a big fan of Cassaday\u0026rsquo;s artwork (which contributed to my being underwhelmed by the first issue) - it feels like he\u0026rsquo;s a bit hit or miss. There are some great panels here, but there are also some that are drawn strangely (Lilandra looks bald in one of the panels - that may have been a colorist problem though). Still, Remender\u0026rsquo;s writing more than makes up for the art, though I do hope Cassaday can keep to schedule so that the book doesn\u0026rsquo;t slip schedules too much (see: \u003cem\u003eAstonishing X-Men)\u003c/em\u003e, I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to where the Red Skull is taking is!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll-New X-Men #2 (Marvel)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#e4829a85d8af806dff2f15de299344bc-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/this-week-in-comics-2012-12-01/all-new-x-men-2-561_hudcc67953afc8cd2d65625691e23e992e_115800_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"e4829a85d8af806dff2f15de299344bc-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/this-week-in-comics-2012-12-01/all-new-x-men-2-561.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"30 Nov 2012 1:09pm\"\u003e30 Nov 2012 1:09pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI was quite excited for the second issue of Bendis\u0026rsquo; X-Men and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t disappointed.

Bendis is known for being a great dialogue writer and he doesn\u0026rsquo;t disappoint.

The book is still great and the art is spectacular. \u003cstrong\u003eFF #1\u003c/strong\u003e was okay, though I must admit to not being a big fan of Mike Allred\u0026rsquo;s art even though some people on the internet swear by it. Not really my Thing I guess. Heh. Still looking forward to where Fraction takes this book. \u003cstrong\u003eNew Avengers #34\u003c/strong\u003e is the end of Bendis\u0026rsquo; 232-issue run of Avengers books, and the ending kind of undoes some of the changes he\u0026rsquo;s made during that run. Which is fine, I guess it gives Hickman more space for his upcoming Avengers run. \u003cstrong\u003eX-Men Legacy #2\u003c/strong\u003e felt like it had just a bit too much of traipsing inside Legion\u0026rsquo;s mindscape, but at least we finally get to see some of the other X-Men (it\u0026rsquo;s not a solo book, right?) \u003cstrong\u003eX-Treme X-Men #7 \u003c/strong\u003eis still a terribly named book, and the art in this issue was a bit off for me.

The main draw for me is the artwork headlined by Rocafort; this issue\u0026rsquo;s pencils and coloring are great, especially with the level of detail. This issue gives us a bit more insight into Clark\u0026rsquo;s current status, especially vis-a-vis his pre-New 52 love Lois Lane. The rest of the book involve Clark and Kara getting beat up by a strange new visitor from their home planet, and it looks like Clark and Kara\u0026rsquo;s relationship isn\u0026rsquo;t going to get better anytime soon. This may be Kara\u0026rsquo;s new status quo for the New 52, maybe they want her be more stand alone from her famous cousin this time around. The issue doesn\u0026rsquo;t resolve the H\u0026rsquo;el on Earth storyline just yet, looks like we\u0026rsquo;re getting another round of this mini-event in the #15 issues of the \u0026ldquo;super\u0026rdquo; books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAquaman #14 (DC)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#84d93284b45ce7d0640a620aa6c242ed-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/this-week-in-comics-2012-12-01/Aquaman_14_Full2-665x1024_hu62f30e12f22401bbd153aadb7a83ca6b_296843_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"84d93284b45ce7d0640a620aa6c242ed-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/this-week-in-comics-2012-12-01/Aquaman_14_Full2-665x1024.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"30 Nov 2012 1:09pm\"\u003e30 Nov 2012 1:09pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a prelude to the \u003cem\u003eAquaman/Justice League\u003c/em\u003e crossover Throne of Atlantis that starts next month (DC has quite a few of these mini-crossovers going on, maybe in preparation for next year\u0026rsquo;s Trinity War?)  and gives us more information about Arthur\u0026rsquo;s New 52 origins.

This future was last seen in Batman #666 (pre-New 52, also written by Morrison). \u003cstrong\u003eTalon #2\u003c/strong\u003e was okay, though the art wasn\u0026rsquo;t very good for me. I like that the book basically giving DC a way to flesh out the Court of Owls after Snyder introduced them in Batman, but aside from that they\u0026rsquo;re going to have to grow Calvin Rose into his own character. \u003cstrong\u003eSavage Hawkman #14 \u003c/strong\u003ewraps up his crossovers with \u003cem\u003eGreen Arrow\u003c/em\u003e and Deathstroke, although everything is told in an unusual chronological order. They probably just put GA and Hawkman together as a prelude to their teaming up in the upcoming \u003cem\u003eJLA\u003c/em\u003e book. From this issue it looks like there are more Thanagarians on Earth than we expected - they were a pretty big deal pre-New 52 so who knows what they have planned for Thanagar these days. \u003cstrong\u003eTeen Titans #14\u003c/strong\u003e wraps up the Cassie origin story but to be honest it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like it resolved very much.

The creative team is science fiction writer Chris Roberson and renowned comic book painter Alex Ross, which means we\u0026rsquo;re in for an interesting and pretty good-looking series.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePanel of the Week - All-New X-Men #2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy favorite panel this week is when Iceman meets Iceman in All-New X-Men #2:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#a78176f9dfe2747befbe51b288ac21b7-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/this-week-in-comics-2012-12-01/iceman_hu966e83d4bf8cbe1be40d2b67ae8b37ae_1112560_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"a78176f9dfe2747befbe51b288ac21b7-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/this-week-in-comics-2012-12-01/iceman.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"30 Nov 2012 1:09pm\"\u003e30 Nov 2012 1:09pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n",
