I told him I didn\u0026rsquo;t believe such detailed rules shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be in the constitution \u0026ndash; that would unnecessarily tie us down to a specific model that we may or may not regret later on. I ended up declining to help him with his strange hobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eLegislative branch\u003c/strong\u003e are the a\u003cstrong\u003enalysts\u003c/strong\u003e. They make the detailed specs/laws to define how we\u0026rsquo;re going to satisfy the requirements/constitution. In a real project, the client usually signs off on the specs. In government, we supposedly sign off when we vote for the legislators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eExecutive branch\u003c/strong\u003e are the \u003cstrong\u003edevelopers\u003c/strong\u003e. They\u0026rsquo;re responsible for implementing the specs/laws in order to fulfill the requirements/constitution. They can decide the technical approach to use, as long as they satisfy the specs and the requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eJudiciary\u003c/strong\u003e is the \u003cstrong\u003eQA\u003c/strong\u003e, they review the work of the developers/executive and make sure they\u0026rsquo;re following the specs/laws and adhering to the requirements/constitution. Sometimes they even have to review the specs/laws themselves to make sure they aren\u0026rsquo;t contradicting the requirements/constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes a project is so large and you need to form smaller subteams to specialize in different areas or modules. That\u0026rsquo;s called **Federalism. **Or maybe \u003cstrong\u003elocal government.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes one person handles specs, development and QA.

In theory at least, you choose the best people for the job. In government, who gets the job is determined by who is best at bamboozling the largest number of people to vote them in. Maybe someday we\u0026rsquo;ll get a meritocracy in government too, but until then I\u0026rsquo;m probably sticking to software development.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

And I had to proxy for her daughter\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003eninong\u003c/em\u003e and maybe give a few words on what it means to become an adult. My first two reactions were (1) wow I\u0026rsquo;m so old one of my batchmates has an eighteen-year-old daughter; and (2) what the heck would I know about becoming an adult? (I guess (3) was \u0026ldquo;oh, it\u0026rsquo;s a debut, so it\u0026rsquo;s formal and I have to dress up? I hate dressing up.\u0026quot;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong. I certainly consider myself an adult. But I have no idea when that transitioned happened. It\u0026rsquo;s not like when you turn eighteen you get some kind of brain implant that magically tells you how to live life and be independent and get a job and be responsible and do your taxes and all that stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf anything, I would say \u0026ldquo;becoming an adult\u0026rdquo; is a continuing task that keeps going on even when you\u0026rsquo;re nearing the big four-oh and beyond. I guess the zeitgeist is already aware of this though, given how we\u0026rsquo;ve coined the word \u0026ldquo;adulting\u0026rdquo;, which basically means doing stuff that makes you feel like an adult. Like going to the bank. Or signing contracts. Or even dressing up to go to a formal event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we were having dinner at the event, I jokingly said I should just give a message like \u0026ldquo;fake it til you make it.\u0026rdquo; I basically feel that\u0026rsquo;s what most of adulthood is: bumbling along until you figure out what the heck you\u0026rsquo;re doing. When you\u0026rsquo;re a kid you look up to the grown-ups who can go out and do anything they want and confidently do all these jobs and they know everything. But when you grow up you realize that\u0026rsquo;s not really how it works \u0026ndash; most of the time all the adults are struggling through life too, trying to figure out whatever thing they have to do that day, or even just trying to make it to the next paycheck. And you\u0026rsquo;re definitely going to miss being a kid. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s the sign that you\u0026rsquo;re already an adult, when you already miss being a kid?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ended up reading a few words from the actual \u003cem\u003eninong\u003c/em\u003e, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to give my own adulthood message. One of my other batchmates gave the debutante a copy of \u003cem\u003eThe Art of War\u003c/em\u003e as a gift, with the message that adulthood is basically warfare so she should be prepared. While I agree with that sentiment somewhat, I think for me the most important thing about becoming an adult would be learning to find your own voice and identity. That means figuring out what\u0026rsquo;s important to you and what values you hold. Being an adult isn\u0026rsquo;t easy, but knowing yourself in this way gives you a framework to guide you in your adulting decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
