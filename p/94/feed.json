I\u0026rsquo;ve only been here twice, but I could imagine myself living here for an extended period of time. It solves my top three problems with Metro Manila: overly hot weather, poor transportation options, and poor internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth visits I found the temperatures to be within the generally agreeable range of around 5-25 degrees celsius. The low end is slightly too cold, but manageable. Of course, I haven\u0026rsquo;t experienced actual Japanese winter, so it\u0026rsquo;s probably colder then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTransportation is great and easy! There\u0026rsquo;s like twenty lines of trains or such _(OK, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really count, but there\u0026rsquo;s a lot!) _and a lot of buses too. The great thing is that the trains and buses run on very exact schedules. At trains stations or bus stops you\u0026rsquo;ll see a list of times \u003cem\u003eto the minute\u003c/em\u003e telling you when the next train or bus will arrive. That kind of thing would be unheard of in Metro Manila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the downsides is that the train lines can get a bit confusing. They\u0026rsquo;re not all interconnected either \u0026ndash; there\u0026rsquo;s some lines that are part of the Tokyo Metro, while some are part of JR (Japan Rail), and so on. It can cause some confusion for example some places might have both a Metro station and a JR station, and they might not be connected. The staff are always very helpful in the train stations though, feel free to ask them how to get to a particular station. They will try their best to help even if their English isn\u0026rsquo;t the best. Most stations will also have helpful signage showing maps and routes and stuff, and the trains themselves will have announcers telling you what the next station is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#11d3f8bbfdd13f862ba1e9dae7e6c197-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2015/11/10154222289158912/_hu319931c2e543c418fa0fa1eb79b01977_85598_bd5d9f53df750d5f0e836fa32b6a9590.jpg\" alt=\"Even though most signs aren\u0026#39;t in English, they should be fairly easy to understand\" title=\"Even though most signs aren\u0026#39;t in English, they should be fairly easy to understand\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eEven though most signs aren\u0026rsquo;t in English, they should be fairly easy to understand (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"11d3f8bbfdd13f862ba1e9dae7e6c197-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2015/11/10154222289158912/12299236_10154222295183912_2882233159207648588_n_10154222295183912.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eEven though most signs aren\u0026#39;t in English, they should be fairly easy to understand\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"13 Jun 2017 1:30am\"\u003e13 Jun 2017 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2015/11/10154222289158912/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eFor paying your transportation fares, there\u0026rsquo;s a few options, but for me the best one is to use an IC card \u0026ndash; these are reloadable cards that you can use on any train or bus in Tokyo. _(I have no idea what IC means.) _You can get one at the airport when you arrive \u0026ndash; there\u0026rsquo;s two providers, it\u0026rsquo;s either Suica or Pasmo and you can reload them at any train station. There\u0026rsquo;s also an option to get a 2-day or 3-day unlimited metro pass, which is a great idea if you plan to travel around Tokyo many times within a short period, but it only works with Metro lines which can be a bit restrictive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInternet in Tokyo is obviously very good of course. If you\u0026rsquo;re staying at an Airbnb, try to get one that provides you with a mobile wifi unit you can use while wandering about. Being a tourist these days is a lot easier with internet, given google maps and similar apps.

            "title": "Review: Persona 5 (You Never Saw It Coming)",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eMy first Persona game was Persona 4 Golden on the Vita \u0026ndash; a fantastic game. After that I dived into Persona 3 Portable and eventually the spin-off games Persona 4 Arena (and Ultimax) and Persona Q on 3DS. So it was no surprise that one of the game releases I was most looking forward to this year would be the next numbered game in the series: Persona 5 on the Playstation 4.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike P4G before it, the focus is on the school life of a young man forced into a new environment, interspersed with some good old JRPG dungeon crawling. You meet a ragtag group of misfits and somehow band together to save all of Japanese society from itself. Or something to that extent. This is just an excuse to dump some screens of P5, so let\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"#resources\"\u003eget that out of the way\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe JRPG side streamlines a lot of the problems from P4G: the main story dungeons are hand-built JRPG style dungeons and there are save points in between to make dying not so much of a pain. Even on normal difficulty, I still managed to die a few times \u0026ndash; notably to those Angel enemies that tend to suicide when low on life. And they brought back Persona negotiation! I didn\u0026rsquo;t appreciate this too much in \u003cem\u003eShin Megami Tensei IV\u003c/em\u003e as it felt a bit obtuse there, but here the Persona\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;personality\u0026rdquo; is shown which makes it easier to figure out the \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be leading a team of thieves there\u0026rsquo;s also a bit of a \u0026ldquo;stealth system\u0026rdquo; while dungeon crawling. It\u0026rsquo;s not a very deep stealth system, basically just hide behind corners and ambush enemies to gain battle advantage. The only problem is that the camera and the controls don\u0026rsquo;t always agree with your stealth plans, and sometimes the wrong button press can lead you to disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Phantom Thieves story is okay, although most of the plot is telegraphed ahead of time. I kind of liked P4G\u0026rsquo;s big murder mystery where you had to figure out who among your confidants was a big ‘ol bad guy. Here in P5, it\u0026rsquo;s painfully obvious who sold you out, even if you hadn\u0026rsquo;t noticed his \u0026ldquo;mistake\u0026rdquo; early on. That being said, there is a surprise twist near the end that caught me by surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompared to P4G, Persona 5 comes out at the height of social media, so while I like the P4G\u0026rsquo;s battle theme a bit better, P5\u0026rsquo;s battle music has managed to become a meme of its own:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"\u003e\n  \u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WUWQFnC2zqU\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI must\u0026rsquo;ve seen this video at least 50 times now due to some of my friends (you know who you are).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing I dislike about the Persona series is that because of the time management aspect of the game, a lot of things are missable. Since I tend to play RPGs without any guides or walkthroughs the first time around, it\u0026rsquo;s problematic for me. This means that on my first run through I missed completing the Confidants/Social Links, even though when I started the run I told myself I\u0026rsquo;d prioritize them over other activities. Definitely need a second run for the platinum. (Of course, I have yet to platinum P4G either due to a mistake I made during the second run~)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion: Despite (or maybe because of?) it\u0026rsquo;s ridiculousness, Persona 5 is a great game. Story is tight, and the dungeon crawling has been streamlined a lot. That being said, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely not a game for everyone, mostly because of the style. If you dislike Japanese stuff or anime or anything turn-based, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely not for you. Go play Call of Duty or something. For everyone else, enjoy one of the year\u0026rsquo;s best JRPGs (sorry FF15!)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI haven\u0026rsquo;t been blogging too much recently. I got busy for a while and had to skip a few weeks, and then general laziness prevented me from resuming a regular posting schedule. (Hopefully that ends now.) Most of the time my ranting was on social media, which got me thinking: Is writing on your own blog still useful in this day and age of social media?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been blogging for a long time \u0026ndash; my archives say 2002 \u0026ndash; waaay before Facebook or even Twitter came around. If for some reason you felt like digging through my older posts you\u0026rsquo;d find that I kind of used the blog like Twitter or FB: I\u0026rsquo;d have some short posts, updates about what\u0026rsquo;s going on, share some links, and so on. These days we have social media for that, so why blog at all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, social media is a perfectly valid channel to post your thoughts obviously. But I feel like blogging serves a different purpose. And when I say blogging, I mean on a platform dedicated to blogging, preferably on your own server.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are the obvious differences/advantages of blogging:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBlogs are publicly accessible commentary. Contrast this with Facebook, which I use mostly for interacting only with family and friends. I sometimes make some FB posts public, but mostly on request because people want to share it. It would make more sense for me to have such content on the blog so that people can share it directly without me having to fiddle with post privacy settings on FB.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBlogs are long-form. Contrast this with Twitter\u0026rsquo;s post-length limitation and even Facebook where I also tend to spout out one-liners or short paragraphs. I like a blog post for longer, more detailed content. Twitter users use workarounds like the \u0026ldquo;1/N\u0026rdquo; format to post longer text content, but I\u0026rsquo;m not really a big fan of that.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA blog should contain your own content. Contrast this with almost all social media where your own content is interspersed with retweets, shares, reblogs, and so on.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBlogs are searchable, either using your internal search form (I have one on the sidebar!) or via Google search. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit annoying sometimes trying to scroll through your FB or Twitter timeline trying to find something.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe above point means social media posts feel a lot more\u0026hellip;  ephemeral, maybe? I consider blog posts a lot more \u0026ldquo;permanent\u0026rdquo;, while social media are more of \u0026ldquo;at this point in time.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBlogs are under your control. You\u0026rsquo;re not subject to someone else\u0026rsquo;s moderation. Of course that also means you\u0026rsquo;re on your own if you get DDOS\u0026rsquo;ed or such hehe. Well, there\u0026rsquo;s pros and cons of course.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou can still push your blog content to your other social media channels. I have systems set up to push my blog posts to Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, the various social media channels have their pros too, so I still use them for various purposes. \u003cem\u003e(I thought about splitting this blog post into two, but I literally just wrote about long-form content, so let\u0026rsquo;s try to justify that a bit!)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFacebook \u0026ndash; I use this mainly to interact with friends and family and for sharing family pictures. There was a thread on reddit a while back about how a lot of people recommend quitting FB (or even social media altogether) since it\u0026rsquo;s not good for your self-esteem to be always checking how other people are doing. I find that this is really only an issue for people who already have low self-esteem and feel a need to compare themselves to other people (I guess teenagers mostly?). I don\u0026rsquo;t have any such issues. I like seeing how my friends are doing even if they\u0026rsquo;re people I don\u0026rsquo;t see often anymore and it gives you good convo material when you randomly run into them. I also tend to share on FB things I know will interest my friends and family, or at least some subgroup of them: family pictures, tech stuff, hobby stuff (gaming/MTG/comics), cat pictures, puns, memes, etc. I try not to dive into public groups too much, since FB has a low barrier of entry, the content/discussion is not that good IMO. My public Facebook profile is \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stephen.roy.tang\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTwitter \u0026ndash; my twitter stream is public. I use it for interacting with strangers. (Sophie Turner never replied to me that one time!). Twitter has a higher barrier of entry compared to FB, so the discussion is a bit higher quality. When posting to Twitter, it\u0026rsquo;s typically a stream of consciousness thing for me \u0026ndash; I just randomly decide to post things. On FB I tend to filter myself a bit as I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be too spammy, but on Twitter, I spam away about what I\u0026rsquo;m doing. If I\u0026rsquo;m playing in a big Magic tournament I\u0026rsquo;ll probably be tweeting every round about my horrible misplays. I will oft tweet about games I\u0026rsquo;m playing, books I\u0026rsquo;m reading, and so on. Same philosophy applies to sharing/retweeting: it\u0026rsquo;s a lot more impulsive, I\u0026rsquo;ll just share anything that looks interesting. My twitter feed is basically my FB feed except with less pics of people I know and more random thoughts throughout the day. If that sounds like your kind of thing, my twitter profile is \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/roytang\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInstagram \u0026ndash; quick story about how I got an instagram account. I tried to create one but found out that someone had already registered an account using my email. Of course I went ahead and used password recovery to take control of the account. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t very active so he probably didn\u0026rsquo;t mind, although I think some of his followers still follow me lol. I mostly post pics of food, board games, sketches, or random things I buy. You can view my instagram \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/roytang0400\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReddit \u0026ndash; I use reddit more for content consumption. It can be shallow sometimes, but you can also find some good/witty/insightful convos. If I want to find some discussion about recent events or tv shows or movies, reddit is always a good place to look. The barrier to entry here is very high, so discussion tends to be higher quality than either FB or Twitter. \u003cem\u003e(Still lots of shitposting though, that\u0026rsquo;s the internet for you.)\u003c/em\u003e I don\u0026rsquo;t publicly acknowledge my reddit profile, but it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to find haha.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTumblr \u0026ndash; just random odds and ends. It\u0026rsquo;s not very important, but I do have it. I used to use it only to reshare tumblr content I found amusing, but these days I also push sketches and blog posts to \u003ca href=\"http://tumblr.roytang.net/\"\u003emy tumblr\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLinkedIn \u0026ndash; terrible! I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of LinkedIn, as it seems to be mainly a way to get harassed by recruiters who didn\u0026rsquo;t even bother reading my profile. Still, it occasionally has a use so I keep it around and update \u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/roytang/\"\u003emy profile\u003c/a\u003e sometimes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eQuora \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading Quora for a while now but recently also started answering questions every so often as a bit of writing practice.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTakeaways: Blogging is great, even if you\u0026rsquo;re already using social media. Try it out! Social media has its place too, but don\u0026rsquo;t let it control your life!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
