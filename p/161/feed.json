That is the same message that a significantly large abstention (although unlikely) could send - not saying it will, but it\u0026rsquo;s a possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not saying abstention is some magic thing that will send a message (although it\u0026rsquo;s a possibility if enough people do so), but that people shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be ashamed to abstain if they don\u0026rsquo;t find the options palatable. Even if your reason is something as simple as \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t decide\u0026rdquo;, that\u0026rsquo;s fine, your abstention still has meaning since it indicates that you consider none of the candidates outstanding enough to support\u003c/p\u003e\n",

One of them has been sketching. I\u0026rsquo;ve been drawing things for as long as I remember \u0026ndash; I have elementary and high school notebooks with more doodles and x-men drawings than there are notes. And even at work, I often find other meeting participants checking out the random sketches I had been absently doing while other people were speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started following this \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/sketchdaily\"\u003esubreddit SketchDaily\u003c/a\u003e. What they do is they have a bot post a daily theme (submitted by other users) and users post their sketches for others\u0026rsquo; comments. \u0026ldquo;Sketches\u0026rdquo; is a wide-ranging term here, submissionsÂ can be anything \u0026ndash; redditorsÂ will typically post sketches with a wide range of skillsets (some are beginners and some quite advanced) and mediums (some do real-life paper sketches or inked and colored drawings, others do digital stuff drawn on tablets or with photoshop).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you follow me on Instagram (\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/roytang0400/\"\u003e@roytang0400\u003c/a\u003e, it\u0026rsquo;s funny how I got that account, but that\u0026rsquo;s a story for another day), you know I\u0026rsquo;ve been posting my sketches for a bit more than a month now. I haven\u0026rsquo;t written a blog post in a while, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d post about this and maybe show a bit of how I do my sketches. I\u0026rsquo;m not super talented or anything, although I like to think I\u0026rsquo;m not a beginner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor March 15th, the theme posted on r/SketchDaily was \u0026ldquo;Lots of Dinosaurs\u0026rdquo;. I usually try to relate the theme to a pop culture thing I\u0026rsquo;m familiar with \u0026ndash; something from movies, TV or video games. Since I\u0026rsquo;m a big Transformers fan, my first instinct was to do a drawing of the Dinobots. I\u0026rsquo;m not good enoughÂ yet to do one from scratch, so I usually search online for an image to use as reference.

Maybe only a little bit. At this point I\u0026rsquo;ve already spent way more time thanÂ I normally do on this (I was already on one and a half hours, most days it takes me less than half an hour), so the I went ahead and submitted the above image to reddit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe above isn\u0026rsquo;t representative of what I do with all of the sketches. For one, this output is way more detailed than my usual ones. And the process varies slightly depending on what I\u0026rsquo;m drawing. I will usually always have the preliminary light-pencil sketch.Â Sometimes for drawing real-life people, I\u0026rsquo;ll want to doÂ an outline trace, which means overlaying the paper over an image I want to draw (usually on the iPad) and lightly tracing the outline with pencil. It feels a bit like cheating, but real-life faces are hard enough without it. Maybe someday I won\u0026rsquo;t have to do them anymore (although I\u0026rsquo;ve only traced like 3 sketches I think). And as mentioned, I don\u0026rsquo;t usually do the coloring \u0026ndash; and I probably won\u0026rsquo;t do it again, takes too much time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m still not sure how far I\u0026rsquo;m taking this hobby. I have no ambitions of becoming a professional or anything (a friend once commented he was scrolling through his instagram feed with famous artists like Leinel Yu and one of my drawings was interspersed and surprised him LOL), but like life, I\u0026rsquo;ll just see how it goes I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I\u0026rsquo;ve had a bit more free time recently, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been filling that time by starting up some hobbies (some old, some new). One of them has been sketching. I\u0026rsquo;ve been drawing things for as long as I remember \u0026ndash; I have elementary and high school notebooks with more doodles and x-men drawings than there are notes. And even at work, I often find other meeting participants checking out the random sketches I had been absently doing while other people were speaking.",
