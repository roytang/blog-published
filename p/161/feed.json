Not all fears have reasonable causes, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay. To overcome fear you do not need to rationalize it, you only need to confront it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically you need to start confronting this fear in small doses. It\u0026rsquo;s best if you have friends you can count on and that are aware of your fear and willing to help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePractice being comfortable around small groups of people first. Try taking the bus to/from school or work, if possible. Better if you can ride the bus with a friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo your shopping errands at different grocery stores, find one where you feel slightly uncomfortable with the amount of people there and do your grocery shopping there for a while. When you get used to it, look for another grocery store that might be more difficult for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBring a friend when you need to navigate through a large crowd (say, at the shopping mall or such). Having a friend along will make you a bit more comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePractice small talk. Say hi to the cashier at the grocery store, or the bus driver on your way to work. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to think of anything else to say beyond \u0026ldquo;Hi, how are you doing?\u0026rdquo;. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry if you have trouble responding, just smile and try again next time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood luck!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit: You don\u0026rsquo;t always need to be outgoing and confident! It\u0026rsquo;s perfectly acceptable to sometimes want to curl up in bed all day and stay away from people :)\u003c/p\u003e\n",
