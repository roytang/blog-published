Here\u0026rsquo;s my Scars of Mirrodin prerelease report!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first hour was spent waiting in an unbearably hot basement area for the 8th player on our table to register his sealed pool. What? yeah, he was late, and the event started early so the airconditioning was not yet on. Sad face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pool I registered was terrible, no money rares and felt a bit short on playables, but the pool I got passed was better (not really in terms of constructed \u0026ldquo;value\u0026rdquo; cards, but pretty good in terms of playability). I think Scars limited lends itself well to monocolor decks with vast majority of the support provided by artifacts, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t just had dragon-class bombs in separate colors, so black-red it was.

In game one neither of had much gas and had to resort to trading blows with our 1/1 mana myrs, but I pulled out ahead after he drew too many lands and I had 3 mana myrs to clock him with. Game two, he tapped out for \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Saberclaw%20Golem\" target=\"_new\"\u003eSaberclaw Golem\u003c/a\u003e and I was thinking of taking it out with a non-boosted G-Blast, but for some reason thought it would be better to do so on his turn. Of course when he untaps he already has \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Stoic%20Rebuttal\" target=\"_new\"\u003eStoic Rebuttal\u003c/a\u003e ready, a card I already saw in game one and hence should have been aware of! I went on tilt a bit and subsequently blocked the Golem looking to trade creatures, but then he just smiled and paid the red mana to give it first strike. Facepalm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did the mental Saito faceslap and toughened up my focus for game three. I stayed in control all game, making only a minor mistake of unnecessarily untapping the \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Rust%20Tick\" target=\"_new\"\u003eRust Tick\u003c/a\u003e at one point, but was well ahead in life totals anyway and finished him off with 2 \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Galvanic%20Blast\" target=\"_new\"\u003eGalvanic Blast\u003c/a\u003es.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo anyway I fail to make 4-0 for the nth time in a row. I haven\u0026rsquo;t 4-0\u0026rsquo;d since Time Spiral I think. It\u0026rsquo;s fine, Prereleases should be very casual events anyway so I have a tendency to maybe play a bit looser than I would at a PTQ for example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrize packs did not contain anything exciting. Well, a \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Genesis%20Wave\" target=\"_new\"\u003eGenesis Wave\u003c/a\u003e but that\u0026rsquo;s more of a fun, casual card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTLDR\u003c/strong\u003e; Went 3-1 at my local Scars of Mirrodin Prerelease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExtra discussion topic\u003c/strong\u003e: A friend and I were talking about how newbie-unfriendly Prereleases can be, even though it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be pretty much a \u0026ldquo;casual affair\u0026rdquo;. There are always a bunch of guys who are at their first sealed event and they take a while to register, and a lot of them don\u0026rsquo;t know that the registered pool won\u0026rsquo;t necessarily be the one they\u0026rsquo;re going to play and get to take home. And where I play, most of the Prereleases will have the local \u0026ldquo;sharks\u0026rdquo; playing, they will usually play multiple flights. I try to keep a friendly atmosphere, but many of them are always dead serious even though it\u0026rsquo;s just a prerelease, making new tournament players or young kids a bit nervous. Of course it has to be that way because there are prizes on the line, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy friend suggested a separate type of prerelease event where entrants are guaranteed some small token prizes (maybe two packs), regardless of their win-loss record, and some trophy prize (like a t-shirt) for going undefeated. Rules enforcement might be looser \u0026ndash; maybe no longer requiring deck registration or pool swaps. This would make it more casual and less appealing to \u0026ldquo;sharks\u0026rdquo;, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how popular it would be. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking maybe we need some more casual events here like gunslinging or Intro Pack duels thing that WOTC staff sometimes talk about \u0026ndash; we don\u0026rsquo;t usually have that sort of thing in local events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, we couldn\u0026rsquo;t come up with a clear solution to make Prerelease events easier for new guys, but it\u0026rsquo;s worth a thought, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n",
