I should remind myself to do this whenever I find books that sound interesting)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about new projects all the time: game dev ideas, app ideas, programming projects, plot ideas for a novel, and so on. Very few of them go on to completion or at least some version of production. Some reasons I\u0026rsquo;ve had difficulty finishing side projects:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI tend to start losing interest when I come across the boring parts of a project or parts I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do. Some examples are UI/design, or promo work/sales/marketing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI might also be overwhelmed by how much work there is that needs to be done. I understand making breaking down the work into a list and then just choosing one task at a time until you get something done. Hmm, I guess sometimes doing the work breakdown is one of the things that falls under the first bullet\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esometimes I might also be frustrated by a lack of technical skill in implementation. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking this applies mostly to stuff like writing or drawing, where I feel like my execution or creativity isn\u0026rsquo;t good enough. This frustration can be overcome by practice, but practice risks the first bullet again\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esometimes I\u0026rsquo;ll also lose motivation if the project turns out too difficult or too time-consuming, as if it\u0026rsquo;s not worth the effort. This can be a legitimate reason for dropping a project, as long as I make sure my assessment is rational.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOne of my main problems seems to be that I\u0026rsquo;m easily distracted by new, shiny ideas that come along. That\u0026rsquo;s why reading this comic felt a bit like a personal attack:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.redd.it/48lvp1vv4p121.jpg\" alt=\"\"\u003e via \u003ca href=\"https://reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor\"\u003e/r/ProgrammerHumor\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do have the ability to go into hyperfocus and gain the flow, enough to immerse myself in what I\u0026rsquo;m doing, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t always last, and it\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a double-edged sword, because if something else grabs my attention, there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance I\u0026rsquo;ll hyperfocus on that. (Another edge being of course, I can be so hyperfocused in burns me out).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Slight tangent: When I\u0026rsquo;m in a team project, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty good at getting things done, because (a) there\u0026rsquo;s usually someone else holding me to account and making sure stuff gets done; and (b) there\u0026rsquo;s usually team mates to help take up those parts that I find uninteresting.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t list plain old laziness among the reasons above, though I\u0026rsquo;m surely guilty of that. But I think usually laziness is a symptom of one of these other reasons and me making excuses for not getting stuff done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of these are some demons I need to tame if I really want to become more independent; I guess at least recognizing them is key and compensating for them where necessary, and making sure I only drop projects if I\u0026rsquo;m convinced they\u0026rsquo;re not worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoincidentally relevant webcomic:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003einspiration strikes \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/qihgd0Q8to\"\u003epic.twitter.com/qihgd0Q8to\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u0026mdash; the Awkward Yeti (Nick Seluk) (@theawkwardyeti) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/theawkwardyeti/status/1070082567402110977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eDecember 4, 2018\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e \u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e ",

Instead of people you interact with regularly rating you, it\u0026rsquo;s now some faceless bureaucrat who might have an agenda. At least if it\u0026rsquo;s people, you might be able to cozy up enough to other people to get your rating back up.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehow would you opt out? In the Black Mirror episode, the protagonist\u0026rsquo;s brother was the type of person who didn\u0026rsquo;t care about social status so the ratings didn\u0026rsquo;t affect him. In a system administered by the state and applied universally, you have no choice. Well, I guess you can still be all \u0026ldquo;meh, I don\u0026rsquo;t care\u0026rdquo; and just don\u0026rsquo;t avail of the benefits unlocked by higher ratings, but since it\u0026rsquo;s the state promoting this, it\u0026rsquo;s likely the scope where the ratings matter will only become larger with time\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy is the idea of a rating system inherently creepy? People judge other people all the time. We judge other people by how they look, the clothes they wear, how they behave, where they went to school, what job they have, what kind of car they drive, and so on. And people often do change their own behavior to influence how others judge them. In certain countries, they already have financial rating systems that allow companies to judge you based on your credit history. It\u0026rsquo;s simply a factor in how human societies work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think having a numeric rating system for social behavior feels so off because it attempts to quantify something that we understand to be inherently subjective, and attempts to impose that standard rating system indiscriminately. And a rating attached to each person universally feels like it would be very difficult to shake off. If someone judges you based on your looks or your clothes you can always change them. If all the people in your neighborhood dislike you, you can always move to a new area. But if there\u0026rsquo;s a quantitative rating attached to you in some centralized database somewhere? People who don\u0026rsquo;t know you can judge you instantly, even if they\u0026rsquo;ve never heard of your past indiscretions. The rating would follow you around where ever you go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least financial credit systems are there to promote good financial decisions (since they are used to judge your credit risk). China\u0026rsquo;s social credit system looks like it\u0026rsquo;s designed to promote obedience to the state or adherence to state-preferred behavior, which means reduced freedoms. One can only hope such an experiment fails and does not propagate to other more democratic-leaning countries, but given the recent worldwide trends, I am not too hopeful.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Starting in October I had a bit more free time so I decided to fire on all cylinders again. Instead of the previous 1-2 posts per week I was going for in 2016, this time I would go for posting every day. Not even every weekday, but seven days a week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried this, as an experiment, back in \u003ca href=\"/2006/10/i-will-blog-every-day/\"\u003eOctober of 2006\u003c/a\u003e, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t last the month with the habit (though I did continue to post regularly for the next few years).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is kind of secondhand-blog-linking, but the post [Seth Godin Explains Why You Should Blog Daily] (\u003ca href=\"https://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/seth-godin-explains-why-you-should-blog-daily\"\u003ehttps://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/seth-godin-explains-why-you-should-blog-daily\u003c/a\u003e) explains well the advantages of posting daily:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Everyone should write a blog, every day, even if no one reads it. There’s countless reasons why it’s a good idea and I can’t think of one reason it’s a bad idea.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;If you know you have to write a blog post tomorrow, something in writing, something that will be around 6 months from now, about something in the world, you will start looking for something in the world to to write about. You will seek to notice something interesting and to say something creative about it. Well, isn’t that all we’re looking for? The best practice of generously sharing what you notice about the world is exactly the antidote for your fear.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSeth Godin\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first fear of course, is: do I actually have enough material, enough stuff to write about on a daily basis? The article above mentions that the mere act of committing to daily writing means you will naturally tend towards notcing more things and having more opinions and thus more things to write about. But I was skeptical, since I had tried the regular writing before and it didn\u0026rsquo;t really stick. One thing that helped however was that since 2016 I\u0026rsquo;ve been regularly listing down blog post ideas. I got this idea from \u003ca href=\"https://jamesaltucher.com/2014/05/the-ultimate-guide-for-becoming-an-idea-machine/\"\u003eJames Altucher\u0026rsquo;s post about becoming an idea machine\u003c/a\u003e where he recommend\u0026rsquo;s thinking of 10 ideas daily. I did start out writing 10 blog post ideas every day, but that tapered off after a while because I was only posting a couple of times I week, I had far too many ideas!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot all of those ideas would be good enough to be posts of course. I wrote up a few posts first, creating a buffer of posts that could be scheduled in advance. I started posting daily on the second week of October, and have kept it up since, I\u0026rsquo;m at more than 60 posts now, so the habit has already stuck longer than the last attempt. I find that between the long list of post ideas I already had (some 600+ in total), \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/benefits-of-walking/\"\u003emy daily walks\u003c/a\u003e and the fact that \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/expanding-horizons/\"\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m a voracious internet reader\u003c/a\u003e, it was actually quite easy to maintain a continuous stream of posts to write.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t spend too much time on each post, maybe 30 minutes at most, sometimes much less. On a good day I can knock off up to five posts. I find that most of my recent posts clock in under 1,000 words, which I think is perfectly reasonable. I think my increased participation in internet debates back during the 2016 election period also made me more willing to post opinions online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re writing to become a \u0026ldquo;professional blogger\u0026rdquo; of some sort, or otherwise trying to optimize for engagement or such, \u003ca href=\"https://smartblogger.com/posting-every-day/\"\u003edaily posting might not be such a good idea\u003c/a\u003e. The front page of this blog changes every day, and I don\u0026rsquo;t have a search function at the moment, so it\u0026rsquo;s not straightforward to find something you miss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI of course write mostly for myself, though I do appreciate it when I find out people are reading the blog. I prefer posts that I can look back to in a few years to remember what was going on with me at the time. I try to write about things I\u0026rsquo;m doing, shows I\u0026rsquo;m watching, projects I\u0026rsquo;m trying out, games I\u0026rsquo;m playing, opinions on current events, and generally random thoughts going through my head and so on. I find that the daily writing, like the daily walking, helps improve my thinking processes. And it often encourages me to be a bit more experimental - I can try things out and even if I fail, the floor is that I have a story for a blog post. There is also less pressure for new posts to be super deep or meaningful or otherwise with my daily blogging, there is no room for perfectionism to get in the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t know how long I can keep this up on a daily basis. I\u0026rsquo;ll try to revisit this after a year maybe to see how far I\u0026rsquo;ve gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThe other day \u003ca href=\"/2019/11/daily-walks/\"\u003eI wrote about how I\u0026rsquo;ve been walking on a regular basis recently\u003c/a\u003e. While the regularity and the tracking are fairly recent, I\u0026rsquo;m actually not that much of a stranger to walking as an activity. Even back when I was in high school I would often walk all the way home instead of taking the bus-and-jeep commute route I was supposed to take. It didn\u0026rsquo;t take that much longer, and I often enjoyed the solace (and I got to save a bit of money, even as a child I was quite frugal~). In college, I would regularly walk the couple of kilometers between classes, or from the campus itself to Philcoa. Sometimes, when it was especially hard to commute, I would walk through UP/Teacher\u0026rsquo;s/Sikatuna Village all the way back to our old home in Kamias. I remember doing this once during the aftermath of a terrible storm when there were no jeeps around to take me home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven back then, walking for me was kinda therapeutic. Like I said, I enjoyed the solace. I would often stop at some places and just be at peace for a while. I wrote about this once in an \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/10155666240078912/posts/10152788551883912\"\u003eold facebook post\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a place at the corner of East Avenue and BIR Road in Quezon City. When I was young I would walk to that intersection and wait there to catch a jeepney ride that would take me home. It was often easy to get a ride, no more than a couple of minutes wait. But sometimes I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t flag down a jeep immediately. I would sit there at the base of the lamp post at the corner of East Avenue and BIR Road, and let the noise of the world wash over me for some time. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember contemplating anything specific while I was there or whether I had worries or was sad. I would just sit there and be peaceful and the world would move around me and I would watch the people and the cars pass by and wonder who they were or where they were going. After a while the trance would break, and I would fall back into the real world and tell myself I had to get home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, a side note, checking Google Maps now, that route\u0026rsquo;s distance was a measly 3.7km, a couple of km shorter than my average walking routes these days. Back then it felt like I was walking a lot!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I started working in Ortigas, there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much opportunity for regular walking. I almost always walked the short distance from the office to Megamall, unless it was raining or insanely hot. When traffic was really bad and it was difficult to get a bus ride or a taxi, I sometimes took the opportunity to walk from Ortigas to Cubao, or vice versa (Distance: somewhere around 5-6km). I often said to myself that someday I would walk the whole 13 or so km home, but I never did get that chance. Occasionally I would get deployed to another country for work, and when I did one of the things I would do during my nights there would be \u003ca href=\"/2009/03/sometimes-you-just-go-where-your-feet-take-you/\"\u003eto walk around a lot\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days, as I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned in the other post, I intentionally try to find the time to walk. I don\u0026rsquo;t always find it, but I do most of the time. It\u0026rsquo;s an additional way to burn off stress. When I\u0026rsquo;m feeling angry or frustrated or sad (usually about work-related things), I say to myself, it\u0026rsquo;s time for a walk. And it helps me think. My mind wanders as I walk, coming up with ideas or solutions to problems or unlocking new thoughts or awakening slumbering areas of my brain or just overall improving my creativity. Walking is also a way of being in the present, leaving behind your worries and anxieties and simply taking in the world. I intentionally don\u0026rsquo;t pace myself too quickly lest the walk end too soon, although I am often impatient to get back home. I find walking is quite good for developing patience as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe philosopher Henry David Thoreau said of walking:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think that I cannot preserve my health and spirits, unless I spend four hours a day at least—and it is commonly more than that—sauntering through the woods and over the hills and fields, absolutely free from all worldly engagements. You may safely say, A penny for your thoughts, or a thousand pounds. When sometimes I am reminded that the mechanics and shopkeepers stay in their shops not only all the forenoon, but all the afternoon too, sitting with crossed legs, so many of them—as if the legs were made to sit upon, and not to stand or walk upon—I think that they deserve some credit for not having all committed suicide long ago.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour hours a day seems excessive of course. I have other things to do. And unlike Thoreau, I don\u0026rsquo;t have the benefit of having nearby woods or hills or fields to saunter through. Mine is more of an urban jungle. But I\u0026rsquo;m not much of a naturalist anyway (biology was always my weakest science), and I find there is still much to see as I walk through Metro Manila\u0026rsquo;s uneven streets. People rushing by. Small businesses I hadn\u0026rsquo;t noticed before. A large franchise restaurant that\u0026rsquo;s often empty. A couple quietly holding hands in the dusk. Too many politicians\u0026rsquo; posters. The endless traffic. One time a biker almost got run over by a car. He managed to jump off the bike and landed right beside me on the sidewalk. Sometimes I feel I\u0026rsquo;m not observant enough, I should take more opportunity during these walks to observe more things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSide note: another extra benefit of all this walking is that my sense of distance has improved. I now generally have a sense of roughly how far a kilometer is. This is why I was able to recognize that Manhattan can\u0026rsquo;t be 4km from top to bottom in \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/game-review-marvels-spider-man-for-ps4/\"\u003emy Spider-Man PS4 review\u003c/a\u003e. I walk more than that distance daily!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can see, there are many benefits to walking. So, what are you waiting for? Go take a walk!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The best puns are so terrible and so great at the same time.

My dad used to do this a lot when we were kids (this might explain a lot!). He would say something like \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to go to Taco Beach!\u0026rdquo; because Taco Beach sounds like \u0026ldquo;takubets\u0026rdquo; which is 80s style slang for \u0026ldquo;kubeta\u0026rdquo;, meaning the toilet. (I have never heard anyone else refer to the toilet this way!) Another pun that I got from him was \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the Tagalog for \u0026lsquo;tweeter\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;? Back then, the word tweeter didn\u0026rsquo;t actually get used a lot, but in modern times, I changed it to this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n    On \n    \u003ca href=\"/2009/05/1872502526/\"\u003e\u003ctime datetime=\"2009-05-21 16:21:37\"\u003e21 May 2009 4:21pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n    I wrote:\n    \u003cblockquote\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eRT \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/roytang/\"\u003e@roytang\u003c/a\u003e: ano sa tagalog ang twitter? -\u0026gt; A: \u0026ldquo;Mat matamit\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI wish I had more puns to share here right now, but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to remember them. When I release a pun, it passes from my brain to the world and it belongs to the universe now. In hindsight, maybe whenever I posted a pun, I should have included some kind of hashtag. In my opinion, puns are a gift to the world. They inspire you to think creatively, and being used to making puns developer your wit. Because they are a gift to the world, whenever you think of a pun, it is your responsibility to unleash it upon the world, no matter how terrible you think it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#10a797a99cc4b5ca9bf95cd0b1724bf2-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/no-puns-left-unsaid/no_pun_intended_hubfc0760e5e49ef1b4a3653cef51ec6ab_97946_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"10a797a99cc4b5ca9bf95cd0b1724bf2-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/no-puns-left-unsaid/no_pun_intended.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"1 Dec 2018 1:59am\"\u003e1 Dec 2018 1:59am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll play Fire Emblem Fates just to see this dialogue lol)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePun with intention!

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eSome things I\u0026rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason, I watched two biopics this month. The first one is \u003cstrong\u003eHidden Figures\u003c/strong\u003e, about three black women who were instrumental during the early days of NASA leading up to the Friendship 7 mission piloted by John Glenn. The movie is fairly interesting if you are even remotely interested in either the challenges faced in black history or math and science or the early days of the space program competition between the USA and Russia. It feels even more appropriate to have watched this since it helps me appreciate the recent Insight mission. (The Oatmeal has \u003ca href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/comics/insight\"\u003ea fun preview of this event\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second biopic was \u003cstrong\u003eBohemian Rhapsody\u003c/strong\u003e. This was a magnificent film, both for the music and the Freddie Mercury story. I guess it appeals more to those who are familiar with Queen music though. I\u0026rsquo;ve read that the movie isn\u0026rsquo;t super accurate especially with regards to the timeline, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s fine. Both the liberties they take and the music serve to construct a compelling narrative. The movie ends with a ten-minute recreation of the 1985 Live Aid concert and they do a good job of communicating the insane energy at Wembley Stadium back then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn less-biographical movies, I also watched \u003cstrong\u003eTeen Titans Go To The Movies\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of Teen Titans Go, it\u0026rsquo;s way too silly and it\u0026rsquo;s obviously for kids, I much preferred the previous Teen Titans series. I only got a copy of this movie because my niece said they watched this all the time back home, so now they can watch it when they\u0026rsquo;re over here either. I did enjoy the ridiculous plot and the Stan Lee cameo, but this isn\u0026rsquo;t something I would have watched in the theatre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn rewatch land, since I finished the Spider-Man PS4 game lately, I also watched \u003cstrong\u003eSpider-Man 2\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eSpider-Man 3\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eAmazing Spider-Man\u003c/strong\u003e, they\u0026rsquo;re nice movies to have playing in the background while you\u0026rsquo;re working on other stuff. \u003ca href=\"/2004/07/movies-spiderman-2/\"\u003eTobey 2\u003c/a\u003e was pretty good and I think it aged well, I\u0026rsquo;d say comparable with Tobey 1 even. \u003ca href=\"/2007/05/spider-man-3/\"\u003eTobey 3\u003c/a\u003e was trying to do way too much what with Venom and Sandman and Harry-Goblin. Andrew 1 had a lot of potential, but I think this series leaned too much into the dark and mysterious and sinister plot route.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTV-wise, nothing much other than the usual superhero series, though I\u0026rsquo;m still behind on Gifted and Doctor Who. I caught Trevor Noah\u0026rsquo;s new Netflix special, it was okay, but too exceptionally. Netflix also added a couple of \u0026ldquo;best of\u0026rdquo; seasons of Jeopardy which I thoroughly enjoyed. Watching these makes me think I\u0026rsquo;d never be able to win an episode of Jeopardy, but of course I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s fair to compare myself to some of Jeopardy\u0026rsquo;s all-time champions.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

(Actually, this is mainly an excuse to write down a story about how stupid I am.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, yeah my bro got me a Fitbit. Or maybe I paid for it. I don\u0026rsquo;t really recall. The point is, I had it and I\u0026rsquo;ve been using it regularly for the past year and a half. It\u0026rsquo;s a great little gizmo, not only do I use it for step counts, but it also lets me track how much sleep I\u0026rsquo;m getting (which is why I know how rare a regular continuous 8-hour sleep is for me, even when I\u0026rsquo;m not working). I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of measuring my own data for self-improvement purposes so I like it. Conveniently, it also works with \u003ca href=\"http://ifttt.com/\"\u003eIFTTT\u003c/a\u003e, so I have an applet that exports my daily data to the a Google Sheets for easy reference. In theory I could also use the Fitbit to track stuff like my food intake and weight, but those don\u0026rsquo;t happen automatically so I don\u0026rsquo;t. Maybe someday. The fitbit itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t use too much battery and has an Android app that syncs with the device via bluetooth (so I have bluetooth on all the time now).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne minor nitpick I have is that it my wrist doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to like the fitbit too much, after a while I realized it was growing darker where I wore it. My brother suggested maybe I was wearing the wrist strap too tightly. After this realization, I sometimes started wearing it on the other wrist when I felt like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, on to the stupid story! About 4 or 5 months after i started using the fitbit, this happened:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#7df3d189d76ff9003b27de0f3f2855f3-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/review-fitbit-charge-2/fitbit1_hua16e6a31c539de7e411e63f564ba5e77_70551_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"7df3d189d76ff9003b27de0f3f2855f3-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/review-fitbit-charge-2/fitbit1.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"29 Nov 2018 2:06am\"\u003e29 Nov 2018 2:06am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOh noes! Normally you can just snap the strap part back into place, but this time something had come off and it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t stick back. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to spend money on a replacement strap, so in a brilliant move that I would surely never regret, I glued it back into place with Mighty Bond. This worked well! The strap held in place and I could now use the fitbit again without worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFast-forward another seven months or so later, and now the strap on the other side came off too! AND around the same time, my charger thingy fell apart as well, and I could not put it back together! Oh noes! Was this the end of my fitbit experiment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily it turns out a friend owned an online shop that could get me a replacement strap and charger for a good price (check out \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Activstylephl/\"\u003eFitbitManila on Facebook\u003c/a\u003e if you\u0026rsquo;re interested), and it would be delivered to my house. All I had to do was wait a few days. During that time I was unable to charge the fitbit so it died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the goods arrived, I attempted to replace the faulty half-strap only. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t remove the other side since it was glued into place! What a surprising twist, I did regret that decision from just three paragraphs ago! And to make it worse, for some reason the replacement strap was not the same width as the older strap, so I can\u0026rsquo;t use the old half with the new half! I was forced to pry apart the glued half-strap, and I did eventually manage to do it, and now my fitbit was whole again, and I think I lost a couple of days data? Actually when I charged the fitbit again it was no longer sync\u0026rsquo;ed to my phone and I had to reinstall it. The replacement strap felt a bit off, but I got used to it soon enough, and here we are half a year later and I\u0026rsquo;m still using the Fitbit, hooray! Stupidity overcome!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy with my year and a half of fitbit usage. I\u0026rsquo;m told that the devices themselves last fairly long, even if the straps don\u0026rsquo;t, so I hope to be using it for at least a couple of years more, maybe? I\u0026rsquo;ll try never to glue the straps again.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThese days the only real exercise I get comes in the form of daily walks. When I took a work hiatus in 2016, it was one of the daily habits I promised myself I would pick up. During that time, I wanted to hit the often-recommended daily target of 10,000 steps per day. (Tangent: I found out while writing this post that this number \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/03/watch-your-step-why-the-10000-daily-goal-is-built-on-bad-science\"\u003emay have no scientific basis after all\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack then, all I had to track my steps was the dinky Samsung health app that came with my Galaxy phone. It was good enough, at least at first. At some point I switched to the Google Fit app. Neither app was super accurate though. I started with a modest target, and slowly ramped up to 10,000 steps per day, which I hit sometime near the end of 2016. (Frustratingly, I can\u0026rsquo;t find my daily records of my step counts from that year. I\u0026rsquo;m sure I had them in a spread sheet of some kind somewhere\u0026hellip;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing I learned on these daily walks is that I don\u0026rsquo;t like repetition. I had been trying to get into the daily habit even before my work hiatus, but because of limited time, I only went a short distance from home and just did laps around a nearby basketball court or subdivision. This however was hard for me to keep up because I found it terribly boring. During 2016, since I had more time, what I did was I would walk as far away from home as possible until I hit half my target, then I\u0026rsquo;m also forced to walk all the way back and meet my target. And because I dislike repetition, I seldom took the same route on succeeding days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pleasant side effect of this method is that I got a better layout of the geography near our house. I\u0026rsquo;ve lived here for more than a decade, but haven\u0026rsquo;t really explored the nearby areas that much because when you\u0026rsquo;re a working joe you don\u0026rsquo;t really have that much time for exploratory walks. And I would walk pretty far too, something like 8-10 km a day. I went down roads I never travelled, visited small malls I never knew of, walked all the way to a friend\u0026rsquo;s house, sometimes even walked through some sketchy-looking neighborhoods and so on. It\u0026rsquo;s also happened more than once that a friend I don\u0026rsquo;t see too often but lives nearby will say to me \u0026ldquo;Hey, I saw someone who looks like you walking around [my neighborhood]!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround mid-2017, my brother got me a Fitbit Charge 2, so I switched to that for my step counting. By this time, I had been maintaining the 10,000 step target for a while after I hit it, but when I started working regularly again I started to slip and often found myself only hitting 2 or 3 thousand a day. I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to ramp it up again the past few months, but I find that usually 10,000 steps takes way too much time, in the neighborhood of 1.5-2 hours of walking, depending on my pace. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll still ramp up to that step count but I\u0026rsquo;ll take it a lot slower this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days, my daily target is now a more manageable 6,000 to 8,000 steps a day, and I have more regular routes I follow. It somehow feels a bit more challenging to do this regularly in 2018 as the weather now seems much hotter than it used to be (that, or I had gotten used to being in an air-conditioned office again). I find my walks now more often happen after dusk, which makes them a bit more dangerous (these are Metro Manila streets after all), despite what a certain former DFA secretary might say. I just try to avoid wandering through shady streets these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, according to the fitbit logs, I\u0026rsquo;ve clocked in around 2.8 million steps since I got the fitbit, over around 500 days, more or less 5,500 steps per day. While it\u0026rsquo;s not ideal, I think it\u0026rsquo;s a lot more than I used to get regularly, and I am able to burst to 10,000 every so often. Hopefully I can get back to 10,000 regularly soonish.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Sure, \u0026ldquo;more money\u0026rdquo; is always good, but you need to consider what you are giving up in exchange for that money. Is X really something you want to be doing? Or would you be miserable doing it? Sometimes you decide that the tradeoff is okay, I\u0026rsquo;ll give up a little happiness in exchange for a little more money, and that\u0026rsquo;s fine if that\u0026rsquo;s what you really want. But that conclusion should come from knowing what it is you want and you need, not out of envy for what other people have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s especially difficult to avoid comparison to other people in the modern age of social media.

You have to remember that what people project on social media isn\u0026rsquo;t often the entire picture of their lives. They are more likely to hold back on the failures, troubles, problems, and other negative aspects that they have to go through. Comparing your own life to others on social media is inherently an imbalanced situation - you will have a tendency to compare your worst days against their best days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can also be challenging and tempting to compare yourself to other people when you find yourself wanting to make unconventional choices. In such a case, even society itself will sometimes challenge you with comparison. It\u0026rsquo;s important to have a firm understanding of what you want for yourself, to avoid falling into the trap of letting comparison decide to take away your joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess the saying isn\u0026rsquo;t absolute. Comparison can be a good thing, as long as it\u0026rsquo;s used in service of what you truly want.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
