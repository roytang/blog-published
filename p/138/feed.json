            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA high-pitched bell rang out a couple of times as I stepped into the diner. Outside had been slightly chilly, the first hints of the coming winter lingering in the air. Inside I gratefully took off my cap and laid it on the counter as I sat down and waved over at the middle-aged lady brewing coffee on the other end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Fresh pot? I\u0026rsquo;ll have some if that\u0026rsquo;s alright. And any bacon and eggs you have,\u0026rdquo; I found myself saying, surprisingly famished. The woman turned as if seeing me for the first time. I spied a name tag against her faded yellow uniform, in gilded letters it spelled out \u0026ldquo;DOLORES\u0026rdquo;. With a surprising assertiveness I followed up, \u0026ldquo;As quickly as possible please Dolores.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDolores\u0026rsquo; raised her eyebrows. I\u0026rsquo;m unsure whether it was because of my unusual order or because of my impertinence, but regardless she turned to the little window behind the counter and whispered something indistinct, I suppose to whoever needed to cook my bacon and eggs. She took her time waddling over with her freshly brewed pot of coffee and poured me a hot cup. She spoke with a long, drawling voice. \u0026ldquo;So, who you running away from honey?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time I was the one to look surprised. My eyes quickly darted around the diner, near empty at this surely ungodly hour. The only other patron was a skinny old man at a booth on the far end, slowly going through what looked like a faded newspaper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDolores smiled a knowing smile. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not rocket science hon,\u0026rdquo; She gestured with her mouth to the parking lot outside, in the direction of the van I had been driving for the past seven hours. \u0026ldquo;You drive up here a bit past midnight in a big-name delivery van, the kind that don\u0026rsquo;t do deliveries at this hour.\u0026rdquo; She put the coffee pot down and waved her hand over my face, \u0026ldquo;Your eyes are tired and your clothes are rumpled and you smell like you\u0026rsquo;ve been in that van for what, half a day now?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re awfully perceptive aren\u0026rsquo;t you,\u0026rdquo; I retorted back without thinking, \u0026ldquo;For a waitress at an all-night diner?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not that unusual you know, there\u0026rsquo;s really only two sorts that end up here at this hour, truckers and people who\u0026rsquo;re running,\u0026rdquo; she gestured at the van again, \u0026ldquo;and that ain\u0026rsquo;t no truck.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Why do people run?\u0026rdquo; I found myself asking. Just making small talk. Why would I care why other people run?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDolores shrugged, \u0026ldquo;Lots of reasons, I guess. Some\u0026rsquo;re crooks, running from the law. There\u0026rsquo;s those in debt and can\u0026rsquo;t afford to pay so they skip town. More and more these days though, there\u0026rsquo;s folks who maybe just got tired of livin\u0026rsquo; their lives and they figure they could just up and vanish, walk out from their nagging wife and their crazy kids and their shitty jobs that probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t last long anyways. A lot of \u0026lsquo;em think they can just find a cabin in the woods somewhere and disappear for a few years, livin\u0026rsquo; off the land. Or maybe they imagine they can drive up to some big city and lose themselves in the crowds.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grunted perhaps a bit too loudly, thinking about how I had gotten here in the first place. Dolores seemed to be able to read my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Let me guess, you have no idea what you\u0026rsquo;re doing here do you?\u0026rdquo; She looked me up and down. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d guess that\u0026rsquo;s your delivery uniform right there, haven\u0026rsquo;t bothered changing out of it. You just kept on driving, no idea where you wanted to go.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Well, I was thinking maybe somewhere up north\u0026ndash;\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Honey, if you really wanted to go, you\u0026rsquo;d have ditched that delivery van o\u0026rsquo; yours as soon as you could. You know as well as I do those things got GPS on \u0026lsquo;em right?'\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded slowly. I had thought about the GPS, but figured I just needed to leave the van somewhere before morning when they would be looking for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;And your cellphone, you got one don\u0026rsquo;t you? Still on you?\u0026rdquo;, she retorted as an indistinct voice called out from beyond the small hole and a plate slid out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Yeah, \u0026quot; I said, patting my left-hand pocket, \u0026ldquo;but I turned it off. My wife must have called me a dozen times by now.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;So tell me hon, why haven\u0026rsquo;t you thrown it out yet?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Throw it out?\u0026rdquo; I was caught a bit off guard, \u0026ldquo;Well, I kind of paid good money for it, and I\u0026rsquo;m still on contract, so\u0026ndash;\u0026rdquo; I trailed off, knowing I wasn\u0026rsquo;t making sense. I shook my head. \u0026ldquo;You think I should go back?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Honey, I ain\u0026rsquo;t telling you what to do, it\u0026rsquo;s your own damn life,\u0026rdquo; Dolores said as she served up a plate full of bacon and eggs. \u0026ldquo;But I see you, you keep glacin\u0026rsquo; at that there wedding ring on your hand, out at the van in the parking lot, and I see a man who ain\u0026rsquo;t ready to let go. You gonna run, you gotta be sure, you gotta cut clean.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; My brow furrowed as I frowned at the bacon in front of me, perhaps for the first time in my life. \u0026ldquo;You know, it was my birthday yesterday.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Dolores\u0026rsquo; turn to grunt, \u0026ldquo;Happy birthday then, but I hope you ain\u0026rsquo;t expecting a discount.\u0026rdquo; She finally picked up the coffee pot, turned away from me, and walked over to the other patron who had motioned her over with his coffee cup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up the fork and started eating. It was perhaps the best meal I\u0026rsquo;ve had in a long while.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Most application processes will have some sort of written exam to filter out people who look good on paper, but can’t actually do anything. People graduate college all the time without being able to do anything so it’s a fairly good idea\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eI was expecting the written exam to be programming questions, but to my surprise it wasn’t. The questions were puzzle/problem solving type questions. I think there were 10 questions in all. I don’t remember all of them, but for sure one of them was the pirates puzzle described here: \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.mathsisfun.com/puzzles/5-pirates-solution.html\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ehttp://www.mathsisfun.com/puzzles/5-pirates-solution.html\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e. I never did find out how many I got correct, although I felt pretty good about my answers for all of them\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAfter passing the written exam, I also had to take a second technical exam. It consisted of a few parts, the first part was they gave me some sort of string-manipulation problem and I had to write a program \u003cem\u003eon a whiteboard\u003c/em\u003e and explain and defend it. Nowadays if you asked someone to write a program on paper or on a whiteboard during an interview, it would kind of look ridiculous since it doesn’t reflect a realistic scenario of how programmers work these days (i.e. with the internet and IDEs and autocompletes and whatnot), but that was how things were done back in the day\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eI hadn’t done much programming outside of using C, so that’s the language I used to provide my solution, but in theory I could have just used some sort of pseudocode since they don’t require you to use specific languages. As a programmer applying for a job, I would recommend prioritizing opportunities that don’t require you to know a specific language or set of languages. You’ll learn and grow a lot more as a programmer\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAfter leaving me in the room for thirty minutes, the interviewer came back and I had to explain the program I had written on the whiteboard. It was a typical string-manipulation problem designed to see how well coders think through the process. I don’t remember the details too much, but I remember getting into a debate with the interviewer about the expected behavior for the C function strcpy(). I didn’t want to appear too argumentative, so even though I believed I was right (and I confirmed it afterwards!) I just let it be after insisting a couple of times\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAfter the programming question, I got asked an \u0026ldquo;impossible question\u0026rdquo;. This is another type of interview question that has mostly fallen out of favor these days. The idea of an impossible question is basically the interviewee tries to approximate an answer to a question that would generally take a lot of research to answer. The interviewee has to explain his reasoning of how he would estimate the answer, and from there the interviewer can make a judgment of how well thought out the interviewee’s processes are. I didn’t know about this style of question ahead of time of course, this interview was the first time I’ve encountered it. I actually still remember the impossible question asked of me: I was asked how many people ride the Metrorail (MRT3) in Metro Manila on a daily basis. This was in 2002, so the MRT3 had only been out for around 3 years and wasn’t quite as congested as it was now, so I could make some reasonable assumptions like each train arrives at each station every 5 minutes, each car usually houses 300 people on average, etc, and I think I gave a pretty reasonable answer\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThis style of recruitment process was popular at the time, more than ten years ago. Companies like Microsoft were well-known for it. In fact many potential programming job applicants would be advised on internet forums to google \u0026ldquo;Microsoft interview questions\u0026rdquo;, and many of them became so well-known MS was forced to revamp its processes as well\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWith the problem solving, the code walk-through and the impossible question, the focus was finding not necessarily people who were very good at coding per se, but rather people who exhibited a strong analytical approach to problem solving\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThese days the recruitment process is very, very different. In most, if not all companies, the written exam will focus on technical, coding questions. You’ll be given sample code and need to try to identify the problems with the code. A friend even had to answer questions over the phone about details of Java syntax (pretty useless questions if you ask me)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAnd instead of a technical interview where you have to write code manually, most likely you’ll be given a workstation with an IDE and computer access and asked to implement so-and-so program. Some of the more progressive ones will do a pairing exam where you have to do pair programming with one of their existing developers; such pairing exams give insight on two fronts: your technical skill and how well you can work well with someone already on the team you’re applying for\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eI kind of prefer the old style of recruitment processes because they give a better chance for people like me who had minimal formal programming education but can learn easily and quickly\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Who knows, it may still happen in our lifetime.

Or maybe we manage to survive until the singularity and live on as artificial constructs\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiterature and popular culture often portray immortality as some sort of curse. Sometimes a literal curse, as in vampires or highlanders needing to cut each other\u0026rsquo;s heads off. More often the implied of curse of eternal solitude \u0026ndash; Superman is often taunted by writers with the idea that everyone he loves will eventually grow old and die, and other immortals are often portrayed as not wanting to burden themselves with short-lived human connections\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat interests me the most about the idea of immortality is the idea that we as a species have so much to look forward to. (Assuming we manage to bypass \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter\"\u003eThe Great Filter\u003c/a\u003e and avoid screwing things up for ourselves of course.) Even just the coming decades hold a lot of promise, with advances in space exploration, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, and so on that may very well expand the horizons of the human experience. And who knows, immortality may actually help George R.R. Martin finish the \u003cem\u003eSong of Ice and Fire\u003c/em\u003e series!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to be immortal if only to be able to see where we are going and what comes next. The future, it comes.
