            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eDuring my adult life, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to learn or at least expose myself to one new skill or programming language every year. For example, over the past year or so I\u0026rsquo;ve been studying, dabbling, or trying out the following: game development using Unity, technical analysis of stocks, Spanish, driving a car, and even some simple cooking! I\u0026rsquo;ve also been regularly practicing to improve my skills in writing and sketching. I probably even forgot a few things I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to learn. I also have a backlog of programming languages and frameworks I\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting to learn and/or try out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere can be a tendency for some people, especially those tired of formal education, to fall into the trap of thinking that once they become adults they no longer need to learn new things or improve their skills, but an attitude towards continuous learning and improvement pushes us towards more fulfilling lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are even certain professions such as software development or medicine where you pretty much have to keep up with the latest trends or new technologies in order to maintain your skill set. But even outside of such professions, a lifetime of learning can be enriching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s literally too. Learning and exposing yourself to new things is a process of growth and discovery that can lead you to better career options and be more financially rewarding. Scott Adams (creator of Dilbert) gave some advice that \u003ca href=\"http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html\"\u003eyou can make yourself more valuable by combining two or more skills\u003c/a\u003e. The more skills you learn, the more likely you are to find a combination of skills that gives you the edge towards financial success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt work, I\u0026rsquo;ve always been happy to take on tasks that required me to learn new frameworks or programming languages. Without an attitude towards continuous learning, your skills will stagnate. You\u0026rsquo;ll be working on the same sort of tasks again and again, leading to boredom and unhappiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApart from the possible financial rewards, continuous learning has a few other soft benefits. It keeps you mentally sharp and healthy even as you grow older. It can help you meet new people. It can give you new conversation topics with your friends. It builds your confidence and leads to trying even more new things. It helps you look at things and situations with fresh eyes or different angles. And it means you\u0026rsquo;re almost never bored!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have kids, it sets an example for them that learning is a good thing and definitely you should be trying to instill the same example in them. Encourage their curiosity and facilitate their learning whenever they show interest in something, especially outside of school, to reinforce the idea that learning isn\u0026rsquo;t something that can only happen in the classroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can be exhausting sometimes to be trying to keep up with everything and learn new things all the time, but you owe it to yourself (and perhaps even to the world!) to continuously try to be a better person.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eSome time ago, one of my many intrepid followers pointed out that this blog tested poorly on web page performance according to this \u003ca href=\"https://testmysite.thinkwithgoogle.com/\"\u003eSpeed Testing Tool\u003c/a\u003e. Now, I\u0026rsquo;m of the opinion that for a personal blog such as this, web performance isn\u0026rsquo;t really a mission-critical sort of thing, but as a software developer who has often had to work hard to optimize the web applications we delivered to our clients, it kind of became a matter of pride :p\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#0c6ac79b772c7e82c9d4b481ecd82269-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2016/06/performance-optimization-for-wordpress-blogs/report_hu878ea8cd0476dbccd5edc1783b05d8c8_6920_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"0c6ac79b772c7e82c9d4b481ecd82269-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2016/06/performance-optimization-for-wordpress-blogs/report.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"30 Jun 2016 1:30am\"\u003e30 Jun 2016 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI also ran the site through \u003ca href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights\"\u003eGoogle PageSpeed Insights\u003c/a\u003e. The results were mostly the same, but the Google site gave me results faster, so this was the one I referenced for subsequent testing. The most important problems to address were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOptimizing image sizes\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRemoving render-blocking JS and CSS in above-the fold content\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLeverage browser caching (through the use of HTTP headers)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMinify CSS and Javascript\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of these are familiar to me since they are very common performance optimizations done in web applications. However, this blog is running on WordPress, which means I should try to look for existing WordPress-based solutions instead of hacking the code myself. (I used to run a custom-built Django-based blog system here, but I got tired of maintaining it myself so I went for tried-and-true WordPress). Here are the optimizations I ended up doing:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUpgraded to the default WordPress Twenty-Sixteen Theme. Not strictly necessary for optimization, but I was previously using the Twenty-Twelve Theme, and the problem with using older themes is that they may not be using newer web development techniques to improve performance. Also, Twenty-Sixteen looked better haha. And yes, I do use the default WordPress themes. Too lazy (as of yet) to look for a nice custom theme, and I don\u0026rsquo;t have the design chops myself to build it, so it will do for now.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFor the image size problem, I found that the biggest offender was the \u003ca href=\"/2016/03/sketching-daily/\"\u003eSketching Daily post\u003c/a\u003e where I broke down how I do my daily sketches. The problem was that I was uploading full-size images of the drawings and they were being inlined into the post \u0026ndash; which meant the browser was loading the full-size image even though it was shown in a smaller size on the post itself. Instead, I manually changed the settings of each image in the post to use one of the smaller-size images generated by WordPress on upload. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#5e6f8afbe11d06811d33a26b4c215b02-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2016/06/performance-optimization-for-wordpress-blogs/wp-image-settings_huc3ccc93e8d0116ad5b05ed14c6c422a1_16871_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"5e6f8afbe11d06811d33a26b4c215b02-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2016/06/performance-optimization-for-wordpress-blogs/wp-image-settings.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"30 Jun 2016 1:30am\"\u003e30 Jun 2016 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n Choosing \u0026ldquo;Large\u0026rdquo; here meant the Large one would be inlined, while I could still set the image to link to the full-size one on click. The full size image is a whole fifteen times larger than the \u0026ldquo;large\u0026rdquo; image! It\u0026rsquo;s something I need to remember in the future if I ever upload huge images again. I also found a link that described how to set the \u003ca href=\"https://made4wp.com/changing-default-attachment-display-setting-insert-image-post/\"\u003edefault image size\u003c/a\u003e (so that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t default to full size all the time), but I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s necessary for now.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo further help with image optimization, I installed the \u003ca href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/\"\u003eWP Smush plugin\u003c/a\u003e, which automatically optimizes (\u0026ldquo;smushes\u0026rdquo;) uploaded images. I found that WP Smush reduces the uploaded image sizes by around 10-15% on average, it\u0026rsquo;s not too bad.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNext was render-blocking JavaScript. If you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar, any \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;script include=\u0026quot;... \u0026quot; /\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e tag in your HTML blocks the rendering of any content below the tag itself until the content of the JS has finished executing. The typical solutions are either to (a) move the script tags to below the content (\u0026ldquo;below the fold\u0026rdquo;) or (b) add an \u0026ldquo;async\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;defer\u0026rdquo; attribute to the script tag. It turns out that there was already a plugin that did (b), \u003ca href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/async-javascript/\"\u003eAsync Javascript\u003c/a\u003e. So I gave it a go, but for some reason it wasn\u0026rsquo;t working. After a bit of debugging, I found that there was an \u0026ldquo;aj_enabled\u0026rdquo; option that wasn\u0026rsquo;t being set. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out any settings page to update it, so I went ahead and edited the plugin directly to set the value: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#36eed300f8d29100ff8ea1e3c36cd5ca-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2016/06/performance-optimization-for-wordpress-blogs/wp-async-js_hu70554058f9d4537be00e9490b1341641_41959_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"36eed300f8d29100ff8ea1e3c36cd5ca-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2016/06/performance-optimization-for-wordpress-blogs/wp-async-js.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"30 Jun 2016 1:30am\"\u003e30 Jun 2016 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n It\u0026rsquo;s generally a bad idea to hack the local copy of your WordPress plugins, since you have to check the impact every time the plugin has a new version, but I decided to live with it for now. After the update, sure enough the JS no longer blocked page rendering.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLastly, I installed the \u003ca href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/\"\u003eW3 Total Cache plugin\u003c/a\u003e. I disabled the WP Super Cache plugin I was using before since they would probably have some sort of conflict. In addition to page caching, this plugin addresses a couple of other issues: it supports HTML/JS/CSS minification (reduces file sizes and HTTP requests) and it allows adding the expiry headers to static content (to leverage browser caching). If you\u0026rsquo;ve done any work on website performance, the settings for the plugin are straightforward to understand, but I also referenced the guide at \u003ca href=\"https://gtmetrix.com/wordpress-optimization-guide.html\"\u003ethis link\u003c/a\u003e. The plugin looks okay, but there\u0026rsquo;s an unfortunate side effect: the minified JS created by the plugin does not respect Async Javascript, so it blocks above the fold content from rendering. It\u0026rsquo;s a problem I\u0026rsquo;ll have to try to resolve in the future.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the above changes, I retest the site:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#21b8bf5fee6eb583237d7c9920559f3b-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2016/06/performance-optimization-for-wordpress-blogs/wp-report_hu9a07672283dc6dda715aae2184dde23f_16606_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"21b8bf5fee6eb583237d7c9920559f3b-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2016/06/performance-optimization-for-wordpress-blogs/wp-report.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"30 Jun 2016 1:30am\"\u003e30 Jun 2016 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMuch improvement indeed!
