The lie was so good, I got a follow-up question about it a year later and was so surprised I just blurted out that my rival died in accident before finally admitting to the fib\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I will intentionally lie often only for fun or mischief, or in the rare case, to protect someone or avoid some problem or injustice. Even for that last scenario I will try to avoid it as much as possible. I am more likely to stay quiet or avoid discussion or maybe even stretch the truth a bit to \u0026ldquo;technically correct\u0026rdquo;, but I try to avoid any outright falsehoods unless absolutely necessary\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this same reason, I kind of have the same aversion to any form of salesmanship, although I am occasionally told that I am good at writing copy. At work I was sometimes asked to write some response to questions in a tender that would be less than honest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t have this feature, how should I respond?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Just say we have it.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;But we don\u0026rsquo;t. How about I just write that this feature will be available?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can see the use of optimistic future tense to stretch the truth a bit. At one point a higher-up even told me that all the other suppliers do that to, as if that justifies it. Being asked to outright be dishonest was stressful for me at best so I later on learned to avoid such tasks altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand that not all salesmanship is dishonest and that not all salesmen are scammers looking to sell snake oil. But we basically live in a world that is caveat emptor don\u0026rsquo;t we? I feel like those salesmen who are honestly just extolling the virtues of their wares are the exception rather than the norm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recognize the need for salesmanship as a skill in everyday life, although younger me would have scoffed at that idea, believing that things should be judged solely on their merits. But merits aren\u0026rsquo;t always obvious, and you still need some level of presentation and good communication skills to push your ideas and merits forward.  I\u0026rsquo;m fine with that I guess, as long as we try to keep things honest.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I\u0026rsquo;m also sure there are many other pertinent questions that I have not considered at this time, but basically my approach would center around: what is the data, where does it come from, how does it compare to other data? And what are the procedures, who is liable for any problems, what is the progress of investigations? These avenues would seem to me (as a layman) to be the most useful in terms of improvements to legislation\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Marcos also wanted to know the consequences of declaring Martial Law. The result of their study stated that, “while Martial Law may accelerate development, in the end the Philippines would become a political archipelago, with debilitating, factionalized politics.” Almonte recalled that their findings led to the conclusion that “the nation would be destroyed because, apart from the divisiveness it would cause, Martial Law would offer Marcos absolute power which would corrupt absolutely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource:\nJose T. Almonte and Marites Dañguilan Vitug, Endless Journey: A Memoir (Quezon City: Cleverheads Publishing, 2015), p. 77.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e=+=+=+=\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe attitude \u0026ldquo;That country should not instruct us on human rights because look at what they have done / are doing\u0026rdquo; is stupid. That\u0026rsquo;s like saying \u0026ldquo;why should I follow the rules when no one else does?\u0026rdquo; Or \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s easier for me to go to mass instead of not being an asshole to other people\u0026rdquo;. This is exactly what is wrong with the entire country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e44 years ago on September 23, 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos declared Proclamation 1081, placing the Philippines under Martial Law. My father was the very first lawyer to challenge the act before the Supreme Court and questioned its legality under the 1935 Philippine Constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, the 1987 Constitution safeguards our institutions from a repeat of Marcos’ Martial Law regime. The Supreme Court is empowered to review all official acts to determine if there has been grave abuse of discretion. Congress cannot be padlocked. Martial Law is limited in duration and effects, even if contemplated by a president. (Source: Section 18 of Article VII)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you really love our country, regardless of political beliefs, invest in it. Give it your love, your forgiveness, your righteous and civil dissent. Obey it\u0026rsquo;s laws even if you feel stupid doing so because no one else will. Hold your head high when people tell you \u0026ldquo;masyado ka kasing honest\u0026rdquo;. Do good work, fall in love, live with honor. Be the best Filipino you can be. And above all, cherish the freedoms that were bought so dearly by so many. Do not abuse them. The Filipino is worth living for, and worth living here for. We are worth changing for, worth loving despite our many frailties.

Every time you add a new person to the team, he comes with a lot of overhead such as the need to learn the project details, responsibilities of other team members, who to consult when there\u0026rsquo;s trouble, custom project procedures, and so on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a reinforcing cycle too. As overhead increases, the team imposes more processes and restrictions to make sure everyone is doing the right thing and there are no screw-ups. More processes means even greater overhead when new team members join. And the cycle repeats\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs team size increases, mistakes become more costly too. When you\u0026rsquo;re a team of two or three developers all in the same room, you can barrel ahead quickly and when there\u0026rsquo;s a problem you can quickly figure out who broke the build. But when there\u0026rsquo;s like eighty of you split over two floors, it becomes a tedious exercise. And every broken build and every critical bug now costs a lot more man-hours because it affects a lot more people. So everybody needs to be even more careful, and yeap even more overhead. You end up introducing more coordinators, reviewers, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn so many words, the above is simply a restatement of the famous \u0026ldquo;Mythical man-month\u0026rdquo; quote:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdding more people to a late project makes it even later\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn practice though, I find that people who are aware of this quote find themselves falling into the trap of \u0026ldquo;this won\u0026rsquo;t happen to me\u0026rdquo;, so a more nuanced discussion of the problems of scale might need to be had. Management typically responds more to qualitative costs, so maybe there are some metrics that you team could find? Something like \u0026ldquo;for every N developers, we need an additional X amount of coordination work\u0026rdquo; and so on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe it\u0026rsquo;s one of those myths we are doomed to relive again and again\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",
