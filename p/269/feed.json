But that may have been a product of reading too many preview pages so that basically the only surprise I got was the shock ending of what Red Skull was doing to Xavier\u0026rsquo;s corpse. The second issue felt a lot better though, there were some scenes that I felt were quite well-written - Havok receiving the old man\u0026rsquo;s thanks, the scenes with the mutants while watching Honest John\u0026rsquo;s broadcasts, how Rogue manages to escape her captors, etc. Also, how great of a villain name is \u0026ldquo;Honest John the Living Propaganda?\u0026rdquo; Heh. (I think he\u0026rsquo;s a new guy introduced by Remender, I can\u0026rsquo;t find any info from before this issue). I\u0026rsquo;m not a big fan of Cassaday\u0026rsquo;s artwork (which contributed to my being underwhelmed by the first issue) - it feels like he\u0026rsquo;s a bit hit or miss. There are some great panels here, but there are also some that are drawn strangely (Lilandra looks bald in one of the panels - that may have been a colorist problem though). Still, Remender\u0026rsquo;s writing more than makes up for the art, though I do hope Cassaday can keep to schedule so that the book doesn\u0026rsquo;t slip schedules too much (see: \u003cem\u003eAstonishing X-Men)\u003c/em\u003e, I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to where the Red Skull is taking is!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll-New X-Men #2 (Marvel)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#e4829a85d8af806dff2f15de299344bc-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/this-week-in-comics-2012-12-01/all-new-x-men-2-561_hudcc67953afc8cd2d65625691e23e992e_115800_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"e4829a85d8af806dff2f15de299344bc-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/this-week-in-comics-2012-12-01/all-new-x-men-2-561.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"30 Nov 2012 1:09pm\"\u003e30 Nov 2012 1:09pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI was quite excited for the second issue of Bendis\u0026rsquo; X-Men and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t disappointed.

The book is still great and the art is spectacular. \u003cstrong\u003eFF #1\u003c/strong\u003e was okay, though I must admit to not being a big fan of Mike Allred\u0026rsquo;s art even though some people on the internet swear by it. Not really my Thing I guess. Heh. Still looking forward to where Fraction takes this book. \u003cstrong\u003eNew Avengers #34\u003c/strong\u003e is the end of Bendis\u0026rsquo; 232-issue run of Avengers books, and the ending kind of undoes some of the changes he\u0026rsquo;s made during that run. Which is fine, I guess it gives Hickman more space for his upcoming Avengers run. \u003cstrong\u003eX-Men Legacy #2\u003c/strong\u003e felt like it had just a bit too much of traipsing inside Legion\u0026rsquo;s mindscape, but at least we finally get to see some of the other X-Men (it\u0026rsquo;s not a solo book, right?) \u003cstrong\u003eX-Treme X-Men #7 \u003c/strong\u003eis still a terribly named book, and the art in this issue was a bit off for me.

The main draw for me is the artwork headlined by Rocafort; this issue\u0026rsquo;s pencils and coloring are great, especially with the level of detail. This issue gives us a bit more insight into Clark\u0026rsquo;s current status, especially vis-a-vis his pre-New 52 love Lois Lane. The rest of the book involve Clark and Kara getting beat up by a strange new visitor from their home planet, and it looks like Clark and Kara\u0026rsquo;s relationship isn\u0026rsquo;t going to get better anytime soon. This may be Kara\u0026rsquo;s new status quo for the New 52, maybe they want her be more stand alone from her famous cousin this time around. The issue doesn\u0026rsquo;t resolve the H\u0026rsquo;el on Earth storyline just yet, looks like we\u0026rsquo;re getting another round of this mini-event in the #15 issues of the \u0026ldquo;super\u0026rdquo; books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAquaman #14 (DC)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#84d93284b45ce7d0640a620aa6c242ed-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/this-week-in-comics-2012-12-01/Aquaman_14_Full2-665x1024_hu62f30e12f22401bbd153aadb7a83ca6b_296843_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"84d93284b45ce7d0640a620aa6c242ed-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/this-week-in-comics-2012-12-01/Aquaman_14_Full2-665x1024.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"30 Nov 2012 1:09pm\"\u003e30 Nov 2012 1:09pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a prelude to the \u003cem\u003eAquaman/Justice League\u003c/em\u003e crossover Throne of Atlantis that starts next month (DC has quite a few of these mini-crossovers going on, maybe in preparation for next year\u0026rsquo;s Trinity War?)  and gives us more information about Arthur\u0026rsquo;s New 52 origins.

This future was last seen in Batman #666 (pre-New 52, also written by Morrison). \u003cstrong\u003eTalon #2\u003c/strong\u003e was okay, though the art wasn\u0026rsquo;t very good for me. I like that the book basically giving DC a way to flesh out the Court of Owls after Snyder introduced them in Batman, but aside from that they\u0026rsquo;re going to have to grow Calvin Rose into his own character. \u003cstrong\u003eSavage Hawkman #14 \u003c/strong\u003ewraps up his crossovers with \u003cem\u003eGreen Arrow\u003c/em\u003e and Deathstroke, although everything is told in an unusual chronological order. They probably just put GA and Hawkman together as a prelude to their teaming up in the upcoming \u003cem\u003eJLA\u003c/em\u003e book. From this issue it looks like there are more Thanagarians on Earth than we expected - they were a pretty big deal pre-New 52 so who knows what they have planned for Thanagar these days. \u003cstrong\u003eTeen Titans #14\u003c/strong\u003e wraps up the Cassie origin story but to be honest it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like it resolved very much. The other half of the issue felt like filler until they could lead up into next month\u0026rsquo;s Death of the Family tie-in. And\u0026hellip;that\u0026rsquo;s it for DC this month, I should probably catch up on the other series.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMasks #1 (Dynamite)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#a2e93280218f0fcbd4757ce9014df84b-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/this-week-in-comics-2012-12-01/masks1_hua3c10341cf3c023c138257f83b375f8e_156314_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"a2e93280218f0fcbd4757ce9014df84b-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/this-week-in-comics-2012-12-01/masks1.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"30 Nov 2012 1:09pm\"\u003e30 Nov 2012 1:09pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis week\u0026rsquo;s non-big two pick is the first issue of \u003cem\u003eMasks\u003c/em\u003e from Dynamite Entertainment. It\u0026rsquo;s a crossover of several pulp heroes/vigilantes - The Shadow, The Green Hornet and his faithful assistant Kato, the Spider and\u0026hellip;is that Zorro on the cover?!? - coming together to oppose a corrupt government that\u0026rsquo;s imposing injustice on the citizenry. The corrupt bureaucracy leads even law-abiding heroes like the Hornet to question their \u0026ldquo;lawful good\u0026rdquo; stance because this time, the law is on the side of the bad guys! The creative team is science fiction writer Chris Roberson and renowned comic book painter Alex Ross, which means we\u0026rsquo;re in for an interesting and pretty good-looking series.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePanel of the Week - All-New X-Men #2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy favorite panel this week is when Iceman meets Iceman in All-New X-Men #2:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#a78176f9dfe2747befbe51b288ac21b7-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/this-week-in-comics-2012-12-01/iceman_hu966e83d4bf8cbe1be40d2b67ae8b37ae_1112560_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"a78176f9dfe2747befbe51b288ac21b7-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/this-week-in-comics-2012-12-01/iceman.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"30 Nov 2012 1:09pm\"\u003e30 Nov 2012 1:09pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n",

Luckily (or unlucky for your wallet?) many of the top Marvel NOW! #1s are double-shipping so here we are a couple of weeks later with the second issue of All-New X-Men! I\u0026rsquo;ve seen some of the preview pages, looks like Beast is going to have to convince the first five to make the trip back with him, but we already know they\u0026rsquo;re going to be back in present day by the end of this issue. I\u0026rsquo;m not only looking forward to how the young ones react to the present day \u0026ldquo;dystopia\u0026rdquo; but I\u0026rsquo;m also eager to see more of Stuart Immonen\u0026rsquo;s artwork (just writing this part made me go re-read the first arc of New Avengers that he drew.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#f7fb0540f483298afce2e67811ed8c74-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/first-three-comics-im-readin-this-week-2012-11-27/thor-god-of-thunder_hub77c64db49cd58485724f39e64aabbaa_80342_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"f7fb0540f483298afce2e67811ed8c74-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/first-three-comics-im-readin-this-week-2012-11-27/thor-god-of-thunder.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"27 Nov 2012 4:59am\"\u003e27 Nov 2012 4:59am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThor: God of Thunder #2\u003c/strong\u003e - this series looks to be one of the best new Marvel NOW! titles; the first issue introducing us to the three Thors facing the god killer was very well-written. Since most of my Thor readings have been either Avengers-related or the recent Journey into Mystery, I\u0026rsquo;ve never read any books that tell us the tales of young Thor during the age of Vikings; it gives a refreshing perspective to the God of Thunder. Mark Millar recently called the book\u0026rsquo;s author Jason Aaron \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/mrmarkmillar/status/269033384670556161\"\u003ethe best Marvel writer at the moment\u003c/a\u003e and having read his recent run on \u003cem\u003eThe Incredible Hulk\u003c/em\u003e it gives me high expectations for this series indeed. The artwork is also pretty good - I\u0026rsquo;m not that familiar with the penciler Esad Ribic but I can say after reviewing some of his earlier work that his interiors of this book so far look like the top of his game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#75ce236140d7436abf66e943f5303926-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/first-three-comics-im-readin-this-week-2012-11-27/2722539-sm_cv14_ds_hu971aa9deffae0378a952dbefe21df0a6_955139_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpeg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"75ce236140d7436abf66e943f5303926-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/first-three-comics-im-readin-this-week-2012-11-27/2722539-sm_cv14_ds.jpeg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"27 Nov 2012 4:59am\"\u003e27 Nov 2012 4:59am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuperman #14\u003c/strong\u003e - it\u0026rsquo;s not that I\u0026rsquo;m particulary excited by the current H\u0026rsquo;el on Earth storyline - the crossover between the \u0026ldquo;super\u0026rdquo; books has been okay so far (and thankfully it looks like Kara\u0026rsquo;s finally going to learn English!)
