I feel like I can claim some nontrivial responsibility in that decision, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like something to be proud of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI myself had resisted shifting to a new plan for a while (so I can carry over my unlimited data), but eventually had to shift to a 3gb capped plan because I wanted to get my mom a new phone on the cheap. They do offer unlimited data for their new fiber home broadband plans, for around 30% higher monthly fees than the capped plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"Cg5GI3G\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"https://imgur.com/Cg5GI3G\"\u003eView post on imgur.com\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cscript async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you think about it, a 3gb bandwidth cap seems ridiculous in this day and age, but I\u0026rsquo;ve pretty much changed my behavior around it. I now very rarely watch Youtube or Facebook videos on the go for example. I prefer to watch stuff on the Desktop. (Phone screens are too tiny to appreciate most videos anyway.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing off on a slight tangent, our home broadband is now on a 50gb Globe fiber plan. Yes, I actually doubled-down on Globe despite all my problems with their customer service. In fact, even the migration of our Bayantel line over to Globe fiber was not without incident. Sadly, there is very little choice for high-speed coverage in our area. (I\u0026rsquo;m not inclined to try PLDT since I have a number of friends who also have poor customer service experience with them, and Converge isn\u0026rsquo;t available in our area.). We\u0026rsquo;ve only had the fiber service for a little more than a month, but it\u0026rsquo;s reasonably good so far. Some occasional slowdowns, but generally downloads are a lot faster. We have a bandwidth cap, but it\u0026rsquo;s at 600gb and there\u0026rsquo;s a mobile app that lets me monitor it. During the first month we only used less than 400gb, so I guess the cap is okay for now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think overall we still have some of the worst internet service in the region. The poor quality of internet service in the Philippines has been \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/roytang/status/84881163134574592\"\u003eone of my all-time pet peeves\u003c/a\u003e about living in this country. Hopefully the promised third telco player to be introduced brings us some improvements in terms of higher bandwidth caps and speeds and better prices.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I had to do 2000 samples per tile which is why it was so slow. I was getting too much noise/graininess at lower sampling rates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t follow the tutorial exactly. My plate is square and made of glass for one thing. The chocobutternut donut wasn\u0026rsquo;t part of the tutorial, I just wanted to try it (obviously did not turn out too well and all those orange particles on the donut probably really slowed down the render lol). I also didn\u0026rsquo;t bother too much with the stuff in the last two videos of the series which involved adjusting the lighting and other stuff to make the image prettier (wasn\u0026rsquo;t really interested). I actually also tried to model a fork (not in the tutorial), but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get the tines right and gave up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long time ago I read an interview in an old PC gaming mag about how they implemented Age of Empires and there was an image of a 3d mesh of a knight on horseback and I remember thinking \u0026ldquo;That looks really complicated, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably never be able to do something like that.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now that I\u0026rsquo;ve tried this tutorial, I have to agree with that initial assessment \u0026ndash; any complex modelling would surely try my patience. But I was also pleasantly surprised with how advanced Blender is \u0026ndash; I sort of imagined that you had to position and adjust all the mesh nodes/vertices/faces by hand a lot, but actually there\u0026rsquo;s a ton of functions to make some common operations simpler (but it\u0026rsquo;s still a lot of work).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne complaint is that Blender\u0026rsquo;s user interface is very obtuse and daunting though \u0026ndash; I don\u0026rsquo;t usually do video tutorials but I doubt I could have figured this stuff out on my own. Though I suppose it can\u0026rsquo;t be helped given the sheer complexity of the task involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m probably not going into any sort of significant 3d modelling or 3d artwork soon (like I said, not enough patience), but it was good to give it a try so at least I have a passing knowledge of some of the concepts involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",
