It didn\u0026rsquo;t help that it\u0026rsquo;s been 4-5 years since I played VLR, and that game already had an overly complex plot so I can barely remember the details from that game as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile it\u0026rsquo;s a story-based series, the gameplay largely consists of two parts: (a) escape rooms; and (b) decision-making. The escape rooms part are entertaining enough, nothing too difficult, but satisfying enough to solve everything. The decision-making part is used to unlock branching timelines, and the path to the \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; endings is determined by your ability to find the correct decisions to unlock the correct events. Not all decisions are binary or multiple-choice; some of the more important ones require text or numeric input, making it impossible to guess them. At multiple points, you will need to reference information learned from other branches of history (don\u0026rsquo;t worry, there is a story reason for why this happens).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTook me a couple of weeks of playing sporadically to finish the game. I enjoyed the game enough to spend a couple of late nights to finish it once I got really going. I will shamefully admit I did get stuck in one place and in my impatience I googled my way past it.

I suspect that this cripples me a bit in the real world where people with less scruples are more willing to bend the truth to make money.

(Over here, I think we get like very weak water pressure a couple of hours a day and that\u0026rsquo;s it). Obviously they can\u0026rsquo;t just cut 9.375% of the hours, they need to add some buffer, that\u0026rsquo;s fine. And households would of course compensate for reduced hours by consuming more during the time they do have water. But why so extreme, so immediately? At worst I would have expected that they cut service hours by at most 50% (so households have water during half the day), then if that\u0026rsquo;s not enough come out with an advisory saying \u0026ldquo;okay, we\u0026rsquo;re still consuming too much water, we need to cut more hours\u0026rdquo;. As it is, their announced service interruption hours are highly inaccurate, so it seems they can\u0026rsquo;t even predict what\u0026rsquo;s going to happen with their service. Conspiracy theories aside, I prefer to attribute all of the issues to sheer incompetence first, but is there something I\u0026rsquo;m missing here, some kind of engineering reason or what, for the service interruptions to be so widespread and unpredictable?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIf I could give some advice to someone starting out in their software development career, it would be this: Don\u0026rsquo;t stay in the same place too long. The first company I worked at, I stayed with them for thirteen years, which I now feel was way too long. I have to admit, the work was hard and challenging, but I was young and had a lot of energy and was willing to work the long hours. I was good at the work and the enjoyed the company of the people I worked with so in a certain sense I got comfortable with the status quo and stayed a bit too long. But given a do-over, I would probably prefer to have left after maybe 4-5 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopping jobs too quickly can be fantastic for your salary growth, but it has some disadvantages - you don\u0026rsquo;t build close enough relationships, and too many hops doesn\u0026rsquo;t look good on your resume. Four to five years seems like a good period to stay, long enough to learn as much as you can and build your network before moving on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main advantage of not staying too long comes in the form of personal growth. When you stay at a place too long you tend to stagnate. Sure, it\u0026rsquo;s software development so somehow you\u0026rsquo;re always improving, but not improving as quickly as you would be if you were to be thrust into a new environment every few years. Your personal network of like-minded professionals will grow quicker as well when you switch companies. I was thinking about this because I was recently asked if I could refer any senior developers and I realized my personal network of high-level senior technical guys wasn\u0026rsquo;t that deep because of me staying in the same place for so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t consider this a \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/choose-without-regret-and-the-fear-of-missing-out/\"\u003eregret\u003c/a\u003e, I\u0026rsquo;m still pretty happy and satisfied with where I am in life. Thinking about this is more of an alternate universe \u0026ldquo;what if\u0026rdquo; scenario. I have to admit that staying that long did have some advantages - I got to work with and meet some good people, younger ones even, who became good friends. But this is not an argument in favor of staying that long, as you would still have the chance to build relationships even if you move on. It\u0026rsquo;s possible in that alternate universe I may have made even better friends or may have even been friends with the same ones I have now somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, given a chance to give advice to my younger self, I would probably recommend the second path. There is more uncertainty there to be sure, but life is risk, and to live is to explore. Taking the change to move to a new environment optimizes for personal growth, and it\u0026rsquo;s probably better to be doing it when you are young and full of energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA few months back, my current web host \u003ca href=\"https://www.webfaction.com/\"\u003eWebFaction\u003c/a\u003e announced they had been purchased by \u003ca href=\"https://godaddy.com\"\u003eGoDaddy\u003c/a\u003e, which was worrying. Back then they hadn\u0026rsquo;t announced any details other than there would be some account migrations and single sign on, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a big deal yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI initially joined WebFaction \u003ca href=\"/roytang-net-site-update/\"\u003eback in 2008\u003c/a\u003e because they were a Python-friendly and developer-friendly host that had some reasonable budget options, allowing me some space to host this blog and any side projects I wanted to deploy. At that time I was learning Django, so I needed the Python support that normal hosts don\u0026rsquo;t provide. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know much about cloud servers back then and the WebFaction account let me try out so much stuff despite it being shared hosting. The news above is worrying because GoDaddy does not have a good reputation and is not especially known for being developer-friendly. They are a mass-market, \u0026ldquo;lowest common denominator\u0026rdquo; kind of host, so I would prefer not to have them as my web host.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis week, they said in an announcement that they were moving forward with a technical evaluation of migrating everyone to GoDaddy, which kind of spells doom for the WebFaction services I\u0026rsquo;m using. Even though their email promised that \u0026ldquo;you won\u0026rsquo;t lose any of your current features or services\u0026rdquo;, but according to a \u003ca href=\"https://community.webfaction.com/questions/22148/webfaction-migration-6-months-later-and-still-no-answers\"\u003erecent thread\u003c/a\u003e on their support forums:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eOne again, zero information about exactly when WebFaction services will be completely shut down.\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe exact date hasn\u0026rsquo;t been defined yet but it is estimated to be on August 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eDoes this mean that WebFaction's current features and services will remain the same AFTER the migration?\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, WebFaction\u0026rsquo;s control panel, servers and other features and services will shut down after the migration is done. The plan is to stay up and running until then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile they say the technical evaluation is still ongoing, in all likelihood that\u0026rsquo;s it for WebFaction. For me, at least. And I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in migrating to GoDaddy. I still have a few months before I need to transition, but I guess I need to start prepping by:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003elooking for a new host. Any recommendations? I have a bit more experience this time with managing servers, so I\u0026rsquo;m open to a VPS instead of shared hosting, might be fun to try out for a while. Currently looking at just getting a cheap ($5/mo) droplet over at Digital Ocean. Alternatively, I could just move this blog over to netlify and any other apps I have (like \u003ca href=\"https://triviastorm.net/\"\u003eTriviaStorm\u003c/a\u003e) over to something like Heroku, but that seems like it would cost me more money.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esee if I can refund my current balance with them, since I prepaid a bit last year. I already asked on the forums and they say we\u0026rsquo;ll have more info on refund options later after their technical evaluation, maybe around Mayish.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, I had a good run with WebFaction, a bit over 10 years now. But time moves on and things change and small businesses get eaten up by large businesses, such is the way of capitalism. They were very developer-friendly and had pretty good customer support in my opinion, so they will be missed. Hopefully I\u0026rsquo;m able to find a good alternative.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
