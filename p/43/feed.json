Here\u0026rsquo;s my \u003ca href=\"https://tumblr.roytang.net/post/181926569205/bumblebee-spoiler-free-review-attached-image\"\u003espoiler-free review\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the link says, I\u0026rsquo;ve been a big fan of Transformers since I was a kid, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d talk about that for a bit. The 1980s cartoon obviously, though I think only the first two seasons of that aired on local TV. I had quite a few G1 toys as well, though I think some of them may have been Chinese knockoffs. I remember I had an Optimus Prime, a Megatron (yes, the walther ppk with the robot mode with super thin legs), a small Powerglide, something like 3 out of 5 Aerialbots (no Silverbolt!), and so on. During their first trip to the US, my parents bought me a Metroplex, which was huge, that thing brought me so much joy and playtime. So much playtime that at some point I broke the toy at the hip. D:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother favorite was a G1 Sixshot!

I haven\u0026rsquo;t forgiven him to this day lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t actually have a very large TF toy collection when I was a kid. I know buying the toys back then must\u0026rsquo;ve been quite expensive, so understandably my folks only got me Transformers on special occasions. Even now as an adult with disposable income I find Transformers toys to be a bit pricey, so I fully understand!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I really got into and had a large collection of was the Marvel Transformers comics series. I remember I had the entire 80-issue Marvel run, plus the Headmasters and Universe limited series. It was the first comic series I really followed, I would eagerly look forward to buying the next issue every month. The stories were a lot more compelling and had a lot more continuity than just watching the cartoon. The stories were a lot more complex - in the cartoons, the Autobots were recognized by humans as heroes and the Decepticons as villains. While in the comics one of the main plot points was the humans mistrusting all transformers. Sadly, I have no idea what happened to my collection D:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn modern times though, I have also seriously enjoyed IDW\u0026rsquo;s Transformers line of comics, which had a much more space/Cybertron focus. Freed from the need to sell new toylines every so often, the IDW line was able to give better characterization to the Transformers and had such great writing, especially towards the end. This continuity recently ended and they\u0026rsquo;re starting up a new one I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to this March.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecently over the past five years or so, I started buying a few modern Transformers toys as well. I\u0026rsquo;m not a big collector or anything, so I only buy one  every so often, preferably when they\u0026rsquo;re on discount/sale, and only the smaller ones. It\u0026rsquo;s fun seeing how they\u0026rsquo;ve updated modern toys to have a lot more articulation and so on. I mostly have them standing on my desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#e67a1763814f415e146285eef24a270e-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2017/08/bxqzgqtgnyj/5a8664d528f473b51d204a3cafb560c3_hu39b1d2c426b68b2c3a8ac114da2db0f5_106656_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Twinferno! #transformers\" title=\"Twinferno! #transformers\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eTwinferno! #transformers (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"e67a1763814f415e146285eef24a270e-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2017/08/bxqzgqtgnyj/5a8664d528f473b51d204a3cafb560c3.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eTwinferno! #transformers\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"18 Jan 2019 5:56am\"\u003e18 Jan 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2017/08/bxqzgqtgnyj/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#34578a082b6fba6ecf3602d861b89405-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2017/10/bz6ml5japww/968b952f174b08a2e74d7aee290e949c_hu48ee178ede639c65ac0b6bff19b87609_112308_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Hound! #transformers\" title=\"Hound! #transformers\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eHound! #transformers (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"34578a082b6fba6ecf3602d861b89405-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2017/10/bz6ml5japww/968b952f174b08a2e74d7aee290e949c.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eHound! #transformers\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"18 Jan 2019 5:56am\"\u003e18 Jan 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2017/10/bz6ml5japww/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#fc7de5032265e5963e7fa341982d492e-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2019/01/bsmx_nfh8zf/66a1b4d8293843011b97c2dba0e8e4a9_hu999cec51ffb334121089c828b057ca65_67445_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Sunstreaker and Drag Strip #transformers #dilawan\" title=\"Sunstreaker and Drag Strip #transformers #dilawan\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eSunstreaker and Drag Strip #transformers #dilawan (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"fc7de5032265e5963e7fa341982d492e-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2019/01/bsmx_nfh8zf/66a1b4d8293843011b97c2dba0e8e4a9.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eSunstreaker and Drag Strip #transformers #dilawan\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"18 Jan 2019 5:56am\"\u003e18 Jan 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2019/01/bsmx_nfh8zf/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eTransformers was my first realy fandom, and something I\u0026rsquo;ll probably never get over, no matter how old I get.

That\u0026rsquo;s why things like phone interviews where people ask you to explain what the \u003ccode\u003evolatile\u003c/code\u003e keyword means in order to test whether you\u0026rsquo;re really a Java expert are BS.

But it gets easier when you realize not everyone knows everything all the time, and that not even the most senior people know everything. And that this ability to seek out advice and yes, even stackoverflow results, is part of the skillset you need to be developing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nature of the field is that we are almost always encountering new situations and new problems and new challenges (well, either that or be bored doing something irrelevant). That means a lot of the time when we are working on something worthwhile, we are figuring out things as we go.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I love a good debate. However, since the 2016 election season, I\u0026rsquo;ve cut back on this significantly. It\u0026rsquo;s only fun if the debaters aren\u0026rsquo;t fanatics and understand that the goal of debate isn\u0026rsquo;t victory, but progress\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efollowing at least one person on social media who I disagree with. Like, there\u0026rsquo;s this guy I follow on Twitter, an American expat living in the PH, and he\u0026rsquo;s so pro-Trump and pro-guns and so on. He is anti-Duterte though, which I find kind of fascinating. I also have a token pro-Duterte friend I still have unmuted on Facebook. It helps to get an occasional glimpse of what \u0026ldquo;the other side\u0026rdquo; is thinking. Maybe not too much though, and definitely avoid anyone too toxic.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ecomplaining about things. There are people who say you should avoid being so negative, but sometimes complaining about things can be cathartic. Also, if we didn\u0026rsquo;t voice disapproval about things going on in society, how would politicians know how to pivot? Complaining can sometimes be unreasonable, but all progress depends on the unreasonable man\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ediving into the comment section. Oh boy. Someone posted an article and warned not to go into the comments because they\u0026rsquo;re toxic, and I kind of take that as an invitation. It\u0026rsquo;s not advisable to do this all the time (you might get cancer), but sometimes I\u0026rsquo;ll dive in just to see how ridiculous humans are\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, some of these might be worth blog posts on their own.

The idea is getting rid of things that \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t give you joy\u0026rdquo;, so if having books give you joy, then obviously you keep your books, regardless of whether those books are challenging, difficult, depressing etc. Maybe the point is that you have to be constantly re-evaluating whether the hoarding is a positive spin in your life.

Well, my first answer was that those are just things I find interesting and may look into, but that\u0026rsquo;s not really an answer for the inspiration part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoftware development is a very wide field, one where the amount of things you can learn increases daily, so it\u0026rsquo;s almost impossible to keep up with everything. I think that having a natural tendency or curiosity towards learning new things is a distinct advantage in this industry. Having at least some passing familiarity with a wide range of technologies gives you more options in both job hunting and deciding on technical approaches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen interviewing developers, I often viewed it as a distinct advantage when a candidate invested their own time in trying out new tech. However, I realize that spending your own time to learn things on your own is another form of privilege that I have. Not all developers will have the free time or motivation to do that unless it was part of their work tasks. So insisting that developers should do this in their free time is a bit elitist to say the least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI read \u003ca href=\"http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2018/12/who-should-pay-for-upskilling-software-developers-individuals-or-employers/\"\u003ea blog post\u003c/a\u003e the other day saying it\u0026rsquo;s actually beneficial for companies to pay for their employees to learn stuff during work time. Quote:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiving developers time to learn makes good business sense in a competitive world where attracting and retaining skilled people is an advantage in the marketplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this makes sense, the problem with this is that from experience, many companies are running their projects on very tight schedules, some often almost always behind schedule, which makes giving developers free time for self-improvement will often be unattractive to higher-ups. I know that in my previous jobs, the only way I could justify learning a new technology would be if it was required or important for a specific upcoming project. In a way, having the space to allow developers this privilege is in itself a privilege that not all companies can afford.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSupposedly in the modern softeare industry, demand for developers is still high compared to supply so individuals should still have some leverage here and should vote with our feet. Younger or entry-level developers should ask companies about their policies for upskilling their employees and prefer those which give them more opportunities, and disfavor companies where the devs\u0026rsquo; technical knowledge tends to stagnate, so that companies will learn to adjust. Such factors can only be good for their career in the long run.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The story of the game itself is interesting, as Pope was more or less a one-man team, doing the design, code, music and art for the game himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar, the game places you in the role of a border inspector in a fictional 1980s totalitarian state called Arstotzka, a thinly-veiled parallel to communist East Germany and similar nations. As border inspector, you\u0026rsquo;re charged with inspecting the documents of people who want to enter the country, and your meagre salary depends on how many people you are able to correctly process in one day. The day-to-day gameplay tension is between your need to process as many people as possible so that you have enough to pay rent and feed your family; vs your desire to avoid making mistakes. Mistakes often come in the form of allowing entrants with discrepancies in their papers to pass through unchallenged, and making multiple mistakes in the same day is painful for your salary and endangers your family members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#be6c48b1b69c8295e4e30d0815d116ca-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2019/01/papers-please/papers-please_hu2d60a46d8ef2e2891c0d2fe52ac06588_137907_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"be6c48b1b69c8295e4e30d0815d116ca-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2019/01/papers-please/papers-please.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"13 Jan 2019 5:56am\"\u003e13 Jan 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gameplay is mostly attention to detail. At the start of a run, you only have one or two documents per entrant and it\u0026rsquo;s relatively simply: make sure their passport photo matches their appearance, make sure the passport isn\u0026rsquo;t expired, make sure it has a valid issuing city, etc. As the days pass, the Arstotzkan bureaucracy imposes more requirements upon entrants, making your job considerably harder. Towards the end of the story mode\u0026rsquo;s 31-day period you\u0026rsquo;ll be checking 4-6 different documents per entrant, making sure all their papers are valid and all the info on each document matches the others and so on. It has an element of tediousness reflecting the actual job you are doing, and yet is strangely engaging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story mode is fairly good, and it finds you dealing with challenges like smugglers, refugees, bribes, forged documents, a nosy press, and even a group of rebels plotting to take down the fascist Arstotzkan government, and the occasional terrorist attack on your booth. There are a number of endings, you can choose to play it straight, do your job as ordered and not support any criminal elements at all, and you and your family will live your same life in Arstotzka. Or you can risk everything by helping dissidents and refugees and criminals, and in the end you have to find a way to escape your homeland with your family. Or you could make the wrong decision at some points, and the game will end earlier than expected. Many of the noncritical entrants are randomly-generated I think, but the story-critical ones are preordained to come at specific times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nation-state of Arstotzka is surprisingly efficient in some ways - if you make a mistake such as letting through an entrant with an invalid passport, you are immediately issued a citation (something you come to dread in the game). So somehow the bureaucracy is able to know what is happening in your booth - yet they are unable to detect your interactions with the dissidents and some of the criminals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAchievements: The game provides an autosave each day you complete, and you can resume from any of the previous days, so that\u0026rsquo;s helpful for achievement hunting. I didn\u0026rsquo;t bother going for achievement completion yet though, as the remaining ones I missed seem to require too much backtracking, and there\u0026rsquo;s other games to play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game was a good buy, and perhaps even still a bit relevant in the modern world, despite it\u0026rsquo;s 1980s setting.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
