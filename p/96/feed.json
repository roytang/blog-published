The difference is just in semantics. The last price of the stock for any transaction isn\u0026rsquo;t the market value per se. The market value is \u0026ldquo;what people are willing to pay for the stock\u0026rdquo;. Usually financial analysts will have some general idea of the \u0026ldquo;expected value\u0026rdquo; of the stock, based on things like the company\u0026rsquo;s profits, historical performance, how quickly it\u0026rsquo;s growing, market sentiment, recent events, etc. Different analysts will use different formulas so there is no one true expected value, but typically they will fall in a small range. It\u0026rsquo;s part math/economics and part crowd psychology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I were to sell 1 of my stocks (worth $100) for $1 then clearly the market price would not go from 100 to 1. Is there an actual equation? Is the price changed by a certain X factor or weight applied to the number of stocks sold at that price?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this example, if other people valued the stock at $100 but you sold at $1, some very lucky person would likely buy your shares at $1 each, then immediately turn around and sell them at a bit less than $100 for a pretty good profit. Stock trades happen quickly, so most people wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even notice (although it would register as the \u0026ldquo;low\u0026rdquo; for that stock on that day)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo give you a better idea, here\u0026rsquo;s a screenshot of the details for a stock from an online broker I use for trading. (I only trade as a side hobby, in small amounts). This is on our local stock exchange (I\u0026rsquo;m not an American), but most stock exchanges should behave around the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://imgur.com/a/oByct\"\u003ehttp://imgur.com/a/oByct\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the upper right on the screenshot, you can see the value for \u0026ldquo;Previous\u0026rdquo;, this is how much the stock sold during the most recent transaction. \u0026ldquo;Last\u0026rdquo; is how much the stock sold for the tran\u003c/p\u003e\n",
