I\u0026rsquo;ve only been here twice, but I could imagine myself living here for an extended period of time. It solves my top three problems with Metro Manila: overly hot weather, poor transportation options, and poor internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth visits I found the temperatures to be within the generally agreeable range of around 5-25 degrees celsius. The low end is slightly too cold, but manageable. Of course, I haven\u0026rsquo;t experienced actual Japanese winter, so it\u0026rsquo;s probably colder then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTransportation is great and easy! There\u0026rsquo;s like twenty lines of trains or such _(OK, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really count, but there\u0026rsquo;s a lot!) _and a lot of buses too. The great thing is that the trains and buses run on very exact schedules. At trains stations or bus stops you\u0026rsquo;ll see a list of times \u003cem\u003eto the minute\u003c/em\u003e telling you when the next train or bus will arrive. That kind of thing would be unheard of in Metro Manila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the downsides is that the train lines can get a bit confusing. They\u0026rsquo;re not all interconnected either \u0026ndash; there\u0026rsquo;s some lines that are part of the Tokyo Metro, while some are part of JR (Japan Rail), and so on. It can cause some confusion for example some places might have both a Metro station and a JR station, and they might not be connected. The staff are always very helpful in the train stations though, feel free to ask them how to get to a particular station. They will try their best to help even if their English isn\u0026rsquo;t the best. Most stations will also have helpful signage showing maps and routes and stuff, and the trains themselves will have announcers telling you what the next station is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n       \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#11d3f8bbfdd13f862ba1e9dae7e6c197-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2015/11/10154222289158912/_hu319931c2e543c418fa0fa1eb79b01977_85598_bd5d9f53df750d5f0e836fa32b6a9590.jpg\" alt=\"Even though most signs aren\u0026#39;t in English, they should be fairly easy to understand\" title=\"Even though most signs aren\u0026#39;t in English, they should be fairly easy to understand\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eEven though most signs aren\u0026rsquo;t in English, they should be fairly easy to understand (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"11d3f8bbfdd13f862ba1e9dae7e6c197-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2015/11/10154222289158912/12299236_10154222295183912_2882233159207648588_n_10154222295183912.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eEven though most signs aren\u0026#39;t in English, they should be fairly easy to understand\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"13 Jun 2017 1:30am\"\u003e13 Jun 2017 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2015/11/10154222289158912/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eFor paying your transportation fares, there\u0026rsquo;s a few options, but for me the best one is to use an IC card \u0026ndash; these are reloadable cards that you can use on any train or bus in Tokyo. _(I have no idea what IC means.) _You can get one at the airport when you arrive \u0026ndash; there\u0026rsquo;s two providers, it\u0026rsquo;s either Suica or Pasmo and you can reload them at any train station. There\u0026rsquo;s also an option to get a 2-day or 3-day unlimited metro pass, which is a great idea if you plan to travel around Tokyo many times within a short period, but it only works with Metro lines which can be a bit restrictive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInternet in Tokyo is obviously very good of course. If you\u0026rsquo;re staying at an Airbnb, try to get one that provides you with a mobile wifi unit you can use while wandering about. Being a tourist these days is a lot easier with internet, given google maps and similar apps. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a mobile wifi unit, you can also leech free wifi from any 7-11 or train station!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe city is also very friendly to people who like to walk \u0026ndash; during this last trip I managed to walk from Asakusa to Akihabara at one point.

            "title": "Review: Persona 5 (You Never Saw It Coming)",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eMy first Persona game was Persona 4 Golden on the Vita \u0026ndash; a fantastic game. After that I dived into Persona 3 Portable and eventually the spin-off games Persona 4 Arena (and Ultimax) and Persona Q on 3DS. So it was no surprise that one of the game releases I was most looking forward to this year would be the next numbered game in the series: Persona 5 on the Playstation 4.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike P4G before it, the focus is on the school life of a young man forced into a new environment, interspersed with some good old JRPG dungeon crawling. You meet a ragtag group of misfits and somehow band together to save all of Japanese society from itself. Or something to that extent. This is just an excuse to dump some screens of P5, so let\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"#resources\"\u003eget that out of the way\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe JRPG side streamlines a lot of the problems from P4G: the main story dungeons are hand-built JRPG style dungeons and there are save points in between to make dying not so much of a pain. Even on normal difficulty, I still managed to die a few times \u0026ndash; notably to those Angel enemies that tend to suicide when low on life. And they brought back Persona negotiation! I didn\u0026rsquo;t appreciate this too much in \u003cem\u003eShin Megami Tensei IV\u003c/em\u003e as it felt a bit obtuse there, but here the Persona\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;personality\u0026rdquo; is shown which makes it easier to figure out the \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be leading a team of thieves there\u0026rsquo;s also a bit of a \u0026ldquo;stealth system\u0026rdquo; while dungeon crawling. It\u0026rsquo;s not a very deep stealth system, basically just hide behind corners and ambush enemies to gain battle advantage. The only problem is that the camera and the controls don\u0026rsquo;t always agree with your stealth plans, and sometimes the wrong button press can lead you to disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Phantom Thieves story is okay, although most of the plot is telegraphed ahead of time. I kind of liked P4G\u0026rsquo;s big murder mystery where you had to figure out who among your confidants was a big ‘ol bad guy. Here in P5, it\u0026rsquo;s painfully obvious who sold you out, even if you hadn\u0026rsquo;t noticed his \u0026ldquo;mistake\u0026rdquo; early on. That being said, there is a surprise twist near the end that caught me by surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompared to P4G, Persona 5 comes out at the height of social media, so while I like the P4G\u0026rsquo;s battle theme a bit better, P5\u0026rsquo;s battle music has managed to become a meme of its own:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"\u003e\n  \u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WUWQFnC2zqU\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI must\u0026rsquo;ve seen this video at least 50 times now due to some of my friends (you know who you are).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing I dislike about the Persona series is that because of the time management aspect of the game, a lot of things are missable. Since I tend to play RPGs without any guides or walkthroughs the first time around, it\u0026rsquo;s problematic for me. This means that on my first run through I missed completing the Confidants/Social Links, even though when I started the run I told myself I\u0026rsquo;d prioritize them over other activities. Definitely need a second run for the platinum. (Of course, I have yet to platinum P4G either due to a mistake I made during the second run~)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion: Despite (or maybe because of?) it\u0026rsquo;s ridiculousness, Persona 5 is a great game. Story is tight, and the dungeon crawling has been streamlined a lot. That being said, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely not a game for everyone, mostly because of the style. If you dislike Japanese stuff or anime or anything turn-based, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely not for you. Go play Call of Duty or something. For everyone else, enjoy one of the year\u0026rsquo;s best JRPGs (sorry FF15!)\u003c/p\u003e\n",
