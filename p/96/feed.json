You hook it up to the TV with an HDMI cable. You connect controllers or dongles via USB. Some controllers like the Steam Controller have wireless support. Network connectivity is through a LAN cable or via wi-fi. When it starts up, it searches your home network for computers running Steam, then it gives you a code that you type into the computer to grant access. Once that\u0026rsquo;s done, you can stream your games to the TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI first tried it out with a Logitech F710 Wireless Gamepad that I\u0026rsquo;ve had forever, since that\u0026rsquo;s explicitly meant for games on Windows. I plugged the dongle into the USB slot, but had some trouble at first with the controller not being detected or taking multiple button presses to respond. I wondered if it was lag due to a poor network and worried that I had just wasted some money. It turns out however, that the batteries on the controller simply needed replacing haha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen streaming to the Link, Steam uses Big Picture mode:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#a43ca86a3d39a711e12ca4f0ae12e5aa-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2017/07/hardware-review-steam-link/IMG_0211_hua4dc0f1e3b11eee3ac7aaf6d71fa8316_429308_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"a43ca86a3d39a711e12ca4f0ae12e5aa-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2017/07/hardware-review-steam-link/IMG_0211.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"6 Jul 2017 1:30am\"\u003e6 Jul 2017 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI tried a couple of games I got during the recent Steam sale.

Only annoyance so far is that the controller seems to become unresponsive if I bring up the Steam overlay midgame and try to go back to the game. (If the Link becomes unresponsive, you can still go to your computer and turn it off from there.) All the processing power still comes from your computer, so enjoying your Steam games on the TV still depends on having a decent computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile a lot of my Steam games are also available on consoles I have, it\u0026rsquo;s often cheaper to get them on Steam, so I\u0026rsquo;ve been looking towards restricting my console purchases to mostly exclusives only. Having the Steam Link helps with that, since I can still enjoy my Steam games on the TV and comfortably from a couch. All in all, a great experience, and a pretty good buy I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",

There\u0026rsquo;s a highly-competitive entrance exam and we\u0026rsquo;ve always been told that students who make it in are considered the \u0026ldquo;cream of the crop.\u0026rdquo; (I don\u0026rsquo;t know that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever heard anyone outside Pisay say that though.) Students are given full scholarships and a modest stipend, and are required to take a science course upon graduation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe movie was pretty good. It was more or less four short stories tied together, each one focused on a different year and following a particular batch of students through their stay at Pisay. Each story covers themes central to the Pisay experience: the difficulty of getting in, balancing academics and relationships, stipends, homesickness, trying to pass and failing, wanting to take a non-science course, and so on. The movie takes place during the school years from 1982-1986, basically during the fall of the dictatorship. So it also gets to cover some of the major events during that period and the senior year story has a stronger focus on activism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suspect that the movie will be a lot more appreciated by people who actually went to Pisay or people who lived through the 80s. (I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if teenagers in the 80s really used that much slang though.) I\u0026rsquo;m also not sure how accurate it is as a reflection of what it was to be a Pisay student in the 80s \u0026ndash; some things felt deliberately dramatized for the film\u0026rsquo;s sake. (That\u0026rsquo;s fine though.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis movie hits all the nostalgia points even though it takes place in a completely different time period than when I was there. I look back fondly on my days in Pisay and consider that an important formative period for me. It was challenging and rewarding and it was great to be among peers that shared many of my interests and many lifelong friendships were formed. Maybe someday I\u0026rsquo;ll write about the experience more, but probably one blog post wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I told him I didn\u0026rsquo;t believe such detailed rules shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be in the constitution \u0026ndash; that would unnecessarily tie us down to a specific model that we may or may not regret later on. I ended up declining to help him with his strange hobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eLegislative branch\u003c/strong\u003e are the a\u003cstrong\u003enalysts\u003c/strong\u003e.

They\u0026rsquo;re responsible for implementing the specs/laws in order to fulfill the requirements/constitution. They can decide the technical approach to use, as long as they satisfy the specs and the requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eJudiciary\u003c/strong\u003e is the \u003cstrong\u003eQA\u003c/strong\u003e, they review the work of the developers/executive and make sure they\u0026rsquo;re following the specs/laws and adhering to the requirements/constitution. Sometimes they even have to review the specs/laws themselves to make sure they aren\u0026rsquo;t contradicting the requirements/constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes a project is so large and you need to form smaller subteams to specialize in different areas or modules.

In theory at least, you choose the best people for the job. In government, who gets the job is determined by who is best at bamboozling the largest number of people to vote them in. Maybe someday we\u0026rsquo;ll get a meritocracy in government too, but until then I\u0026rsquo;m probably sticking to software development.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eSome time ago a friend from high school invited me to her daughter\u0026rsquo;s debut. And I had to proxy for her daughter\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003eninong\u003c/em\u003e and maybe give a few words on what it means to become an adult. My first two reactions were (1) wow I\u0026rsquo;m so old one of my batchmates has an eighteen-year-old daughter; and (2) what the heck would I know about becoming an adult? (I guess (3) was \u0026ldquo;oh, it\u0026rsquo;s a debut, so it\u0026rsquo;s formal and I have to dress up? I hate dressing up.\u0026quot;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong. I certainly consider myself an adult. But I have no idea when that transitioned happened. It\u0026rsquo;s not like when you turn eighteen you get some kind of brain implant that magically tells you how to live life and be independent and get a job and be responsible and do your taxes and all that stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf anything, I would say \u0026ldquo;becoming an adult\u0026rdquo; is a continuing task that keeps going on even when you\u0026rsquo;re nearing the big four-oh and beyond. I guess the zeitgeist is already aware of this though, given how we\u0026rsquo;ve coined the word \u0026ldquo;adulting\u0026rdquo;, which basically means doing stuff that makes you feel like an adult. Like going to the bank. Or signing contracts. Or even dressing up to go to a formal event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we were having dinner at the event, I jokingly said I should just give a message like \u0026ldquo;fake it til you make it.\u0026rdquo; I basically feel that\u0026rsquo;s what most of adulthood is: bumbling along until you figure out what the heck you\u0026rsquo;re doing. When you\u0026rsquo;re a kid you look up to the grown-ups who can go out and do anything they want and confidently do all these jobs and they know everything. But when you grow up you realize that\u0026rsquo;s not really how it works \u0026ndash; most of the time all the adults are struggling through life too, trying to figure out whatever thing they have to do that day, or even just trying to make it to the next paycheck. And you\u0026rsquo;re definitely going to miss being a kid. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s the sign that you\u0026rsquo;re already an adult, when you already miss being a kid?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ended up reading a few words from the actual \u003cem\u003eninong\u003c/em\u003e, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to give my own adulthood message. One of my other batchmates gave the debutante a copy of \u003cem\u003eThe Art of War\u003c/em\u003e as a gift, with the message that adulthood is basically warfare so she should be prepared. While I agree with that sentiment somewhat, I think for me the most important thing about becoming an adult would be learning to find your own voice and identity. That means figuring out what\u0026rsquo;s important to you and what values you hold. Being an adult isn\u0026rsquo;t easy, but knowing yourself in this way gives you a framework to guide you in your adulting decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
