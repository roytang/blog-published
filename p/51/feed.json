And the intolerant xenophobic aliens are cast as the aggressive antagonists, a problem to be resolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the current state of affairs, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit hard to be this optimistic about humanity\u0026rsquo;s future. Imagine if first contact with an alien species happened today, with the dominant (yet spiraling) superpower presided over by an openly racist president, and a wave of far-right nationalism across the world facing migrants everywhere. How welcoming would we be towards an entirely alien species, when we can\u0026rsquo;t even be welcoming to our own kind?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m sure there\u0026rsquo;s been fiction that covered this angle (\u003cem\u003eDistrict 9\u003c/em\u003e comes to mind), but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure there\u0026rsquo;s been any that covered the entire transition - from first contact to xenophobic hate groups to somehow leading to planetary unification and eventually to a Star Trek-like future. It would at least be an interesting story, and if we can speculate about how to bring that future about, it might even help us with our present problems too.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I\u0026rsquo;m sure it bothers other people too, but it annoys me a bit disproportionately. I\u0026rsquo;m an introvert by nature so every unexpected interaction \u0026ndash; even just the effort to shake my head at whatever they\u0026rsquo;re handing out \u0026ndash; takes away from my precious pool of socializing points. In addition to those people trying to flag you down as you walk about the mall, I also dislike it when salespeople in a store approach me unsolicited while I\u0026rsquo;m browsing, offering their help. If I need help, I\u0026rsquo;ll ask for it!

Sometimes I\u0026rsquo;ll be in a \u0026ldquo;exploring\u0026rdquo; mode, and will probably be more amenable to that kind of thing, but that\u0026rsquo;s a bit rare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand of course that people need to make a living and that stuff needs to be told and there \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e actually people who could use help or might be interested in that condo flier. I wish there was some way to \u0026ldquo;opt out\u0026rdquo; of unsolicited marketing in real life. Maybe some sort of statement shirt I could wear that says \u0026ldquo;Strangers: Don\u0026rsquo;t talk to me unless I talk to you.\u0026rdquo; Since there\u0026rsquo;s not, I just try to avoid contact and maybe have a scary expression on my face. It rarely works though.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "title": "The Quezon City Public Library",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI pass by the Quezon City Hall every so often, and I\u0026rsquo;ve always been curious about the \u003ca href=\"http://www.quezoncitypubliclibrary.org\"\u003eQC public library\u003c/a\u003e they have there. It got a bit of press a while back about how it was a nice place to hang out (for a government institution at least), so I had a todo list item about checking it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, last week I did! I passed by on a weekday afternoon about 4pm after running some errands. The library was open until 7pm, so the timing was fine. I went up to the building and the guard asked me what my business was and I said I just wanted to check out the library. He told me that bags weren\u0026rsquo;t allowed inside so I had to go to the baggage counter. Oops, luckily I only had my sling bag and not the full backpack I usually had when carrying a laptop. I left my sling bag at the counter and went inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe space wasn\u0026rsquo;t as large as I thought it would be - the pictures on the website made it seem a bit larger in my imagination. The tables and seats were maybe 75% full, mostly with students and library staff. The main library area was in the first floor. Second floor seemed to be some offices and an outdoor cafe, I didn\u0026rsquo;t explore the second floor too much. I walked around the ground floor rooms for a bit, browsing the shelves. Aside from the main area, there was a separate room specialized for Philippine history and such, a room for kids\u0026rsquo; books, a \u0026ldquo;puppeteers room\u0026rdquo;, and a smaller round room with periodicals and such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was also a small section for fiction books in the main area; the selection was decent, mostly mainstream titles like Hunger Games, some Robert Ludlum, a few sci-fi/fantasy titles, and so on. For the reference materials, it was about what you\u0026rsquo;d expect from a public library - most of it was dated and donated. The tech/comptuers sections had the sort of obsolete computer books you\u0026rsquo;d find at book sale - like \u0026ldquo;How to use Microsoft Access 95\u0026rdquo;, that kind of thing. There were The World is Flat by Friedman, and Obama\u0026rsquo;s book about hope or such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone showed me how to use one of the computer kiosks to search the library\u0026rsquo;s catalog, and I was told it should be accessible via the website, so that seems fine. If you wanted to know whether they had a particular book, you could just check the website first. Also, the catalog said they had some Thor comics, but they were in the children\u0026rsquo;s corner, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like going in there lol. I also tried connecting my iPad to the local wifi, but the internet wasn\u0026rsquo;t very good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI came away not too impressed with the library. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what I was expecting. I guess I was kind of hoping to see if it was a good place to hang out, maybe if I was stranded near city hall due to traffic or waiting around in that area for something. It seems like a fairly good place for students from nearby schools though, especially those with no internet access at home. At least my curiosity was sated and I managed to tick an item off my todo list!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

(Yes, my bucket list items are that level lol)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n    On \n    \u003ca href=\"/2019/01/1085123142467506176/\"\u003e\u003ctime datetime=\"2019-01-15 10:34:52\"\u003e15 Jan 2019 10:34am\u003c/time\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n    I wrote:\n    \u003cblockquote\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eAchievement unlocked: play chess in the park with strangers (and lose badly)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen watching TV/movies, I was always fascinated by those scenes where people are in the park playing chess and I wanted to play chess in the park with strangers too. In hindsight, it makes more sense that people would actually be playing with people they knew, but the idea of playing chess with strangers seemed fun to me for some reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the other day I was passing by \u003ca href=\"/2018/10/the-qc-memorial-circle/\"\u003ethe QC circle\u003c/a\u003e (as is my wont), and I saw a bunch of white-haired old men playing chess under some tent-like structure. There were four chess sets set up and two of the boards were occupied with ongoing games. I strolled over and started watching the games. One of the guys sitting at the other two tables asked me if I wanted to play, just some quick games. There were chess clocks too! So we could play timed games, 10 minutes each. They told me the sets belonged to one of the gentlemen currently playing, and he just asked for some small amount in coins for playing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter some mumbling that I\u0026rsquo;m very out of practice I pretended to reluctantly agree. We set up the clock and went at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was true that I was out of practice. Most of my chess-playing days were back when I was in HS/college, though I did occasionally play when my old company had chess as a sportsfest event. (That didn\u0026rsquo;t last too long because one of our employees was an actual competitive chess player, and another one was a varsity player in college, so I never got beyond the top 4\u0026hellip;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst game I was black, and my openings were good enough, and we had a decent back and forth in the midgame, but I was behind in pawns and near the end game he forced a queen exchange and my king couldn\u0026rsquo;t handle the pawns in time. I almost ran out of time on the chess clock too!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI agreed to a second game, this time I was white and performed much worse. It was easier for me playing black and just reacting to what the opponent was doing, but as white I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any kind of decent plan and all my attacks ended horribly until I fell to a knight fork attack that took out a rook, then got trapped in a situation where I had to give up the queen to avoid a checkmate. I had already run out the clock by that point, so I just quit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey wanted to play some more, but it was late and dusk had fallen so I begged off and thanked them for the games. I gave the guy 15 pesos for the use of the sets, seemed fine. They invited me to play again if I see them there, apparently they do this often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I would have felt much better if I had manage to win at least one game, but I walked away satisfied anyway. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why I was so excited at the idea - since I do Magic tournaments, playing against strangers isn\u0026rsquo;t new to me. I guess there\u0026rsquo;s something about participating in an activity I don\u0026rsquo;t do too often, and having strangers judge my plays, that made it a bit exciting. And in any case, it did make me think about playing chess online - is Yahoo chess still a thing? Lol. Well, I already have a lot of daily gaming habits, let\u0026rsquo;s see if I can fit that in sometime.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The 1980s cartoon obviously, though I think only the first two seasons of that aired on local TV. I had quite a few G1 toys as well, though I think some of them may have been Chinese knockoffs. I remember I had an Optimus Prime, a Megatron (yes, the walther ppk with the robot mode with super thin legs), a small Powerglide, something like 3 out of 5 Aerialbots (no Silverbolt!), and so on. During their first trip to the US, my parents bought me a Metroplex, which was huge, that thing brought me so much joy and playtime. So much playtime that at some point I broke the toy at the hip. D:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother favorite was a G1 Sixshot!

I haven\u0026rsquo;t forgiven him to this day lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t actually have a very large TF toy collection when I was a kid. I know buying the toys back then must\u0026rsquo;ve been quite expensive, so understandably my folks only got me Transformers on special occasions. Even now as an adult with disposable income I find Transformers toys to be a bit pricey, so I fully understand!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I really got into and had a large collection of was the Marvel Transformers comics series. I remember I had the entire 80-issue Marvel run, plus the Headmasters and Universe limited series. It was the first comic series I really followed, I would eagerly look forward to buying the next issue every month. The stories were a lot more compelling and had a lot more continuity than just watching the cartoon. The stories were a lot more complex - in the cartoons, the Autobots were recognized by humans as heroes and the Decepticons as villains. While in the comics one of the main plot points was the humans mistrusting all transformers. Sadly, I have no idea what happened to my collection D:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn modern times though, I have also seriously enjoyed IDW\u0026rsquo;s Transformers line of comics, which had a much more space/Cybertron focus. Freed from the need to sell new toylines every so often, the IDW line was able to give better characterization to the Transformers and had such great writing, especially towards the end. This continuity recently ended and they\u0026rsquo;re starting up a new one I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to this March.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecently over the past five years or so, I started buying a few modern Transformers toys as well. I\u0026rsquo;m not a big collector or anything, so I only buy one  every so often, preferably when they\u0026rsquo;re on discount/sale, and only the smaller ones. It\u0026rsquo;s fun seeing how they\u0026rsquo;ve updated modern toys to have a lot more articulation and so on. I mostly have them standing on my desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#e67a1763814f415e146285eef24a270e-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2017/08/bxqzgqtgnyj/5a8664d528f473b51d204a3cafb560c3_hu39b1d2c426b68b2c3a8ac114da2db0f5_106656_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Twinferno! #transformers\" title=\"Twinferno! #transformers\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eTwinferno! #transformers (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"e67a1763814f415e146285eef24a270e-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2017/08/bxqzgqtgnyj/5a8664d528f473b51d204a3cafb560c3.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eTwinferno! #transformers\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"18 Jan 2019 5:56am\"\u003e18 Jan 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2017/08/bxqzgqtgnyj/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#34578a082b6fba6ecf3602d861b89405-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2017/10/bz6ml5japww/968b952f174b08a2e74d7aee290e949c_hu48ee178ede639c65ac0b6bff19b87609_112308_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Hound! #transformers\" title=\"Hound! #transformers\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eHound! #transformers (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"34578a082b6fba6ecf3602d861b89405-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2017/10/bz6ml5japww/968b952f174b08a2e74d7aee290e949c.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eHound! #transformers\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"18 Jan 2019 5:56am\"\u003e18 Jan 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2017/10/bz6ml5japww/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#fc7de5032265e5963e7fa341982d492e-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2019/01/bsmx_nfh8zf/66a1b4d8293843011b97c2dba0e8e4a9_hu999cec51ffb334121089c828b057ca65_67445_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Sunstreaker and Drag Strip #transformers #dilawan\" title=\"Sunstreaker and Drag Strip #transformers #dilawan\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eSunstreaker and Drag Strip #transformers #dilawan (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"fc7de5032265e5963e7fa341982d492e-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2019/01/bsmx_nfh8zf/66a1b4d8293843011b97c2dba0e8e4a9.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eSunstreaker and Drag Strip #transformers #dilawan\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"18 Jan 2019 5:56am\"\u003e18 Jan 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2019/01/bsmx_nfh8zf/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eTransformers was my first realy fandom, and something I\u0026rsquo;ll probably never get over, no matter how old I get.

But it gets easier when you realize not everyone knows everything all the time, and that not even the most senior people know everything. And that this ability to seek out advice and yes, even stackoverflow results, is part of the skillset you need to be developing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nature of the field is that we are almost always encountering new situations and new problems and new challenges (well, either that or be bored doing something irrelevant). That means a lot of the time when we are working on something worthwhile, we are figuring out things as we go.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
