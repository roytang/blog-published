If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.\"\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother article about it that I like is this Medium post titled \u003ca href=\"https://extranewsfeed.com/tolerance-is-not-a-moral-precept-1af7007d6376\"\u003eTolerance is not a Moral Precept\u003c/a\u003e.

It means that we accept that people may be different from us, in their customs, in their behavior, in their dress, in their sex lives, and that if this doesn’t directly affect our lives, it is none of our business.

It was supposed to be a straightforward yum upgrade, which meant of course there would be a problem. The problem turned out to be one of the SOAP calls to a third-party service. After a bunch of retries and log checking, we found that OpenSSL was complaining that the third party’s certificate didn’t have enough bits in the Diffie-Hellman (DH) parameters. Complaining to the third party would have taken forever, so we had to find a workaround ourselves. I had previously been told that OpenSSL was the same version before and after the upgrade, but after we did our own checking, we found that there was a minor version difference. That led to a lot of searching until I managed to \u003ca href=\"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2017:0660\"\u003efind release notes from Red Hat\u003c/a\u003e (which was upstream of CentOS). The release notes linked us to \u003ca href=\"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1335921\"\u003ethis bug\u003c/a\u003e which gave us the workaround we needed.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI had been working on a Python script that would fetch JSON from an external URL and process it. Local dev environment was running Python 3.6. Everything worked well. When I went to deploy it to my server, I found that my host only supported Python 3.5. I was like surely there wouldn’t be a problem, so of course there was. It turns out the \u003ca href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#json\"\u003ejson load functions added support for binary inputs in 3.6\u003c/a\u003e, which I had been using all this time.

And of course there\u0026rsquo;s the common social problem nowadays of always checking your phone compulsively while you have it in your hand.

I mean, for sure I could come up with a killer game design idea that I actually manage to implement that becomes a hit with a niche market and suddenly takes off. There\u0026rsquo;s always that chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I have no interest in studying markets or marketing or promotion or selling to people in general. And a lot of my interests are niche so that gets in the way of economic feasibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike when I have an idea for something I want to build, I don\u0026rsquo;t think about marketing opportunity or economic feasibility or anything. I just start building it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like building things. I like solving problems. I like studying systems and figuring out how they work and what problems they have that are solvable and what not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the idea of having to sell those solutions, to find people to finance my time, to do marketing work and reaching out and networking and promotion, etc. For me, that\u0026rsquo;s just hard work that I\u0026rsquo;m inclined to avoid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I do avoid a lot of hard work that I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do. This is probably why I tend to leave a lot of half-finished projects behind. This is why it\u0026rsquo;s best for me to be working in a team and having other people willing to do those tasks I dislike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Well, then why not hire some people to do that other work for you?\u0026rdquo; I can do that, sure. That involves some capital, but I have some capital and surely I can raise more if needed. But doing the due diligence to figure out whether the idea is feasible enough to work on, meaning the investment of capital is worth it \u0026ndash; that in itself is something I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do. What more trying to convince people to raise capital for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd again, because of my niche interests, a lot of ideas that I tend to think of tend to fall into the \u0026ldquo;I think this is cool, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be likely to be profitable\u0026rdquo; bucket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell-meaning go-getters will be all \u0026ldquo;Well, that\u0026rsquo;s just a defeatist attitude! You can do anything if you put your mind to it! Stop thinking of reasons why you can\u0026rsquo;t do it!\u0026rdquo; Yes it\u0026rsquo;s true. It\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of attitude. The human brain is just another system after all, and one only needs to study one\u0026rsquo;s one own system to figure out how to maybe hack it to figure out how to get into some kind of \u0026ldquo;entrepreneurship mode.\u0026rdquo; But again, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t interest me. Maybe someday it will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0026rsquo;t speak for the future, but at the moment I think the most likely way I\u0026rsquo;d become an entrepreneur is by accident. Stumble into something that happens to be profitable. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I can do it on purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realize this post is kind of a downer. A really negative post full of \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t do it\u0026rdquo; kind of statements. Don\u0026rsquo;t take this to mean I don\u0026rsquo;t appreciate people sharing entrepreneurship advice or articles, I do. And please keep them coming. But I think it\u0026rsquo;s worth the time to study your own psyche and understand what holds you back so that when the time comes you know what you need to be able to set aside. Who knows, maybe next week I\u0026rsquo;ll be writing why I should and can be an entrepreneur.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

You will be tempted to throw everything away and start over and rebuild everything from scratch. You wonder who made all of these past decisions that have resulted in such a terrible system and what the heck were they thinking?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, you can\u0026rsquo;t just throw everything away. People still need to eat, and the system users still need to do their work. You can instead do some kind of system-wide one-time big-time change. But the problem with that is\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChange Is Risk\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore often than not, the existing system works. Or at least, it works well enough that the system isn\u0026rsquo;t totally unusable. The software system\u0026rsquo;s users can still perform the needed functions, albeit maybe with some number of bugs. The state\u0026rsquo;s citizens can still mostly survive and there aren\u0026rsquo;t riots on the streets or people dying of mass starvation or anything like that. Life is hard, but there is life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking to change things means some level of risk, and of course some level of cost. There are several possible outcomes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eChange happens and things become better. Hooray! The change was worth it!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eChange happens but things remain the same. Uhh, why did we spend all that time and effort for the change then?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eChange happens but things actually get worse. This is the worst of all worlds. We wasted time and money and energy and things got worse! Why didn\u0026rsquo;t anyone warn us this could happen!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften we can\u0026rsquo;t predict with any certainty which outcome will happen. We can make educated guesses, by comparing to past experiences or other people\u0026rsquo;s experiences. **But each software project is unique. **This is kind of a blessing since it means it\u0026rsquo;s hard for programmers to run out of work. But it\u0026rsquo;s also more of a curse since it means we can only reuse small parts from other projects with no guarantee that the entire whole will work cohesively together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCountries/states/governments are unique too. Each people has their own geography, culture and history and unique problems arising from such. And to make matters worse, countries are made up of people, and most people will have differing opinions on which things are better and which things are worse. This makes it much more difficult to form a consensus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRisk Management\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e****Granted that change is risk.

The most common scenario is when someone messages you like \u0026ldquo;Hey, can we talk later?\u0026rdquo; with no additional context whatsoever. Depending on your relationship with that person, you might start to overthink things. \u0026ldquo;Am I in trouble? Did something go wrong? What did I tell her last time? Did I forget to submit something?\u0026rdquo; And so on. Relevant tweet:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Edit: Um, the relevant tweet seems to have been deleted :/)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich is nonsense of course. Without any additional context, there is an equal likelihood the discussion would end up being about something positive or neutral, instead of something negative. Anxiety is caused mostly by fear and uncertainty, magnified by a time gap. That time gap is filled by a hyperactive imagination with worst-case scenarios.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I said, I\u0026rsquo;m a well-adjusted adult, so I rarely let this sort of anxiety affect me, although I know I am more vulnerable to it when I am stressed by other factors. For me, the key to avoiding this problem is to practice some level of detachment (something I need to improve at as well), and also to keep oneself busy, to prevent the hyperactive mind from going into overdrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
