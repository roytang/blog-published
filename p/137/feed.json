            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eGrammar note: \u0026ldquo;Biased\u0026rdquo; is an adjective. \u0026ldquo;Bias\u0026rdquo; is a noun. It is not appropriate to say that a person or an entity \u0026ldquo;is bias\u0026rdquo;. Unless you are talking to like a prejudice elemental or something (takes note of that for hypothetical hipster RPG)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a (long-winded) discussion during the recent election period, someone told me that I \u0026ldquo;obviously had a bias\u0026rdquo; and my answer was \u0026ldquo;Of course I do! Everyone does!\u0026rdquo; People have different histories and backgrounds which means for any given topic they are likely to start from different points. These biases are perfectly okay and healthy and they\u0026rsquo;re called opinions. (Cue quote about opinions being like assholes). Example: I\u0026rsquo;m not in favor of the death penalty therefore I\u0026rsquo;m biased against candidates that want to promote it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough we are all entitled to our own opinions, many times we are called upon to make objective judgments. Common examples are jury trials, elections, or when you\u0026rsquo;re a judge in some contest. During these instances we have to be careful to weigh our own biases and opinions objectively to make sure we are giving a fair judgment\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat you do need to note is when you become subject to \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias\"\u003ecognitive biases\u003c/a\u003e \u0026ndash; unconscious, automatic influences on human judgment and decision making that reliably produce reasoning errors. \u003cstrong\u003eBe wary of your own cognitive biases\u003c/strong\u003e and try to mitigate or compensate for them in your reasoning\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResearch has also shown that \u003ca href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2015/june/bias-blind-spot.html\"\u003epeople have a bias blind spot\u003c/a\u003e. This means \u003cstrong\u003ewe think we are less biased than other people\u003c/strong\u003e. This is why it is important to \u003cstrong\u003eexamine your own arguments\u003c/strong\u003e from time to time to see whether you are subject to any of the known cognitive biases. When there is a need to be objective, we need to be extra critical of our own arguments\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften, it is simply a matter of shifting your perspective: think about how a situation looks to people with an opposing point of view to balance out your own views. A sure sign of bias is that you are only aware of the positives of your own point of view and the negatives in others\u0026rsquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"\u003e\n  \u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\n    Common Evidence of Bias: Your candidate is the best, and you can find absolutely nothing good to say about other candidates.\n  \u003c/p\u003e\u0026mdash; Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) \n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/741361923061653504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eJune 10, 2016\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eChastising Duterte is not mutually exclusive with supporting De Lima.

This traps you in an echo chamber of people constantly reinforcing the same ideas. A friend and I recently were discussing how certain people react poorly to differing opinions and theorized that maybe that person grew up surrounded by people who enabled his biases\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead,** seek out different opinions. **Continuing from the death penalty example above, I don\u0026rsquo;t shut out discussion from friends who I know to be pro-death penalty. I still read their threads and try to understand their point of view. Listening to a wide variety of different opinions will tend to cancel out your biases with time and will lead towards more objective thinking. For example, when conducting a performance assessment of a team member (something I\u0026rsquo;ve done often for the past decade or so!), I tend to get other people\u0026rsquo;s opinions first to contrast with my own, and will often ask someone else whether I might be biased in certain situations. The risk of personal bias is mitigated by sourcing different opinions\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the day, we probably can\u0026rsquo;t completely eliminate our own biases, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we stop trying to be more objective in our thoughts and discussions and decisions\u003c/p\u003e\n",
