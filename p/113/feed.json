He came backstage and explained why you can\u0026rsquo;t wear your brassiere in other galaxies, and I have a sense you will be going to outer space very soon, so here\u0026rsquo;s why you cannot wear your brassiere, per George. So, what happens is you go to space and you become weightless. So far so good, right? But then your body expands??? But your bra doesn\u0026rsquo;t- so you get strangled by your own bra. Now I think that this would make a fantastic obit- so I tell my younger friends that no matter how I go, I want it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e― Carrie Fisher, Wishful Drinking\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are people a lot more cluttered than me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTowards the start of the year, I told myself I should throw out/get rid of/dispose of at least one thing a day. It\u0026rsquo;s one of those relatively easy things to do I haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to maintain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do we keep around all this old stuff we don\u0026rsquo;t need?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of it may be from a mentality of scarcity \u0026ndash; we don\u0026rsquo;t want to throw away stuff for fear of finding out that we may need it later. But reasonably, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t used a thing in years, maybe you\u0026rsquo;ll never use it and even if you had need of one, how difficult would it be to find one again? Some kind of pack rat mentality. I know a few of my friends who would be very familiar with this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther things we keep around for some sort of nostalgia or as keepsakes of other people and faraway places. That\u0026rsquo;s fine I suppose, but maybe one shouldn\u0026rsquo;t put too much value in things that don\u0026rsquo;t actually have them. Case in point: I have a bunch of rocks here from different countries I visited in Europe, haha. Pictures, letters, and other personal keepsakes one might consider digitizing and storing in the cloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving a cluttered space has a cost, one that\u0026rsquo;s difficult to ascertain or quantify. Not only do things look messy, but things are harder to find when you need them most. There\u0026rsquo;s also a strange satisfaction that comes from achieving a fine, organized space (before it all falls back into chaos of course.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "title": "Learning a New Programming Language",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eRelated: \u003ca href=\"http://roytang.net/2016/12/learning-new-skills/\"\u003eLearning new skills\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile many people working as programmers/software developers are happy enough specializing in a single programming language or platform, I generally consider it a better idea to have a wider toolset and the ability to easily pick up new programming languages as needed. The benefits should be obvious: when you have a wide variety of tools under your belt and are able to quickly learn to use a new tool, the number of work options you have increases greatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHappily, programming languages share a lot of similar constructs. Only your first programming language (when you first learn programming) should provide you with any difficulty \u0026ndash; once you\u0026rsquo;ve cleared that hurdle, learning additional programming languages shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too much of a concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou typically start with syntax, variable declarations, function declarations and program flow (loops, conditionals and so on). Some languages may have a strange syntax that don\u0026rsquo;t share much in common with other programming languages, but that\u0026rsquo;s pretty much not a concern as long as you have access to a modern-day compiler that will tell you when you stray from the desired syntax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find that learning a programming language is best done the same way you actually program \u0026ndash; iteratively. Learn something new, try it out, modify it a bit, try it out, and so on. I once had to help someone prepare for a programming interview where he would be expected to know C++. He had learned it before in college, but hadn\u0026rsquo;t used it for a few years, but for some reason he stuck to reading up on it instead of taking my suggestion to install a compiler and actually try out all the suggestions. (He ended up passing the interview, but that was luckily because they didn\u0026rsquo;t ask too much about syntax.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt also helps a lot to learn about theory and terms and whatnot. Like for object-oriented  programming, it helps to know and understand the concepts behind polymorphism, inheritance, abstract classes and so on. When studying different programming languages, you can then easily compare how they are done in one language vs another, making it easier for you to carry over design concepts to the new language you are learning. Being familiar with the terms and vocabulary also helps you communicate better with mentors, teachers, and fellow learners studying the same language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding small toy applications with the new programming language is a great way to learn too. Or maybe if you had a certain project in mind that you wanted to do, you could use the new language with it. Slightly related: When I was consulting with a startup on developing a new product, I asked the CTO whether he preferred to use a technology stack that the developers were more familiar with (to reduce learning costs) or whether he wanted to try this different language that neither of us had tried before, and he told me that one of the great things about being in a startup was that he could choose to do new projects with new technologies to expand their horizons and not have to listen to higher-ups shut it down for fear of increased costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the longest time, I tried to learn at least one new programming language/platform a year. For 2016, it was Unity/C#, although I\u0026rsquo;ve also started studying Node.js in the past month or so. I hope it\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;m able to keep up, even as I\u0026rsquo;m trying to explore new skills other than programming.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
