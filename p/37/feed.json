You can do:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003epsql [database-user-name] -d [database-name]\u003c/code\u003e and it should prompt you for your password.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when I tried this today, I got:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003epsql: FATAL:  Peer authentication failed for user \u0026quot;[database-user-name]\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem had something to do with the permissions available to my ssh user. The workaround was to tell psql I was doing this from the local machine:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003epsql: FATAL:  Peer authentication failed for user \u0026quot;[database-user-name]\u0026quot; -h 127.0.0.1\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorked fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter connecting, you get a prompt that looks like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003e[database-name]=# \u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, when I connected today, I had to do some queries, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t superfamiliar with the project\u0026rsquo;s schema, and would have to muck around to find table names and field names. The psql shell provides some handy shortcuts for that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\\dt\u003c/code\u003e - outputs a list of tables\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\\d [table-name]\u003c/code\u003e - describes a specific table, showing field names\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also just directly run an SQL query, just make sure to end it with a semicolon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the command outputs a lot of records, it will show them to you in a page-able vim-like format. You can recognize it when it stops with a \u003ccode\u003e:\u003c/code\u003e after each page and you can hit spacebar to proceed, and at the end it shows \u003ccode\u003e(END)\u003c/code\u003e. And like vim, you might not know how to get out of this view. I had to google it myself, you just have to hit \u003ccode\u003eq\u003c/code\u003e to go back to the psql shell.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThis past weekend was \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evo_2019\"\u003eEVO 2019\u003c/a\u003e, the world\u0026rsquo;s biggest celebrations of fighting games. If I had stayed in the US another month maybe I could have gone to Vegas to attend and lose badly. Instead, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d write about fighting games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI consider fighting games one of my weaknesses, in the sense that (a) I easily succumb to the temptation to spend money on them; and (b) I\u0026rsquo;m not very good at them. Example of (a): I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I\u0026rsquo;ve purchased Street Fighter IV on at least 4 different platforms, including all DLC. Example of (b): I have yet to advance past bronze rank in online Street Fighter V, despite having purchased the game at launch back in 2016.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike many in my generation, I got my introduction to fighting games with the arcade release of \u003cstrong\u003eStreet Fighter II\u003c/strong\u003e in the arcades in the early 90s. Prior to that, my arcade experience had been mostly side-scrolling beat-em ups like the old \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgF_VMQ19aA\"\u003eX-Men arcade game\u003c/a\u003e. I remember my brother and I literally playing the SF2 arcade release like \u0026ldquo;scrubs\u0026rdquo;, i.e., often times scrubbing our palms over the buttons trying to get moves going. Back then arcade machines didn\u0026rsquo;t come with instructions and you had to figure out how the character moves worked by experimentation. I remember he preferred playing Ryu/Ken, while I liked Guile. We didn\u0026rsquo;t really do combos, most of the time we just did Flash Kicks (which we called the \u0026ldquo;Slice\u0026rdquo;), Sonic Booms, Fireballs, and Dragon Punches most of the time. We also found it hard to understand what the Japanese characters were saying; we called Ryu\u0026rsquo;s hurricane kick the \u0026ldquo;Kat-kat-nougat\u0026rdquo; because that\u0026rsquo;s what it sounded like he was shouting! The other characters were mysteries! We didn\u0026rsquo;t know how Zangief worked for example. And I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure we never finished the arcade mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStreet Fighter II eventually got a home release, I remember playing it for the first time at a friend\u0026rsquo;s house when he got his copy first. We would be playing SF2 on the SNES a lot. I remember the annoyance when playing SF2 at another person\u0026rsquo;s house, I\u0026rsquo;d have to configure my controller because I didn\u0026rsquo;t use the default button layout. I used a layout called \u0026ldquo;YXLBAR\u0026rdquo; (with the heavy attacks on the SNES shoulder buttons) instead of the default \u0026ldquo;YLXBRA\u0026rdquo;. Rumor has it someone used an insane layout like \u0026ldquo;YBAXLR\u0026rdquo;. I also remember seeing the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY0KBMkvDyo\"\u003earcade intro for the updated \u003cstrong\u003eSuper Street Fighter II\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and being so amazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#9255053aacc428b06549560c2419f614-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2019/08/fighting-games/ssf2shinkuhadouken_huf0b9fa7f4cb0977fcabeeae76d376d02_338304_300x0_resize_box.gif\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"9255053aacc428b06549560c2419f614-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2019/08/fighting-games/ssf2shinkuhadouken.gif\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"7 Aug 2019 12:00am\"\u003e7 Aug 2019 12:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe tried out some other fighting game franchises on SNES too, like the Japanese \u003cstrong\u003eDragonball Butoden\u003c/strong\u003e series, a TMNT fighting game, and the \u003cstrong\u003eJustice League Task Force\u003c/strong\u003e fighting game. On the PC, we also had a copy of \u003cstrong\u003eMortal Kombat\u003c/strong\u003e 1. I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure our PC could handle color back then, we may have been playing Mortal Kombat in black and white! We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have controllers for the PC back then, so we had to play with two players to one keyboard, and if you held down four buttons or more on your side, the keyboard couldn\u0026rsquo;t register any more additional inputs so your opponent couldn\u0026rsquo;t move!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from playing with my brothers, me and some HS friends often got together at a friend\u0026rsquo;s house and would be playing fighting games \u0026lsquo;til the early morning hours. We got to try a lot more fighting games in the PS1 era, since games were cheaper in the PH then. A lot of it was still capcom stuff: \u003cstrong\u003eStreet Fighter Alpha 3\u003c/strong\u003e, the \u003cstrong\u003eStreet Fighter EX\u003c/strong\u003e series, \u003cstrong\u003eRival Schools\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eDarkstalkers\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eXmen vs Street Fighter\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eMarvel vs Capcom\u003c/strong\u003e 1. There were also the games that were similar in command style like the King of Fighters series and Guilty Gear. We would also sometimes try the 3d games like \u003cstrong\u003eTekken\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eSoul Edge\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eVirtua Fighter\u003c/strong\u003e, or \u003cstrong\u003eBattle Arena\u003c/strong\u003e Toshinden but those played a lot differently than SF-style games and they never really caught on with our group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe PS2 era brought with it one of our most played games of all time: the legendary \u003cstrong\u003eCapcom vs SNK 2\u003c/strong\u003e. With a ridiculous 48 characters and six different \u0026ldquo;grooves\u0026rdquo; or playstyles to choose from, there was a lot of variety in the game and we rarely got tired of it. The \u003cstrong\u003eStreet Fighter III\u003c/strong\u003e series also came out at around the same time, but we never got too much into it because \u003cstrong\u003eNew Generation\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eSecond Impact\u003c/strong\u003e only had home releases on Dreamcast; I remember we did play \u003cstrong\u003eThird Strike\u003c/strong\u003e for a while, but that was quickly overshadowed when CvS2 came out. There were a lot of other Capcom/SNK/other fighting game releases we tried out at this time too, but CvS2 was the main one I remember from this era.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the PS3 era came \u003cstrong\u003eStreet Fighter IV\u003c/strong\u003e and a new dimension: online play! This is where I got my first indication that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t very good at fighting games, despite enjoying them so much. I was fine when playing on the couch casually with my friends, but online was another matter entirely. I remember being so frustrated at the \u0026ldquo;ten wins in a row\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;get C rank for all characters\u0026rdquo; achievements in SF4 because of how difficult they were. Around this time, my brother and I also tried attending a local tournament or two, but we did poorly. During this era, I also tried out games like \u003cstrong\u003eBlazblue\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eInjustice\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003ePersona 4 Arena\u003c/strong\u003e, and so on. (ArcSys really got it\u0026rsquo;s groove in this era as far as I\u0026rsquo;m concerned.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was during this era that I started preferring fight sticks as well. I bought my first fight stick for the PS3, and I found I liked it a lot more than playing with a controller. My play group still prefers controllers, so when I meet up with them I have to suck it up, but at home and for online play I\u0026rsquo;m usually on a fight stick. This generation also marked the first time for me to play the \u003cstrong\u003eSmash Brothers\u003c/strong\u003e series via the Wii U installment, but I never could get the hang of that game either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally that brings us to the PS4 era and of course \u003cstrong\u003eStreet Fighter V\u003c/strong\u003e. SF5 isn\u0026rsquo;t too popular these days, mainly due to some balancing issues and lack of innovation,making the game feel stale, but it\u0026rsquo;s still very hype at EVO. My old play group doesn\u0026rsquo;t get to play much anymore, mostly because the one who usually brought the console has moved abroad, but we still manage to meet up at least once a year or so and put up our fighting dukes. I still play SF5 online, though not as often as I did with SF4. Matchmaking is a lot tougher, probably because I\u0026rsquo;ve been stuck at bronze level all this time. I still get hyped for fighting games when EVO rolls around, and I\u0026rsquo;m always tempted to buy these flashy new fighting games that come out. Just this weekend I purchased \u003cstrong\u003eDragonball Fighter Z\u003c/strong\u003e on Steam after trying it out for the free weekend and enjoying it. It helps that it has a lot of nice single-player content so I can justify the cost even if I don\u0026rsquo;t win/play online too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy am I so bad at fighting games? I\u0026rsquo;m sure part of it is old age - these days my reaction time isn\u0026rsquo;t as good as I\u0026rsquo;d want it to be (maybe it never was?!?). A large part of it is due to laziness - fighting games take a lot of practice, and you need a lot of experience to do well online. You also need to put in the time in training to be able to pull off execution of more complicated moves like \u003ca href=\"https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Focus_Attack#Dash_Cancelling\"\u003eSF4\u0026rsquo;s famous FADC\u003c/a\u003e. I don\u0026rsquo;t have time to really play fighting games all the much anymore. I was doing slightly better online during the PS3 era because my play group and me and my brothers were still playing regularly, but with SF5, I don\u0026rsquo;t really have anyone to practice offline with on a regular basis, and just spending a lot of time in training bores me, so here we are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do I still enjoy playing fighting games so much even though I\u0026rsquo;m bad at them? I\u0026rsquo;ve thought about this a lot, and I think the main reason other than general competitiveness, is that I enjoy the spectacle (these days at least). It\u0026rsquo;s one of the few genres where I can truly appreciate the over-the-top graphics and cool moves and supers and so on. When I get a new fighting game and try out a new character one of the first things I do is try to get a super off to see how cool it is. I also enjoy the variance in game play - which is why I prefer fighting games with larger rosters like CvS2, and I especially like it when there is a random character select option. When my play group meets up, we always do random character selection where possible, it exposes us to all the characters and everything the game has to offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn recent years it has become easier to enjoy fighting games even if you\u0026rsquo;re not good at them or you don\u0026rsquo;t have much time to play, since there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more tournaments these days and many of them are live-streamed and available to watch on demand online. I still want to play the games, but when I can\u0026rsquo;t find a match, watching tournament play is a good alternative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy reflexes can only get worse as the years pass, but I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;ll still be playing fighting games for years to come, and I\u0026rsquo;ll probably buy Street Fighter VI day one when it comes out for the PS5 or whatever. I may not have the skills to be the world champion in fighting games, but I\u0026rsquo;ll always be a street fighter at heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "This past weekend was EVO 2019, the world\u0026rsquo;s biggest celebrations of fighting games. If I had stayed in the US another month maybe I could have gone to Vegas to attend and lose badly. Instead, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d write about fighting games.\nI consider fighting games one of my weaknesses, in the sense that (a) I easily succumb to the temptation to spend money on them; and (b) I\u0026rsquo;m not very good at them.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI forget where I got this book recommendation from, but it did go on sale for Kindle a while back so I got a copy. The full title is \u0026ldquo;Utopia for Realists: How We Can Build the Ideal World\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummary: I really like this book, though I think it falls short in providing concrete steps for how to get from where we are to the idealized utopia he presents. Still, in this world of ever-increasing bad news and crises, the optimism of this book is a welcome respite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book covers a number of \u0026ldquo;utopian\u0026rdquo; scenarios worth striving for, namely:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003euniversal basic income\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eshorter work weeks\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eopen borders\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven before reading a book, I was already a believer in these ideals, well aware of the justifications. But the book covers that and more, providing a history of those ideas and what was tried before and why they failed and why we aren\u0026rsquo;t there yet. The history is particularly interesting, as before this I had no idea how close the US came to implementing something like UBI in the middle of the last century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I said, there\u0026rsquo;s very little concrete suggestions as to how to get there though. The author wails a bit about how progressives are stuck trying to protect the status quo instead of pushing forward truly progressive ideals such as these. The book also briefly covers such topics as biases and how difficult it is to push truly progressive ideas forward in the face of those biases. Aside from that, most of the advice seems to be \u0026ldquo;keep on bringing these issues up, their time will come.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a critical eye to these issues leads me deeper into my \u003ca href=\"/2018/10/capitalism/\"\u003edisagreements with the hyperefficiency of capitalism\u003c/a\u003e because even though with detailed analysis these ideals may tend to hold up in terms of value, it will still be difficult convincing a society to pursue them when said society is focused on profit over all things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably a more detailed discussion of each issue is beyond the scope of this post and each one may even merit multiple additional posts on their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, here are some passages/quotes I found myself highlighting from the book:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn worrying about what other people think:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOn inequality affecting people\u0026rsquo;s self-image (explains a lot about the Philippines):\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake bullying. Countries with big disparities in wealth also have more bullying behavior, because there are bigger status differences\u0026hellip; the “psychosocial consequences” are such that people living in unequal societies spend more time worrying about how others see them. This undercuts the quality of relationships (manifested in a distrust of strangers and status anxiety, for example). The resulting stress, in turn, is a major determinant of illness and chronic health problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOn why performance-driven societies may not be optimal (i.e. capitalsm\u0026rsquo;s focus on efficiency may not be best):\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the writer Kevin Kelly says, “Productivity is for robots. Humans excel at wasting time, experimenting, playing, creating, and exploring.” Governing by numbers is the last resort of a country that no longer knows what it wants, a country with no vision of utopia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOn shorter work weeks:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Ford, Kellogg, and Heath had all discovered is that productivity and long work hours do not go hand in hand. In the 1980s, Apple employees sported T-shirts that read, “Working 90 hours a week and loving it!” Later, productivity experts calculated that if they had worked half the hours then the world might have enjoyed the groundbreaking Macintosh computer a year earlier. There are strong indications that in a modern knowledge economy, even forty hours a week is too much. Research suggests that someone who is constantly drawing on their creative abilities can, on average, be productive for no more than six hours a day. It\u0026rsquo;s no coincidence that the world\u0026rsquo;s wealthy countries, those with a large creative class and highly educated populations, have also shaved the most time off their workweeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOn the cult of busy:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNowadays, excessive work and pressure are status symbols. Moaning about too much work is often just a veiled attempt to come across as important and interesting. Time to oneself is sooner equated with unemployment and laziness, certainly in countries where the wealth gap has widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOn \u0026ldquo;bullshit jobs\u0026rdquo;:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBizarrely, it\u0026rsquo;s precisely the jobs that shift money around–creating next to nothing of tangible value–that net the best salaries. It\u0026rsquo;s a fascinating, paradoxical state of affairs. How is it possible that all those agents of prosperity–the teachers, the police officers, the nurses–are paid so poorly, while the unimportant, superfluous, and even destructive shifters do so well?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThis one I highlighted because I found it a questionable ideal at best, he offers no explanation for why this should be true:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we restructure education around our new ideals, the job market will happily tag along. Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine we were to incorporate more art, history, and philosophy into the school curriculum. You can bet there will be a lift in demand for artists, historians, and philosophers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOn how even smart people are not immune to cognitive dissonance:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmart people, concludes the American journalist Ezra Klein, don\u0026rsquo;t use their intellect to obtain the correct answer; they use it to obtain what they want to be the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNever give up!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Solomon Asch made another discovery. A single opposing voice can make all the difference. When just one other person in the group stuck to the truth, the test subjects were more likely to trust the evidence of their own senses. Let this be an encouragement to all those who feel like a lone voice crying out in the wilderness: Keep on building those castles in the sky. Your time will come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOn not focusing too much on work:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few years ago, Australian writer Bronnie Ware published a book titled The Top Five Regrets of the Dying, about patients she had tended during her nursing career. 2 And guess what? No one said he or she would have liked to pay closer attention to coworkers\u0026rsquo; PowerPoint presentations or to have brain-stormed a little more on disruptive co-creation in the network society. The biggest regret was: \u0026ldquo;I wish I\u0026rsquo;d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.\u0026rdquo; Number two: \u0026ldquo;I wish I didn\u0026rsquo;t work so hard.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall a very good read, despite my criticisms, and a lot of his thought appeal to my own ideals personally.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

To make a long story short, I decided to start working on \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/roytang/hugo-theme-exhale\"\u003ea Hugo theme\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s still largely a work in progress, as there\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of things I wanted to implement. But it was good enough to replace the old one so I went ahead and deployed it, so maybe some bugs here and there on some pages. And I\u0026rsquo;m still tinkering, so probably some minor/major changes as we go along in the next few weeks. Or months. Who knows how long it will take? There were some conflicts with the old theme and the new theme which meant I had to modify some of my main blog files to support the new theme and the amount of uncommitted changes I had was getting unwieldy, so I figured I\u0026rsquo;d just \u0026ldquo;move fast and break things\u0026rdquo;, as it were.

Would\u0026rsquo;ve made things a lot easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve also kind of gone down the rabbit hole of \u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/\"\u003eIndieweb\u003c/a\u003e stuff. The core message of having your own website that contains all your content appeals to me and also aligns with some things I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about implementing like importing all of my off-site content into this site as a central repository. Those things are yet to come but with the theme change I\u0026rsquo;ve also started looking into stuff like microformats (should be supported as of now), webmentions, POSSE, and so on.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI was travelling for most of the past two months, so this covers both June and July, and I guess I haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to watch too much. Maybe? IDK, we\u0026rsquo;ll see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I was in the US, I took the opportunity to finish watching \u003cstrong\u003eVoltron: Legendary Defender\u003c/strong\u003e which only had two seasons available on PH Netflix. Pretty good adaptation, lots of fun callbacks to the old series. Some annoying filler eps, especially in the middle seasons onwards. I like how they spent the entire series going through the main Voltron villains one by one: first Zarkon, then Lotor, then a little bit of Sendak, then finally Hagar. It got a bit too hocus pocus magicky BS near the finale for me, but overall a pretty good watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we were staying with relatives in the US, it turns out they\u0026rsquo;re really fond of watching Filipino movies. I\u0026rsquo;m not big on Filipino movies, most of them seem either uninspired, formulaic or outright ridiculous. I did enjoy a couple of the ones that I sat through, at least enough to comment on them, coincidentally both starring Eddie Garcia (RIP). The first one was \u003cstrong\u003eRainbow\u0026rsquo;s Sunset\u003c/strong\u003e, which has Eddie Garcia playing a senior citizen ex-politician who comes out as gay and explores the repurcussions to his children and grandchildren. This movie had a strange ending that came out of nowhere though. The second movie was \u003cstrong\u003eHeaven\u0026rsquo;s Waiting\u003c/strong\u003e where Garcia portrays an old man who has died and finds himself in a waiting area before he can be sent to heaven, basically purgatory. In this place he finds an old flame of his from his youth, who has secretly been waiting for him all this time, refusing to advance to heaven. The movie explores themes of life and death and love and regret and commitment, but in a context outside of the typical Filipino love team movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a bunch of other Netflix movies watched - these folks didn\u0026rsquo;t have that much to do at home - but the only other one I remember sitting through was \u003cstrong\u003eMurder Mystery\u003c/strong\u003e starring Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston. Basically a comedic whodunnit, it was entertaining enough to sit through, but nothing too special. I did like the car chase scene at the end though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from watching on Netflix, I also tried out an American cinema and watched \u003cstrong\u003eSpider-man Far From Home\u003c/strong\u003e with a friend. I have a \u003ca href=\"/2019/07/spider-man-far-from-home/\"\u003eseparate blog post\u003c/a\u003e for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurder Mystery might not have been too special, but it did inspire me to watch the copy I had of \u003cstrong\u003eMurder on the Orient Express\u003c/strong\u003e when I got back home. It was my first exposure to Hercule Poirot, and I was pleasantly surprised by the star-studded cast. It\u0026rsquo;s the sort of movie where you can\u0026rsquo;t watch it twice though; I suppose all whodunits are like that, but now I can\u0026rsquo;t watch the older movie based on this book. There\u0026rsquo;s supposedly a sequel coming out next year, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll watch that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the trip, there was a whole lot of shows to catch up on. The only one I managed to complete was \u003cstrong\u003eJessica Jones S3\u003c/strong\u003e, the final season among the erstwhile Netflix-Marvel shows. I liked this season, mostly because it went way more dark than I expected and had a very \u0026ldquo;Criminal Minds\u0026rdquo;/procedural kind of vibe since her main antagonist here was a serial killer, and one of the themes is how a hero has to play by the rules and can\u0026rsquo;t just do whatever he wants like killing criminals. (This kind of message always resonates with me now because of where the country is.) While I feel like it might have been better to cap the Netflix-Marvel venture with Daredevil\u0026rsquo;s fantastic season 3, this one isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad ending either. I suspect I will do a more detailed look back on these shows soonish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike I said, I have a ton of shows to catch up on. Good Omens, Stranger Things, Doom Patrol, Legion, etc to name a few. And I missed out on a few movies though, like Dark Phoenix, which I was tempted to watch in the cinema despite the bad reviews, because I\u0026rsquo;ve never missed any of the prior X-Men movies, not even Wolverine Origins. Hopefully I\u0026rsquo;ll have time to catch up on all of this stuff before the Fall TV season comes in!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
