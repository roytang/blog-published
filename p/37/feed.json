            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThe concept of a \u0026ldquo;meritocracy\u0026rdquo; has come to the fore again with the \u003ca href=\"http://time.com/5549921/college-admissions-bribery-scandal/\"\u003erecent college admissions scandal\u003c/a\u003e in the US, where wealthy parents bribed coaches and other professionals to get their kids into high-end universities with supposedly high standards. It\u0026rsquo;s put a lie to the idea that the students of these universities represent the \u0026ldquo;cream of the crop\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the best of the best\u0026rdquo;, showing that kids can get in not only due to their own talent, but also due to money. Of course, it was always open knowledge before that one could get their kid admitted to such universities simply by making a huge donation. The recent events apparently crosses some line because the \u0026ldquo;donation\u0026rdquo; was in the form of bribe money to individuals instead of the school itself, but even without them there was no true meritocracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to a specialized high school (and college) that had supposedly merit-based entrance exams as well, such that one could simply not get in without passing the exams. (Athletics-based admissions aren\u0026rsquo;t very popular in this country.) Even in such a system, rich kids still have a significant leg up of course - aside from growing up in an environment that favored them, their parents could also afford to send them to expensive review centers to prep for the exams. I was reminded of this due to a recent thread among my HS batchmates discussing how their kids had to prep for the entrance exams years early because it was much more competitive these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to be a strong believer in meritocracy when I was young (probably due to my educational background), believing it to be an ideal for society to aspire to. The idea is certainly attractive - that we should give the jobs and positions to those who would be able to use them most effectively, for the betterment of society. I later learned that the term orignated in 1958 as a condemnatory word by Michael Young in his work \u0026ldquo;The Rise of the Meritocracy\u0026rdquo;. I realize now that while a pure meritocracy would be nice, it would disadvantage people who are already behind in life due to poverty, sickness or other such challenges. I think that like many things, some sort of balance is better struck, with a \u0026ldquo;meritocracy at large\u0026rdquo; in effect for the most part, but with opportunities promoted for marginalized groups. That is, a meritocracy that favors the poor instead of the rich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll this meritocract quote reminds me of a quote from the Simpsons\u0026rsquo; villainous Mr Burns who tries to justify cheating in a contest during a company retreat, which gives us a different perspective:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Burns: Tell me, Simpson, if an opportunity arose for taking a small short-cut, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be averse to taking it, would you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHomer: Hmm, not as such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Burns: Neither would I. If you can take advantage of a situation in some way, it\u0026rsquo;s your duty as an American to do it. Why should the race always be to the swift, or the Jumble to the quick-witted? Should they be allowed to win merely because of the gifts God gave them? Well I say, \u0026ldquo;Cheating is the gift man gives himself.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHomer: Mr. Burns, I insist that we cheat!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Burns: Excellent!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n",

It didn\u0026rsquo;t help that it\u0026rsquo;s been 4-5 years since I played VLR, and that game already had an overly complex plot so I can barely remember the details from that game as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile it\u0026rsquo;s a story-based series, the gameplay largely consists of two parts: (a) escape rooms; and (b) decision-making. The escape rooms part are entertaining enough, nothing too difficult, but satisfying enough to solve everything. The decision-making part is used to unlock branching timelines, and the path to the \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; endings is determined by your ability to find the correct decisions to unlock the correct events. Not all decisions are binary or multiple-choice; some of the more important ones require text or numeric input, making it impossible to guess them. At multiple points, you will need to reference information learned from other branches of history (don\u0026rsquo;t worry, there is a story reason for why this happens).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTook me a couple of weeks of playing sporadically to finish the game. I enjoyed the game enough to spend a couple of late nights to finish it once I got really going. I will shamefully admit I did get stuck in one place and in my impatience I googled my way past it.

I have a good grasp of communication skills and think I have a decent chance of writing good copy. My main issue is that I\u0026rsquo;ve been exposed many times to sales/marketing practices that just seem dishonest downright or scummy. This happens both with me as a customer and with me on the side of the company trying to do the sales/marketing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn example in the software engineering sphere would be a developer writing project proposals in response to tenders, and he is asked to write a technical response confirming that their product supports a particular tender requirement. Except he knows for a fact that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t, and when he raises this concern, he\u0026rsquo;s told not to worry about and that they\u0026rsquo;ll just implement the feature if/when they win the contract. And apparently that\u0026rsquo;s a regular practice in some companies. Disclaimer: I\u0026rsquo;m not saying I have been personally involved in such a situation, but I do know such situations exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand the motivation from the sales side, but not only is that intellectually dishonest (to say the least), it also puts your engineering teams in a bind should the project push through - you now committed them to do an extra feature without proper estimation or scheduling and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me it\u0026rsquo;s okay to sell something by promoting its strengths and advantages, but not by being dishonest about its capabilities or weaknesses. I suspect that this cripples me a bit in the real world where people with less scruples are more willing to bend the truth to make money. But for me personally, honesty and integrity are more important than making more sales.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Catching up with all the \u0026ldquo;explanations\u0026rdquo; given out so far, the thing that makes the least sense for me is this: Supposedly MW is allocated 1600mld from Angat Dam, which is insufficient because the demand is at 1750mld. That\u0026rsquo;s around a 9.375% deficit. Given that, why would it be necessary for a large number of areas (I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if there are even unaffected MW service areas) to have service interruptions for majority of the hours of the day? (Over here, I think we get like very weak water pressure a couple of hours a day and that\u0026rsquo;s it). Obviously they can\u0026rsquo;t just cut 9.375% of the hours, they need to add some buffer, that\u0026rsquo;s fine. And households would of course compensate for reduced hours by consuming more during the time they do have water. But why so extreme, so immediately? At worst I would have expected that they cut service hours by at most 50% (so households have water during half the day), then if that\u0026rsquo;s not enough come out with an advisory saying \u0026ldquo;okay, we\u0026rsquo;re still consuming too much water, we need to cut more hours\u0026rdquo;. As it is, their announced service interruption hours are highly inaccurate, so it seems they can\u0026rsquo;t even predict what\u0026rsquo;s going to happen with their service. Conspiracy theories aside, I prefer to attribute all of the issues to sheer incompetence first, but is there something I\u0026rsquo;m missing here, some kind of engineering reason or what, for the service interruptions to be so widespread and unpredictable?\u003c/p\u003e\n",
