Pre-pandemic, it\u0026rsquo;s nothing I\u0026rsquo;d just take some biogesic and sleep it off, but now we have to worry about Covid. To be sure, I had an RT-PCR swab test taken by Monday lunch time. My brother and his family had passed by the house Sunday morning and we hung out a bit outside shooting the breeze, so aside from the seniors I live with, I was worried for them, so the test was mostly to be sure and for peace of mind. I thought the test itself would be uncomfortable, but it was super quick, swab went in and out once per nostril, then one more in the throat. It was a bit pricey, as someone comes to your home to do it, but the results came quickly, got the NEGATIVE result the next morning. Hugh sigh of relief. By then my fever had gone down. I self-isolated for a couple more days just to be sure. Am completely fine now.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI wrote a bunch of words on the blog this week.

It was not uncommon for me to post some rant about something stupid our political leaders have done or some essay about how things could be improved, and someone would comment with the eventual \u0026ldquo;Roy Tang for President!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a joke of course. Running for president requires some level of fame, political experience, connections and even ridiculous amounts of money. I\u0026rsquo;m a nobody who has none of these things. there\u0026rsquo;s no way I\u0026rsquo;m running for president! That being said, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to claim I\u0026rsquo;ve never thought about it; it\u0026rsquo;s the sort of thing that\u0026rsquo;s fun to fantasize about once in a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt actually feels like a really insane idea to run for president. Being president is a terrible, thankless job. The country has so many systemic issues that it\u0026rsquo;s simply a gargantuan task to address them all or even make a significant dent in a single term. Even assuming you\u0026rsquo;re an honest, well-meaning person who just wants to do good things for the country, you\u0026rsquo;re going to run afoul of so many vested interests who will stand in your way and try to take you down: politicians benefiting from corruption, elites and oligarchs profiting from inequality, the criminals and corrupt who want to evade accountability, basically anyone in power looking to preserve the status quo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can\u0026rsquo;t run the country alone, so you have to be lucky enough to know or find people to work with who you can trust to be honest and well-intentioned and not abuse their authority. And because we aren\u0026rsquo;t in a dictatorship, the president would often have to find a way to work with many different parties and sectors to get things (such as legislation) done, even if some of those people may be part of the very vested interests opposing you. You would have to do all of these tasks while constantly being criticized for your every move, and also managing public opinion and handling whatever random tragedy or crisis happens every week. And you have to find a way so that when everything is done, somehow the small gains you\u0026rsquo;ve made will be preserved and be built upon by future leaders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it\u0026rsquo;s not a job with a lot of work-life balance; you don\u0026rsquo;t step being president after 5pm. I can only imagine that once you decide to take on the job, you are basically committing six years of your life to the country, and not everyone has that privilege.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was thinking about these things for the past couple of weeks as I read many of the testimonials given by people who\u0026rsquo;ve worked with the \u003ca href=\"/2021/06/weeknotes-2021-06-27/\"\u003erecently deceased former President Noynoy Aquino\u003c/a\u003e. By most accounts he was an honest, sincere person who wanted to do a good job. He was \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/indiohistorian/status/1407928646547902465\"\u003ea data driven President\u003c/a\u003e and tended to \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ANCALERTS/status/1408370950530158593\"\u003ework hard\u003c/a\u003e, often making his staff work late into the night and such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had some issues he had trouble dealing with, namely in transportation and crisis management. But his biggest problem was his lack of charisma and political savvy; he tended not to show emotion and he wasn\u0026rsquo;t good at espousing his own causes or letting the public know how hard he worked or empathizing with other people. His political opponents capitalized on this and he was the target of bad propaganda, ending his term with him and his family name mocked and vilified by certain sectors of society. Someone I know called him \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/LaTtEX/status/1407939921868824579\"\u003ea \u0026ldquo;misunderstood nerd\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e and I think it\u0026rsquo;s a stereotype that fits perfectly - the sort of awkward person who knows how to do the work, but not how to effectively manage his relationships with other people and the public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo hard work and good intentions are obviously not enough for the job. You also need charisma, political will and the savvy to navigate the cesspool of politics. With all of these challenges, it\u0026rsquo;s very difficult to find truly good and honest people willing to go for the job of president. Most will be experienced politicians who are already compromised in some way, perhaps thinking they can still leave a good legacy behind; or worse, some will be the truly corrupt, who see the position as an opportunity to further their own agendas, whether that be power or enrichment or whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the scary part is that often, it\u0026rsquo;s the bad ones who have the knowhow or skills needed to get elected, which means elections here will always be a challenge. Maybe someday we\u0026rsquo;ll figure things out or just get really lucky and roll a chain of natural 20s and actually get a series of good presidents (or candidates even), enough to make some headway in improving the country, instead of the typical riffraff we find running for president.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this country, there is a constitutional requirement that the president must be at least 40 years old which for me means next year\u0026rsquo;s elections would be the first one where I would actually be eligible to run for president! The presidentiables are already starting to make their moves so I want to make this clear: I have not yet decided whether or not to run for president. (Lol.)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "title": "Tomorrow Never Dies",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eLast night I watched Tomorrow Never Dies (1997). Bond film no. 18 and Brosnan\u0026rsquo;s second. Also the first one I actually saw in theaters when it came out so officially my first rewatch! That said, it was 24 years ago so while I remember the general overarching plot (Jonathan Pryce playing a multibillionaire media mogul inciting a war between China and the UK to profit off the news), I have forgotten many of the finer details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did remember Michelle Yeoh in her role as a Chinese agent who ends up working with Bond. (She looks so young here, especially compared to \u003cem\u003eStar Trek Discovery\u003c/em\u003e where I last saw her! I guess Asian women do age somehow.) I forgot about Teri Hatcher being here though, apparently in the middle of her heyday on the \u003cem\u003eLois and Clark\u003c/em\u003e TV series. She looked great too, but had little screen time, so maybe that\u0026rsquo;s why I forgot about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also remembered the scene with the remote controlled car as I remember thinking that was pretty neat back when I first saw it. Now that I\u0026rsquo;ve actually learned how driving a car works (not that I actually drive), it seems ridiculous that Bond could have such fine control using only a touchpad. It\u0026rsquo;s 2021 and the touchpad UX isn\u0026rsquo;t even that great for laptops, let alone a car!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the first time possible conflict with China came into play in the Bond series (though they have made appearances before as \u0026ldquo;Red China\u0026rdquo;), maybe a sign of China\u0026rsquo;s rising prominence at the time? This was also the same year that Hong Kong was ceded back to China by the British, so perhaps appropriate for Bond to be working with a Chinese agent this time, in the spirit of international friendship?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe choice of villain may have been a bit prescient, given our current woes with billionaires and their platforms endangering the world and/or democracy, although if this film were made today the company would be more tech/internet focused than mass media, as that age has passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like the theme music here (performed by Sherly Crow) better than the one in Goldeneye, possibly because I kind of still remembered how it went (or the chorus part anyway).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrivia: There were no more unadapted Fleming stories remaining so this is an original film story, but the original title was meant to be \u003cem\u003eTomorrow Never Lies\u003c/em\u003e, which would have made a lot more sense! But there was a typo when the potential title was sent over to MGM, and they liked the current version better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall Goldeneye seemed the stronger film, though this one appeals to me too because it\u0026rsquo;s my second watch; It\u0026rsquo;s aged rather well I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next film is the only other Brosnan film I\u0026rsquo;ve seen, \u003cem\u003eThe World Is Not Enough\u003c/em\u003e, but I seem to remember even less about it than this film, can\u0026rsquo;t even call the plot to mind. I seem to remember some kind of\u0026hellip; ice building? I suppose I\u0026rsquo;ll find out when I get to it, probably next week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, here\u0026rsquo;s some commentary from the movie about software development.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Last night I watched Tomorrow Never Dies (1997). Bond film no. 18 and Brosnan\u0026rsquo;s second. Also the first one I actually saw in theaters when it came out so officially my first rewatch! That said, it was 24 years ago so while I remember the general overarching plot (Jonathan Pryce playing a multibillionaire media mogul inciting a war between China and the UK to profit off the news), I have forgotten many of the finer details.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI was on a Twitch chat for a local streamer yesterday and someone bought up the term \u0026ldquo;comsat\u0026rdquo;, popular in local computer shop or \u0026ldquo;compshop\u0026rdquo; (also called \u0026ldquo;internet cafes\u0026rdquo;) culture. In the context of multiplayer games, it means to spy on what your opponent is doing by peeking at his screen. I\u0026rsquo;ve never heard this term used other than by Filipino gamers, so I have reason to believe it\u0026rsquo;s a local thing. There is \u003ca href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=comsat\"\u003ean Urban Dictionary entry\u003c/a\u003e, but the submitter might just be a Pinoy as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the younger gamers weren\u0026rsquo;t familiar with the origins of the term. Someone even said they thought it mean \u0026ldquo;computer satellite\u0026rdquo;, as in someone who hovers over the opponent\u0026rsquo;s computer to see what they\u0026rsquo;re up to. The term actually originates from the original \u003cstrong\u003eStarcraft\u003c/strong\u003e, it\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/ComSat_station\"\u003ea Terran building\u003c/a\u003e used to enable scanner sweeps. Starcraft was one of the earliest popular LAN games in the Philippines; we used to play it a lot on the lab computers after hours in college. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if this kind of thing is now frowned upon, but back then one of the regular players in our lab was one of the younger teachers, so whatever. I suppose when compshops started to proliferate, many of the initial patrons were familiar with Starcraft and hence the term comsat and it propagated to later generations of gamers who played mostly games like the various versions of \u003cstrong\u003eDOTA\u003c/strong\u003e or \u003cstrong\u003eCounterstrike\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompshops were a popular small business back in the day. In fact, I briefly considered running one myself, the startup capital needed wasn\u0026rsquo;t too high. (But like many potential endeavors, it felt like too much work.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompshops in the Philippines of course had their uses other than gaming - many students used them to do schoolwork or get something printed. But they became popular mostly for gaming, especially among the youth. Many were so obsessed we got memes like the one below with kids continuing to play despite floods, an image I\u0026rsquo;ve seen even in international gaming forums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#ab5abb0057d0b41ff4838d1484735376-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2009/12/281590937/281590937_hu0ddbc344b8435ac780f105cabd68a214_50460_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Baha na, nde pa GG!\" title=\"Baha na, nde pa GG!\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eBaha na, nde pa GG!

I think part of that is because I was already graduating when they really took off in Metro Manila around the mid 2000s. But I also wasn\u0026rsquo;t really a fan of the multiplayer games that became popular locally - the aforementioned DOTA and Counterstrike - or the popular MMOs like \u003cstrong\u003eRagnarok Online\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only multiplayer PvP games I really played over LAN were Starcraft (mostly with labmates during the college days) and occasionally Warcraft III. I was comfortable with Warcraft III because \u003ca href=\"/2005/03/games-warcraft-iii-rude-and-annoying-teammates/\"\u003eI played it on Battle.net\u003c/a\u003e back home so I didn\u0026rsquo;t mind playing it with friends. I never really got into that phase where I would hang out in compshops and play with strangers. Between work and my home gaming, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really have time for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did enjoy the occasional game night out with coworkers after work - there was a small compshop near Tektite we\u0026rsquo;d go to. The only games I remember playing this way were \u003cstrong\u003eLeft 4 Dead\u003c/strong\u003e / \u003cstrong\u003eLeft 4 Dead 2\u003c/strong\u003e. I find that coop games like these tend to generate more funny moments overall, and we had a lot of fun shouting over the computers to try to get our party\u0026rsquo;s act together. Once we got tired of L4D, I\u0026rsquo;d take my leave to go home early while the more hardcore players stayed behind to play DOTA or CS late into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s probably been a decade or even more since I\u0026rsquo;ve last been to a compshop. Interest in this kind of LAN gaming kind of faded among PC owners in the 2010s, around the same time that most games stopped offering LAN play in favor of online gaming. The writing was on the wall when \u003ca href=\"/2009/06/2402550844/\"\u003eStarcraft 2 announced in 2009 that they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t support LAN\u003c/a\u003e. There was no reason for compshop owners to spend for legit copies of Starcraft 2 just so their clients could play it. PC owners who preferred to play SC2 or other newer paid games ended up mostly just playing online at their own homes. And with the rise of modern online voice chat, you could still replicate the experience of shouting at your teammates or opponents, although of course it wasn\u0026rsquo;t really the same as hearing the trash talk in person at a compshop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompshops still continued to exist well into the 2010s of course, though perhaps not as prevalent as before. They offered mostly F2P or freemium games, although many still came with old / pirated copies of the classics - many players still played the older games because that\u0026rsquo;s what they knew. The clientele became primarily the less privileged who didn\u0026rsquo;t have access to a PC or internet or the latest games at home, many of them minors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think even during the pandemic, compshops still managed to survive. They\u0026rsquo;re kind of essential for less privileged students who all have to take online classes now. I imagine the industry will still be right there well into the 2020s - so long as the inequality and lack of access to PCs and internet persists, so will the humble compshops be there to help the less privileged enjoy some PC gaming as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The book\u0026rsquo;s primary thesis is that in the modern world, you have to avoid being a conforming, replaceable assembly line worker, and instead be a linchpin, someone who is indispensible, someone who goes the extra mile, who invests emotional labor into his work and his art. The book covers topics such as the problems with the \u0026ldquo;old way\u0026rdquo; of working, what it means to be a linchpin, the resistance from your lizard brain, gift culture, connection, the importance of shipping, etc. He summarizes the book as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I wanted to do in this book was sell you on being the artist you already are. To make a difference. To stand for something. To get the respect and security you deserve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book is structured into chapters each of which are broken into 1 or 2 pages worth of discussion on one aspect of the chapter\u0026rsquo;s topics, each about as long as a blog post. Given that Seth Godin is \u003ca href=\"https://seths.blog/\"\u003ea prolific blogger\u003c/a\u003e, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if a lot of this book evolved directly from his posts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs someone who has mostly soured on late-stage capitalism, a lot of this is preaching to the choir. I don\u0026rsquo;t need to be told that something is wrong with the way our companies and labor are currently set up. Concepts like the resistance and the lizard brain aren\u0026rsquo;t new to me either. I did enjoy the chapters about gift culture and how being an artist means being willing to give a gift to the world, instead of having everything be a commercial transaction. And I do appreciate the overall message of avoiding being just another cog in the capitalist machine, of going above and beyond in whatever you do and gifting your talent to the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are some parts I highlighted from the book for whatever reason (yes, I just discovered the Kindle app lets you export your highlights!):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"thinking-about-your-choice\"\u003eTHINKING ABOUT YOUR CHOICE\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo to a McDonald\u0026rsquo;s.

Say, \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t drink this milkshake . . . there\u0026rsquo;s a Big Mac in it.\u0026rdquo; The person at the counter will give you a refund. Why? Because it\u0026rsquo;s easier to give her a rule than it is to hire people with good judgment. The rule is, \u0026ldquo;When in doubt, give a refund.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"becoming-the-linchpin\"\u003eBECOMING THE LINCHPIN\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonald Bradman was an Australian cricket player.

They\u0026rsquo;re typically difficult for the uncommitted casual gamer to get into. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of stuff that needs to be learned: inputs, commands, matchups, systems, etc. I mean, I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing FGs since Street Fighter II came out and I\u0026rsquo;m still pretty bad at them competitively, but I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I can crush most casuals who pick up a fighting game for the first time simply because I understand the lingua franca a bit - I know how throws work, what overheads and antiairs are etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a casual picking up a fighting game for the first time, all this stuff can get confusing. The simple matter of blocking attacks can be daunting: some attacks need to be blocked high, some blocked low, and how do you know which is which? You don\u0026rsquo;t, you kind of have to learn them along the way, so getting over the learning curve requires getting beat up a lot. There are some visual cues - sweeps look like sweeps so that\u0026rsquo;s easy to figure out, but not all of them do, and definitely not all overheads look like overheads (GGS has a universal overhead via standing dust, but most of the ones I\u0026rsquo;ve seen don\u0026rsquo;t look like overheads at all.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan you air block? Maybe, depends on the game. You can dash, unless you\u0026rsquo;re this character. I can just block all the attacks right? No, there\u0026rsquo;s throws and command grabs and unblockables, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot all fighting games play the same even. Like, I play mainly motion input games like Street Fighter and Guilty Gear, but whenever I try a game like \u003cstrong\u003eTekken\u003c/strong\u003e, everything feels and plays differently and matches just flow differently so I don\u0026rsquo;t really understand it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s always a whole lot to learn, and the best games have a lot of characters which increases the learning curve significantly. It\u0026rsquo;s like playing an RPG with a lot of character classes and enemies to study, but instead of getting all the abilities one at a time and encountering each enemy according to a difficulty track, everything is available all at once so it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed. And all the battles are in real-time and you have to make split-second decisions and react quickly and sometimes you blink and you\u0026rsquo;ve already taken a 100% death combo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, I think the items Max enumerated above would be helpful for casual adoption (which is necessary to birth more genre fans) - specifically making it easier to do cool, flashy stuff, and good matchmaking and netcode go a long way towards building an audience. GGS is certainly an example of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI usually try to review games when I\u0026rsquo;ve finished them, but that\u0026rsquo;s not really a thing with fighting games so I might as well use this space to write a quick review of \u003cstrong\u003eGuilty Gear -STRIVE-\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had been looking for a replacement for \u003cstrong\u003eStreet Fighter V\u003c/strong\u003e which I\u0026rsquo;d been playing for a while but never really got very good at, languishing in the bronze ranks for most of its run. It had also gotten more and more difficult to even find matches, and I don\u0026rsquo;t really enjoy doing training/labwork to get better, so that was unacceptable. I happily purchased GGS on Steam when it was released June 11. (I think it\u0026rsquo;s actually been a while since I purchased a game full price on Steam at launch!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrive looks great, everything looks cool and flashy as mentioned above, which is amazing given my PC is 6 years old and I\u0026rsquo;m running on an RX570. It\u0026rsquo;s also easy to get into, and a lot of that is because of the the fantastic \u0026ldquo;tutorial\u0026rdquo; via the Missions Mode, which walks you through simple to advanced concepts so you can learn all the basics and the systems of the game. A friend rightly points out that it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t tell you when to use most of these tactics in a match, but it\u0026rsquo;s actually still a great improvement compared to other fighting games out there in terms of making it easier for new users to learn the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said (and despite Max claiming in the video above that Strive has been toned down to appeal to casuals), this is still a very complicated game, especially compared to something like Street Fighter V. Typical for the franchise, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of movement options and systems to consider: dashes, back dashes, air dashes, jump cancels, high jumps, double jumps, recovery options, launchers, tension gauge, burst gauge, RISC, positive bonus, Roman cancel (FOUR DIFFERENT KINDS!!) and so on and so forth. I am not sure I would recommend it to casuals though it is VERY flashy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt does look like there has been some simplification / standardization in terms of character movesets. Most characters now have a HCB-\u0026gt;F+HS super, the dust button acts a standard button for throw, sweep, overhead and launcher attacks, etc. Combo damage is stronger, so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to be able to do super long combo strings to be able to do significant damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing I was disappointed with is that the game doesn\u0026rsquo;t have Instant Kills, which have been a staple of the series since the first game. They\u0026rsquo;re not very useful competitively, but when playing casually with friends on a single monitor it\u0026rsquo;s always been fun to try to pull them off (especially when you\u0026rsquo;re losing!) I hope they get added back at some point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m still not particularly good at the game. In the video above, Max says everyone on ranked floor 5 and below is a casual, and I seem to be waffling between floors 5 and 6 constantly, so I\u0026rsquo;d say I\u0026rsquo;m mostly a casual who sometimes glimpses something more lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe importang thing of course is that I am having a bunch of fun. It\u0026rsquo;s quite easy to find matches, and the netcode is pretty good. I live in a third-world country still and even with fiber broadband online gaming can get spotty, but my network experience has been relatively good. I\u0026rsquo;ve only been playing Ky and Potemkin online, so I still have a bunch of characters to study and learn and such, but I expect to be playing this game for a good long time to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, here\u0026rsquo;s a video of me being Ky:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"\u003e\n  \u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgZGWs_Wu7o\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRelated: \u003ca href=\"/2019/08/fighting-games/\"\u003eFighting games\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

This led to the usual condolences and accolades from across the political spectrum, although many noted the delay in the palace issuing a statement (I suspect it was because the current president was still asleep). Many of his friends and supporters came out with stories of his time in office, many portraying him as misunderstood, uncharismatic, and quiet; holding his emotions close to his chest, but devoted to the job. My favorite entry is \u003ca href=\"https://news.abs-cbn.com/ancx/culture/spotlight/06/25/21/pnoy-was-my-boss-a-delayed-dispatch-from-a-palace-speechwriter\"\u003ethis post by his former speechwriter\u003c/a\u003e. His legacy was tainted by several problems and a lot of black propaganda near the tail end of his term, leading many online to preface their accolades with phrases like \u0026ldquo;He wasn\u0026rsquo;t perfect, but\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, perhaps to avoid being tagged with the divisive \u0026ldquo;Dilawan\u0026rdquo; label or to avoid being targetted by the hordes of online trolls.
