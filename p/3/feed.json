It\u0026rsquo;s kind of a time machine in a way. And it helps me by providing a sort of foundation for my thinking, so I understand how my thinking has (or has not) evolved through the years, what mistakes I\u0026rsquo;m still prone to, or which ones I\u0026rsquo;ve overcome, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to start this habit on and off again since basically the early 2000s. This blog is part of that effort, as you can see by the \u003ca href=\"/archives/\"\u003earchives\u003c/a\u003e. (Although, not everything can be logged publicly in a blog.) I really only managed to get into a regular discipline of reviews starting around 2017 though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy current regular reviews/tracking systems:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edaily tracker. This is a custom system I built for myself basically just to log things on a day-to-day basis, with categorization, search and summary metrics and graphs. Most useful for expense and tracking what I eat. This tracker is the reason I have a pretty good idea of where my money is going. (I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are OTS systems that can do this, building your own isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eweekly reviews. For things I\u0026rsquo;ve done throughout the week, any big expenses, etc. Helps me remember when I did things. I used to do this privately, via text files, but last year mostly moved it to regular weekly blog posts called \u003ca href=\"/tags/weeknotes\"\u003eweeknotes\u003c/a\u003e. Having the weekly reviews on the blog gave me a regular public cadence. Most of the things I log in weekly reviews are ok to be public anyway; any private stuff stays in the daily tracker\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emonthly finance checks. This is the review habit I\u0026rsquo;ve had the longest, but it\u0026rsquo;s also evolved a lot along the way. Basically I just go through all my bank accounts and credit cards and billing statements, make sure all transactions for the month check out/are legit, check if there are loans/investments I need to follow up on, make sure all bills are paid, and get a snapshot of what my current financial status is. I can cross check the deltas with the numbers from the daily tracker, to make sure there\u0026rsquo;s not any money I\u0026rsquo;m losing unnecessarily.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eyearly reviews. These are on the blog as \u003ca href=\"/tags/yearnotes\"\u003eyearnotes\u003c/a\u003e. There are entire years of my early career that seem like a blur - I have very little idea what I was up to in those years. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to lose that kind of time again.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to all of that, I\u0026rsquo;ve recently also resumed doing \u003ca href=\"/2019/03/750words/\"\u003e750words\u003c/a\u003e, mainly because the old export files from that service were among the old files I was going through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this might seem overmuch for most people, but I find it works for me. It helps me with my thinking, helps me manage my anxiety, and having the past to scroll through is certainly better than doomscrolling all the time. (There is probably some danger of becoming too obsessed with the past, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s worth it as long as you\u0026rsquo;re aware of the risk.) The past informs the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelated:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2005/10/on-journalling-or-how-hard-it-is-to-keep-up-a-blog/\"\u003eOn Journalling, or How Hard It Is to Keep Up a Blog (2005)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2018/05/logs-and-memories-and-audit-trails/\"\u003eLogs and Memories and Audit Trails (2018)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e(there\u0026rsquo;s probably more.

Crashes a lot, reader view often fails to load, or flickers and reloads continuously and so on. Just not a very good experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m sure it\u0026rsquo;s not entirely their fault; recent iOS versions (starting from 13 I think?) have become more agressive with their memory management and garbage collection, so app processes seemed to regularly get killed for some reason. It sometimes happens in other apps too, but by far Flipboard is the worst offender. Maybe their code is poorly optimized, IDK. Oh, and they\u0026rsquo;ve started to have a lot more ads! In any case, I\u0026rsquo;ve had enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy most relevant Flipboard reading consists of:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003elatest world news/headlines (main)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003etech news (secondary)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ecomics/gaming news (when I just feel like scrolling through Flipboard)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a replacement, I assumed I could simply take their most common sources in each of the above categories and import them into my RSS reader of choice (right now that\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.inoreader.com\"\u003eInoreader\u003c/a\u003e). But after doing that, I realized this won\u0026rsquo;t work, because I treat my mealtime news reading differently from feeds I follow via RSS. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to have unread counts for the news stuff, just see what\u0026rsquo;s the most recent stuff and move on. I decided instead to revive my \u003ca href=\"https://feedly.com/\"\u003eFeedly\u003c/a\u003e account, and import the news feeds there, and use the Feedly iOS app for my morning news reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave been doing this for a few days already; not all of the feeds render well (particularly some websites that did not have RSS feeds, I had to do workarounds), but it seems acceptable for now. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll revisit Flipboard again in a future iOS version and hope they get their stability together.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
