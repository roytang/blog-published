            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eOver the past couple of years, I\u0026rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d do reviews of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first one is \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/337150/Sentinels_of_the_Multiverse/\"\u003eSentinels of the Multiverse\u003c/a\u003e. We\u0026rsquo;ve played the IRL boardgame of it before during one of our sporadic in-person meetups. If you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar, it\u0026rsquo;s a comics-themed coop game where up to 4 people play as a group of heroes to beat a villain (basically comic book shenanigans).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a large variety of heroes available to play, each with unique abilities and play styles. Some of them are straightforward and some are super complicated and fiddly to play. The villains you have to beat vary from super simple to really difficult, with advanced variants for even more challenge. The game also provides a \u0026ldquo;weekly one-shot\u0026rdquo; challenge which provides a fixed scenario/villain and set of heroes to play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;ve played a lot of games of Sentinels, and probably only won something like 60-70% of them. Each game takes around an hour or so, maybe more if it was super difficult. Usually we lose when we choose some combination of random heroes just to try them out then get beaten terribly by the villain. Then we go on a revenge run using one of the simpler heroes like Legacy or Tachyon (or we just put in a healer like Dr Medico).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe digital version has the advantage that it automates a lot of the ability triggers and checks that the boardgame requires, which would usually be a lot of work. On the other hand, it has a UX disadvantage for those scenarios where an ability triggers multiple times and you want to make the same decision every time. In the real board game, you can just handwave it off by saying \u0026ldquo;Ok, we choose X is every time\u0026rdquo;, but in the digital version you have to click through every confirmation dialog every time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#9b343c2c14c495c5a8dd6b1afec25ba2-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2021/02/digital-boardgames-review-sentinels-of-the-multiverse/sentinels_hu55ebca5d49dfa13d3a35dca65e2ada62_322159_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"9b343c2c14c495c5a8dd6b1afec25ba2-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2021/02/digital-boardgames-review-sentinels-of-the-multiverse/sentinels.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"15 Feb 2021 7:34am\"\u003e15 Feb 2021 7:34am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe game\u0026rsquo;s aesthetic is very much classic comic books, even multiplayer games are joined by entering a code in the format of a comic book issue like \u0026ldquo;Justice Comics #153\u0026rdquo;. The art isn\u0026rsquo;t the most elaborate and could be better; in fact, they are planning a \u003ca href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/27/22250963/sentinels-of-the-multiverse-definitive-kickstarter-street-date-price\"\u003eDefinitive Edition of the boardgame\u003c/a\u003e that has even better art that is closer to the old-school comic book aesthetic. It looks like a signficant upgrade, so I expect if they ever release a digital version of the new version it would be a completely new game on Steam. Our group has enjoyed our Sentinels games though, so I fully expect we will be getting the new Steam version when it does come out.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I was ecstatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then my mother told me to stop talking about Back to the Future. ‚ÄúOther people are going to think it‚Äôs weird,‚Äù she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI learned three things from this interaction: one, it is bad to be really interested in things; two, if I was really interested in something, I should therefore hide it; and three, my mother cared more about me being normal than about me being happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to blame the parent for this sort of interaction, as most likely they grew up in the sort of society that routinely punished noncomformity (or weirdness). Luckily, in today\u0026rsquo;s modern society, there\u0026rsquo;s less pressure to be ashamed of the things that give us joy, since the online communities make it easier to connect with people who share similar interests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe linked post above goes on to talking about how as an adult, she learned to find joy through her fandom of the South Korean group BTS. I have no interest in such things myself, but I follow a few people on Twitter who are unashamedly fans and they will sometimes Tweet something like \u0026ldquo;sorry to my followers for all the spam\u0026rdquo;, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my view, such apologies shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be necessary. Social media is a public platform where you\u0026rsquo;re free to follow and unfollow as you wish. If you choose to follow someone, obviously you think some percentage of what they say will be of interest to you, but you should also accept that they aren\u0026rsquo;t the exact same person you are and they may have other interests and they will talk about what they want to talk about. If the volume is unsatisfactory to you, feel free to unfollow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this same reason, I dislike it when people complain to other people on Twitter in the vein of \u0026ldquo;I followed you for $TOPIC, please stop talking $OTHERTOPIC\u0026rdquo;. (Usually $OTHERTOPIC is something like politics.) Basically \u0026ldquo;stay in your lane.\u0026rdquo; People are complete people and not just whatever aspect you happen to enjoy. Let them enjoy what they enjoy and talk about what they want to talk about, and just unfollow if it\u0026rsquo;s too much for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0026rsquo;t be ashamed to talk about things you enjoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Obviously, as long as you\u0026rsquo;re not hurting other people. \u003ca href=\"/2019/02/be-excellent-to-each-other/\"\u003eBe excellent to each other.\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

From roaming the plains of Africa, to settling down and building homes, to buying food in central markets, to instituting courts of law. Progression is compression. \u003cem\u003eHow can I make it so everybody isn‚Äôt making their own shirts? Deciding their own justice? Tabulating their own spreadsheets?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve argued a few times on here in favor of decentralization (see \u003ca href=\"/2018/03/rethinking-facebook/\"\u003e1\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"/2018/08/blogging-and-the-decentralized-internet/\"\u003e2\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"/2021/01/tech-censorship/\"\u003e3\u003c/a\u003e), and the whole concept of movements like \u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/\"\u003eIndieweb\u003c/a\u003e is a preference for a decentralized internet where everyone has his or her own personal site, instead of reliance on centralized large silos like Facebook or Twitter or whatever. In fact, I still believe in that ideal for the internet as it was conceived. (See also: \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/badnetworker/status/1133363823728091136\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;four websites, each filled with screenshots of the other three\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I can see Will\u0026rsquo;s point. Human history definitely means we trend towards centralization in the long term. (Although our cultural and nationalistic differences are still too wide to tend towards centralized government for the planet\u0026hellip;) Still, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean there isn\u0026rsquo;t room for decentralized networks to also still exist, perhaps on the fringe. After all, not everyone wants to live in the big cities, there are still people who like growing their own food, people who prefer independent films over the ones made by big blockbuster conglomerates, people who want to support the small mom-and-pop stores over the big retail chains, etc. Even as culture and society consolidate and centralize, counter-cultures can still exist and even thrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just because things towards centralized platforms doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we have to accept the current platforms as the end state, we can still ask for something better. If the analogy was to compare online platform centralization to the tendency towards people living in large metropolitan areas, then something like Facebook could be considered analogous to the worst of industrialized cities: over-populated, polluted, scammers and other shady characters abound trying to see if they can make a quick buck off of you, strangers shouting at each other, law enforcement going after you for arbitrary reasons, and so on. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be like this. The same way we are trying to have better, well-designed cities with better, cleaner systems to better support populations at scale, we also need to work hard to have better centralized silos and platforms, ones that work for us instead of against us. If we have to in a city, it might as well be a good city.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Will Schreiber argues that decentralization is a narrative mirage:\n Human history is a story of increasing centralization. From roaming the plains of Africa, to settling down and building homes, to buying food in central markets, to instituting courts of law. Progression is compression. How can I make it so everybody isn‚Äôt making their own shirts? Deciding their own justice? Tabulating their own spreadsheets?\n I\u0026rsquo;ve argued a few times on here in favor of decentralization (see 1, 2, 3), and the whole concept of movements like Indieweb is a preference for a decentralized internet where everyone has his or her own personal site, instead of reliance on centralized large silos like Facebook or Twitter or whatever.",

That might have been true back in 2010, back before all these youngsters came online and added all their vlogs and tiktoks and whatnot. This newsletter (and the next one) helps me keep up with all of the modern internet\u0026rsquo;s day-to-day nonsense. Each issue of Today in Tabs is dense and jam-packed with a whole bunch of recent cool internet things.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.garbageday.email\"\u003eGarbage Day\u003c/a\u003e by \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/broderick\"\u003eRyan Broderick\u003c/a\u003e. I first encountered this newsletter when someone shared his \u003ca href=\"https://www.garbageday.email/p/everything-you-need-to-know-about\"\u003earticle giving an explainer about the Tumblr subculture\u003c/a\u003e. It covers a variety of internet-focused topics, but each issue focuses on less\u0026hellip; things than Today In Tabs, albeit covering each item with just a bit more depth. Together, both newsletters give me a good idea of what\u0026rsquo;s happening on the internet on a regular basis.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://vicki.substack.com/\"\u003eNormcore Tech\u003c/a\u003e by \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/vboykis\"\u003eVicki Boykis\u003c/a\u003e. The author\u0026rsquo;s background is in data science, and from their own description, the newsletter offers \u0026ldquo;takes on tech news that are rooted in humanism, nuance, context, rationality, and a little fun\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; I couldn\u0026rsquo;t write a better explanation than that.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n",
            "summary": "A while back I wrote about how I wasn\u0026rsquo;t a big fan of the recent trend of newsletters. Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve realized Substack actually publishes RSS feeds for their newsletters, so I\u0026rsquo;ve been following a a bit more of them. I thought I\u0026rsquo;d recommend a few that I\u0026rsquo;ve found to be quite interesting/useful:\n Money Stuff by Matt Levine. The only non-substack entry on today\u0026rsquo;s list, this Bloomberg column covers financial matters like stock market and investment stuff.",

I\u0026rsquo;d define it as any blogging that isn\u0026rsquo;t for any kind of commercial purpose like for selling something or to generate ad revenue.

I feel like in the past few years, I\u0026rsquo;ve filtered my writing a bit by only writing blog posts when I feel like I have something longish or elaborate or profound to say, and that led to making it harder to write posts when I was low on energy or whatever. Most probably a consequence of the proliferation of microblogging, as if a post needed to justify it\u0026rsquo;s length so that it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t get relegated to the ranks of \u0026ldquo;notes\u0026rdquo;. And I\u0026rsquo;ve been restricting myself to at most one post a day, which is a bit arbitrary and entire meaningless. So, let\u0026rsquo;s change all that, I\u0026rsquo;m hoping.

id=\"2\"\u003e2\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve also been meaning to update the \u003ca href=\"/page/blogroll/\"\u003eblogroll\u003c/a\u003e on the site, since I haven\u0026rsquo;t added things there in a while. So I went through the good old RSS reader to find items to add to the blogroll, and I noted with sadness a number of blogs from old friends/people I knew who were still on my follows and were no longer active. But at least they were still there and I can still revisit all their old posts and thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorse than the inactive ones are those that are no longer accessible at all, either because their domains were no longer renewed, or their accounts on platforms like wordpress.com have been deactivated. Just another form of link rot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s one of the disadvantages of the whole \u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/personal-domain\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;owning your personal domain\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e principle promoted by the \u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/\"\u003eIndieweb\u003c/a\u003e. Domains require maintenance, which means money, and which also means such personal sites can easily fall out of maintenance and thus contribute to link rot. Granted, running your website on one of the silos has no guarantees either (see: Geocities), but at least those silos have more resources than any individual and are likely to give you a chance to archive your data before they shut down, if ever. (Well, IDK if Parler let their users do that\u0026hellip;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLink rot is one of the reasons that when I no longer use Twitter embeds on this site, since if the source tweet is deleted or the account gets banned or goes private, the embed breaks (and back when I was using \u003ca href=\"https://gohugo.io/\"\u003eHugo\u003c/a\u003e it would even break the build completely)).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"3\"\u003e3\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLink rot is inevitable, as I said. It\u0026rsquo;s part of the nature of the internet. Despite services such as \u003ca href=\"https://archive.org/\"\u003earchive.org\u003c/a\u003e, it\u0026rsquo;s probably impossible to keep the entire web of the internet online at the same time. Links will break and rot as time goes by. Maybe trying to avoid link rot completely is an impossible ideal, akin to wishing people never die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I guess that it\u0026rsquo;s also a bit selfish of me to want everything to be preserved no matter what. People have a right to want their content off the internet or be private if that\u0026rsquo;s what they want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"4\"\u003e4\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for my own content, I am well aware of my own mortality, and hope all this nonsense I write, such as it is can somehow survive beyond me. Aside from my current hosting, a mirror of all the site content is currently published to \u003ca href=\"https://mirror.roytang.net/\"\u003emirror.roytang.net\u003c/a\u003e. Of course, that\u0026rsquo;s still under my domain, so if I ever slip and lose the domain, or if I kick the bucket, it won\u0026rsquo;t be accessible either. But at least all my content exists in source form on the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/roytang/blog/\"\u003egithub repo for this blog\u003c/a\u003e. And a good chunk of that has already been preserved in \u003ca href=\"https://archiveprogram.github.com/\"\u003eGithub\u0026rsquo;s Arctic Code Vault\u003c/a\u003e, so at the very least if all of humanity perishes, some record of me personally may still survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

One of the first things I had to do was to go through and identify any broken links. So I wrote a quick Python script to ping the URLs and it turns out there were a lot of them, unsurprising given the archives go back to 2004.",

I watched the first few episodes, the series is as insane as I remember. It has English dubs, so I can watch it in the background (since I\u0026rsquo;ve already seen it before), but I have a bunch of other stuff to watch, so we\u0026rsquo;ll see.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWandaVision\u003c/strong\u003e episode 5 was fantastic. It also may or may not be a BIG DEAL (tm). We\u0026rsquo;ll see. I was a bit annoyed that this was a weekly show, but the reality is that their cliffhangers wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been as effective (or generated as much discussion/hype) if all the episodes came in one drop, so I guess it\u0026rsquo;s okay.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOn a whim, I decided to watch the \u003cstrong\u003eRoyal Rumble\u003c/strong\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s so weird since their events have virtual audiences (with the wall of faces). Also like 1/3 to 1/2 of the actual Rumble participants have been around since forever, and in fact the current winner Edge won the Rumble for the first time 11 years ago to the day (which, together with him starting at #1, was a pretty strong hint he\u0026rsquo;d be winning). Not sure if I\u0026rsquo;d watch Wrestlemania in two months, since I don\u0026rsquo;t really follow anymore and I\u0026rsquo;m not really invested in the storylines or anything, but they really do a pretty good job of recapping storylines, feuds, etc in the events themselves.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGaming:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNew Humble Choice is out and includes \u003cstrong\u003eValkyria Chronicles 4\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eEndless Space 2\u003c/strong\u003e, which seem like good picks for me, so I\u0026rsquo;m probably getting it.
