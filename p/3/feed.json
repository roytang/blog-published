It is what it is though. I guess I haven\u0026rsquo;t really had time for longer writing things lately?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not \u003cem\u003ework\u003c/em\u003e busy, but the I have felt busy during the past week. Part of it is probably becaause I\u0026rsquo;ve started \u003ca href=\"/tags/inktober2020\"\u003edoing the Inktober thing\u003c/a\u003e, so that\u0026rsquo;s an additional daily task. Another part of it is probably the fact that I purchased a Nintendo Switch last week!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, gaming then:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe aforementioned Nintendo Switch. I got Super Mario 3D All Stars and Link\u0026rsquo;s Awakening together with the purchase. I originally wanted to get Mario Odyssey, Fire Emblem and Paper Mario as well, but I figured two games (really four) was plenty for a first set, and my brother was going to lend me Odyssey anyway. I started playing \u003ca href=\"/2020/09/1310497720117784577/\"\u003eMario 64\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;m not too far in, but I found the camera really problematic, and I can\u0026rsquo;t play it for too long without getting dizzy. I also started playing Super Mario Sunshine, which was a noticeable improvement camera-wise, and I can play it for extended periods without dizziness problems, so I\u0026rsquo;m quite a bit farther along there. I hope to get back to Mario 64 eventually, but it\u0026rsquo;s no big loss if I don\u0026rsquo;t. I understand it\u0026rsquo;s a classic game a lot of people look back fondly on, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s aged well, and not just because of camera problems.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also tried the \u003ca href=\"/2020/10/1311655542008377346/\"\u003efree Super Mario 35 battle royale game\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s reasonably fun, although when you\u0026rsquo;re at the last 2-3 players, it takes a while to get to a winner.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFinally managed to \u003ca href=\"/2020/10/1311602939891535872/\"\u003ehit the 7 wins in Zendikar Rising draft\u003c/a\u003e! Standard is still terrible though. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll just play 1 draft a week and that\u0026rsquo;s it? The MTG community was also in an uproar the past few weeks, both due to the poor state of standard and due to some controversy over an upcoming Secret Lair crossover with The Walking Dead. WOTC has implied they are looking at expanding Magic mechanics to other IPs, so the TWD thing is mostly a trial balloon, I think. Many people are upset and are predicting the death of Magic, but the game has been pronounced dead before. We\u0026rsquo;ll see what happens. I\u0026rsquo;m not personally affected (since I don\u0026rsquo;t Commander), my primary concern is the health of Standard formats.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSaturday gaming group picked up a new multiplayer game, it\u0026rsquo;s Root, from Leder Games (and published for digital by Dire Wolf, creators of \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/\"\u003eEternal\u003c/a\u003e). It\u0026rsquo;s reasonably complicated, and thematically and mechanically quite different from the last digital boardgame we were doing (Blood Rage).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mentioned last week that I was planning to participate in \u003ca href=\"https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/\"\u003eHacktoberfest\u003c/a\u003e. I haven\u0026rsquo;t yet, and there was some controversy over the past few weeks, with OSS maintainers complaining about spam PRs due to the event. Apparently, it was the fault of a Youtube who had a few hundred thousand followers. He had made a video showing how easy it was to make PRs and win the event swag, and a lot of people were following his low effort examples. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if I\u0026rsquo;ll still participate, though I have been looking around a few repos here and there, we\u0026rsquo;ll see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, I haven\u0026rsquo;t watched anything of note the past week. A couple of standup specials on Netflix, that\u0026rsquo;s it. I guess the Switch took most of my entertainment time!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIFTTT, a service I\u0026rsquo;ve \u003ca href=\"/2019/01/ifttt/\"\u003ebeen using for a while now\u003c/a\u003e, has \u003ca href=\"/2020/10/1312652625511280640/\"\u003eobnoxiously been insisting I upgrade to their Pro tier\u003c/a\u003e. They\u0026rsquo;re going to start severely restricting free accounts, so I\u0026rsquo;m looking to minimize my usage of the service moving forward. All of the social media syndication stuff can be handled by the new blog backend I\u0026rsquo;m writing, so that\u0026rsquo;s fine. The only things that should remain are stuff I haven\u0026rsquo;t looked into automating myself yet, mainly backing up of SMS, so I\u0026rsquo;ll probably look into that soonish. I\u0026rsquo;m not against paying for services, but in this case it\u0026rsquo;s simply not worth it for me, since I can trivially write my own replacement software for most of my usage of the service. So long IFTTT, it\u0026rsquo;s been swell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no closing words of wisdom today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",

I last \u003ca href=\"/2019/02/hacktoberfest/\"\u003eparticipated in 2018\u003c/a\u003e, skipped last year because I was a bit busy.

It\u0026rsquo;s one of those projects where I find myself being productive not because of deadlines or anything like that, but because I genuinely enjoy working on it. When I find myself thinking of of new things that need to be done, or a new feature, or a way to solve an interesting problem, I am cursed (blessed?) with restlessness until I get it done. There are a number of challenges with the way I chose to approach this problem, most probably the subject of a future blog post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned this before, but I went ahead and paid for a year of the Micro plan on Migadu.com. The email in/out limits aren\u0026rsquo;t that high, but the price is decent, and I don\u0026rsquo;t really use my personal email that much anyway (I\u0026rsquo;m no spammer!). I\u0026rsquo;ll re-evaluate next year whether I want to migrate. (Sets a calendar event.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuff I\u0026rsquo;ve watched this past week:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI went ahead and watched the second season of Umbrella Academy. It\u0026rsquo;s more or less structured like the first season: each member has their own problems; five discovers an upcoming apocalypse, so he tries to bring everyone together; also, there\u0026rsquo;s people who want to kill them. The ending of this is more satisfying than S1 though\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEnola Holmes on Netflix. It was ok, but it\u0026rsquo;s more of a young adult story, maybe a bit above the Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys level.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaming this past week:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emanaged to get in a \u003ca href=\"/tags/mtgznr/\"\u003ecouple more Zendikar Rising drafts\u003c/a\u003e. Fun format, but I continue to have a terrible record, with only one draft actually going well. I did get a refund for that last one, so let\u0026rsquo;s see if we can\u0026rsquo;t do better this coming week!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eadditional drop on the Civ6 New Frontier pass came out, giving us Gaul and Byzantium. A friend and I tried it in a multiplayer game. I played Byz and he went with Gaul; we only played for a couple of hours, but both new civs seem quite powerful.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emy SC2 group managed to finish the Wings of Liberty coop campaign! Pretty fun, and it was fun to relive the story too, as I had already forgotten a lot of it. We started the Heart of the Swarm version the next day.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSaturday gaming group have been playing Blood Rage over the past few months, and it even came out with a new DLC/expansion a couple of weeks ago. The game client is a bit buggy, but we tolerate it because it\u0026rsquo;s a fun/deep game anyway. We\u0026rsquo;re looking at maybe trying out a different game next week though.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTrivia was meh this week, the topics weren\u0026rsquo;t really to our liking.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI purchased last month\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription\"\u003eHumble Choice\u003c/a\u003e (or rather, let it lapse into purchase). It\u0026rsquo;s not unreasonable, there\u0026rsquo;s some games there I can try like Forager and Evoland, and given my recent streak of Mario playing, I was wanting a platformer for the PC, so Yooka Layle isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad idea\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLate-breaking Sunday news: I have kind of impulse bought a Nintendo Switch. Well, I was agonizing over it for a while, but stores were selling it just a bit overpriced. Today I found that there was a slight price drop (around $40 worth) of the Labo bundle at one of my local stores, so I impulsively went ahead and ordered it. Maybe should have waited a day or so? regardless, it\u0026rsquo;s on the way, along with Zelda: Link\u0026rsquo;s Awakening and Super Mario 3D All Stars. No interest in the Labo personally, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll try to sell it off?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe tried using Messenger Rooms for a family conf call today, in lieu of Zoom which limits us to 40-minute calls. Might have been bad luck or poor internet, but the experience was substantially worse. Disconnections, lag, poor video quality, etc. We\u0026rsquo;ll see if they want to switch back to Zoom next time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems weird that we are so close to the end of 2020 now. Still no idea what Christmas is going to look like. I\u0026rsquo;m sure many other people are also looking forward to closing out 2020 and going to 2021, even though that holds no logical promise of things being better than they are now. But we can always dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",

This one will probably get finished: I\u0026rsquo;m writing a Django based server for this website. I am generally happy with the current Hugo workflow I use for publishing things here, but the build times have struggled with the sheer number of posts I have. This started back when I decided to \u003ca href=\"/2019/10/archive-of-my-own/\"\u003estart importing my social media activity to this site\u003c/a\u003e, which increased the post count from a couple of thousand to more than twenty thousand now. Even the automated builds take forever, and I can\u0026rsquo;t even run the local Hugo build on my laptop due to too many open files error on Mac. And Hugo is already one of the faster static site generators, so I have doubt that other SSGs would be able to solve this problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI briefly considered moving back to Wordpress, but that seems like a step back. I also briefly considered writing a new backend using a new programming language like Rust, giving me an opportunity to learn something new as well. But I kind of needed to get this done quickly, given that I have a pending server migration within the next couple of months; it\u0026rsquo;s not necessary, but it would be nice to have the new system up in place by the time I do that, so that all the migration happens in one go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am still generally happy with the workflow of writing using my local editor and pushing markdown files to git, so I plan to retain that. The Django webapp will have a database, but that will be a secondary data structure used mainly for indexing and searches. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be some kind of weird file system/database storage, we\u0026rsquo;ll see how that goes. Anyway, probably more details on all that when I am ready to deploy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuff I\u0026rsquo;ve been watching this past week: I finished both seasons of Cobra Kai. The series is decent. I\u0026rsquo;m here mostly for the Karate Kid nostalgia and the Lawrence/LaRusso rivalry. Season two had a lot of high school drama, which I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too interested in, so I liked the first season a lot more. Will still probably watch S3 when it comes out on Netflix. Now to figure out what to watch next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaming this past week:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eZendikar Rising is out on Magic Arena! I\u0026rsquo;ve already played a couple of drafts, but things didn\u0026rsquo;t go as well as I hoped, so now I am poor, will probably be able to draft again in a couple of days. Hopefully I get better at this format, as I\u0026rsquo;ve been planning to draft this set a lot; posts on these should be under \u003ca href=\"/tags/mtgznr/\"\u003ethe mtgznr tag\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edidn\u0026rsquo;t play much else this week other than the regular multiplayer games with the gaming groups SC2, Blood Rage, etc. I have yet to find a new game to knock off the backlog. I have also been considering trying out some of the smaller indie games in my collection, and maybe streaming some let\u0026rsquo;s play/reviews for them, as a bit of support for indie game devs.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethis week was the much awaited PS5 announcement, with pricing and release dates and everything! The $499 price tag is reasonable, but I probably won\u0026rsquo;t be getting one on launch, since there\u0026rsquo;s not a lot of games I want immediately. I will admit to getting a bit excited at the FF16 reveal, but that\u0026rsquo;s probably a ways off. I\u0026rsquo;m probably more likely to get a Switch first.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrivia team put up a new chaotic video of \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U52L9c2kB8M\"\u003eus playing some trivia\u003c/a\u003e. Check it out, like, subscribe, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig news from the other side of the pacific is that US SC Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has died. \u0026ldquo;No no no\u0026rdquo; was trending on Twitter for a little bit, and a lot of people on my timeline were swearing. I had a short discussion with some friends living on the west coast about it. Many of my US friends also have some level of anxiety/worry about what\u0026rsquo;s going to happen during/after their elections. It\u0026rsquo;s actually annoying how informed I am about US politics, although it doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect me directly. Like it or not though, the US further sliding into single-party autocracy will likely be bad for the rest of the world, so let\u0026rsquo;s all hope they get their shit together.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "It\u0026rsquo;s hard to imagine this is already the 3rd week of September, it feels like the month is passing by quickly, although I haven\u0026rsquo;t been particularly busy recently.\nI did do some paid work this past week; not a lot, just filling in to provide some emergency support/consultation.\nI guess the reason it feels like the week passed by quickly is that I started a new side project (like many programmers, I am afflicted by the curse of wanting to start too many side projects).",

I get to play with banned cards!\noops, went down for maintenance! Hopefully this is still around when it comes back up (and that I dont get the third loss!)\nWe\u0026rsquo;re back! I decided to wrap this up before drafting Zendikar. When my opponents pause with Fires or Teferi on the stack, I can only assume they are dumbfounded lol",

Not so much with work, though there was a bit of that due to a required emergency software change (aren\u0026rsquo;t they always emergencies?). I wasn\u0026rsquo;t doing the emergency work myself, more like consulting and advising how to approach it, so not much to tell there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did quite a bit of work on my personal data processes/backups/workflows. It involved streamlining my backups, dedepulication, going through old records and cleaning them up, and so on. Some combination of Python scripts and manual work was required. One specific thing I did was to get a whole bunch of my old photos out of Google Photos and onto disk backups, and also had to do some deduplication there. I was able to remove around 1300 duplicates from over 12000 photos, so around 10% ish duplication rate, not too bad. My original intent was to remove them from Google Photos, dedupe, then add them back, but now I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure I need to add them back. The main advantage of Google Photos has been that they make the photos more searchable, but I don\u0026rsquo;t seem to have an urgent need for that anyway, and probably there are other ways to do that? I guess I\u0026rsquo;ll look into it when the time comes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have also been browsing some old (physical) albums stored around the house. There\u0026rsquo;s another few thousand photos there, I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of eventually digitizing them, as a means of backup, but that\u0026rsquo;s a lot of work, so maybe in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaming was good again this week. I finished \u003ca href=\"/2020/09/uncharted4/\"\u003eUncharted 4\u003c/a\u003e! I guess any week where I manage to tick something off the backlog is a good week. Last weekend I mentioned I was near the end, that was so untrue lol. Turned out more than half the game was still to come. My SC2 buddies and I started to play this 3-player coop version of the Wings of Liberty campaign (avaiable as custom arcade things), that\u0026rsquo;s been fun. Then the usual stuff: Blood Rage with the Saturday group. Quiz nights/codenames with the trivia team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kind of want to get into SFV again, presumably there\u0026rsquo;s a flood of new players coming in recently since it was free on PS+ this past month, so hopefully it won\u0026rsquo;t be so hard to find matches this time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy desire for a Nintendo Switch is being tempered by two things at the moment:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003erumors of a new, upgraded Switch coming out next year. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the first time that I\u0026rsquo;ve purchased a console just before it\u0026rsquo;s successor came out though.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efrustration at the difficulty of the special stages in Super Mario 3D Land lol. It\u0026rsquo;s a stark reminder that I\u0026rsquo;m getting old and I\u0026rsquo;m not as good at these games as I used to be.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring this week, I binged four seasons of Superstore. It\u0026rsquo;s a reasonable enough ensemble comedy, though it\u0026rsquo;s no Brooklyn Nine Nine. A lot of the characters\u0026rsquo; problems are of their own making due to selfishness, that\u0026rsquo;s always annoying. But it\u0026rsquo;s good enough for side-watching while I\u0026rsquo;m doing other things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also started watching Cobra Kai, not even halfway through the first season yet. It\u0026rsquo;s slightly painful, since it casts Johnny Lawrence as the POV character/protagonist, and he\u0026rsquo;s kind of a loser asshole, but we\u0026rsquo;ll see how it goes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy desktop PC seems to be showing it\u0026rsquo;s age. It\u0026rsquo;s like recently I\u0026rsquo;ve been hitting 100% CPU and/or RAM much more often. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried uninstalling some unneeded software, hopefully that helps. I got this PC back in 2015, so it\u0026rsquo;s not unreasonable that I might need an upgrade soon, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I want to spend that money yet. I\u0026rsquo;m kind of hoping it can still hold on for a few years still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSame thoughts for the rest of the world, I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
