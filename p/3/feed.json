            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThis last week was weird. I feel like I didn\u0026rsquo;t really get much done in terms of productivity, yet I don\u0026rsquo;t feel I was unproductive. A very relaxed and chill week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again a tiny bit of work done this past week, some fixes, including to side projects. I also spent some time preparing for some events next weekend. Although I wasn\u0026rsquo;t productive this week, I did outline a bit of a roadmap of new features for one of my side projects, hopefully I can get into that in the coming weeks!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are still in a pandemic! But I did have my first dine-in meal at a restaurant last Monday. It was because I went to get blood drawn for routine medical reasons, and I had needed to skip breakfast for the test (spoiler: my blood sugar levels were very, very normal). So after getting the blood drawn I was super hungry and decided to have breakfast at the nearby Pancake House. I was the only customer since it was super early (and you know, pandemic), although a second guy came in after I had given my order. I almost subconsciously picked up the glass of water to sip from it as soon as it was served, luckily I remembered I was wearing a face mask and a face shield. I decided to hold off on removing the gear until the actual pancakes were served, to minimize the exposure time. The next day I also decided to have a snack at a Starbucks after running some errands, mainly because I had a free coffee from Globe Rewards. It was afternoon so there were a few other customers there. The cashier said it was ok to dine in, but for a maximum of one hour only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a longish post I was writing, but it felt too raw to publish and might break it up into smaller posts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe actually managed to win an online quiz night this week! It\u0026rsquo;s been a while, good job trivia team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt feels great to no longer be following the covid19 stats regularly, even though they are still fairly terrible. UP experts are projecting that we get the reproduction rate to below 1 in like a month though, so that\u0026rsquo;s some good news, though we may still be a ways away from getting this under control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are the things I\u0026rsquo;ve been watching and playing the past week:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStill playing a lot of SC2 Coop, trying to unlock the new prestiges. Levelling the commanders again can be a pain, but at least they managed to provide new goals/objectives for the players, breathing back a bunch of life into this game mode.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStill drafting Amonkhet Remastered, although the last few drafts haven\u0026rsquo;t gone well. Need to save up gems, so I\u0026rsquo;ll do one last one draft once I get enough gold.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHuh, I guess I kind of paused Uncharted 4 for most of the week, not sure why. I should get back to it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI started re-playing Super Mario 3D Land (on the 3DS) lately, mostly to stave off my desire to get a Nintendo Switch (prices are still inflated here due to supply issues!). I had forgotten a lot about this game, so even when I finished the first 8 worlds and rescued Princess Peach, I was pleasantly surprised to find there were another 8 \u0026ldquo;special\u0026rdquo; worlds to play!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewatched the video game history documentary \u003cstrong\u003eHigh Score\u003c/strong\u003e on Netflix. Pretty good, although there\u0026rsquo;s some Dragon Quest erasure going on in the RPG episode!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewatched \u003cstrong\u003eBill and Ted Face the Music\u003c/strong\u003e, this was a most excellent sequel. I found the start a bit clunky (I always find it awkward watching characters be awkward), but the rest of it was a fun and sweet adventure that echoed elements of both of the first two movies. A lot of the time travel stuff didn\u0026rsquo;t make any sense if you sat down and thought about it, but I was smiling through a lot of it. Little Billie and Theda are great!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ealso watched \u003cstrong\u003eSuperman: Man of Tomorrow\u003c/strong\u003e, the first entry in the new DC animated universe (following the reboot at the end of Justice League Dark: Apokolips). Yet another Superman origin story here. Not too happy with this one. Not fond of the animated style, and the writing and plot seemed weird at many points. I felt like there could have been a better way to resolve the whole situation with the big bad that felt more \u0026ldquo;Superman\u0026rdquo;-like, and the movie doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to earn the monicker \u0026ldquo;Man of Tomorrow\u0026rdquo; for the hero.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efor one reason or another, I also ended up watching a few standup specials on Amazon Prime. A couple from Craig Ferguson, and one from Jimmy Yang.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCobra Kai is now on Netflix! Yet another thing to add to the ever-increasing backlog.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome tech stuff:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI have about three months left on my Webfaction hosting, which I\u0026rsquo;ve \u003ca href=\"/2019/03/rip-webfaction/\"\u003ebeen planning to migrate away from\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;m currently leaning towards getting a cheap $5/mo VPS from Linode, although I\u0026rsquo;m still willing to accept any recommendations. Switching to a VPS means more effort (since it won\u0026rsquo;t be a managed service anymore), but that should provide some learning opportunities. It\u0026rsquo;s just as well anyway, my apps have been pushing the memory limits on the current hosting, and even the cheapest Linode VPS provides more RAM.  I\u0026rsquo;ll probably start looking into the migration in September.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI wrote before about \u003ca href=\"/2020/05/gmail-migration/\"\u003emigrating away from GMail\u003c/a\u003e, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Migadu.com\u0026rsquo;s free tier for about half a year now. This past week, they wrote that they are sunsetting the free tier. Totally understandable, given the economy. They are also introducing a new Micro tier at $20 a year, with slightly better limits than the old free tier, so I may migrate to that near the end of September (when the free tier runs out). In theory, I could just try to run a mail server on whatever VPS I set up (see above bullet), but that\u0026rsquo;s a big hassle. This cost + the $5/mo for the VPS is still less than what I was paying for at Webfaction, so I don\u0026rsquo;t mind paying for this for a while.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI was notified by a local bank that their old web platform is being sunsetted and I needed to migrate to the new system, so I did that. But whenever I tried the migration steps, the process never completed, it just kept telling me it was processing. I finally had to message someone I knew on the dev team lol. Hopefully it can getr resolved next week.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",
            "summary": "This last week was weird. I feel like I didn\u0026rsquo;t really get much done in terms of productivity, yet I don\u0026rsquo;t feel I was unproductive. A very relaxed and chill week.\nOnce again a tiny bit of work done this past week, some fixes, including to side projects. I also spent some time preparing for some events next weekend. Although I wasn\u0026rsquo;t productive this week, I did outline a bit of a roadmap of new features for one of my side projects, hopefully I can get into that in the coming weeks!",

He has to be one of the most peak-performance athletes in the world to consistently pull of the jumping and wall climbing stunts he regularly does. Not to mention being able to win over basically hordes of heavily-armed mercenaries in gunfights. Not that it\u0026rsquo;s not fun and engaging as a game, it just feels so ridiculous.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.dcfandome.com\"\u003eDC Fandome\u003c/a\u003e was today, I watched some panels and new trailers and such.

Their main sin is that they are audio-only. When consuming content, my order of preference for formats is roughly:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003etext (+images I guess) (most preferred)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003evideo (with audio)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eaudio only (least preferred)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think these preferences have to do with information density: I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I prefer text because text can convey the most amount of information in the least amount of bits. I\u0026rsquo;ll also watch informative videos, to a point. If it\u0026rsquo;s movie-length, it better be damn entertaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat leaves us with audio. I don\u0026rsquo;t see the appeal. I try podcasts, sometimes, when I\u0026rsquo;m out walking or such. Audiobooks, I\u0026rsquo;ve never tried. My main concern is the amount of attention you have to give the content. Because you only have the audio as a source of information, if you lose track of it, then why are you even bothering? And if I try to listen to an audiobook or podcast while doing something else that requires my attention, there\u0026rsquo;s a very low chance I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to absorb anything from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the few times I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to listen to podcasts while I\u0026rsquo;m out walking, I only dare to if I\u0026rsquo;m walking in this safe, short, and circular route inside our subdivision. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t dare do it in the streets outside where there\u0026rsquo;s real traffic. That seems like a recipe for being distracted while crossing the road, which CAN LEAD TO DEATH! Granted, the odds of such a disaster are fairly low, but why risk it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe if I still had a regular 2-hour commute (one way) to work, then audiobooks/podcasts would be more appealing while I sit in the back of an FX in Metro Manila traffic. But even then, I think I\u0026rsquo;d rather nap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make an exception for listening to music of course. Listening to music doesn\u0026rsquo;t take much concentration, and can easily happen as a background task, so that\u0026rsquo;s fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I just haven\u0026rsquo;t found the right podcast to follow? IDK, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried a few. Never could keep it up as a habit. Also, can I subscribe to podcasts using RSS feeds? I think I can, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never tried it. Like, if I find a podcast on Spotify there doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be an RSS option?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"newsletters\"\u003eNewsletters\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy \u0026ldquo;Newsletters\u0026rdquo;, I don\u0026rsquo;t mean those popups that appear on news sites or commercial blogs asking you to subscribe to get updates or such. Those are just spammy marketing BS and I have no interest in such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy \u0026ldquo;Newsletters\u0026rdquo;, I\u0026rsquo;m referring to a recent trend in the tech/online world of people moving their writing from websites/blogs to newsletters via platforms such as substack. These have some merit, as it basically involves the type of blog writing I like to consume, except in email newsletter form. There are some such newsletters whose posts I\u0026rsquo;ve read and I do find their content interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what\u0026rsquo;s the problem? The problem is I want to treat this type of content the same way I treat blog posts and newspaper editorials - as casual reading that I can pick up and read at my leisure. And (for me at least), casual reading doesn\u0026rsquo;t belong in my email inbox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have an inbox zero policy, and to achieve that I\u0026rsquo;m very strict about what I let in my email inbox. It\u0026rsquo;s mostly limited to actual conversations with people and important notifications. The email inbox is \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e where I\u0026rsquo;d like to consume casual reading that I can pick up whenever I\u0026rsquo;d like. Just the idea of leaving them there while having unread markers is annoying. In theory I could filter them to a subfolder and then the unread count would accumulate there, but I don\u0026rsquo;t like unread counts even in my email subfolders!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have nothing against the Substack business model (writers gotta earn a living I guess) and I\u0026rsquo;m sure a lot of people don\u0026rsquo;t mind consuming casual reading content via email, but Substack (and similar platforms) should provide alternate ways to consume their content, preferably RSS feeds. In the meantime I\u0026rsquo;ve been using a service called \u003ca href=\"https://kill-the-newsletter.com/\"\u003eKill the Newsletter\u003c/a\u003e to subscribe to a few newsletters I like. It works well enough (though I checked just now and one of the feeds, on a nonsubstack platform, seems to have stopped last June. I just created a new inbox in KTN for it).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(It would be even better if the content writers made their content available on their own websites, instead of centralized in a silo like Substack!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, are there any newsletters anyone can recommend that might be relevant to my interests?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eMozilla made the tech news recently for laying off a whole lot of people. (\u003ca href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/\"\u003eOfficial statement\u003c/a\u003e). People were alarmed and worried about the future of what is the last major independent browser and the open web, bit it looks like it isn\u0026rsquo;t that bleak. Most of the layoffs were to teams other than those working on Firefox, things like the experimental browser engine Servo, devtools, and MDN. The core Gecko team seems to be unaffected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that these things aren\u0026rsquo;t important. MDN, if you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar, is a set of documentation of web standards and browser support, \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\"\u003eavailable online\u003c/a\u003e, that is one of the best resources for web developers working on cross-platform things. Mozilla no longer funding it\u0026rsquo;s maintenance is a big deal, it means it\u0026rsquo;s less likely to be kept up-to-date, even though community work can still continue. Peter-Paul Koch, writer of \u003ca href=\"https://quirksmode.org\"\u003equirksmode.org\u003c/a\u003e, which was the original resource for cross-browser compatibility back in the heyday of the browser wars, wrote an article about Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s problems titled \u003ca href=\"https://quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2020/08/the_cult_of_the.html\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;The Cult of the Free\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e where he argues that it\u0026rsquo;s time to step out of this mentality that all these resources must be maintained for free by \u0026ldquo;the community\u0026rdquo;, but that we as consumers must get used to the idea of paying or donating to support these resources. Expecting \u0026ldquo;the community\u0026rdquo; to step in and maintain these resources \u003ca href=\"https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2020/08/i_love_mdn_or_t.html\"\u003ealso devalues the work of technical writers.\u003c/a\u003e Trying to get more people to support these \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; resources is a good idea, but I worry it goes against the grain of years of internet culture which has conditioned people to expect online content for free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of contributing, a while back I had considered looking for open source projects I could contribute to, and preferred projects that I actively use. Given that I\u0026rsquo;d been using Firefox \u003ca href=\"/2004/10/firefox-1-0-on-november-9/\"\u003esince before version 1.0\u003c/a\u003e, one of the projects I considered was Firefox. I went through the whole rigmarole of \u003ca href=\"https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/windows_build.html\"\u003etheir instructions to set up my machine for the Windows build\u003c/a\u003e, and just the setup process, which involved setting up and checking out code took more than an hour. That was fine for initial setup, but actually building and running Firefox itself took an additional hour or so. Might have been more than that even, it was a while back so I don\u0026rsquo;t clearly remember, but I do remember thinking that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have time for these hour-long build times. The whole set up also took up a nontrivial amount of my SSD disk space (imagine how much worse the build time would have been if I had used my non-SSD drive!), which I am always dangerously low on. These 2 factors led me to shelve the idea for the time being; perhaps I could revisit the idea of contributing to Firefox when I upgraded my computer or had more SSD space available. (TBF, I kind of gave up real quick after the first build, maybe the builds get faster on succeeding runs?). So that\u0026rsquo;s my personal \u0026ldquo;contributing-to-Firefox\u0026rdquo; story, for now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sheer size of the codebase and the long build times just drive home the point of how much modern browsers are these large complex beasts that are doing so much. They are pretty much an OS of their own since they host a ton of features and web applications and JIT JS and all of that. This means it\u0026rsquo;s really difficult for independent browser efforts to hit feature parity with modern web browsers - even just working with JS and CSS standards, there are so many to implement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew DeVault laments that \u003ca href=\"https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/13/Web-browsers-need-to-stop.html\"\u003eWeb browsers need to stop\u003c/a\u003e with all these new functionalities and APIs that add scope and complexity, and maybe focus more on performance, efficiency, etc. I do agree - if I was contributing to Firefox, I would want to find a way to reduce the massive memory footprint it always has. I don\u0026rsquo;t even use that many tabs, and I already feel burdened by Firefox\u0026rsquo;s memory footprint. (Pretty sure Chrome is pretty bad in this regard as well.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy care about Mozilla/Firefox at all? Why not just use Chrome, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty good right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, no, Chrome is not necessarily \u0026ldquo;pretty good\u0026rdquo;, given how it props up a surveillance capitalsm engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, even if you didn\u0026rsquo;t dislike Google, having a browser (engine) monoculture is not a good thing. I \u003ca href=\"/2020/02/old-web/\"\u003egot my start in web development\u003c/a\u003e at around the height of Internet Explorer 6\u0026rsquo;s dominance, and I\u0026rsquo;d rather not find my way back there. Granted, one of the issues back then was that IE6 was a stagnant platform that upstarts Firefox and eventually Chrome left behind. No such problem exists now, since Chrome is still in active development and still pushing new web standards forward. And the fact that Chrome is an open-source platform means in theory someone could just fork it if ever Google goes off the rails or such. (And people have already built indie browsers on top of Chrome of course!) But it\u0026rsquo;s still dangerous for a single company and/or codebase to be the sole major implementer of web standards. A single company dictating the future of the web isn\u0026rsquo;t a good thing, and is the very opposite of the idea of an \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo; web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSide note: Maybe I should try building Chromium too, just for comparison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, that\u0026rsquo;s all my ranting for today. In conclusion: reduce your surveillance capitalism footprint and support the open web, use Firefox.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThese weeknotes are coming in late in the day because of reasons. (The reasons being laziness and procrastination.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve been kind of phoning in the weeknotes over the past few weeks, they\u0026rsquo;ve mostly been \u0026ldquo;hey, I\u0026rsquo;ve been busy, so nothing of significance happened, but here are some things I watched/played.\u0026rdquo; Supposedly one of the side effects of writing regular updates is that you tend to look out for more interesting things to do so you have something to write about, even on an unconscious level. In the past few weeks, that has been problematic because (a) as mentioned, I\u0026rsquo;ve been busy with some things, so my excess time is devoted to less mentally taxing things like just watching movies/shows or destress with games; and (b) we are still in the middle of a pandemic!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of the pandemic, I read this piece recently on the Financial Times: \u003ca href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32d79c87-1ade-4b63-8d14-7af1a553d963\"\u003eWe won’t remember much of what we did in the pandemic\u003c/a\u003e, about how the sameyness of our days in quarantine means our brains compress that data since so little of it is meaningful, affecting our perception of time. When 99% of your activities take place in the same environment, in your room during a zoom call, everything just tends to blur together. And I guess that reflected in the weeknotes too! (For that reason, I\u0026rsquo;m switching up the weeknotes format today to be more freeform prose, we\u0026rsquo;ll see if it sticks.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of the pandemic part 2, one thing I have been doing since the pandemic started is writing a regular series of notes, first as \u003ca href=\"/2020/03/covid19/\"\u003eone long post that I kept updating every couple of days or so\u003c/a\u003e then later I transitioned to regular weekly update notes, on the same day as these weeknotes. The idea was that in the future I could just browse the \u003ca href=\"/tags/covid19/\"\u003ecovid19 tag\u003c/a\u003e on the site and I could recall what things were like during the days of quarantine and the quality of the government response. And this was fine during the start, since things happened and unfolded quickly. But these past few months, the updates have fallen in the quagmire of sameyness as well: I only went out once every 1 or 2 weeks, everything was always getting worse, cases were always going up, government response was always terrible, and so on. One thing the last few months has made clear for me is that the government has no clear plan on controlling this thing and so I am highly pessimistic that things will change anytime soon. For that reason, I\u0026rsquo;m just going to pause on doing the covid19 update notes for now, unless some drastic change happens.(I have no expectation of Russia\u0026rsquo;s vaccine having any effect on our status quo anytime soon!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, so how was my week? I wrapped up the things causing my busy-ness towards the middle of the week, so I expect to be less busy/stressed during the coming weeks. At the very least, I should be able to write on the blog more, and maybe do some work on some of my other side projects. I actually thought about writing some posts already last week but I was like you know what, I\u0026rsquo;ll just relax and watch things and play things and leave the writing to next week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are the things I\u0026rsquo;ve been watching and playing the past week:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMarvel\u0026rsquo;s Agents of SHIELD had their series finale last Thursday. I enjoyed the first half of this season, but the second half and the finale were just ok, maybe slightly meh. Still, the series finale was pretty good, wrapping things up nicely with a big bow. This series had a lot of haters, I think mostly because of mismatched expectations, because people wanted it to be more directly tied-in to the MCU movies, but that was never going to happen (maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll get that more with the coming Disney+ series). But I like it, it had a lot of fans, and it had a pretty good run. And it had Ghost Rider!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOne things I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing a bunch is Amonkhet Remastered, which came out on Magic Arena last Thursday. I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing drafts over on \u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy\"\u003ethe twitch channel\u003c/a\u003e, and archiving them to \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsD8jNRlYkw\u0026amp;list=PLmU0vkKslGXg6Pdu3_kaKx5oumTwftUUe\"\u003ethis playlist on the Youtube channel\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s fairly fun, though I need to play better. Watch me on Twitch/Youtube, or like and subscribe, all that jazz, if you like.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOh, I also finally finished \u003ca href=\"/2020/08/1293051269129486337/\"\u003eDivinity Original Sin 2\u003c/a\u003e! I really dragged out that last act for a few months, but I finally got there.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also \u003ca href=\"/2020/08/1294146833359364097/\"\u003etried out Fall Guys on PS4\u003c/a\u003e (free on PS+!). It\u0026rsquo;s fun but kind of frustrating, I guess this is why I don\u0026rsquo;t really play these battle royale kind of things.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePlayed a little bit Street Fighter x Tekken because of a reddit thread and am once again disappointed that (a) it was such a missed opportunity; and (b) up to now it\u0026rsquo;s still not available on Steam in SEA.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so one of the reasons I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing these \u0026ldquo;watching/playing lately\u0026rdquo; posts and segments is because I want to track what I have been watching/playing at any particular point in the past. And maybe I can have like a widget on the site with things like \u0026ldquo;Recently played\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Last movie watched\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;d also want to be able to search/query for things like \u0026ldquo;what year did I watch so-and-so movie?\u0026rdquo; (Helps with trivia quizzes!) I feel like I need to be recording these detail in more of a machine-readable format or a database in order to do those kinds of things. Maybe some kind of Goodreads-like system? It\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;d need to figure out how to implement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOk, this is already longer than I thought it would be. More things will be posted to the blog (hopefully!) later this week!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
