I actually started this a few years back, thought I\u0026rsquo;d actually get around to finish it. The book is an analysis of history, of what geographical advantages certain civilizations had that allowed them to triumph over others. He presents a lot of interesting topics covering linguistics, animal/plant domestication and food production that may explain these differences. Given my poor geography knowledge, I would have appreciated more maps in the book. There are some topics here I enjoyed more than others, such as how Pizarro conquered the Incans. But a lot of the topics are presented a bit dryly, in an academic fashion. Making academic topics interesting is tough, I found myself having difficulty reading some of the later chapters. The book overall is very informative though, I learned a lot about the sort of things historians analyze to understand the particulars of human civilization.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/18436248-roy-tang\"\u003eView all my reviews\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

IDK much about Davao, but my impression is he didn\u0026rsquo;t do that in 3-6 months. But I am happy that his \u0026ldquo;killing criminals\u0026rdquo; rhetoric now includes the rider that it must be within the scope of the law\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBinay\u0026rsquo;s preparation for this debate seems to have been to keep telling himself \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a decisive leader!!!

But none of the candidates detailed implementation plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiscussion on policies and issues generally one-sided - everyone agrees with the stuff that has to be done, but no one really talks about details of how, etc. Reflection of the fact that we don\u0026rsquo;t really have parties with differing ideologies (aside from Duterte\u0026rsquo;s federalism. Oh and Binay\u0026rsquo;s insistence that political dynasties are cool LOL)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from Binay getting shot down a few times, nothing too fiery/exciting happened.

Say what you will about the debate\u0026rsquo;s format and lack of challenging questions, but the fact that we are having any sort of discussion at all that manages to capture the public\u0026rsquo;s attention is already an improvement. Hopefully the organizers of the next two debates manage to learn something and try to improve on the first one\u003c/p\u003e\n",

You might have to do a lot of admin work yourself (managing your SSS, Philhealth, taxes, etc). Established companies will tend to have better benefits (HMO, vacation days, etc) too. On the upside, working for a startup generally means a looser culture, and a smaller company means you have greater influence over the culture there.",

For some people, programming is just a job: they come in, they do what they\u0026rsquo;re told to do, and go home. They don\u0026rsquo;t want to think about process involvement or anything like that. And that\u0026rsquo;s fine, if that\u0026rsquo;s the life they want.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\"\u003eThis applies to companies too: there will be companies that just want to get their projects done and out the door, and don\u0026rsquo;t want to think about process improvements, etc. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\"\u003eMy suggestion to you, if you are interested in that kind of thing, is to start looking around for companies more to your liking. It\u0026rsquo;s not really about talented/experienced programmers and more of about the company culture - although that will be driven largely by the senior programmers in the company. I would also prioritize working in companies that are primarily programming shops, instead of say, a programming department in a bank or some other type of business. Programming shops will be more focused on the dev process as one of their priorities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\"\u003eOr if you like your job and don\u0026rsquo;t want to leave, you can also try to persist. Don\u0026rsquo;t be obnoxious, but every so often when some problem is encountered you can say \u0026ldquo;we could have avoided this if we have done X\u0026rdquo; or something like that. Get to know the senior software developers on your team and try to discuss programming practices with them. If you stick around, eventually you will become the senior software developer and will have more influence on the culture.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\"\u003eGood luck!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The book starts off with a lot of action before settling into a phase where the three protagonists wander around a lot and sleep in tents and finally into a big showdown at Hogwarts with virtually every character in the series showing up for one big brawl. It\u0026rsquo;s fun to read, but I\u0026rsquo;d love to see it in the film too (soon!). I\u0026rsquo;m a bit ambivalent about how Severus Snape was handled, with the author basically treating him as a bad guy the entire series only to flip him at the last minute. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that Alan Rickman died before I finished the series - before Alan Rickman\u0026rsquo;s death I was unaware that Snape was a beloved character and being aware meant I knew he had to do a face turn at some point. The ending was satisfying enough, pretty good for a fantasy series actually; but I would\u0026rsquo;ve hoped for more details on what happened to the rest of the cast nineteen years later. We basically only got endings for Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione and Draco. Overall the series was pretty good, and covered some ground I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have expected for a children\u0026rsquo;s/young adult series.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/18436248-roy-tang\"\u003eView all my reviews\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",
