I mean, I\u0026rsquo;m all about productivity and improvement and changing for the better, but I\u0026rsquo;ve found that very specific resolutions don\u0026rsquo;t often work for me. Mostly because I have very little focus (obviously something that an be improved).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n    On \n    \u003ca href=\"/2015/12/682613316246585344/\"\u003e\u003ctime datetime=\"2015-12-31 17:24:31\"\u003e31 Dec 2015 5:24pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n    I wrote:\n    \u003cblockquote\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eNew Year\u0026rsquo;s resolutions: Read, write, watch, play, create, destroy, win, learn, improve, chill, move forward\u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo my tendency now is to stick to general, high level resolutions (like the above) that don\u0026rsquo;t go into anything too specific. And so this year I decided on something like that. My NYR for this year is: Do at least one personally productive thing per day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy \u003cem\u003epersonally,\u003c/em\u003e I mean something outside of work, something I do for myself. By \u003cem\u003eproductive\u003c/em\u003e, I mean something that helps me improve or grow or live a better life in some manner. And this excludes any manner of consumption (reading, eating, watching TV, browsing reddit, playing games, etc)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo yes, it\u0026rsquo;s still kind of vague, but my intent is to minimize or even completely avoid those days where I just totally laze out the entire day and not do anything outside of what I needed to do for work. Not that there\u0026rsquo;s anything wrong with that \u0026ndash; chilling out is important too \u0026ndash; but I felt like maybe I had a bit too many of those days last year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome examples of things which I think will qualify for this resolution:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eWriting a blog post.\u003c/em\u003e (Hooray, I already got one done today!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eDoing some work on one of my many secret projects that I never get going or never get finished.\u003c/em\u003e There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of these to choose from. It helps a bit with my lack of focus \u0026ndash; I can do other projects if I\u0026rsquo;m not in the mood for the previous one I was working on. If you\u0026rsquo;re curious, this typically means some kind of writing or programming project.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eSome art thing.\u003c/em\u003e I did get back into drawing and sketching in 2016 and kinda tapered off in 2017, hopefully I can get back on track.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eLearning something new\u003c/em\u003e. Arguably reading or being on the internet always lets me learn something new, but let\u0026rsquo;s say this means dedicating some focused time to a learning activity.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eThrowing out or deleting stuff I don\u0026rsquo;t need anymore.\u003c/em\u003e Not all growth comes from expansion; we also need to throw out old stuff we don\u0026rsquo;t need anymore to make room for the new.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eReorganizing/Cleaning up/Optimizing.\u003c/em\u003e This is pretty broad, but basically anything that streamlines some aspect of my life or makes it easier.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the previous year, I had actually wanted to pursue many of these things all at once \u0026ndash; I wanted to be able to do daily sketching AND writing AND cleaning up AND side projects, etc. Didn\u0026rsquo;t really work out, so this year we lower our standards a bit. Just one of those things per day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the challenges would be finding the time to be personally productive even during those days when I\u0026rsquo;m mentally tired out from work stuff \u0026ndash; you know, the kind of day where you get home and you just kinda wanna sit in a chair and not think about stuff too hard. Hopefully I don\u0026rsquo;t get too many of those days, but hopefully the resolution inspires me to do even one small thing during the difficult days.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I mean, I\u0026rsquo;m all about productivity and improvement and changing for the better, but I\u0026rsquo;ve found that very specific resolutions don\u0026rsquo;t often work for me.
