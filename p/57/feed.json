The best puns are so terrible and so great at the same time.

My dad used to do this a lot when we were kids (this might explain a lot!). He would say something like \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to go to Taco Beach!\u0026rdquo; because Taco Beach sounds like \u0026ldquo;takubets\u0026rdquo; which is 80s style slang for \u0026ldquo;kubeta\u0026rdquo;, meaning the toilet. (I have never heard anyone else refer to the toilet this way!) Another pun that I got from him was \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the Tagalog for \u0026lsquo;tweeter\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;? Back then, the word tweeter didn\u0026rsquo;t actually get used a lot, but in modern times, I changed it to this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n    On \n    \u003ca href=\"/2009/05/1872502526/\"\u003e\u003ctime datetime=\"2009-05-21 16:21:37\"\u003e21 May 2009 4:21pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n    I wrote:\n    \u003cblockquote\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eRT \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/roytang/\"\u003e@roytang\u003c/a\u003e: ano sa tagalog ang twitter? -\u0026gt; A: \u0026ldquo;Mat matamit\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI wish I had more puns to share here right now, but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to remember them. When I release a pun, it passes from my brain to the world and it belongs to the universe now. In hindsight, maybe whenever I posted a pun, I should have included some kind of hashtag. In my opinion, puns are a gift to the world. They inspire you to think creatively, and being used to making puns developer your wit. Because they are a gift to the world, whenever you think of a pun, it is your responsibility to unleash it upon the world, no matter how terrible you think it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#10a797a99cc4b5ca9bf95cd0b1724bf2-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/no-puns-left-unsaid/no_pun_intended_hubfc0760e5e49ef1b4a3653cef51ec6ab_97946_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"10a797a99cc4b5ca9bf95cd0b1724bf2-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2018/12/no-puns-left-unsaid/no_pun_intended.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"1 Dec 2018 1:59am\"\u003e1 Dec 2018 1:59am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll play Fire Emblem Fates just to see this dialogue lol)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePun with intention!

The first one is \u003cstrong\u003eHidden Figures\u003c/strong\u003e, about three black women who were instrumental during the early days of NASA leading up to the Friendship 7 mission piloted by John Glenn. The movie is fairly interesting if you are even remotely interested in either the challenges faced in black history or math and science or the early days of the space program competition between the USA and Russia. It feels even more appropriate to have watched this since it helps me appreciate the recent Insight mission.

This was a magnificent film, both for the music and the Freddie Mercury story. I guess it appeals more to those who are familiar with Queen music though. I\u0026rsquo;ve read that the movie isn\u0026rsquo;t super accurate especially with regards to the timeline, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s fine. Both the liberties they take and the music serve to construct a compelling narrative. The movie ends with a ten-minute recreation of the 1985 Live Aid concert and they do a good job of communicating the insane energy at Wembley Stadium back then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn less-biographical movies, I also watched \u003cstrong\u003eTeen Titans Go To The Movies\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of Teen Titans Go, it\u0026rsquo;s way too silly and it\u0026rsquo;s obviously for kids, I much preferred the previous Teen Titans series. I only got a copy of this movie because my niece said they watched this all the time back home, so now they can watch it when they\u0026rsquo;re over here either. I did enjoy the ridiculous plot and the Stan Lee cameo, but this isn\u0026rsquo;t something I would have watched in the theatre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn rewatch land, since I finished the Spider-Man PS4 game lately, I also watched \u003cstrong\u003eSpider-Man 2\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eSpider-Man 3\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eAmazing Spider-Man\u003c/strong\u003e, they\u0026rsquo;re nice movies to have playing in the background while you\u0026rsquo;re working on other stuff. \u003ca href=\"/2004/07/movies-spiderman-2/\"\u003eTobey 2\u003c/a\u003e was pretty good and I think it aged well, I\u0026rsquo;d say comparable with Tobey 1 even. \u003ca href=\"/2007/05/spider-man-3/\"\u003eTobey 3\u003c/a\u003e was trying to do way too much what with Venom and Sandman and Harry-Goblin. Andrew 1 had a lot of potential, but I think this series leaned too much into the dark and mysterious and sinister plot route.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTV-wise, nothing much other than the usual superhero series, though I\u0026rsquo;m still behind on Gifted and Doctor Who. I caught Trevor Noah\u0026rsquo;s new Netflix special, it was okay, but too exceptionally. Netflix also added a couple of \u0026ldquo;best of\u0026rdquo; seasons of Jeopardy which I thoroughly enjoyed. Watching these makes me think I\u0026rsquo;d never be able to win an episode of Jeopardy, but of course I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s fair to compare myself to some of Jeopardy\u0026rsquo;s all-time champions.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Some things I\u0026rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:\nFor some reason, I watched two biopics this month. The first one is Hidden Figures, about three black women who were instrumental during the early days of NASA leading up to the Friendship 7 mission piloted by John Glenn. The movie is fairly interesting if you are even remotely interested in either the challenges faced in black history or math and science or the early days of the space program competition between the USA and Russia.",

(Actually, this is mainly an excuse to write down a story about how stupid I am.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, yeah my bro got me a Fitbit. Or maybe I paid for it. I don\u0026rsquo;t really recall. The point is, I had it and I\u0026rsquo;ve been using it regularly for the past year and a half. It\u0026rsquo;s a great little gizmo, not only do I use it for step counts, but it also lets me track how much sleep I\u0026rsquo;m getting (which is why I know how rare a regular continuous 8-hour sleep is for me, even when I\u0026rsquo;m not working). I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of measuring my own data for self-improvement purposes so I like it. Conveniently, it also works with \u003ca href=\"http://ifttt.com/\"\u003eIFTTT\u003c/a\u003e, so I have an applet that exports my daily data to the a Google Sheets for easy reference. In theory I could also use the Fitbit to track stuff like my food intake and weight, but those don\u0026rsquo;t happen automatically so I don\u0026rsquo;t. Maybe someday. The fitbit itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t use too much battery and has an Android app that syncs with the device via bluetooth (so I have bluetooth on all the time now).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne minor nitpick I have is that it my wrist doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to like the fitbit too much, after a while I realized it was growing darker where I wore it. My brother suggested maybe I was wearing the wrist strap too tightly. After this realization, I sometimes started wearing it on the other wrist when I felt like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, on to the stupid story! About 4 or 5 months after i started using the fitbit, this happened:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#7df3d189d76ff9003b27de0f3f2855f3-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/review-fitbit-charge-2/fitbit1_hua16e6a31c539de7e411e63f564ba5e77_70551_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"7df3d189d76ff9003b27de0f3f2855f3-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/review-fitbit-charge-2/fitbit1.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"29 Nov 2018 2:06am\"\u003e29 Nov 2018 2:06am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOh noes! Normally you can just snap the strap part back into place, but this time something had come off and it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t stick back. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to spend money on a replacement strap, so in a brilliant move that I would surely never regret, I glued it back into place with Mighty Bond. This worked well! The strap held in place and I could now use the fitbit again without worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFast-forward another seven months or so later, and now the strap on the other side came off too! AND around the same time, my charger thingy fell apart as well, and I could not put it back together! Oh noes! Was this the end of my fitbit experiment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily it turns out a friend owned an online shop that could get me a replacement strap and charger for a good price (check out \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Activstylephl/\"\u003eFitbitManila on Facebook\u003c/a\u003e if you\u0026rsquo;re interested), and it would be delivered to my house. All I had to do was wait a few days. During that time I was unable to charge the fitbit so it died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the goods arrived, I attempted to replace the faulty half-strap only. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t remove the other side since it was glued into place! What a surprising twist, I did regret that decision from just three paragraphs ago! And to make it worse, for some reason the replacement strap was not the same width as the older strap, so I can\u0026rsquo;t use the old half with the new half! I was forced to pry apart the glued half-strap, and I did eventually manage to do it, and now my fitbit was whole again, and I think I lost a couple of days data? Actually when I charged the fitbit again it was no longer sync\u0026rsquo;ed to my phone and I had to reinstall it. The replacement strap felt a bit off, but I got used to it soon enough, and here we are half a year later and I\u0026rsquo;m still using the Fitbit, hooray! Stupidity overcome!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy with my year and a half of fitbit usage. I\u0026rsquo;m told that the devices themselves last fairly long, even if the straps don\u0026rsquo;t, so I hope to be using it for at least a couple of years more, maybe? I\u0026rsquo;ll try never to glue the straps again.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThese days the only real exercise I get comes in the form of daily walks. When I took a work hiatus in 2016, it was one of the daily habits I promised myself I would pick up. During that time, I wanted to hit the often-recommended daily target of 10,000 steps per day. (Tangent: I found out while writing this post that this number \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/03/watch-your-step-why-the-10000-daily-goal-is-built-on-bad-science\"\u003emay have no scientific basis after all\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack then, all I had to track my steps was the dinky Samsung health app that came with my Galaxy phone. It was good enough, at least at first. At some point I switched to the Google Fit app. Neither app was super accurate though. I started with a modest target, and slowly ramped up to 10,000 steps per day, which I hit sometime near the end of 2016. (Frustratingly, I can\u0026rsquo;t find my daily records of my step counts from that year. I\u0026rsquo;m sure I had them in a spread sheet of some kind somewhere\u0026hellip;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing I learned on these daily walks is that I don\u0026rsquo;t like repetition. I had been trying to get into the daily habit even before my work hiatus, but because of limited time, I only went a short distance from home and just did laps around a nearby basketball court or subdivision. This however was hard for me to keep up because I found it terribly boring. During 2016, since I had more time, what I did was I would walk as far away from home as possible until I hit half my target, then I\u0026rsquo;m also forced to walk all the way back and meet my target. And because I dislike repetition, I seldom took the same route on succeeding days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pleasant side effect of this method is that I got a better layout of the geography near our house. I\u0026rsquo;ve lived here for more than a decade, but haven\u0026rsquo;t really explored the nearby areas that much because when you\u0026rsquo;re a working joe you don\u0026rsquo;t really have that much time for exploratory walks. And I would walk pretty far too, something like 8-10 km a day. I went down roads I never travelled, visited small malls I never knew of, walked all the way to a friend\u0026rsquo;s house, sometimes even walked through some sketchy-looking neighborhoods and so on. It\u0026rsquo;s also happened more than once that a friend I don\u0026rsquo;t see too often but lives nearby will say to me \u0026ldquo;Hey, I saw someone who looks like you walking around [my neighborhood]!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround mid-2017, my brother got me a Fitbit Charge 2, so I switched to that for my step counting. By this time, I had been maintaining the 10,000 step target for a while after I hit it, but when I started working regularly again I started to slip and often found myself only hitting 2 or 3 thousand a day. I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to ramp it up again the past few months, but I find that usually 10,000 steps takes way too much time, in the neighborhood of 1.5-2 hours of walking, depending on my pace. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll still ramp up to that step count but I\u0026rsquo;ll take it a lot slower this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days, my daily target is now a more manageable 6,000 to 8,000 steps a day, and I have more regular routes I follow. It somehow feels a bit more challenging to do this regularly in 2018 as the weather now seems much hotter than it used to be (that, or I had gotten used to being in an air-conditioned office again). I find my walks now more often happen after dusk, which makes them a bit more dangerous (these are Metro Manila streets after all), despite what a certain former DFA secretary might say. I just try to avoid wandering through shady streets these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, according to the fitbit logs, I\u0026rsquo;ve clocked in around 2.8 million steps since I got the fitbit, over around 500 days, more or less 5,500 steps per day. While it\u0026rsquo;s not ideal, I think it\u0026rsquo;s a lot more than I used to get regularly, and I am able to burst to 10,000 every so often. Hopefully I can get back to 10,000 regularly soonish.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about this lately as I try to plan for what\u0026rsquo;s ahead and what I want. I think one has to be able to decide what one wants independently of what other people are doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a concrete example, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of \u0026ldquo;Oh, this other person in my field did X and now they are making so much money, should I take that path as well?\u0026rdquo; In a situation like this it\u0026rsquo;s helpful to ask yourself if \u0026ldquo;more money\u0026rdquo; is really what you want. Sure, \u0026ldquo;more money\u0026rdquo; is always good, but you need to consider what you are giving up in exchange for that money. Is X really something you want to be doing? Or would you be miserable doing it? Sometimes you decide that the tradeoff is okay, I\u0026rsquo;ll give up a little happiness in exchange for a little more money, and that\u0026rsquo;s fine if that\u0026rsquo;s what you really want. But that conclusion should come from knowing what it is you want and you need, not out of envy for what other people have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s especially difficult to avoid comparison to other people in the modern age of social media. It\u0026rsquo;s just another form of \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/choose-without-regret-and-the-fear-of-missing-out/\"\u003eFOMO\u003c/a\u003e. You have to remember that what people project on social media isn\u0026rsquo;t often the entire picture of their lives. They are more likely to hold back on the failures, troubles, problems, and other negative aspects that they have to go through. Comparing your own life to others on social media is inherently an imbalanced situation - you will have a tendency to compare your worst days against their best days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can also be challenging and tempting to compare yourself to other people when you find yourself wanting to make unconventional choices. In such a case, even society itself will sometimes challenge you with comparison. It\u0026rsquo;s important to have a firm understanding of what you want for yourself, to avoid falling into the trap of letting comparison decide to take away your joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess the saying isn\u0026rsquo;t absolute. Comparison can be a good thing, as long as it\u0026rsquo;s used in service of what you truly want.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "The aforementioned quote is attributed to Theodore Roosevelt. I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about this lately as I try to plan for what\u0026rsquo;s ahead and what I want. I think one has to be able to decide what one wants independently of what other people are doing.\nAs a concrete example, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of \u0026ldquo;Oh, this other person in my field did X and now they are making so much money, should I take that path as well?",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI said in my previous \u003ca href=\"/2017/02/review-duelyst/\"\u003eDuelyst review\u003c/a\u003e that \u003ca href=\"https://www.direwolfdigital.com/eternal/\"\u003eEternal\u003c/a\u003e didn\u0026rsquo;t really hook me. That was in Feb 2017. I stopped playing Duelyst after around six months. I started playing Eternal regularly July of that year, and have been playing regularly ever since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat changed my mind? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure, but once I got around to playing Eternal regularly, I found myself enjoying it. I think one of the main factors is that out of all \u003ca href=\"/tags/ccgs/\"\u003ethe online ccgs\u003c/a\u003e I\u0026rsquo;ve tried, Eternal is the one that\u0026rsquo;s closest to \u003ca href=\"/categories/magic-the-gathering/\"\u003eMagic the Gathering\u003c/a\u003e. That\u0026rsquo;s not really surprising, since a number of Eternal\u0026rsquo;s lead designers are MTG Pros and Hall of Famers. As such, my review will tend to compare Eternal to MTG.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEternal games play out almost exactly like MTG games. Each player plays mana sources (called Power in eternal), then uses his pool to play creatures and spells to interact with the enemy. You send in creatures to attack and deal damage to the enemy until the enemy\u0026rsquo;s life total is at 0 (Eternal starts at 25 life vs MTG\u0026rsquo;s 20.), the enemy can send his units to block your attackers, and so on. Eternal feels like a smoother, more streamlined MTG. I\u0026rsquo;m also playing MTG Arena regularly these days, so I know that by comparison Eternal\u0026rsquo;s games feel like they flow quicker and finish faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the relevant changes that I believe make it feel like a faster MTG:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003elimited fast effect windows. This is the main one. MTG Arena has to stop and ask you what you want to do every time there\u0026rsquo;s an opportunity to play fast effects, and there\u0026rsquo;s tons. In Eternal, there are only three windows: during combat, at the end of the enemy\u0026rsquo;s turn, and whenever the enemy plays a spell. And you can only play fast spells (basically MTG instants), there are no creature abilities to activate at instant speed.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe game will automatically pass priority whenever you don\u0026rsquo;t have any relevant plays. MTG Arena does this automatically as well. You can turn it off, since it has a bit of disadvantage (it conveys information to the opponent)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esimilar to HS, Eternal limits the number of creatures you can have on the board. Eternal allows twelve on each side vs Heathstone\u0026rsquo;s seven. This is more due to technical constraints than anything else. MTG Arena has to play the same on paper, so you can crash the game by generating some large number of creatures somehow.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#f653e5535156b73f5d214483a5874674-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/eternal_board_limit_hub36af13f9519955d1931871364475345_567453_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"f653e5535156b73f5d214483a5874674-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/eternal_board_limit.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"25 Nov 2018 2:00am\"\u003e25 Nov 2018 2:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEternal\u0026rsquo;s power system is similar to MTG\u0026rsquo;s mana system - you have to draw cards that provide power the same way that you have to draw lands in MTG. This means one of MTG\u0026rsquo;s inherent \u0026ldquo;problems\u0026rdquo; - mana screw - still happens in Eternal. In fact, on the forums mana screw is one of the complaints that often comes out (I suspect from former HearthStone players). Coming from MTG, I understand that building your deck to avoid mana screw is one of the skills needed in games like Magic and Eternal. Eternal eases the problem a little bit with its mulligan mechanic: Eternal gives you one free mulligan, and the 2nd hand is guaranteed to have 2-4 power. As I write this, they are also experimenting with allowing a 2nd mulligan that drops your starting hand size by one, still with the guarantee of 2-4 power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColor screw can still be a problem in Eternal, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have enough of the correct influence (Eternal\u0026rsquo;s analogue to color), you can\u0026rsquo;t play cards that require that influence. They improved on this a bit because in Eternal, power and influence aren\u0026rsquo;t tied together the way mana and color are, they are independent. The influence requirements are \u003cem\u003eminimums\u003c/em\u003e that aren\u0026rsquo;t used up like mana of a given color. That is, if you have one Fire influence, you can play any number of cards that require one Fire influence. In MTG, if you only have one source of red mana, that red mana can only be spent for one card at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFactions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of color/influence, Eternal has five factions like MTG\u0026rsquo;s color pie:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ctable\u003e\n\u003cthead\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003cth\u003eFaction\u003c/th\u003e\n\u003cth\u003eSymbol color\u003c/th\u003e\n\u003cth\u003eClosest analogous MTG color\u003c/th\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/thead\u003e\n\u003ctbody\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eFire\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eRed\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eRed\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eShadow\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003ePurple\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eBlack\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003ePrimal\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eBlue\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eBlue\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eJustice\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eGreen\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eWhite\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eTime\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eYellow\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eGreen\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can see, they don\u0026rsquo;t map cleanly. Often in my own head I still refer to the factions by their MTG analogue (and I call Justice Green and Time White), but I\u0026rsquo;ve been improving on this lately. The play styles largely map correctly though. Fire decks are often aggressive with small quick creatures and burn for reach. Primal decks have card draw and counter magic. Shadow decks have a lot of removal and life draining. Time decks have mana acceleration and big creatures. Justice decks have Wrath of God lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeywords\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs expected, many of Eternal keywords are similar or analogous to MTG keywords.

Also, Aegis will protect against Wrath-style effects whereas Hexproof does not.

There\u0026rsquo;s far too many to cover here!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRe: other mechanics, the main one to note is that Eternal takes full advantage of the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s a computer game and doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to deal with player memory issues. This means that buffs and debuffs stay on cards, even when they leave zones. Unlike Hearthstone, the graveyard/void zone exists and thus reanimator strategies are viable. There is some amount of RNG, such as \u0026ldquo;units gain a random battle skill\u0026rdquo;, but not as much as HS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nice mechanic they have is the \u0026ldquo;Market\u0026rdquo;. Basically each deck can have a set of five cards set aside as a \u0026ldquo;Market\u0026rdquo;/sideboard, and there are a set of cards (one for each faction) that allow you to fetch a card of that faction from the market. Basically similar to the way the Wishes worked in Magic. It\u0026rsquo;s a clever approach that allows for some form of \u0026ldquo;sideboarding\u0026rdquo; even for best of one matches\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSkill Level, Competitive Play and F2P\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think Eternal is inherently more skill-based than HS because of:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emanabase decisions\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emuch less RNG\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eattacking and blocking\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meta for competitive play is rather healthy, there are a number of viable decks in different archetypes that can you to Master ranking on the ladder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEternal provides several modes for Limited play as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s Forge, which is similar to Hearthstone\u0026rsquo;s Arena\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s monthly sealed leagues\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s 4-pack draft available at any time\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn terms of F2P, Eternal is the most generous among CCGs I\u0026rsquo;ve tried in terms of how much it gives players for free, as far as I can tell. Aside from the standard three daily quests, your first ranked win of each day gets you a free pack. There\u0026rsquo;s a free Gauntlet mode where you fight against AIs, and just grinding Gauntlet can get you enough gold to purchase the campaigns, which give you more cards to work with. When you start out, you quickly earn starter decks for five factions and five color pairs. These decks are decent enough for ranked play; I remember I took the Rakano and Stonescar starter decks up to Gold rank during my first month. They recently nerfed gold rewards from chests (that you earn from quests) by 10% for balance reasons, but I think the rewards are still pretty generous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hit Master rank in constructed on my third month of play (same rate as with Duelyst I believe) and have regularly hit it ever since. By comparison, I\u0026rsquo;ve never hit legend rank in HS. It really helps that Eternal games are quick and a lot more fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a while longer to hit Master rank in draft - more than one year in fact, I only hit it last week. This was the last achievement I needed for Steam completion too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#16ef1703755644be4695f85a61fdc85d-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/eternal_draft_master_hu00fcd3b62d84728fe9d738e25b00aec7_359716_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"16ef1703755644be4695f85a61fdc85d-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/eternal_draft_master.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"25 Nov 2018 2:00am\"\u003e25 Nov 2018 2:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLore and Aesthetics\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEternal\u0026rsquo;s world is described as \u0026ldquo;Six Guns and Sorcery Combined\u0026rdquo;, which means there\u0026rsquo;s Gunslingers alongside magic users and shamans and such. There\u0026rsquo;s a little bit of steampunk in there too, along with valkyries, yetis, centaurs, wisps, dinosaurs, radiants (basically magical aliens), grenadin (basically goblins), sentinels (basically giant robots), and a bunch of other stuff too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s pretty fun, and the story is continuously being updated. Each monthly league and the occasional campaign or new card set represents a change in the story. Major characters are represented by powerful cards and often have multiple versions representing their stages of growth. A prime example is Icaria, the young Valkyrie captain who later becomes a rebellious keyword-souped Akroma-like avenger after witnessing her superior\u0026rsquo;s misdeeds:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/eternalcardgame/images/6/6d/Icaria%2C_Valkyrie_Captain.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/318?cb=20180307222958\" alt=\"Icaria, Valkyrie Captain\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/eternalcardgame/images/e/eb/Icaria%2C_the_Liberator.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/318?cb=20181012184436\" alt=\"Icaria, the Liberator\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from the lore, I like the game\u0026rsquo;s overall aesthetic. Many game actions have smooth and quick animations that keep the game alive. Units with Aegis are wrapped with an animated bluish glow. Legendary units crash onto the field with force, attacking units dive towards their blockers, and so on. I think the animations and aesthetic are comparable with HS in this regard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Future\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question is now: will I keep playing Eternal now that I\u0026rsquo;ve hit my usual target of all the Steam achievements?

I think I will play it for a while, the designers seem to know what they\u0026rsquo;re doing, and a new set comes out next month too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a few other online CCGs I have accounts for that I haven\u0026rsquo;t really gotten into for some reason or another, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll try giving them another chance next year. There\u0026rsquo;s Spellweaver (very slow games and kinda boring), Shadowverse (not a fan of the aesthetic and ugh the UI is so messy/cluttered), and Gwent (uh, it\u0026rsquo;s weird). There\u0026rsquo;s Valve\u0026rsquo;s Artifact coming out too, I might try that if reviews are good. So many card games to play!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I said in my previous Duelyst review that Eternal didn\u0026rsquo;t really hook me. That was in Feb 2017. I stopped playing Duelyst after around six months. I started playing Eternal regularly July of that year, and have been playing regularly ever since.\nWhat changed my mind? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure, but once I got around to playing Eternal regularly, I found myself enjoying it. I think one of the main factors is that out of all the online ccgs I\u0026rsquo;ve tried, Eternal is the one that\u0026rsquo;s closest to Magic the Gathering.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eLooking back on 8 years of apple tablets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got my first iPad (1st generation!) \u003ca href=\"/2010/10/ipad-first-impressions-and-snap-judgments/\"\u003eback in 2010\u003c/a\u003e with 64gb storage. This version was purchased for me by a friend in Singapore. I got the 3g model back then, but I never got around to using that feature. Future purchases would be wifi only. My main usage for the iPad back then was for reading ebooks/comics and playing some games. I spent a lot of time on \u003ca href=\"http://onemanleft.com/games/tilttolive/\"\u003eTilt to Live\u003c/a\u003e on that bad boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first upgrade was a 4th generation iPad that I asked a friend to buy for me in Hong Kong in October 2012. This was a straight upgrade for performance reasons. The 1st gen iPad was already having trouble with modern apps and the latest iOS, my usage for it was pretty much the same. I think the game I played the most on the 2nd iPad was Mika Mobile\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"http://www.mikamobile.com/games/battleheart/\"\u003eBattleheart\u003c/a\u003e. Come to think of it I don\u0026rsquo;t think I ever finished that game, I wonder if my save would still be there if I reinstalled it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy current iPad Pro is my 3rd apple tablet. It\u0026rsquo;s a 1st generation iPad Pro (2015) with 128gb, which I bought around this time in 2016. At this time, my previous iPad was still doing well, but my main motivation for getting the iPad Pro was the Apple Pencil. I had started getting back into drawing as a hobby and wanted to explore digital sketching. With my previous iPad I had tried purchasing some kind of capacitive stylus, but those never worked out, as the precision was never good enough for my liking. The Apple Pencil solved those issues and has been great, it\u0026rsquo;s a fantastic product. Most of my digital drawing is done using Procreate, although I also tried a few other apps like Paper by 53 and Autodesk Sketchbook Pro. I could also be using the Apple Pencil for note taking, and I have done so on occasion, but I\u0026rsquo;m not that much of a note taker so this doesn\u0026rsquo;t come up often. When I do use it, I find the handwriting functionality fairly good as well. My note-taking app of choice is ???.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite being my newest iPad and being only two years old, this one is the least well-maintained and is experiencing some problems. It already has quite a few cracks on the display, so it looks quite worse for the wear. (See the visible cracks in the image below.) I don\u0026rsquo;t think the cracks are on the display itself, probably on the thin protective layer on top, because the cracks extend over the bezels. I suspect this is due to me banging my bag around too much. The battery life also seems much worse these days, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if that\u0026rsquo;s due to the most recent version of iOS. When my niece comes over she always drains the battery with her Youtubes and weird games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#0e69c4442bdbda5b4311c38fb14a7bc3-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/ipad-retrospective/ipad_screen_hu2b43923f691899f894bf5ea67bd89c2d_510489_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"0e69c4442bdbda5b4311c38fb14a7bc3-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/ipad-retrospective/ipad_screen.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"24 Nov 2018 2:00am\"\u003e24 Nov 2018 2:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the most mysterious problem is an incessant beeping. It\u0026rsquo;s been happening for a while, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to figure out yet. Basically, at times the iPad will beep continuously, as if it was being repeatedly plugged and unplugged into the charger. It happens most often when I\u0026rsquo;m lying in bed holding the iPad above me at an angle or at my side. I can\u0026rsquo;t identify whether it happens due to position or something else. Also, it\u0026rsquo;s rare for it to happen when I\u0026rsquo;m using the iPad in some other place or position. And it \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e happens when I\u0026rsquo;m not using the iPad. I\u0026rsquo;m starting to suspect that it has to do with some sort of static charge caused by my hands and the bed somehow, but that seems ridiculous. That, or my iPad has developed sentience and is trying to communicate with me through beeps. (That theory gives a fun image whenever I put the iPad down and the beeping starts to taper off.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of charger problems, another issue I have with Apple tablets in general is hardware-related but not with the tablet itself - the problem is their lightning cables, which tend to rapidly fall apart over time. I\u0026rsquo;m talking the official Apple lightning cables here. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried some unoffical ones as well, but those seem highly inconsistent as to whether they\u0026rsquo;ll even work, so I tend to prefer the official ones. I just wish they lasted longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#ac261482d13679ea21e09bf3aa55d03d-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2013/09/382888558639333376/1_382888558639333376_BVBLHXECMAAAfE0_hu3edde0d04816e45cb5653fead35df854_34977_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"I have no idea why this keeps happening to my ipad cables.

When I first got the iPad, I did indulge myself in purchasing a few apps, mostly games like the aforementioned Tilt to Live and Battleheart. Gaming on the iPad is okay, but as can be expected it\u0026rsquo;s a big battery drain. I often got iPad versions of \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; games like Street Fighter, Injustice, and so on. But I stopped buying apps in 2013. I don\u0026rsquo;t know my rationale at the time, but I do know today that buying apps on the iPad is extremely problematic for one reason: rapid changes in iOS. The programming APIs change rapidly, and apps will often need to be updated to work with more recent versions of iOS, and many app developers won\u0026rsquo;t bother keeping up. That means many apps will tend to be short-lived - I checked my purchase history and roughly more than half of my previously purchased apps could not even be downloaded anymore. (Not sure if this would be alleviated by using older iOS versions). Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m spoiled by backward compatibility on Windows, where I can basically still run software from two decades ago. These days, my iPad gaming is mostly just Words with Friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from drawing and gaming, my other main usage is for reading. I use both iBooks and the Kindle app and also Comic Flow for comics. At any given time, my tablet is loaded with hundreds of books and comics, so it\u0026rsquo;s hard to run out of things to read even if there\u0026rsquo;s no internet. I still enjoy reading physical books, but having a fairly large library easily accessible is great too. This is the main reason I often get high-storage versions even though they\u0026rsquo;re a lot more expensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, I\u0026rsquo;m happy with my iPad purchases so far, I\u0026rsquo;ve used them constantly, and even the older models are still in use by other family members. I will admit I am tempted by the recently announced new iPad Pro iteration, especially given the problems my current iPad already has. It\u0026rsquo;s attractive for me mainly due to the Pencil now being able to be docked on the iPad itself and the reports that it performs about as well as a Macbook. These tablets are quite expensive though, and I\u0026rsquo;ve already made one big tech purchase this year (more on that in a future post I guess), so I\u0026rsquo;m skipping on the new iPad Pro for now.

I got the 3g model back then, but I never got around to using that feature. Future purchases would be wifi only. My main usage for the iPad back then was for reading ebooks/comics and playing some games. I spent a lot of time on Tilt to Live on that bad boy.",
