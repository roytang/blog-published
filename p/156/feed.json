I actually started this a few years back, thought I\u0026rsquo;d actually get around to finish it. The book is an analysis of history, of what geographical advantages certain civilizations had that allowed them to triumph over others. He presents a lot of interesting topics covering linguistics, animal/plant domestication and food production that may explain these differences. Given my poor geography knowledge, I would have appreciated more maps in the book. There are some topics here I enjoyed more than others, such as how Pizarro conquered the Incans. But a lot of the topics are presented a bit dryly, in an academic fashion. Making academic topics interesting is tough, I found myself having difficulty reading some of the later chapters. The book overall is very informative though, I learned a lot about the sort of things historians analyze to understand the particulars of human civilization.\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/18436248-roy-tang\"\u003eView all my reviews\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Say what you will about the debate\u0026rsquo;s format and lack of challenging questions, but the fact that we are having any sort of discussion at all that manages to capture the public\u0026rsquo;s attention is already an improvement.

For some people, programming is just a job: they come in, they do what they\u0026rsquo;re told to do, and go home. They don\u0026rsquo;t want to think about process involvement or anything like that. And that\u0026rsquo;s fine, if that\u0026rsquo;s the life they want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis applies to companies too: there will be companies that just want to get their projects done and out the door, and don\u0026rsquo;t want to think about process improvements, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy suggestion to you, if you are interested in that kind of thing, is to start looking around for companies more to your liking. It\u0026rsquo;s not really about talented/experienced programmers and more of about the company culture - although that will be driven largely by the senior programmers in the company. I would also prioritize working in companies that are primarily programming shops, instead of say, a programming department in a bank or some other type of business. Programming shops will be more focused on the dev process as one of their priorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr if you like your job and don\u0026rsquo;t want to leave, you can also try to persist. Don\u0026rsquo;t be obnoxious, but every so often when some problem is encountered you can say \u0026ldquo;we could have avoided this if we have done X\u0026rdquo; or something like that. Get to know the senior software developers on your team and try to discuss programming practices with them. If you stick around, eventually you will become the senior software developer and will have more influence on the culture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood luck!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
