This is why I like the idea of the GBA, even though I\u0026rsquo;ve never actually owned a gameboy. I see all these nice GBA titles around and I figure even if Nintendo releases a new GB-style handheld, it\u0026rsquo;ll be backward compatible and I can play those suckers!

I knew we had pirated copies of both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpiderman 2 \u0026ndash; failed. The PS2 wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even play the disc. Instead it made a wonderful churning noise that made me quickly hit the eject button. This is Sony\u0026rsquo;s best form of copy protection: In my experience, our PS2 can only play somewhere between 30% \u0026ndash; 50% of all pirated discs out there. I don\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026hellip; it may just be our PS2 model. Sometimes if I particularly like a game, I will buy 2-3 pirated copies until I find one that agrees with our PS2. This is why I have 3 copies of \u003ca href=\"/2005/01/games-star-ocean-till-the-end-of-time/\"\u003eStar Ocean: Til The End Of Time\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaruto 2 \u0026ndash; failed. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the disc. I tried searching through all the PS2 DVD cases we have, but I was unsuccessful. In the average pinoy techie\u0026rsquo;s house, there would be hundreds of audio CDs, VCDs, data CDs and DVDs, many of them pirated. Finding one specific disc outside of its case is a nigh-impossible task. Going out and buying a new (pirated) copy would be far easier \n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnotebase-1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf piracy is so problematic, why use pirated discs? Because frankly, the alternatives are roughly 10 times more expensive. At least. This is especially true for PS2 games; last I checked PS2 games retail for around 4000 pesos around here (more than 80 dollars) By comparison, PC games retail for roughly the correct dollar-equivalent prices. \n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnotebase-2\"\u003e[2]\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt should be noted that I have NEVER bought original PS2 games \n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnotebase-3\"\u003e[3]\u003c/a\u003e\n, while I have bought several original PC games. Not only that, but if things continue as-is, I will NEVER buy original PS2 or PS1 games, even though there are some games I would like to own originals of \n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnotebase-4\"\u003e[4]\u003c/a\u003e\n. The astute Pinoy gamer would note that the price of even PS1 titles is still roughly around 3000-4000 pesos, which makes no sense at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder what compels store owners to sell PS2 originals at these prices? Are there so many piracy-conscious console owners that they are able to fuel such a high demand for PS2 originals that result in high prices? Who buys at these stores?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t know why games (and digital media in general) have to be the same cost or more expensive in a third world country where people obviously have less money than developed nations. Of course, I am not saying we are entitled to lower prices because we are poor. But don\u0026rsquo;t companies who sell these consider that selling to citizens of developing nations at lower prices would be better than the zero sales caused by high prices/piracy combination?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the future, I may be more compelled to buy console originals online, especially if I can find good deals on used copies. Well, at least as soon as I become more confident about buying things online.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

(My younger brother seems to have no idea what \u003cem\u003eSpin-a-win\u003c/em\u003e is/was, although he is aware of SOS, Flames, etc.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe earlier parts of the book are mostly funny and/or amusing, detailing those silly little things that school kids tend to obsess with. The latter parts start to get serious once the author gets to his college years; he goes into serious stories of dropping out of college, taking a vocational course and eventually becoming a teacher, where the book comes full circle (and a bit preachy as well).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book is hard to classify; it\u0026rsquo;s not exactly comedy, it\u0026rsquo;s not exactly serious. It\u0026rsquo;s more like the author kept a running blog since he was in grade school and published it all. Also, there doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be much information \u003ca href=\"http://www.visprint.net/publications/bob/faq.htm\"\u003eabout the author \u003c/a\u003ehimself; apparently \u0026ldquo;Bob Ong\u0026rdquo; is a pseudonym of some sort. A very satisfying read all in all, I know this because I felt compelled to buy his next two books because of it. His books are cheaper than the usual book prices anyway =)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThis game is the third and last installment of Tri-Ace\u0026rsquo;s venerable space opera science fiction RPG, spanning across three consoles \n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnotebase-1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e\n, and it\u0026rsquo;s a good finish.

But I\u0026rsquo;ve still been actively playing it, going through the bonus dungeons \n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnotebase-3\"\u003e[3]\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact that I finished it, and the fact that I am still playing it, and the fact that I am still planning to finish it on both of the higher difficulty levels, all of these facts speak volumes about how good this game is, given that I don\u0026rsquo;t have nearly as much time to play as I did before I was working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story/plot is so-so, not too strong, but some of the characters \n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnotebase-4\"\u003e[4]\u003c/a\u003e\n are cool. Space-faring lad gets stranded on backwards-planet, gets involved and suddenly gets thrust into a conflict against the Creator that threatens the existance of the very universe. The usual sort of thing. There\u0026rsquo;s a giant plot twist somewhere in the second disc that changes the very nature of the Star Ocean universe and guarantees that this is, in fact, the last game of the series. Actually, in retrospect, the plot is fairly okay, but it could\u0026rsquo;ve been pulled off better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gameplay is where it\u0026rsquo;s at of course. As well know, RPGs are about gameplay, not story. \n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-5\" id=\"footnotebase-5\"\u003e[5]\u003c/a\u003e\n Gameplay-wise, the single best feature of this game is: Battle Trophies! Battle Trophies are awards granted to you for certain things done in combat, such as avoiding certain spells, winning with no damage, winning by tiny slivers of life, etc. Many boss battles have associated battle trophies such as \u0026ldquo;Defeat so-and-so in 1 minute\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Defeat so-and-so without taking damage.\u0026rdquo; Accumulating battle trophies means unlocking higher difficulty levels, extra costumes and extra modes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other good things carry over from Star Ocean 2. The real-time battle system is the same, with a bunch of improvements. The Fury gauge stops battles from being a button-bashing-fest, and the anti-attack auras add some tactical element to the battles. Damage bonuses for chaining together special moves are neat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eItem Creation is still here, but the system is vastly different from SO2. Instead of just crafting items yourself anywhere you are, you can hire inventors to work for you in workshops throughout the world. You can work with them of course, in an assembly line fashion that shows your characters going through various experiments to make stuff. However, I greatly miss that feature of Star Ocean 2\u0026rsquo;s Item Creation where you are shown a blob of some sort of raw creation material that slowly but surely transforms into a wonderful item. Losing that feature sort of removed the joy of item creation. =p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are however, some bad things about this game. Mostly minor nitpicks actually. The most important one is this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe menu interface for the battle arena sucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeriously, everytime I go to fight the ranking battles, I have to go through three or four menus. One to ask whether I need to be given a tutorial. One to choose what type of battle I want to fight. Before I beat the champions, I get asked whether I want to fight them. One where I choose the opponent for my battle. The one with the tutorial really ticks me off every time I see it. I\u0026rsquo;ve already read the tutorial! Must you ask me every single time? Would you like fries with that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally, the \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d like an explanation\u0026rdquo; thing could just be placed in the second menu. I should only have to decide two things: One, I want to fight a ranking battle; and two, I want to choose my opponent. Single battles or team battles are slightly worse, as you must choose your fighter and your difficulty level in addition to the above choices. I wonder how hard it would have been to make a simple menu system for the arena, instead of relying on the conversation system?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realize this is a really petty thing to note, but when you start playing the battle arena, you have to go through those menus repeatedly every two or three minutes. It got annoying fast. And don\u0026rsquo;t get me started on those bunny races\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other bad thing is: bad endings. Well, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting much given that the story wasn\u0026rsquo;t that good anyway, but eh? The general ending wasn\u0026rsquo;t much more than \u0026ldquo;Hey, we\u0026rsquo;re still alive! Cool!\u0026rdquo;, and the individual endings were a bit sleepy. Or maybe it was just the lackluster music playing during the endings?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall though, a decidedly good game, one I\u0026rsquo;m going to try to finish at least two more times, and a worthy end to the Star Ocean series. Looking forward to Tri-Ace\u0026rsquo;s next series\u0026hellip;  \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

That\u0026rsquo;s when I started the site on \u003ca href=\"http://topcities.com\"\u003etopcities \u003c/a\u003esome time back. I moved some of the \u0026ldquo;journal\u0026rdquo; posts I had from there into blogger, using a very detailed process I shall refer to as \u0026ldquo;manual copy-and-paste and editing of links\u0026rdquo;. I still had some backup copies of most of the old site around, and \u003ca href=\"http://www.archive.org\"\u003earchive.org \u003c/a\u003ewas a big help. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t much editing actually, I just went through most of the links and marked those which were broken. I didn\u0026rsquo;t transfer (yet) any posts which needed additional files to exist on my own server, those are a bit more troublesome, so later. All in all, the content of the posts are presented as they are, or were, typos and all, making these archives a genuine representation of my frame of mind circa 2002.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe purpose of this exercise is of course for posterity. Putting all these posts in one place makes it easy for me to export them in some method in the future. (And even if blogger goes down for some reason, these posts are now also hosted on my fateback account, and you know there\u0026rsquo;s safety in redundancy.) So, past memories safely preserved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, that\u0026rsquo;s what a journal should be about right? Something that lets you look back into the past, to see what B*S you were trying to put out back then. Online journals are roughly ten thousand times more exciting than private ones; if you\u0026rsquo;re honest enough (i.e., you don\u0026rsquo;t edit out any embarassing stuff from old posts), there\u0026rsquo;s always the tendency for something from the past to come back and bite you in the ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an example, in the last post I made a comment about how I may have pissed my dentist off. It\u0026rsquo;s a funny story actually. I wanted to post, but was in too much tooth-pain to think clearly; so after the tooth-pain cleared, I decided to \u003ca href=\"/2004/12/i-get-bored-easily/\"\u003epost about it\u003c/a\u003e. (Note to future self: even if you move to a different server, keep the fateback account, so these permalinks would still actually work.) About a week after that, I sent an email to my dentist, (wow, I exchange email with my dentist, I\u0026rsquo;m like, so cutting edge, for 1999) and she read the blog entry. She mailed me back saying the post \u0026ldquo;knocked her off her chair\u0026rdquo;, or something. I emailed back, saying it was just an exaggeration, hoping I didn\u0026rsquo;t piss her off. She hasn\u0026rsquo;t responded yet though (and I haven\u0026rsquo;t needed any dentist-time lately), so I conclude that there\u0026rsquo;s a distinct possibility I may actually have pissed her off. I\u0026rsquo;ll found out when I need to get this impacted molar removed, I suppose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, anyway, yeah. Coming back to bite you in the ass. And for this reason, I\u0026rsquo;m hesitant to let anyone at work know about this blog. (At least one person at work knows it exists, but does not know the location) My long-term memory is a bit stupid, I may have inadvertently said something here that may be bad for me professionally, I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure. And of course I have no idea how a certain someone would react to me publishing on the internet my feelings about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat am I saying? Am I going to be more circumspect in the future, and avoid anything that may get me in trouble? Hell, no. Although I did breifly consider taking down the \u003ca href=\"/2004/10/unrequited/\"\u003eUnrequited\u003c/a\u003e post, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I should stand for what I\u0026rsquo;ve written. No matter how bad, sappy, or stupid it was, it\u0026rsquo;s my work, I should just take it for what it is. Hence bringing back the old posts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHmm\u0026hellip; I really only wanted to post that I was bringing back the old posts. I talk a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

What does 2005 hold for our brave not-so-young hero?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried thinking up some New Year\u0026rsquo;s resolutions, but, as many intelligent folk know, resolutions suck. Sure, they probably have some motivational value, but if you really know what you want, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t need the end of an arbitrarily-decided calendar year to start. So, in lieu of resolutions, I present the following list of things-I-might-have-resolved-to-do:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBlog every day. This was a good idea, but I figured forcing yourself to do something regularly _just for the sake of it _was not a good thing. I\u0026rsquo;ll blog when I have something to say, thanks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLearn to cook/bowl well. This sounds neat. But the real problem with me trying to learn new skills outside my comfort zone is that they tend to eat up goof-off time. But I _want _to learn new things. So, for this one, I\u0026rsquo;ll do \u0026lsquo;em if I can and I feel like it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLearn PHP/mySQL and use dynamic stuff for this website. This is an easier proposition, since it\u0026rsquo;s something that falls well within one of my areas of interest (coding). However, I already code a lot at work, so I\u0026rsquo;m not really that motivated to code outside of work. I think I may be able to do this to some degree or other though.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBroaden my horizons. Do new things. Visit new places. This is a good idea. And I hope I can do it some. But I won\u0026rsquo;t resolve to do it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s it I guess, let\u0026rsquo;s see what 2005 has in store for us. Bring it!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that every other developer in one of my projects is going to be on vacation next week.

Sometime before dinner I wrote a love letter and sent it by email to her. Nothing much, just telling her some things I wanted her to know, and greeting her for the holidays and stuff. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting anything back, but I guess I got lucky. A few minutes before I left the office, I got a jabber message from her.

My first thought was to use tables-within-a-table in the HTML source, but it seems that Excel loses the column widths (i.e., the column widths change from what I\u0026rsquo;ve set them to before) when I try to create a new table inside one of the existing s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to preserve the widths of the columns outside the inner table. Any idea how this can be done? Or maybe someone can point me to online resources that might help?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, this has been sort of a low-pri task for me, so I haven\u0026rsquo;t had much time to check it out; but the deadline is creeping up on me fast. I\u0026rsquo;ve posted on some forums and asked around, but no positive responses so far. Any assistance is appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I\u0026rsquo;m not here to talk about whether the loggers are indeed to blame, or how it\u0026rsquo;s silly for the government to try to implement a total log ban when they can\u0026rsquo;t even implement a selective log ban, or how chances are everyone important will forget about this in, say a month tops, while the victims continue their struggle to recover even a fraction of their once-normal lives. No, these topics have already been covered to death in serious newspaper editorials and columns. And possible internet discussions in Pinoy-bloggerland, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, I\u0026rsquo;m not particularly familiar with that scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, as always, I prefer to attack this from a more personal angle. And like some of my more interesting stories, this one is about a taxi driver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a bit old, and his first few attempts at conversation were annoying at best. Later, toward the end of the trip, we glimpsed one of the day\u0026rsquo;s headlines on some tabloid. Something about the government wanting to implement a total log ban. He goes on to say that\u0026rsquo;s an impossible thing, they\u0026rsquo;d never be able to implement it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurns out he worked for the Department of Environment and Natural Resources for some fifteen-odd years. As a forest ranger. Wow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow of course, as someone who indulges often in the fantasy genre, my idea of ‘Forest Rangers\u0026rsquo; is closely associated either Aragorn from Lord of the Rings, or someone who likes to stop bears from stealing picnic baskets. This guy leaned more towards the latter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on his stories, it seems like the news articles detailing the lack of manpower at the DENR are accurate. He says forest rangers were often assigned to guard or patrol some forty hectares of land. Or maybe it was four hectares, I forget — I had this conversation more than three days ago. In any case, I have no idea how large a hectare is anyway. But from his narratives it seemed like the area assigned to them was far too much for one man to cover. Add to that the fact that he and his co-rangers were often harassed by Communist rebels that are supposedly in bed with the illegal loggers, and life was really difficult for them back then. It was a much easier life to just while away your day slacking or goofing off, rather than risk your own life to try to catch some illegal loggers who would probably get off the hook easily anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe told about treestampers. Or something like that. Basically, people whose job it is to mark trees to indicate which ones are okay for cutting by which company. Or something. Forgive me; I\u0026rsquo;m really hazy on the details, maybe because I\u0026rsquo;m sleepy. Anyway, apparently a lot of these treestampers have lifestyles far beyond their income. When the bribe money comes in, it\u0026rsquo;s a race to mark trees, with no regard for the tree\u0026rsquo;s age or species or location or whatnot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what I have to say about this, I just thought the hearsay I got from him would be interesting to relate. I\u0026rsquo;m not exactly a radical environmentalist. As a friend of mine once said, \u0026ldquo;Trees? What have they ever done for me?\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m a city dude, born and bred, so I seldom worry about such things, it\u0026rsquo;s not really part of my thinking. And I don\u0026rsquo;t really think I can judge people who live on a small government subsidy and have to do what they can to get a decent living. Hey, we\u0026rsquo;re all just out to make some scratch, right? Except that the living some of these guys make may have cost countless lives and destruction of property. Sadly, I think this is just part of the general malaise that plagues our society. Resources are scarce, so the less fortunate among us are forged to scrounge around for whatever we can, the law and the environment be damned. Of course, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that the rest of the country only gives a damn shortly after a tragedy happens. Will we ever learn?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "summary": "Mike: I thought you were broke?\nMe: That\u0026rsquo;s just a lie I tell people who ask me for money.\n I forgot to talk about this. We played Champions of Kamigawa Team Sealed a couple of weekends back. For the uninitiated, ChK is a Magic:the Gathering set, and Team Sealed is our favorite limited format! I think it\u0026rsquo;s mostly because if we lose, I can blame my teammates for screwing up, unlike in regular tournaments where it really is my fault.",
