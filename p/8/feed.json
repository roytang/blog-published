So I haven\u0026rsquo;t been wandering the internets that much.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDaily sketches still ongoing in \u003ca href=\"/albums/sketchbook/\"\u003ethe sketchbook album\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatching:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGurren Lagann\u003c/strong\u003e was added to Netflix! I watched the first few episodes, the series is as insane as I remember. It has English dubs, so I can watch it in the background (since I\u0026rsquo;ve already seen it before), but I have a bunch of other stuff to watch, so we\u0026rsquo;ll see.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWandaVision\u003c/strong\u003e episode 5 was fantastic. It also may or may not be a BIG DEAL (tm). We\u0026rsquo;ll see. I was a bit annoyed that this was a weekly show, but the reality is that their cliffhangers wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been as effective (or generated as much discussion/hype) if all the episodes came in one drop, so I guess it\u0026rsquo;s okay.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOn a whim, I decided to watch the \u003cstrong\u003eRoyal Rumble\u003c/strong\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s so weird since their events have virtual audiences (with the wall of faces). Also like 1/3 to 1/2 of the actual Rumble participants have been around since forever, and in fact the current winner Edge won the Rumble for the first time 11 years ago to the day (which, together with him starting at #1, was a pretty strong hint he\u0026rsquo;d be winning). Not sure if I\u0026rsquo;d watch Wrestlemania in two months, since I don\u0026rsquo;t really follow anymore and I\u0026rsquo;m not really invested in the storylines or anything, but they really do a pretty good job of recapping storylines, feuds, etc in the events themselves.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGaming:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNew Humble Choice is out and includes \u003cstrong\u003eValkyria Chronicles 4\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eEndless Space 2\u003c/strong\u003e, which seem like good picks for me, so I\u0026rsquo;m probably getting it. I \u003ca href=\"/2009/01/valkyria-chronicles/\"\u003eplayed the first Valkyria Chronicles more than a decade ago\u003c/a\u003e and I was surprised to know there\u0026rsquo;d already been 3 sequels, so looking forward to this one.

Anyway, I played almost 5 hours of this in one session, which was really bad for my eyestrain.
