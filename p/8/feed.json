As discussed in \u003ca href=\"/2019/11/one-year-with-hugo/\"\u003ethis post one year ago\u003c/a\u003e, I was very happy with the general workflow of managing posts through markdown files in git, but had big problems with the Hugo build time, largely a consequence of \u003ca href=\"/2019/10/archive-of-my-own/\"\u003emy social media archiving\u003c/a\u003e. At that time, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to invest effort into migrating to a different backend, but the problem has only gotten incrementally worse since then, so I decided to take the jump and started working on it last month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"migration-goals\"\u003eMigration goals\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main goal is to get rid of the unnecessary build time. I also don\u0026rsquo;t want to have to store all the pre-generated HTML files. It\u0026rsquo;s fine for a small site, but with the large number of posts here, there\u0026rsquo;s a large amount of unnecessary duplication, considering listing pages and such. That means reverting to a system where each page is generated on the fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to retain the current workflow of managing content via markdown files, so that rules out something like Wordpress. Still, I figured I needed some kind of database for indexing, so that things like listing and archive pages work properly. Given that we would be migrating away from a static site, I fully expect a performance hit, at least initially, but ideally it\u0026rsquo;s not too bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;d also like to retain the current content written for Hugo as much as possible. This means the new system will need to be able to parse the custom Hugo shortcodes I\u0026rsquo;d set up for the site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would also be migrating to a new server which I would be managing myself, which means I would need to set up the deployment myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"why-django\"\u003eWhy Django\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI naturally fell back on Django, it\u0026rsquo;s my ORM+backend framework of choice, and the one I\u0026rsquo;m most familiar with. Also, I already had a handful of small Django apps that I needed to migrate to the new server as well, so no matter what I needed to have a Django app on the server anyway. I also had a bunch of Python scripts that were doing already doing support functions for the site like search and ingestion of social media content, so that\u0026rsquo;s something to fold into the new backend as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"why-bother\"\u003eWhy Bother?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will fully admit I spent far too much effort unnecessarily doing this, but the realization is that it\u0026rsquo;s actually work I enjoy. This site is primarily a project for myself, and I enjoy the time working on it and learning stuff and improving things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, the effort wasn\u0026rsquo;t too much. There was a lot of code to reuse and migrate, so most of the effort was testing and making sure things worked. Most of the new code was for parsing the markdown files to render the hugo shortcodes as HTML; I basically wrote Django templates for each Hugo shortcode to be supported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"changes\"\u003eChanges\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe migration was largely done in-place: site design remains mostly the same, post URLs should be more or less retained. I did take the opportunity to make one nontrivial change: Photos are now under \u003ca href=\"/notes\"\u003eNotes\u003c/a\u003e category. I really only had a separate photos category before because in Hugo I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a way to query posts that have attached images. Even with everything under Notes, since I have a database now, I can do silly things like show \u003ca href=\"/photos/random\"\u003erandom photos\u003c/a\u003e. Also, now the notes section is closer to a microblog/tumblr-like feed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe source for the site content will still be \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/roytang/blog\"\u003eavailable publicly via Github\u003c/a\u003e, as it was before. Unfortunately, I am not ready to make public the source for this site, because (a) a lot of it is old code that I reused so it looks terrible; and (b) some level of security by obscurity I guess?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that the site needs to be secure; there isn\u0026rsquo;t actually any critical/important data being stored anywhere. But the fact that a database now exists means I need to follow some kind of security practices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe server is now hosted on DigitalOcean. Here\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://m.do.co/c/6c2e6b11b260\"\u003emy affiliate link\u003c/a\u003e. Since I\u0026rsquo;m on a self-managed VPS now, that means Github webhooks now work, so whenever I push new posts, they take less than a minute to now appear on the site. This is a vast improvement over the old system where it would take anywhere between 30-60 minutes depending on how Travis was feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of Travis, I set up a new mirror, Travis now publishes to \u003ca href=\"https://mirror.roytang.net\"\u003ehttps://mirror.roytang.net\u003c/a\u003e once a day, hosted on Netlify. The mirror is still generated using Hugo! I don\u0026rsquo;t know how long I can keep up having the content generate correctly for both builds, but we\u0026rsquo;ll see how it goes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"summary\"\u003eSummary\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this actually went out much smoother than I thought it would. Took less effort than expected, deployment was a breeze. The listing pages have slightly worse performance, but individual pages are hitting 100 on Pagespeed, so that\u0026rsquo;s mostly fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis post was just the overview of the site changes. There\u0026rsquo;s still a bunch of technical notes to be written up, so that\u0026rsquo;s stuff for a future blog post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last time I used a Django backend for my website was \u003ca href=\"/2008/12/roytang-net-site-update/\"\u003ewaaaay back in 2008\u003c/a\u003e, and that didn\u0026rsquo;t last more than a year before I switched to Wordpress. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how long this one holds out!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Leaving Hugo It\u0026rsquo;s been a bit under two years since I migrated the site from Wordpress to Hugo. As discussed in this post one year ago, I was very happy with the general workflow of managing posts through markdown files in git, but had big problems with the Hugo build time, largely a consequence of my social media archiving. At that time, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to invest effort into migrating to a different backend, but the problem has only gotten incrementally worse since then, so I decided to take the jump and started working on it last month.",

Luckily, most of the migration work to the new backend was already done, so I went ahead and switched over the servers. So this site is no longer plain-old deployed HTML, but rather powered by a Django backend. The site should be mostly the same, though I did take the opportunity to move some stuff around. There\u0026rsquo;s probably some bugs floating around, and maybe some secrets even. Probably need a longer blog post writing about the migration itself, though it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too complicated. I also have a bunch of notes about the server setup that I\u0026rsquo;ll also carve into a blog post when I have time. Things should be mostly done for this site, but I have one other domain I have to migrate, and I have scheduled that for the end of the month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat means that hopefully all my apps/domains will be on the new server after the first week of November. My account at the old webhost is paid until Nov 15th, and I\u0026rsquo;ve already indicated I don\u0026rsquo;t plan to migrate to whatever new system they have, so it\u0026rsquo;s just in time I think. Hoping things go smoothly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaming: I did \u003ca href=\"/2020/10/1318238520251621377/\"\u003ethe 120 stars \u0026ldquo;completion\u0026rdquo; for Super Mario Galaxy\u003c/a\u003e, although that\u0026rsquo;s really more like half of actual completion. I put down the Switch for a few days after that to cool down on it for a bit, as I have been playing it a lot since I got it. Still deciding whether to play Odyssey next or try Link\u0026rsquo;s Awakening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaming: I haven\u0026rsquo;t played \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/review-eternal/\"\u003eEternal Card Game\u003c/a\u003e in months, which meant falling behind on the collection as new sets came out and such. But they\u0026rsquo;re running an event right now where all accounts have access to all cards, and there are qualifiers for their worlds event. I figured why not and gave it a shot, running a deck I got from their recent tournaments, and \u003ca href=\"/2020/10/1319794495395745793/\"\u003emanaged to qualify for the LCQ on my first try\u003c/a\u003e. Eternal has always been a fun game, but the past few months I\u0026rsquo;ve preferred playing on MTG Arena. The timing of this Eternal event was pretty nice, as it came up just after Arena got a patch that severely downgraded the UX, with bugs being reported everywhere and general laggy performance. The Eternal client was, as always, snappy and had no issues. Arena dev team needs to get their act together!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill ongoing: \u003ca href=\"/tags/inktober2020\"\u003ethe Inktober thing\u003c/a\u003e. Still haven\u0026rsquo;t missed a day! This week is the final stretch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot ongoing: Hacktoberfest. I mentioned before that I was planning to do it, but\u0026hellip; I haven\u0026rsquo;t. Less than a week to go, so doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem likely I can get into it, especially since other things have come up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo my current webhost finally decided to give me a deadline, the long and short of it is that my new server needs to be ready by December the 9th, giving me a bit under a month to get things in order. I\u0026rsquo;m already in the middle of setting up the new server, so I think I\u0026rsquo;ll be ready by early November anyway. Most of the code to run the new blog is also mostly ready (who knows how many bugs there are though!) I am (re-)learning a lot about server setups though, so hopefully I\u0026rsquo;ll have quite a few blog posts to write the migration is done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching lately: Mostly old NCIS seasons still, and I\u0026rsquo;m just past the halfway point on The Expanse season 4. Slow going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am looking forward to November, and am awaiting the outcome of the US presidential elections with morbid interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Server migration update: I had encountered some trouble with the Travis-CI -based Hugo build generating this here website last week. Luckily, most of the migration work to the new backend was already done, so I went ahead and switched over the servers. So this site is no longer plain-old deployed HTML, but rather powered by a Django backend. The site should be mostly the same, though I did take the opportunity to move some stuff around.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eSo I \u003ca href=\"/2020/09/nintendo-switch/\"\u003egot a Nintendo Switch last month\u003c/a\u003e. One of the first games I had gotten for the system was the recently released Super Mario 3d All-Stars. I had really been wanting to play Super Mario Odyssey instead, but my brother had a copy of that game that I could borrow later, so I decided to get 3dAS first, as I had never really played the 3 games on the collection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve mostly played the 2d Mario games prior to this, with the exception of 3d Land (3DS) and 3d World (WiiU), although both of those games were closer in style to the the 2d mario games than to the games in this collection. The three games here share the same style of having a hub-like world from which you visit other worlds to accomplish missions to get stars/shines. The other worlds have multiple \u0026ldquo;episodes\u0026rdquo; so you have to replay each of them a bunch of times (doing different things each time) to get all the stars/shines available in those worlds. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of a clever world to save on level design resources - each world is essentially multiple stages sharing the same maps and objects and so on. It can also mean the player might get tired of repeating the same worlds over and over, but the hub system means they can visit other worlds for a while if that happens. As you gather stars/shines, you unlock more areas of the hub world and thus more worlds/stages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuper Mario 64\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0026rsquo;t optimistic about SM64 going in. I played a little bit of it on the DS when it was released there, didn\u0026rsquo;t really enjoy it. Released in 1996, I know it\u0026rsquo;s regarded as a classic and revolutionized 3d platforming in its day, but for me it hasn\u0026rsquo;t really aged very well. My problems with the title are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePoor camera handling. You don\u0026rsquo;t have smooth right-stick control of the camera (since the N64 did not have a right analog stick), and the camera angles are often limited in how you can rotate them around. There\u0026rsquo;s a button to toggle the camera from Lakitu perspective to Mario perspective, which is annoying for me since I don\u0026rsquo;t find the over-the-shoulder Mario perspective useful, and I accidentally keep hitting the toggle button. There is a setting to disable the Mario perspective altogether (such that the toggle button now fixes the camera to a given position instead), but the setting resets every time you load your game.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEven when the camera is in Lakitu mode, it will often turn or rotate far too quickly for my taste, and for me this means if I play the game for around an hour or so I start getting dizzy, and this is the main dealbreaker for me.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI find it quite difficult to control Mario in this game as well. His normal movement is to run, not to walk, so a simple flick of the left analog stick moves him farther than I\u0026rsquo;d like, and the same goes for his jumps. I think it\u0026rsquo;s because this was their first 3d game, so they hadn\u0026rsquo;t really calibrated yet what would be a good walk/run speed and jump distance. Adding to that, some actions like turning Mario in a new direction combined with jumping can cause him to jump in a different direction/distance, it\u0026rsquo;s something to get used to. You don\u0026rsquo;t have much jump control once you are in mid-air either. So for difficult platforming segments, I often found it challenging to position Mario for precise jumps.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMany of the worlds/stages are also quite frustrating. You will be dying quite often. This is unsurprising for a Mario game, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that many of the sequences are a bit long so it can be annoying to re-do them. Combined with the finnicky controls and the often weird camera angles, it can cause unnecessary frustration. Even worse, when you die, you are not just kicked back to the start of the stage, but most of the time you are kicked out of the stage altogether and back to the hub world. A minor inconvenience, but it still means additional friction in the try-fail-retry cycle.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSpeaking of try-fail-retry, a lot of the missions really require you to spend multiple lives dying and trying again. This isn\u0026rsquo;t unexpected, but a lot of them can be extremely challenging. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking in particular of that one mission where you have to race a penguin down a twisty icy slope, where veering off the slope means death. Trying to get to the end of the icy slope is bad enough - it\u0026rsquo;s going to take you a lot of trial and error to do so - but then you have to make sure you get there ahead of the penguin too. I feel like a lot of the more challenging missions carry over some of the \u0026ldquo;Nintendo hard\u0026rdquo; mentality from the NES/SNES generation.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven\u0026rsquo;t managed to even finish SM64 yet, so I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are a lot more challenging stages ahead. As of this writing, my progress stands at a pitiful 17 stars obtained (out of a possible 120). The dizziness due to the camera is the main problem for me. I may try to come back to it later, but for now there are better games to play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuper Mario Sunshine\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReleased in 2002 for the GameCube, Sunshine is the mainline Mario I\u0026rsquo;ve never even tried before. I later found out that Sunshine is considered one of the most difficult 3d Mario games to date. I will tend to disagree; I think the average SM64 stage is more difficult than Super Mario Sunshine, given that I was actually able to beat Sunshine. I will concede that 120-shine completion is probably very difficult for Sunshine though, but more on that later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunshine provides some improvements over SM64:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe most significant upgrade is graphically. It\u0026rsquo;s a huge jump over SM64\u0026rsquo;s blocky polygons, and Mario\u0026rsquo;s appearance here is already pretty close to his latest modern appearances.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI still find walk/run controls a bit slippery, but there is significant improvement in jump control since this game gives you FLUDD (the water jetstream firing thing), which has hover functionality making it easier to make difficult jumps.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUnsurprisingly, the most challenging parts of the game are the \u0026ldquo;secret\u0026rdquo; platforming stages where Mario is denied the use of FLUDD. These secrets usually have to be accessed at a certain point in the composite worlds. Although these secret stages are difficult, the blow is kind of softened by two things: if you die, you are returned to the start of the secret stage (instead of kicked out to the containing/hub world); and most of the stages will have one or more 1-ups available, with one easily available near the start of the stage. You\u0026rsquo;re still going to need to grind a lot to finish these secret stages, but at least you\u0026rsquo;re not likely to run out of lives doing so.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlso most of the game\u0026rsquo;s worlds and settings are a lot more fun in terms of ambience.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned, I did manage \u003ca href=\"/2020/10/1314224120490389504/\"\u003eto beat Super Mario Sunshine a couple of weeks ago\u003c/a\u003e. I finished with around 77 shines (out of a possible 120). I may eventually come back to it for completion, although that looks challenging. The main challenge would probably be completing the blue coins in each world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuper Mario Galaxy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOriginally released in 2007, Galaxy is easily the best game in this collection. I tried playing this back when I first got a WiiU (by borrowing the game and a couple of WiiMotes from a friend). At the time I wasn\u0026rsquo;t thrilled with the WiiMote control scheme, especially with having to use the WiiMote as an imprecise pointer, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t get far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m obviously much happier with the Switch version. In handheld mode, you use touch controls on the screen to do the pointer stuff (like to collect star bits), which is much easier and more precise than using the WiiMote (or pointing the joycon in TV mode), so that\u0026rsquo;s my preferred mode of playing the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are some stages that require motion controls, where I find I need to switch to TV control. Examples are the ones where you have to control a Mario riding a rolling ball, or Mario riding a manta ray surfing along a water track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game itself is very beautiful and significantly easier (or at least, less frustrating) than the first two games. You don\u0026rsquo;t have FLUDD this time, but Mario gets a spin jump that gives him additional jump control. And longer stages now have checkpoints in between so that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to start over from the beginning if you die. Many of the stages are fun to play and do a lot of innovative things like playing around with gravity and such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are still some challenging stages. Two of them specifically come to mind: The first one is Galaxy\u0026rsquo;s Greatest Wave, which is one of the aforementioned ray-surfing stages. The race course is very twisty and challening, and if you take each turn too fast or don\u0026rsquo;t turn just the right amount, you\u0026rsquo;re going to be falling off. There are a number of 1-ups along the course, and I managed to get to 99 lives in trying to finish the course. My personal estimate is that I probably re-did the course at least a hundred times. The second one that comes to mind is Luigi\u0026rsquo;s Purple Coins, a stage only available after beating the game the first time. It\u0026rsquo;s a stage where you have to be constantly jumping across disappearing platforms while collecting purple coins all within a time limit. It took me a lot less tries than the ray-surfing one, but each try was exhausting since you\u0026rsquo;re jumping all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing I wish they would have done for this port was add more button support for the menus, instead of having to use tap/motion control for many of them (such as when retrying a level).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI \u003ca href=\"/2020/10/1317023064555548672/\"\u003efinished Galaxy for the first time\u003c/a\u003e last week, and completed the bonus Purple coin missions a few days later. That makes it the first game of this trilogy where \u003ca href=\"/2020/10/1318238520251621377/\"\u003eI hit the goal of 120 stars\u003c/a\u003e. Unlike the first two games though, Galaxy has an additional \u0026ldquo;second quest\u0026rdquo;, an additional 120 stars to be earned while playing as Luigi. Again, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably come back to this at another time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOverall\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Switch is a great console for these games, since I can easily pick it up at any time and play a couple of stages in handheld mode. I was worried whether this purchase would be worth it, since to be honest I\u0026rsquo;m getting a bit old and am not as good as the platforming stuff as I used to be. Platforming in 3d only adds an additional level of difficulty for me personally. But overall, it was a good purchase. I somehow managed to beat two of the games, and it was nice to see how the 3d Mario games evolve through the years. It\u0026rsquo;s too bad they didn\u0026rsquo;t include Galaxy 2, which by all accounts is as good as Galaxy was. My fingers and wrists are tired from all the jumping though, so maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll put down the Switch for a few days before I get started with Odyssey.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "So I got a Nintendo Switch last month. One of the first games I had gotten for the system was the recently released Super Mario 3d All-Stars. I had really been wanting to play Super Mario Odyssey instead, but my brother had a copy of that game that I could borrow later, so I decided to get 3dAS first, as I had never really played the 3 games on the collection.",
