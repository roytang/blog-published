I\u0026rsquo;m already in the middle of setting up the new server, so I think I\u0026rsquo;ll be ready by early November anyway. Most of the code to run the new blog is also mostly ready (who knows how many bugs there are though!) I am (re-)learning a lot about server setups though, so hopefully I\u0026rsquo;ll have quite a few blog posts to write the migration is done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaming: Hey, I \u003ca href=\"/2020/10/1317023064555548672/\"\u003efinished Super Mario Galaxy\u003c/a\u003e! There\u0026rsquo;s 15 post-game stars only available after beating the game, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to work through them before moving on to Odyssey, alhough some of them are quite stressful. (Apparently there\u0026rsquo;s an entire 120 stars again afterwards in some kind of second quest, but I figure I can come back to that some other time.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill ongoing: \u003ca href=\"/tags/inktober2020\"\u003ethe Inktober thing\u003c/a\u003e.

(Hopefully I haven\u0026rsquo;t jinxed it.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching lately: I\u0026rsquo;ve taken to having old seasons of NCIS running in the background (via Prime Video) recently, they\u0026rsquo;re the sort of show you can just leave running while you\u0026rsquo;re doing other things, and if you miss something it really doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. I also started on Expanse season 4, but that requires more focused watching so the going is slow. I have some backlog to work through, since The Boys season 2 and Star Trek Discovery season 3 are both out now.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It is what it is though. I guess I haven\u0026rsquo;t really had time for longer writing things lately?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not \u003cem\u003ework\u003c/em\u003e busy, but the I have felt busy during the past week. Part of it is probably becaause I\u0026rsquo;ve started \u003ca href=\"/tags/inktober2020\"\u003edoing the Inktober thing\u003c/a\u003e, so that\u0026rsquo;s an additional daily task. Another part of it is probably the fact that I purchased a Nintendo Switch last week!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, gaming then:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe aforementioned Nintendo Switch. I got Super Mario 3D All Stars and Link\u0026rsquo;s Awakening together with the purchase. I originally wanted to get Mario Odyssey, Fire Emblem and Paper Mario as well, but I figured two games (really four) was plenty for a first set, and my brother was going to lend me Odyssey anyway. I started playing \u003ca href=\"/2020/09/1310497720117784577/\"\u003eMario 64\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;m not too far in, but I found the camera really problematic, and I can\u0026rsquo;t play it for too long without getting dizzy. I also started playing Super Mario Sunshine, which was a noticeable improvement camera-wise, and I can play it for extended periods without dizziness problems, so I\u0026rsquo;m quite a bit farther along there. I hope to get back to Mario 64 eventually, but it\u0026rsquo;s no big loss if I don\u0026rsquo;t. I understand it\u0026rsquo;s a classic game a lot of people look back fondly on, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s aged well, and not just because of camera problems.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also tried the \u003ca href=\"/2020/10/1311655542008377346/\"\u003efree Super Mario 35 battle royale game\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s reasonably fun, although when you\u0026rsquo;re at the last 2-3 players, it takes a while to get to a winner.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFinally managed to \u003ca href=\"/2020/10/1311602939891535872/\"\u003ehit the 7 wins in Zendikar Rising draft\u003c/a\u003e! Standard is still terrible though. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll just play 1 draft a week and that\u0026rsquo;s it? The MTG community was also in an uproar the past few weeks, both due to the poor state of standard and due to some controversy over an upcoming Secret Lair crossover with The Walking Dead. WOTC has implied they are looking at expanding Magic mechanics to other IPs, so the TWD thing is mostly a trial balloon, I think. Many people are upset and are predicting the death of Magic, but the game has been pronounced dead before. We\u0026rsquo;ll see what happens. I\u0026rsquo;m not personally affected (since I don\u0026rsquo;t Commander), my primary concern is the health of Standard formats.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSaturday gaming group picked up a new multiplayer game, it\u0026rsquo;s Root, from Leder Games (and published for digital by Dire Wolf, creators of \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/\"\u003eEternal\u003c/a\u003e). It\u0026rsquo;s reasonably complicated, and thematically and mechanically quite different from the last digital boardgame we were doing (Blood Rage).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mentioned last week that I was planning to participate in \u003ca href=\"https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/\"\u003eHacktoberfest\u003c/a\u003e. I haven\u0026rsquo;t yet, and there was some controversy over the past few weeks, with OSS maintainers complaining about spam PRs due to the event. Apparently, it was the fault of a Youtube who had a few hundred thousand followers. He had made a video showing how easy it was to make PRs and win the event swag, and a lot of people were following his low effort examples. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if I\u0026rsquo;ll still participate, though I have been looking around a few repos here and there, we\u0026rsquo;ll see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, I haven\u0026rsquo;t watched anything of note the past week. A couple of standup specials on Netflix, that\u0026rsquo;s it. I guess the Switch took most of my entertainment time!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIFTTT, a service I\u0026rsquo;ve \u003ca href=\"/2019/01/ifttt/\"\u003ebeen using for a while now\u003c/a\u003e, has \u003ca href=\"/2020/10/1312652625511280640/\"\u003eobnoxiously been insisting I upgrade to their Pro tier\u003c/a\u003e. They\u0026rsquo;re going to start severely restricting free accounts, so I\u0026rsquo;m looking to minimize my usage of the service moving forward. All of the social media syndication stuff can be handled by the new blog backend I\u0026rsquo;m writing, so that\u0026rsquo;s fine. The only things that should remain are stuff I haven\u0026rsquo;t looked into automating myself yet, mainly backing up of SMS, so I\u0026rsquo;ll probably look into that soonish. I\u0026rsquo;m not against paying for services, but in this case it\u0026rsquo;s simply not worth it for me, since I can trivially write my own replacement software for most of my usage of the service. So long IFTTT, it\u0026rsquo;s been swell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no closing words of wisdom today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",

It\u0026rsquo;s one of those projects where I find myself being productive not because of deadlines or anything like that, but because I genuinely enjoy working on it. When I find myself thinking of of new things that need to be done, or a new feature, or a way to solve an interesting problem, I am cursed (blessed?) with restlessness until I get it done. There are a number of challenges with the way I chose to approach this problem, most probably the subject of a future blog post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned this before, but I went ahead and paid for a year of the Micro plan on Migadu.com. The email in/out limits aren\u0026rsquo;t that high, but the price is decent, and I don\u0026rsquo;t really use my personal email that much anyway (I\u0026rsquo;m no spammer!). I\u0026rsquo;ll re-evaluate next year whether I want to migrate. (Sets a calendar event.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuff I\u0026rsquo;ve watched this past week:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI went ahead and watched the second season of Umbrella Academy. It\u0026rsquo;s more or less structured like the first season: each member has their own problems; five discovers an upcoming apocalypse, so he tries to bring everyone together; also, there\u0026rsquo;s people who want to kill them. The ending of this is more satisfying than S1 though\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEnola Holmes on Netflix. It was ok, but it\u0026rsquo;s more of a young adult story, maybe a bit above the Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys level.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaming this past week:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emanaged to get in a \u003ca href=\"/tags/mtgznr/\"\u003ecouple more Zendikar Rising drafts\u003c/a\u003e. Fun format, but I continue to have a terrible record, with only one draft actually going well. I did get a refund for that last one, so let\u0026rsquo;s see if we can\u0026rsquo;t do better this coming week!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eadditional drop on the Civ6 New Frontier pass came out, giving us Gaul and Byzantium. A friend and I tried it in a multiplayer game. I played Byz and he went with Gaul; we only played for a couple of hours, but both new civs seem quite powerful.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emy SC2 group managed to finish the Wings of Liberty coop campaign! Pretty fun, and it was fun to relive the story too, as I had already forgotten a lot of it. We started the Heart of the Swarm version the next day.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSaturday gaming group have been playing Blood Rage over the past few months, and it even came out with a new DLC/expansion a couple of weeks ago. The game client is a bit buggy, but we tolerate it because it\u0026rsquo;s a fun/deep game anyway. We\u0026rsquo;re looking at maybe trying out a different game next week though.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTrivia was meh this week, the topics weren\u0026rsquo;t really to our liking.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI purchased last month\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription\"\u003eHumble Choice\u003c/a\u003e (or rather, let it lapse into purchase). It\u0026rsquo;s not unreasonable, there\u0026rsquo;s some games there I can try like Forager and Evoland, and given my recent streak of Mario playing, I was wanting a platformer for the PC, so Yooka Layle isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad idea\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLate-breaking Sunday news: I have kind of impulse bought a Nintendo Switch. Well, I was agonizing over it for a while, but stores were selling it just a bit overpriced. Today I found that there was a slight price drop (around $40 worth) of the Labo bundle at one of my local stores, so I impulsively went ahead and ordered it. Maybe should have waited a day or so? regardless, it\u0026rsquo;s on the way, along with Zelda: Link\u0026rsquo;s Awakening and Super Mario 3D All Stars. No interest in the Labo personally, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll try to sell it off?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe tried using Messenger Rooms for a family conf call today, in lieu of Zoom which limits us to 40-minute calls. Might have been bad luck or poor internet, but the experience was substantially worse. Disconnections, lag, poor video quality, etc. We\u0026rsquo;ll see if they want to switch back to Zoom next time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems weird that we are so close to the end of 2020 now. Still no idea what Christmas is going to look like. I\u0026rsquo;m sure many other people are also looking forward to closing out 2020 and going to 2021, even though that holds no logical promise of things being better than they are now. But we can always dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",

There are two distractions I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to in the coming month.\n  The first one is Inktober, which I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing since 2016. Basically it\u0026rsquo;s just to do 30 ink drawings in October, one per day. There are some official prompts, which I\u0026rsquo;ll probably follow. I haven\u0026rsquo;t really done any serious sketching in a while, maybe this will help me get back into the groove.",
