            "title": "Digital Boardgames Review: Scythe",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eOver the past couple of years, I\u0026rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d do reviews of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy second review is about \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/718560/Scythe_Digital_Edition/\"\u003eScythe: Digital Edition\u003c/a\u003e. Scythe is a competitive game where you play one of seven factions in an alternate history post-war Eastern Europe. Players vie to control territories, hire workers, build mechs, accumulate resources, accomplish secret objectives, and other such goals. Accomplishing secret objectives, winning combats or maximizing one of the several metrics (workers, money, popularity, military power, recruits, structures, mechs, etc) earns you stars, and the game ends when at least one player has six stars. Having six stars doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee victory, as points are then tallied up depending on various factors including stars, territories, money, popularity, and so on. Having separate victory and end conditions creates a bit of tension and a balancing act between progressing stars and earning points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlayers play as one of seven available factions, each with preset locations on the board. The board is preset and consists of hex tiles, each with different movement limitations and resources that can be produced. The board also has \u0026ldquo;encounters\u0026rdquo; on certain tiles, basically roleplaying opportunities where you get the choice of an action to take, typically trading one type of resource for another, usually a good deal, if you can pay the costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe board is fixed, but each player is randomly assigned a mat that determines the actions available during their turn. The mat is split into top actions (produce, move, bolster, trade) each paired with one of the available bottom actions (upgrade, deploy mech, recruit, build structure). During your turn, you may play one top action followed by the corresponding bottom action, and you cannot do the same action pair on successive turns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis weird action structure makes the game challenging. Typically, the top actions generate resources, while the bottom actions consume them to advance your goals. If you get a mat with pairings that are poor for your particular situation, it may take a while for you to get into a regular rhythm of production to actually get anything done. Other players can also interfere with you by sending their character and/or mechs to attack or harass your territory or workers. I usually find that I need to plan ahead 2-3 turns to accomplish a simple goal like building a mech. Beyond the 3-turn window, who knows what the board looks like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCombat is kind of straightforward - you can attack a hex with one or two combat units, and up to two combat units will defend it. Each side can spend up to 7 military power, plus play one combat card per unit on their side, each card adds 2-5 to your total. The attacker wins all ties, favoring aggressors. Due to the way military power and combat cards are accumulated, it\u0026rsquo;s risky to initiate combat unless you have at least 14 military power (this ensures you have a fighting chance against a counterattack). Furthermore, each faction can only gain up to 2 stars from winning combats, so you want to make them count. In our games, we find that typically the winning faction will use two combats to try to earn 2 stars in one turn and end the game, and often those will be the only combats that happen in the entire game. Not sure if we are playing this optimally!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames tend to go at least an hour long, roughly 20 or so turns in our experience. Because of the game\u0026rsquo;s pacing and action structure, you can have games where it feels like I haven\u0026rsquo;t accomplished much by then. Usually this creates a bit of snowball effect as well - the player who gets his act together earlier will tend to pull ahead and be difficult to catch up to. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if there\u0026rsquo;s a \u003ca href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComebackMechanic\"\u003ecomeback mechanism\u003c/a\u003e we\u0026rsquo;re missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe display is literally just the actual board, and the camera can be a bit finicky sometimes. In my last game I accidentally rotated the view and took a minute to figure out how to get it back. The UI is also fairly sparse and a lot of information or options can be hidden in the weirdest places. Like, figuring out where your faction is allowed to cross rivers can be challenging for new players. I\u0026rsquo;ve attached some screenshots to this post, but they\u0026rsquo;re nothing special.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is probably just relevant to my playgroup, but because of the slow pace, we tend to play a second metagame on top of the endgame scoring, where we consider the player who has spent the least amount of time on his turns (as seen via the turn clock) as \u0026ldquo;winning by time\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong the digital board games we\u0026rsquo;ve played, this is the one where we have the least amount of playtime. Unsurprising given how slow the pace is and how difficult it is. For this reason, I think it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to recommend to any boardgame newbies.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It tells the story of a near-future world and a trend of people going \u0026ldquo;walkaway\u0026rdquo;. This term means walking away from what they call \u0026ldquo;default society\u0026rdquo;, characterized by late stage capitalism, massive inequality, ever-present surveillance, and a world controlled by what they call the zottarich, or simply zottas. Not too far from our own present reality of course. Later, the novel also delves into the near-future (?) concept of humans being to upload their consciousness into machines, effectively allowing them to cheat death by running as a \u0026ldquo;brain in a jar\u0026rdquo; on a cluster of computers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing walkaway means giving everything up and deciding to live communally and off the land, as it were. This near-future world makes this possible due to the abundance of materials and equipment that have been left behind or abandoned due to failed cities, institutions or companies. Resources that are presumably being wasted or going unused because of insane things like copyright controls, patents, and so on. Walkaways are shown building entire communities by sending out drones to seek out and gather nearby raw materials and constructing machines like fabricators that can spin out food and clothing, all powered by open source code that is freely shared and improved upon by walkaways worldwide via a highly distributed and decentralized walkaway network. \u0026ldquo;Default\u0026rdquo; society and media portray walkaways as anarchists and terrorists, living on the fringe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plot centers upon a small group of twenty-somethings (including one zotta heiress) who initially flirt with the idea of going walkaway, and then decide to jump right in. Under that thin veneer, the novel feels mostly like an opportunity to explore how such an idea could work, and how it could bridge the gap between our current society and an idealized future, post-scarcity and even post-human. That gap is not bridged easily of course. Discoveries in walkaway culture and science such as human mind uploads threaten to overturn the \u0026lsquo;default\u0026rsquo; society and thus draws the ire of the zottas, who send in mercenaries and even armies to disrupt, arrest, and take down walkaways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe author is a blogger I\u0026rsquo;ve known about for a while, and his interest in various kinds of technology and possible future applications to help supplant late-stage capitalism are made obvious through the novel. I initially thought it was being a bit too preachy and idealistic about walkaway culture being the right path for humanity. The story argues that there is plenty to go around, and that people shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be coerced to work and should have an abundance mentality, freely helping and giving away to others, something that works in the novel because of the existence of fabricators and the apparent abundance of raw materials, but which I am unsure would be true in the real world. This is why we still have a lot of people arguing against things like UBI and so on. The novel anchors itself from a point where the scarcity issue is mostly addressed, what\u0026rsquo;s left is to overcome the regressive \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; capitalist systems holding us back from a brighter future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kind of find myself aligned with the author in terms of ideology; I am very much hoping we as a society find a way past the perils of capitalism, but I\u0026rsquo;m not yet so optimisci that it could work. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure whether the story should be classified as a dystopia - it certainly describes a very dystopian status quo, but that status quo is not too far from our current one. And ultimately, despite all the trials and tribulations our walkaway protagonists are subject to, the novel still exudes optimism about humanity\u0026rsquo;s future. So, a hopeful dystopia, a dystopia that can be defeated? A dystopia that is merely a stepping stone towards what the walkaways call \u0026ldquo;the first days of a better nation\u0026quot;\n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnotebase-1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e\n.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eOver the past couple of years, I\u0026rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d do reviews of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first one is \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/337150/Sentinels_of_the_Multiverse/\"\u003eSentinels of the Multiverse\u003c/a\u003e. We\u0026rsquo;ve played the IRL boardgame of it before during one of our sporadic in-person meetups. If you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar, it\u0026rsquo;s a comics-themed coop game where up to 4 people play as a group of heroes to beat a villain (basically comic book shenanigans).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a large variety of heroes available to play, each with unique abilities and play styles. Some of them are straightforward and some are super complicated and fiddly to play. The villains you have to beat vary from super simple to really difficult, with advanced variants for even more challenge. The game also provides a \u0026ldquo;weekly one-shot\u0026rdquo; challenge which provides a fixed scenario/villain and set of heroes to play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;ve played a lot of games of Sentinels, and probably only won something like 60-70% of them. Each game takes around an hour or so, maybe more if it was super difficult. Usually we lose when we choose some combination of random heroes just to try them out then get beaten terribly by the villain. Then we go on a revenge run using one of the simpler heroes like Legacy or Tachyon (or we just put in a healer like Dr Medico).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe digital version has the advantage that it automates a lot of the ability triggers and checks that the boardgame requires, which would usually be a lot of work. On the other hand, it has a UX disadvantage for those scenarios where an ability triggers multiple times and you want to make the same decision every time. In the real board game, you can just handwave it off by saying \u0026ldquo;Ok, we choose X is every time\u0026rdquo;, but in the digital version you have to click through every confirmation dialog every time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#9b343c2c14c495c5a8dd6b1afec25ba2-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2021/02/digital-boardgames-review-sentinels-of-the-multiverse/sentinels_hu55ebca5d49dfa13d3a35dca65e2ada62_322159_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"9b343c2c14c495c5a8dd6b1afec25ba2-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2021/02/digital-boardgames-review-sentinels-of-the-multiverse/sentinels.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"15 Feb 2021 7:34am\"\u003e15 Feb 2021 7:34am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe game\u0026rsquo;s aesthetic is very much classic comic books, even multiplayer games are joined by entering a code in the format of a comic book issue like \u0026ldquo;Justice Comics #153\u0026rdquo;. The art isn\u0026rsquo;t the most elaborate and could be better; in fact, they are planning a \u003ca href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/27/22250963/sentinels-of-the-multiverse-definitive-kickstarter-street-date-price\"\u003eDefinitive Edition of the boardgame\u003c/a\u003e that has even better art that is closer to the old-school comic book aesthetic. It looks like a signficant upgrade, so I expect if they ever release a digital version of the new version it would be a completely new game on Steam. Our group has enjoyed our Sentinels games though, so I fully expect we will be getting the new Steam version when it does come out.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

If the volume is unsatisfactory to you, feel free to unfollow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this same reason, I dislike it when people complain to other people on Twitter in the vein of \u0026ldquo;I followed you for $TOPIC, please stop talking $OTHERTOPIC\u0026rdquo;.

In fact, I still believe in that ideal for the internet as it was conceived. (See also: \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/badnetworker/status/1133363823728091136\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;four websites, each filled with screenshots of the other three\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I can see Will\u0026rsquo;s point. Human history definitely means we trend towards centralization in the long term. (Although our cultural and nationalistic differences are still too wide to tend towards centralized government for the planet\u0026hellip;) Still, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean there isn\u0026rsquo;t room for decentralized networks to also still exist, perhaps on the fringe. After all, not everyone wants to live in the big cities, there are still people who like growing their own food, people who prefer independent films over the ones made by big blockbuster conglomerates, people who want to support the small mom-and-pop stores over the big retail chains, etc. Even as culture and society consolidate and centralize, counter-cultures can still exist and even thrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just because things towards centralized platforms doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we have to accept the current platforms as the end state, we can still ask for something better. If the analogy was to compare online platform centralization to the tendency towards people living in large metropolitan areas, then something like Facebook could be considered analogous to the worst of industrialized cities: over-populated, polluted, scammers and other shady characters abound trying to see if they can make a quick buck off of you, strangers shouting at each other, law enforcement going after you for arbitrary reasons, and so on. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be like this. The same way we are trying to have better, well-designed cities with better, cleaner systems to better support populations at scale, we also need to work hard to have better centralized silos and platforms, ones that work for us instead of against us. If we have to in a city, it might as well be a good city.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The only non-substack entry on today\u0026rsquo;s list, this Bloomberg column covers financial matters like stock market and investment stuff. (It was certainly useful when following the whole Reddit/Gamestop stock market saga!) Levine likes to go in-depth and long-form, so his columns are usually quite long and cover multiple topics. I\u0026rsquo;ll admit that this kind of thing isn\u0026rsquo;t really my specialty, and most of the time I have trouble even getting to the end of any single entry without my eyes glazing over, but I do feel like I learn a lot every time and I hope to someday finish a column claiming I fully understand it!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://noahpinion.substack.com/\"\u003eNoahpinion\u003c/a\u003e by \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/noahpinion\"\u003eNoah Smith\u003c/a\u003e. Noah Smith writes mostly about economics and US politics. The articles are fairly in-depth (not as much as Money Stuff), and I\u0026rsquo;ve found them generally informative and educational on topics I\u0026rsquo;m not especially familiar with.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.todayintabs.com/\"\u003eToday in Tabs\u003c/a\u003e by Rusty Foster. I used to consider myself \u0026ldquo;extremely online\u0026rdquo; and aware of most everything on the internet. That might have been true back in 2010, back before all these youngsters came online and added all their vlogs and tiktoks and whatnot. This newsletter (and the next one) helps me keep up with all of the modern internet\u0026rsquo;s day-to-day nonsense. Each issue of Today in Tabs is dense and jam-packed with a whole bunch of recent cool internet things.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.garbageday.email\"\u003eGarbage Day\u003c/a\u003e by \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/broderick\"\u003eRyan Broderick\u003c/a\u003e. I first encountered this newsletter when someone shared his \u003ca href=\"https://www.garbageday.email/p/everything-you-need-to-know-about\"\u003earticle giving an explainer about the Tumblr subculture\u003c/a\u003e. It covers a variety of internet-focused topics, but each issue focuses on less\u0026hellip; things than Today In Tabs, albeit covering each item with just a bit more depth. Together, both newsletters give me a good idea of what\u0026rsquo;s happening on the internet on a regular basis.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://vicki.substack.com/\"\u003eNormcore Tech\u003c/a\u003e by \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/vboykis\"\u003eVicki Boykis\u003c/a\u003e. The author\u0026rsquo;s background is in data science, and from their own description, the newsletter offers \u0026ldquo;takes on tech news that are rooted in humanism, nuance, context, rationality, and a little fun\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; I couldn\u0026rsquo;t write a better explanation than that.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n",

I\u0026rsquo;d define it as any blogging that isn\u0026rsquo;t for any kind of commercial purpose like for selling something or to generate ad revenue. Sincere blogging can be intended as informative or aspirational or purely for self-expression, as long as it\u0026rsquo;s not mainly commercial in purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it served as reminder to me, as I haven\u0026rsquo;t been writing here as often as I could have. I feel like in the past few years, I\u0026rsquo;ve filtered my writing a bit by only writing blog posts when I feel like I have something longish or elaborate or profound to say, and that led to making it harder to write posts when I was low on energy or whatever. Most probably a consequence of the proliferation of microblogging, as if a post needed to justify it\u0026rsquo;s length so that it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t get relegated to the ranks of \u0026ldquo;notes\u0026rdquo;. And I\u0026rsquo;ve been restricting myself to at most one post a day, which is a bit arbitrary and entire meaningless. So, let\u0026rsquo;s change all that, I\u0026rsquo;m hoping. I should be free to post more than once if I want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo here I am with my nonsense again, if you\u0026rsquo;ll have me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Not like I ever left, mind you\u0026hellip;)\u003c/p\u003e\n",
