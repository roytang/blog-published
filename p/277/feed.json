Superman\u0026rsquo;s early years are largely re-written, and that\u0026rsquo;s understandable, he\u0026rsquo;s never had particularly interesting events in his history anyway\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSuperman\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; meh, needs more spice\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSuperboy\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting, but the character has yet to find a status quo\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSupergirl\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting, but the character has yet to find a status quo\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eGreen Lantern\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting, though it implies Hal is currently a GL in the league with a \u0026ldquo;fake\u0026rdquo; power ring. Most of the GL history seems to be intact, and the GL books are all leading towards some sort of \u0026ldquo;third army\u0026rdquo; event, I hope it happens soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eGreen Lantern Corps\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting enough for me to want to read it before AvX #6 this week\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eGreen Lantern: New Guardians\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting, but I don\u0026rsquo;t see where this is going. Is it possible for Raynier\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Rainbow Guardians\u0026rdquo; to become a real team?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eRed Lanterns\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; mildly interesting, but I don\u0026rsquo;t see where this is going. I\u0026rsquo;m not convinced the Reds were the best corps to give their own series\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTeen Titans\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting for me, but only because Red Robin is here. The team\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;coming together adventure\u0026rdquo; has been going on for far too long and they need to reach some sort of status quo\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBlue Beetle\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting, but the character has yet to find a status quo\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eLegion of Super-Heroes\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting storylines, but way too many characters, not very accessible\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eLegion Lost\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting, but they can\u0026rsquo;t get back to their own time without changing the book title, so it kinda limits what\u0026rsquo;s going to happen and makes them always on the run\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAll-Star Western\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting, but weird. Not really a superhero book, though it has ties to Gotham City. I\u0026rsquo;m not particularly interested in the backup stories though\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDeathstroke\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; not interesting, seems to be mostly just Slade killing a bunch of guys for one reason or another. I\u0026rsquo;m not confident about it with Liefeld coming on, but I\u0026rsquo;ll probably still read it for a while since I can\u0026rsquo;t resist a  train wreck\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSuicide Squad\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; meh, the squad composition at the moment isn\u0026rsquo;t very interesting, the only real personalities there are Deadshot and Harley (at least they\u0026rsquo;re giving her something to do aside from being a Joker fangirl)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eStormwatch\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; mildly interesting, if only because they\u0026rsquo;re going to need to be fighting the JL at some point. Some of their science-y explanations are ridiculous though\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eGrifter\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; meh, doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be going anywhere serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eVoodoo\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; meh, not sure where it\u0026rsquo;s going. Also, with all this Daemonite activity going on, how is it Stormwatch isn\u0026rsquo;t seriously cracking down on them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eResurrection Man\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; I like the concept, but the storyline seems to be going nowhere serious\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMan O War\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; I tried to bear with this, but it just bored me. I only managed to read up to issue 7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eJustice League Dark\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting, though they\u0026rsquo;re not really a real \u0026ldquo;team\u0026rdquo; at the moment. But the team composition is solid, especially they dropped Shade who wasn\u0026rsquo;t really doing anything for the book. Andrew Bennet seems a better fit\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSwamp Thing\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting, but might be a bit too weird for some, since a lot of the book feels like Alec Holland being on an acid trip of some sort. Feels very Vertigo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnimal Man\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; see Swamp Thing. Art is pretty good, but still weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFrankenstein, Agent of SHADE\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting enough. Art is\u0026hellip;  unique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eI, Vampire\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; surprisingly interesting, even if I\u0026rsquo;m already reading another Vampire series (American Vampire). Curious to see where it goes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDemon Knights\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; surprisingly interesting, the team composition is nice and varied (Vandal Savage, wut) and the storylines are a fresh reprieve from superhero stuff\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDC Comics Presents\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; Deadman was ok, Challengers less interesting for me. Good series for them to keep around and showcase lesser-known characters\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the second wave of the New 52, of which we are only one or two issues in:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBatman Incorporated\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; looking good, easily better than both Detective and Dark Knight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEarth 2\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; the second issue was a bit slow, but it looks interesting enough\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWorlds\u0026rsquo; Finest\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; the first issue wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best, but I like the idea of this comic so I\u0026rsquo;ll keep reading it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDial H\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; off to a good start, but I can\u0026rsquo;t help but wonder whether they\u0026rsquo;ll be running out of hero ideas at some point. Also, Pelican Army!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eGI Combat\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; okay, I didn\u0026rsquo;t like the last war book, I\u0026rsquo;m not gonna bother with this one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Ravagers\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; giving this a shot, although at the moment it just seems like another \u0026ldquo;bunch of super teens on the run from evil forces\u0026rdquo; kinda deal, and that\u0026rsquo;s already what Teen Titans is doing at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m probably going to keep on reading a good 70-80% of the books going forward, I don\u0026rsquo;t feel compelled to read every single one of them any more. It\u0026rsquo;s still a good chunk of books to read, and makes me look forward to the new releases every week.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I finished 11 and 4, which was good enough for 39th place despite my pretty bad tiebreaks. This means I finished in the money, hooray! Feels good to have a decent finish after playing this game for what, seventeen years now? Playing in Day 2 was great, the tables weren\u0026rsquo;t as crowded as Day One! Hah. I still made a lot of bad plays though, I mostly got lucky with a lot of my wins. With tighter play I might have gone as good as 13-2.\u003cfigure style=\"width: 540px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nOZlY4k8DC8/T99O13bdziI/AAAAAAAAAOU/t5RzS6Rhafo/s720/IMG_20120617_155930.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg title=\"My finish\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nOZlY4k8DC8/T99O13bdziI/AAAAAAAAAOU/t5RzS6Rhafo/s720/IMG_20120617_155930.jpg\" alt=\"My finish\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003e39th!\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from the main event, another thing I participated in during the second day was the Magic Rules Challenge! This was a fun thing they had where they set up a booth manned by a couple of judges. You could go up to them (no entrance fee) and answer up to three rules questions in a row. If you get questions right, you get foil cards! Well, the foil cards I won weren\u0026rsquo;t very useful or valuable, but I had a lot of fun with the rules questions themselves, I really enjoy that stuff. I\u0026rsquo;d hang out there between rounds not only to join but also to watch other people play. The questions ranged in difficulty from quite easy (\u0026ldquo;You play \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Grim%20Lavamancer\" target=\"_new\"\u003eGrim Lavamancer\u003c/a\u003e\u0026rsquo;s activated ability and your opponent uses \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Tormod%27s%20Crypt\" target=\"_new\"\u003eTormod's Crypt\u003c/a\u003e, how much damage is dealt?\u0026quot;) to an actual layers + \u003ca class=\"cardname\" href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small\u0026type=card\u0026name=Humility\" target=\"_new\"\u003eHumility\u003c/a\u003e question!

Makes me excited about playing Magic again. Looking forward to the next GP Manila in a couple of years!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Last weekend was Grand Prix Manila 2012, held at the SMX at Mall of Asia. I don\u0026rsquo;t really consider myself a \u0026ldquo;regular\u0026rdquo; Magic player anymore so I\u0026rsquo;m not going to give a full tournament report, though I will record some details for posterity.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with the deck. I played some version of Naya Pod, limited by what cards were available as usual:\nA Pile of Naya  Creatures   4 Birds of Paradise   3 Avacyn Pilgrim   1 Ulvenwald Tracker   4 Strangeleroot Geist   2 Thalia, Guardian of Thraben   1 Daybreak Ranger   2 Borderland Ranger   2 Blade Splicer   2 Fiend Hunter   2 Wolfir Avenger   1 Phyrexian Metamorph   2 Hero of Bladehold   2 Huntmaster of the Fells   3 Restoration Angel   1 Oxida Scrapmelter   1 Acidic Slime    Spells   2 Birthing Pod   1 Bonfire of the Damned    Lands   4 Copperline Gorge   4 Razorverge Thicket   3 Sunpetal Grove   2 Rootbound Crag   2 Gavony Township   1 Slayer Stronghold   2 Cavern of Souls   4 Forest   1 Mountain   1 Plains    Sideboard   1 Ancient Grudge   2 Ray of Revelation   1 Zealous Conscripts   2 Garruk Relentless   2 Celestial Purge   3 Thunderbolt   2 Arc Trail   1 Surgical Extraction   1 Oblivion Ring       It\u0026rsquo;s a pretty straightforward deck, what with the turning guys sideways and all.",
