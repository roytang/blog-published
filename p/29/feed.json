            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI forget where I got this book recommendation from, but it did go on sale for Kindle a while back so I got a copy. The full title is \u0026ldquo;Utopia for Realists: How We Can Build the Ideal World\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummary: I really like this book, though I think it falls short in providing concrete steps for how to get from where we are to the idealized utopia he presents. Still, in this world of ever-increasing bad news and crises, the optimism of this book is a welcome respite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book covers a number of \u0026ldquo;utopian\u0026rdquo; scenarios worth striving for, namely:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003euniversal basic income\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eshorter work weeks\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eopen borders\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven before reading a book, I was already a believer in these ideals, well aware of the justifications. But the book covers that and more, providing a history of those ideas and what was tried before and why they failed and why we aren\u0026rsquo;t there yet. The history is particularly interesting, as before this I had no idea how close the US came to implementing something like UBI in the middle of the last century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I said, there\u0026rsquo;s very little concrete suggestions as to how to get there though. The author wails a bit about how progressives are stuck trying to protect the status quo instead of pushing forward truly progressive ideals such as these. The book also briefly covers such topics as biases and how difficult it is to push truly progressive ideas forward in the face of those biases. Aside from that, most of the advice seems to be \u0026ldquo;keep on bringing these issues up, their time will come.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a critical eye to these issues leads me deeper into my \u003ca href=\"/2018/10/capitalism/\"\u003edisagreements with the hyperefficiency of capitalism\u003c/a\u003e because even though with detailed analysis these ideals may tend to hold up in terms of value, it will still be difficult convincing a society to pursue them when said society is focused on profit over all things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably a more detailed discussion of each issue is beyond the scope of this post and each one may even merit multiple additional posts on their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, here are some passages/quotes I found myself highlighting from the book:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn worrying about what other people think:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOn inequality affecting people\u0026rsquo;s self-image (explains a lot about the Philippines):\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake bullying. Countries with big disparities in wealth also have more bullying behavior, because there are bigger status differences\u0026hellip; the “psychosocial consequences” are such that people living in unequal societies spend more time worrying about how others see them. This undercuts the quality of relationships (manifested in a distrust of strangers and status anxiety, for example). The resulting stress, in turn, is a major determinant of illness and chronic health problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOn why performance-driven societies may not be optimal (i.e. capitalsm\u0026rsquo;s focus on efficiency may not be best):\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the writer Kevin Kelly says, “Productivity is for robots. Humans excel at wasting time, experimenting, playing, creating, and exploring.” Governing by numbers is the last resort of a country that no longer knows what it wants, a country with no vision of utopia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOn shorter work weeks:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Ford, Kellogg, and Heath had all discovered is that productivity and long work hours do not go hand in hand. In the 1980s, Apple employees sported T-shirts that read, “Working 90 hours a week and loving it!” Later, productivity experts calculated that if they had worked half the hours then the world might have enjoyed the groundbreaking Macintosh computer a year earlier. There are strong indications that in a modern knowledge economy, even forty hours a week is too much. Research suggests that someone who is constantly drawing on their creative abilities can, on average, be productive for no more than six hours a day. It\u0026rsquo;s no coincidence that the world\u0026rsquo;s wealthy countries, those with a large creative class and highly educated populations, have also shaved the most time off their workweeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOn the cult of busy:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNowadays, excessive work and pressure are status symbols.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI was travelling for most of the past two months, so this covers both June and July, and I guess I haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to watch too much. Maybe? IDK, we\u0026rsquo;ll see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I was in the US, I took the opportunity to finish watching \u003cstrong\u003eVoltron: Legendary Defender\u003c/strong\u003e which only had two seasons available on PH Netflix. Pretty good adaptation, lots of fun callbacks to the old series. Some annoying filler eps, especially in the middle seasons onwards. I like how they spent the entire series going through the main Voltron villains one by one: first Zarkon, then Lotor, then a little bit of Sendak, then finally Hagar. It got a bit too hocus pocus magicky BS near the finale for me, but overall a pretty good watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we were staying with relatives in the US, it turns out they\u0026rsquo;re really fond of watching Filipino movies. I\u0026rsquo;m not big on Filipino movies, most of them seem either uninspired, formulaic or outright ridiculous. I did enjoy a couple of the ones that I sat through, at least enough to comment on them, coincidentally both starring Eddie Garcia (RIP). The first one was \u003cstrong\u003eRainbow\u0026rsquo;s Sunset\u003c/strong\u003e, which has Eddie Garcia playing a senior citizen ex-politician who comes out as gay and explores the repurcussions to his children and grandchildren. This movie had a strange ending that came out of nowhere though. The second movie was \u003cstrong\u003eHeaven\u0026rsquo;s Waiting\u003c/strong\u003e where Garcia portrays an old man who has died and finds himself in a waiting area before he can be sent to heaven, basically purgatory. In this place he finds an old flame of his from his youth, who has secretly been waiting for him all this time, refusing to advance to heaven. The movie explores themes of life and death and love and regret and commitment, but in a context outside of the typical Filipino love team movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a bunch of other Netflix movies watched - these folks didn\u0026rsquo;t have that much to do at home - but the only other one I remember sitting through was \u003cstrong\u003eMurder Mystery\u003c/strong\u003e starring Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston. Basically a comedic whodunnit, it was entertaining enough to sit through, but nothing too special. I did like the car chase scene at the end though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from watching on Netflix, I also tried out an American cinema and watched \u003cstrong\u003eSpider-man Far From Home\u003c/strong\u003e with a friend. I have a \u003ca href=\"/2019/07/spider-man-far-from-home/\"\u003eseparate blog post\u003c/a\u003e for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurder Mystery might not have been too special, but it did inspire me to watch the copy I had of \u003cstrong\u003eMurder on the Orient Express\u003c/strong\u003e when I got back home. It was my first exposure to Hercule Poirot, and I was pleasantly surprised by the star-studded cast. It\u0026rsquo;s the sort of movie where you can\u0026rsquo;t watch it twice though; I suppose all whodunits are like that, but now I can\u0026rsquo;t watch the older movie based on this book. There\u0026rsquo;s supposedly a sequel coming out next year, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll watch that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the trip, there was a whole lot of shows to catch up on. The only one I managed to complete was \u003cstrong\u003eJessica Jones S3\u003c/strong\u003e, the final season among the erstwhile Netflix-Marvel shows. I liked this season, mostly because it went way more dark than I expected and had a very \u0026ldquo;Criminal Minds\u0026rdquo;/procedural kind of vibe since her main antagonist here was a serial killer, and one of the themes is how a hero has to play by the rules and can\u0026rsquo;t just do whatever he wants like killing criminals. (This kind of message always resonates with me now because of where the country is.) While I feel like it might have been better to cap the Netflix-Marvel venture with Daredevil\u0026rsquo;s fantastic season 3, this one isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad ending either. I suspect I will do a more detailed look back on these shows soonish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike I said, I have a ton of shows to catch up on. Good Omens, Stranger Things, Doom Patrol, Legion, etc to name a few. And I missed out on a few movies though, like Dark Phoenix, which I was tempted to watch in the cinema despite the bad reviews, because I\u0026rsquo;ve never missed any of the prior X-Men movies, not even Wolverine Origins. Hopefully I\u0026rsquo;ll have time to catch up on all of this stuff before the Fall TV season comes in!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI have a small mobile app that I wrote using React Native (henceforth RN) back in 2017, currently deployed on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. Shortly before my US trip, I got an email from Google telling me about a required action:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy August 1, 2019, all apps that use native code must provide a 64-bit version in addition to the 32-bit version in order to publish an update. This past January, we reiterated that this is required in order to make way for innovation and in anticipation of future Android devices that only support 64-bit code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the deadline approaches, we wanted to remind you that at least one of your apps* uses native code but does not currently offer a 64-bit variant\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis illustrates for me one of the big problems with mobile development: that app was perfectly fine when I last deployed it in 2018 and now even though I haven\u0026rsquo;t changed anything, there\u0026rsquo;s additional work that needs to be done. I guess I\u0026rsquo;m too used to web development where we just deploy the app on a server and the server architecture doesn\u0026rsquo;t suddenly change for no reason. With mobile apps, the platforms and APIs and frameworks change quickly, leading to situations where even if your app doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any pending changes, you need to do some work on it anyway. (Granted, this can also happen with webservers due to security patches and such, but with managed hosting, that\u0026rsquo;s not something you worry about as often, and the resolution is often straightforward!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I was about to be out of the country on vacation for more than a month, I put this off and only started looking at it when I got back. Luckily, I did actually also have some minor revisions to do on the app, so I would do all the work in one go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it turns out, the version of RN I was using was too old and did not support providing the 64-bit version. I had to upgrade to a later version of RN, and after reviewing the process, it seemed like a nontrivial amount of work. There was an upgrade tool, but because I was so many versions behind, it couldn\u0026rsquo;t work directly. The problem seems to be in the initial boilerplate created by \u003ccode\u003ereact-native init\u003c/code\u003e for the ios and android subprojects; the older boilerplate was out of date and needed to be updated, which was not straightforward given that you may have modified that boilerplate afterwards. I had to use some kind of diff tool to manually find the differences in the boilerplate and merge the changes manually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat seemed like a lot of work, and the app wasn\u0026rsquo;t that large and didn\u0026rsquo;t have that much code, so I figured it was more straightforward to just create a new RN project from scratch, which would be using the latest version of RN (0.60.3, from 0.50.4). Afterwards, I port over the project code into the new project, them swap the new project back into the old project\u0026rsquo;s repo. That way I only had to update the few dependencies I was using in the project itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was still a nontrivial amount of work, but I eventually got everything working through many iterations of trial-and-error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI went ahead and upgraded the dependencies to the latest versions as well, to make sure there was no conflict with the new RN version\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReactNavigation had some backward incompatible changes:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eneeded to \u003ca href=\"https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/getting-started.html#installation\"\u003einitialize the gesture handler\u003c/a\u003e in the java class\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003enew function \u003ccode\u003ecreateStackNavigator\u003c/code\u003e instead of just \u003ccode\u003eStackNavigator\u003c/code\u003e constructor\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eneeded to use \u003ccode\u003ecreateAppContainer\u003c/code\u003e to initialize the navigator\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esome components such as WebView and AsyncStorage were no longer part of RN core and had to be imported accordingly\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAndroid now requires that I explicitly prompt for the \u003ccode\u003eREAD_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\u003c/code\u003e permission when trying to access the camera roll\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGoogle now recommends that I provide an upload key for encryption, but since I reset the project, I also accidentally deleted the signing key I was using before. Oops! Momentary panic until I have the sense to do a search and realize that past me was wise enough to backup the file elsewhere.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTest that I can create the app bundle successfully.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy this point I more or less had a working Android build, then shifted over to iOS. Since I only \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/macbook-air-2017-model/\"\u003erecently got a Macbook Air\u003c/a\u003e, I actually hadn\u0026rsquo;t tried creating and publishing the iOS build, someone was helping me with that part before. Because of reasons, I wanted/had to do it myself this time around, so a bit of a learning curve and trial-and-error again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eclone the project from repo, \u003ccode\u003enpm install\u003c/code\u003e, try \u003ccode\u003ereact-native run-ios\u003c/code\u003e, oops missing dependencies\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efind out about CocoaPods. Clone a fresh copy of the project, \u003ccode\u003enpm install\u003c/code\u003e then \u003ccode\u003epod install\u003c/code\u003e (took a while), then try \u003ccode\u003ereact-native run-ios\u003c/code\u003e again\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eneeded to fix some dependencies I was using by manual linking and updating\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ecamera roll also needed to be added to the podfile (a config I possibly lost when I reset the project)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efix a bunch of configs before I can actually run and test the app in the simulator\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSuccess!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, I make my other app changes and test on both my Android phone and the iOS simulator. The changes are easy, so now to try publishing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTry to publish and upload to iTunesConnect. Takes me a few tries to figure out that I need to be updating stuff like bundle identifier, version number, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eiTunesConnect has some new requirements too (like the iPad version needs to support all orientations) which causes a couple more iterations\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emore screenshots are now required when submitting the app!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI set up TestFlight and verify everything is ok with the published app. (I only tested using the simulator before)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eiOS app now submitted and \u0026ldquo;Waiting for Review\u0026rdquo;. I anticipate they will have some ridiculous request and it might take me a couple more submission rounds before I can publish\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGoogle Play is more straightforward. \u003ccode\u003egradlew releaseBundle\u003c/code\u003e is already working after my previous effort, so I just upload the bundle and distribute.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see no indication that I have satisfied Google\u0026rsquo;s action item, but it let me publish the update without complaints, so I\u0026rsquo;m done!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy initial estimate that the work was nontrivial ends up correct, I spent way more manhours than I expected on the upgrade. Part of it was learning how to do the iOS deployment, so hopefully that ends up easier in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
