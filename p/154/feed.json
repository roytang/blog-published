I\u0026rsquo;d suggest starting with minor UI bugs, those tend to be easiest to figure out since a text search of the source will often point you to where the correction needs to be made. For example, if the bug is that a particular error message is being shown under the wrong conditions, you can use a text search to find where the error message is declared, then trace all the code points that generate that message, figure out which one you need to update (probably by trial and error) and fix accordingly\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",
