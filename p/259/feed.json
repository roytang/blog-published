Hopefully I finish this series before the reviews become too out of date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBatman\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to read every book of the New 52 to widen my horizons regarding my comic book reading, and one of the greatest advantages has been exposure to Scott Snyder\u0026rsquo;s work. I have a tendency not to remember writers and artists of comics I read, except for the very famous ones, so I wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware that I had read his work before during the Black Mirror arc in \u003cem\u003eDetective Comics\u003c/em\u003e pre-New 52. But he\u0026rsquo;s quickly become one of my favorite writers to date, with his work on Batman quickly bringing me to appreciate his work on other books like \u003cem\u003eSwamp Thing\u003c/em\u003e and the phenomenal \u003cem\u003eAmerican Vampire\u003c/em\u003e. His writing on Batman is up there with those other books. He\u0026rsquo;s introduced a whole new mythos and underbelly to Gotham, adding a new dimension to Batman\u0026rsquo;s fight to keep his city sane. And the artwork by Greg Capullo  is simply fantastic, an awesome backup to Snyder\u0026rsquo;s plots. Capullo is another creative whom I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have encountered if not for the New 52, his work previously been mostly Image-related. The excellent creative team easily makes \u003cem\u003eBatman\u003c/em\u003e my favorite of the DC New 52 so far (it helps that I\u0026rsquo;m quite the Batman fan.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDetective Comics\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetective isn\u0026rsquo;t the best, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay. The art is above average, I kinda like it, though it smells a bit like the usual gritty comic-book art I\u0026rsquo;ve grown up with. The story lines so far have involved the Dollmaker and the Penguin, and they involve a lot of Batman knocking around thugs to get information. The stories are always narrated in Batman\u0026rsquo;s third person voice which gives it a weird edge. Not sure what\u0026rsquo;s the final fate of the Joker, based on what happened to him at the start of the book. The book is promising, but needs to show something excellent to gain attention. Still, it\u0026rsquo;s not like DC\u0026rsquo;s gonna cut the titular Detective Comics, so neither am I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBatman: The Dark Knight\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBatman seems to be the Wolverine of DC Comics: he has a lot of his own books, and he even makes appearances in other books to help shore up their popularity (see: \u003cem\u003eHawk and Dove, I Vampire\u003c/em\u003e) . As a Batman fan I\u0026rsquo;m glad to read more Bat-stories, but the character might just be stretched a little bit too thin. And if we had to cut one Batman book from the New 52, I\u0026rsquo;d choose this one (we certainly can\u0026rsquo;t cut any of the other three). \u003cem\u003eBatman: The Dark Knight\u003c/em\u003e‘s storyline so far has involved a mysterious white rabbit and a hodgepodge of Batman\u0026rsquo;s enemies escaped from the asylum. Seriously, there\u0026rsquo;s a new one every issue: Two-Face in #2, Clayface as  Joker in #3, Deathstroke in #4, Scarecrow in #5, Venom in #6 and #7, Mad Hatter in #8. Then there\u0026rsquo;s the cameos by Flash, Superman and Wonder Woman. It\u0026rsquo;s like the writer finally got to his dream of drawing Batman and just wants to play with all the characters he can use. It\u0026rsquo;s not really a bad thing, but I\u0026rsquo;d appreciate more story arcs that didn\u0026rsquo;t just involve Batman punching a new supervillain every month. The art is so-so and reminds me of every guy who ever graduated from the Kubert school. The style is very much the same. The book is ok, I\u0026rsquo;d keep reading it if it were around, but probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t miss it if they cut it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBatman and Robin\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat makes the current combination of Batman and Robin interesting is that unlike Bruce\u0026rsquo;s relationship with the previous Robins Dick and Tim (and even Jason) where having a partner was seen to improve Batman\u0026rsquo;s temperament and bring a lighter side to the superhero team, in Damian\u0026rsquo;s case he\u0026rsquo;s very much as grim as his father what with the whole being raised by assassins bit. And we get exactly what we can expect \u0026ndash; Bruce trying to teach Damian how to become a better person despite his upbringing and despite forces around them trying to bring Damian down into the dark side. The art is a bit uneven but it works, and the book is well worth the read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBatgirl\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a bit controversial when they revealed Barbara Gordon would be getting her legs back with the reboot. Oracle had been a staple of the Batman family for so long that fans would surely miss her, not to mention the fans of previous Batgirls Cass Cain and Stephanie Brown (neither of which have been seen in action in the New 52). While the events of \u003cem\u003eThe Killing Joke\u003c/em\u003e haven\u0026rsquo;t been retconned away (Barbara explicitly recalls the shooting incident in several flashbacks), they haven\u0026rsquo;t explained yet as of this writing the \u0026ldquo;miracle\u0026rdquo; that gave Barbara back the use of her legs. The current storylines haven\u0026rsquo;t been particularly exciting; I think I enjoyed Stephanie\u0026rsquo;s schoolgirl problems more, but they\u0026rsquo;re entertaining enough I suppose. The art is okay, if not a bit too shiny. Will continue reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBatwing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like Batwing if only for the fact that a superhero from Africa has his own titular book. Most of the first story arc (which spans the first eight books) takes place in Africa and delves into the history of superheroes on that continent. It also shows a bit of what life is like under the grip of African warlords. The exposure to something non-American is nice, although the story arc manages to drag itself over to Gotham for the finale (and it looks like Batwing is going to become part of \u003cem\u003eJustice League International\u003c/em\u003e‘s roster). The art style is crisp, unique and refreshing, I approve of this book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBatwoman\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really like the artwork here and the panel layouts. They all feel so crisp and I love paging through them. The stories are okay, except that they don\u0026rsquo;t put enough effort towards the accessibility of the character. I\u0026rsquo;ve read some of Batwoman\u0026rsquo;s history before so I know a bit what she\u0026rsquo;s about, but this book mostly just dives straight in and expects the reader to \u0026ldquo;get it\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s nice that Batwoman doesn\u0026rsquo;t end up as one of Batman\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;formal\u0026rdquo; allies. Instead she ends up working with a certain government agency. (This book is also not part of the Night of Owls crossover I think). However, I find some story details a bit tough to follow, not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s because of the unusual layouts or the lack of introductory detail \u0026ndash; I find myself having to read each issue one more time to get most of the details. They\u0026rsquo;re usually worth it though, and this is a book I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep following.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNightwing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story arcs so far dig into Dick\u0026rsquo;s background with the Haly Circus, something I haven\u0026rsquo;t been too familiar with before. Near the end of the first eight books it ties in to the Batman Court of Owls storyline, adding a deeper back story to Haly\u0026rsquo;s Circus than previous story lines had shown. The book is interesting and the art is okay, though it\u0026rsquo;s not one of the titles I feel like I have to read immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCatwoman\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis book has trouble keeping my interest. It\u0026rsquo;s mostly Catwoman getting into thieving hijinks (and occasionally having sex with the Batman). Well, at least the story gives us a different perspective of life on Gotham\u0026rsquo;s streets. The art isn\u0026rsquo;t spectacular, but it\u0026rsquo;s not bad. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably keep reading it, at lower priority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBirds of Prey\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve never read the previous \u003cem\u003eBirds of Prey\u003c/em\u003e series, so I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how this compares, but the book is interesting enough. I like the team\u0026rsquo;s variety \u0026ndash; there\u0026rsquo;s one of Batman\u0026rsquo;s archvillains here, Black Canary is always cool, I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sure Katana is sane, and I like the way Starling handles things. The art is passable, though not really standing out for me. No reason to drop this title.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRed Hood and the Outlaws\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis series kicked off with a bit of controversy regarding the mangling of Starfire\u0026rsquo;s character. In fact it confused me a bit with Starfire\u0026rsquo;s vague recollections of being with Dick Grayson; I\u0026rsquo;m not sure whether the New Teen Titans era exists in the New 52 (the \u003cem\u003eTeen Titans\u003c/em\u003e book seems to imply that the New 52 incarnation is the first one). Despite the problems with Starfire\u0026rsquo;s characterizations, I\u0026rsquo;ve found the stories so far pretty interesting. The plots mostly delves into Jason Todd\u0026rsquo;s background and what happened to him between the time he was brought back by the League of Assassins and when he resurfaced as the Red Hood. The art is pretty good, it\u0026rsquo;s probably one of my favorite in the entire New 52. It\u0026rsquo;s nice and shiny and not too conventional. This is one of the books I read immediately when it comes out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUgh, these reviews are taking longer to write than I thought. Next up: Superman and Green Lantern.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Not to say I dislike him either. I\u0026rsquo;ve never met the man, I don\u0026rsquo;t personally know anything about his family. All I know is what I\u0026rsquo;ve heard reported in the news, media, etc. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to hold my judgment until the end of the trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst: yes, the prosecution was terrible. Rushed impeachment complaint, bringing charges that are near-impossible to prove (\u0026ldquo;bias\u0026rdquo;? =/) fishing expeditions, \u0026ldquo;evidence\u0026rdquo; mysteriously appearing given by \u0026ldquo;unknown sources\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s all kinds of shady. To be honest, if the defense had rested their case right after the prosecution finished, they might have gotten a better outcome than this, maybe even won, who knows. The prosecution had next to nothing before the defense made their presentation. All they had were dollar accounts inaccessible to them, and the properties being declared with market value rather than acquisition cost. The defense made so many mistakes, it\u0026rsquo;s facepalm-worthy. Calling a hostile witness to the stand without knowing what she would bring, calling irrelevant witnesses, arguing that the foreign currency act restricted Corona himself from disclosing the dollar accounts; Cuevas (or whoever pushed for it) should be disbarred for even arguing that last one. They really had only one thing they had to explain, the co-mingled funds in the peso account issue. And even that they weren\u0026rsquo;t able to explain, with nothing to back up Corona\u0026rsquo;s explanation: no bank documents, no paper trail, none of the family members testifying that some of the funds were there, nothing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only things Corona brought with his testimony were ad hominem attacks, appeals to sympathy, appeals to authority and drama. While I don\u0026rsquo;t care if those arguments are presented to the media or via press conferences I couldn\u0026rsquo;t care less, but for the chief justice himself, the head of the judiciary, to be making such arguments in a quasi-legal proceeding? It boggles the mind, to be claiming that the prosecution is bringing forth charges without evidence, when your arguments consist of a conspiracy theory involving an unrelated agrarian reform case and the state of mind of your grandchild. Ugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be honest, I was already leaning against the CJ the moment he accepted the midnight appointment from Gloria Arroyo. That was a terrible, terrible thing to do. You can say that technically it was legal and the Supreme Court upheld it but whatever. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that we should be supportive of public servants just because they adhere to the minimum standards set by the law. I believe that with public office being a public trust, public servants should be held to a higher standard than ordinary citizens, even more so those who hold the highest positions in our land. Higher standards of integrity and delicadeza. Public servants should be like caesar\u0026rsquo;s wife: beyond any suspicion.  To accept that midnight appointment, while ruled to be technically legal, while it could not be proven to be for the benefit of GMA, was a terribly unethical decision for someone who should be the epitome of legal ethics. It would have been so easy to say \u0026ldquo;No, this is not right, I will not accept this nomination, I will not degrade the position of Chief Justice\u0026rdquo; and thus to end his career honorably (possibly even be chosen as the CJ at a later date). But pride, ambition, loyalty, whatever, he still chose to accept it, and it led to his downfall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interpretation of the FCBD act and the SALN law to his benefit is another example, an indicator of a preference of adhering to the letter of the law rather than the spirit of the law; of placing more importance to a law whose purpose was to encourage dollar savings than to a law that promotes transparency and good government. Is that the sort of shining example we want to give to the judiciary, that they should be placing their personal interests above those of the country?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd rushing out of the trial, claiming a low blood sugar attack, conveniently right after he dramatically calls for waivers from his \u0026ldquo;political opponents\u0026rdquo;, then coming back in a wheelchair looking dazed to try to get sympathy (what, there were no sugar sources anywhere in the senate building?). There\u0026rsquo;s no way to disprove the claim or to show it was staged (even though he had time to shake hands with some people on his way out of the courtroom), but you have to wonder if the CJ himself would allow that sort of shenanigans if he was presiding over the court. Not a very good example either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were very few real winners in this trial, but a clear one has to be the Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile. Despite all the incompetence of the related parties, he did the best job he could, presiding over a very fair trial, calling it straight down the middle down to the very end. Respect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, time for a lesson in bad arguments (mostly for internet commenters): \u0026ldquo;Let he who is without sin cast the first stone\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; this is a logical fallacy called \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;Tu quoque\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e, a form of ad hominem. While this is great for bibilical parables, probably not the best argument to cite for legal proceedings. Sure, a whole lot of the accusers themselves are probably corrupt or misdeclaring their SALNs or whatever. Impeach them too. Impeach them all if we have to. (Fortunately for the president, incompetence is not an impeachable offense\u0026hellip; yet.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s my 2 cents. Now can we move on? We still have to prepare for the next circus, it\u0026rsquo;s coming in May 2013.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re reading this, that means I\u0026rsquo;ve done it: I\u0026rsquo;ve read the first eight issues of every DC New 52 book. I\u0026rsquo;ve always been a Marvel fan more than DC, my previous DC reading having been restricted to JLA and the Batman books, so I figured exposure to the New 52 would widen my appreciation of the DC stable of heroes. Here are my reviews:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJustice League\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the art is Jim Lee-fantastic, the first story arc left much to be desired. It was basically a meet-and-greet where we\u0026rsquo;re introduced to the team members and after a while they knock Darkseid back down a boom tube. Nothing overly complicated, and it would be okay for an introductory arc if it didn\u0026rsquo;t take six issues to get to that point. (By comparison, Morrison\u0026rsquo;s far more interesting White Martian arc that launched the JLA book in 1997 finished in four issues). The characters aren\u0026rsquo;t particularly fleshed out, which is fine. Justice League books have always been more about the powers and big epic battles than serious characterization, though hopefully Geoff Johns can sneak in something more than a \u0026ldquo;Hal Jordan is shallow\u0026rdquo; joke every once in a while. They\u0026rsquo;re starting a new story arc with issue #9, and based on the FCBD DC New 52 book, they have a Trinity War story arc coming up next year, so hopefully the book picks up the pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJustice League International\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReading this book feels like watching the animated Justice League Unlimited series. That\u0026rsquo;s where I was first introduced to some of the characters like Fire, Ice, Vixen and Booster Gold. Booster is a great character, and while he doesn\u0026rsquo;t have his own New 52 book, it\u0026rsquo;s nice seeing him take the helm in this one. The art here isn\u0026rsquo;t exceptional and like Justice League the story is more about the powers than the characters but at least the pacing is better than the Justice League book. Guy Gardner\u0026rsquo;s problems with Booster are a nice touch, but it\u0026rsquo;s kind of overkill to have started this book with Batman as part of the team in the main story arc; I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if Batwing will be taking his place in the team after issue 8.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAquaman\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s nice that the book is really meta about Aquaman\u0026rsquo;s status as a Justice League member, implying he\u0026rsquo;s the butt of jokes even in the actual DC universe. The stories so far have been entertaining, and the characterization of Arthur and Mera have been okay; Johns\u0026rsquo; writing is better here than in Justice League so far. The art looks nice, though not spectacular. The ongoing \u0026ldquo;The Others\u0026rdquo; storyline seems to have promise, hopefully we\u0026rsquo;ll see some epic Aquaman arcs. Not sure if I miss the hook from Peter David\u0026rsquo;s days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWonder Woman\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe art style here is weird and unusual, but I kinda like it. The storyline so far has dealt mainly with Greek myth stuff and has made significant changes to Diana\u0026rsquo;s origins linking her more to the Olympus pantheon. It\u0026rsquo;s a good read especially if you\u0026rsquo;re into all the mythological references.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Flash\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry Allen is back as the only Flash in the DCnU, though we\u0026rsquo;ll see how long that lasts. The first story arc was ok, showing us some details of how Barry interacts with Iris West and the police, while the second story arc brings us some new details on how The Flash interacts with The Speed Force in the DCnU. The art is okay, I like it a bit better than Aquaman. The only obvious question at the moment is: where is Wally West?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCaptain Atom\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far the art on this book hasn\u0026rsquo;t been very appealing to me. The story line is a lot of \u0026ldquo;oh no, I\u0026rsquo;m having trouble controlling my powers and the norms don\u0026rsquo;t trust me\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what his range of powers were pre-New 52, but the way it\u0026rsquo;s described here he\u0026rsquo;s basically able to do anything, including time travel, matter transformation, etc. Anything except FIND LOVE. The book is meh, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mind losing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Fury of Firestorm\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI seem to remember that there was a previous Firestorm incarnation where it was two people trapped in the same body. It\u0026rsquo;s different this time around, they have two teenagers who are both Firestorms, each with a different power set. (Only one of them can do transmutation, et cetera). Additionally, they can combine into a bigger, badder Firestorm! Also, other countries have Firestorms too, albeit most are flawed versions. Firestorms seem to be kinda like nukes here. The art is nothing to write home about. The book is ok I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGreen Arrow\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUgh, the art is mediocre and the storylines are uninteresting and feel unnecessarily convoluted, especially the latest one. Oliver Queen here is shallow and uninteresting, playing out the lazy heir to a fortune while secretly fighting crime in a costume. I think we already have one of those (Batman, and he\u0026rsquo;s already pretty overexposed), so Green Arrow needs some way to differentiate himself. So far he hasn\u0026rsquo;t shown any of the grit or social consciousness that was characteristic of the previous incarnation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Savage Hawkman\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe art here is a bit unusual, but I kind of like it. The storyline revolves around Carter Hall and his archaeological pals accidentally unleashing some sort of evil alien that had previously been trapped on Earth. There\u0026rsquo;s some changes to his powers as well, as the Nth metal which enables him being Hawkman is now ‘bonded\u0026rsquo; to his body such that he can transform into Hawkman at will (sort of like how Iron Man\u0026rsquo;s current armor is just nanomachines in his body). Well okay, I\u0026rsquo;m not exactly sure how the previous incarnations worked, but my impression was that the Nth metal was just a harness he put on. It\u0026rsquo;s still unknown how Carter Hall in this universe is related to Katar Hol, the Thanagarian who was previously Hawkman, or whether we\u0026rsquo;re going to see Hawkgirl/Shayera anytime soon, but this series has potential.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOk, I can\u0026rsquo;t do everything all in one post, so let\u0026rsquo;s save some for later. For the curious, I\u0026rsquo;m doing these in \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_52\"\u003eWikipedia order\u003c/a\u003e, which means the Batman family will be in part 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "If you\u0026rsquo;re reading this, that means I\u0026rsquo;ve done it: I\u0026rsquo;ve read the first eight issues of every DC New 52 book. I\u0026rsquo;ve always been a Marvel fan more than DC, my previous DC reading having been restricted to JLA and the Batman books, so I figured exposure to the New 52 would widen my appreciation of the DC stable of heroes. Here are my reviews:\nJustice League\nWhile the art is Jim Lee-fantastic, the first story arc left much to be desired.",
