I found young Scott\u0026rsquo;s trying to wrap his head around mobile phones, bottled water and $5 magazines particularly amusing. The artist duties are temporarily handled by David Marquez (with Immonen still doing the cover) and he does a pretty good job of it too; the panels during the intro sequence with Jean and Logan are very well done. Bendis handles the Angel meet-up well, and Kitty and Storm quickly bond with young Jean\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDaredevil #22 \u003c/strong\u003egives us the first encounter between the new Superior Spider-Man and our favorite blind lawyer slash vigilante. Not even Daredevil\u0026rsquo;s hyper-senses are enough to see through the change in Spider-Man (though the dialogue does give him suspicion!) and as heroes do when they cross paths, they are at each others\u0026rsquo; throats at first. But the convenient appearance of an old enemy breaks their battle and forces them into a team up. Spidey and DD manage to patch things up, and later DD tries to patch things up with another partner\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew Avengers #2\u003c/strong\u003e continues Hickman\u0026rsquo;s epic Illuminati story with Reed Richards himself giving us a quick rundown of the multiverse-level crisis our heroes face. Hickman\u0026rsquo;s large-scale scifi storytelling is in full effect here as the heroes consider the terrible options laid out for them; I\u0026rsquo;m curious how this book will intersect with Hickman\u0026rsquo;s ongoing saga over in \u003cem\u003eAvengers\u003c/em\u003e though.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
