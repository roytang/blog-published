We get a glimpse of Cyborg\u0026rsquo;s current relationship with his father Clark and Diana on a date in secret identity mode and later saving people together mode (with Lois looking on wistfully maybe?) and a bit of a team-up between Batman, Aquaman and Mera in Gotham as the initial opening salvo of the Atlantis invasion begins. The story continues in \u003cem\u003eAquaman\u003c/em\u003e and sadly yes, you probably have to be reading both books to follow this little storyline but at least it looks like it\u0026rsquo;s going to be worth it and will help define a new status quo for the League in the run-up to 2013\u0026rsquo;s Trinity War. No Flash or Green Lantern appearances this month though (they\u0026rsquo;re pretty busy!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Shazam backup story in Justice League continues this month and leaves us looking forward to the next issue as Black Adam finally catches up with Billy!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are some of the DC and Image books I read last week (the week before Christmas):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSaga #8 (Image)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you ask anyone who follows the comics scene what\u0026rsquo;s currently the best ongoing series then you\u0026rsquo;re going to get a lot of \u0026ldquo;Saga Saga Saga Saga Saga Saga Saga Saga Saga Saga Saga Saga\u0026rdquo;! Brian K Vaughn\u0026rsquo;s newest series, brought to life by the excellent Fiona Staples artwork has me excited to read it whenever it\u0026rsquo;s out. Part space opera, part Romeo and Juliet, part sci-fi vs fantasy, part \u0026ldquo;How I Met Your Mother\u0026rdquo;, the series has a little bit of something for everyone. In this issue, BKV fleshes out Marko\u0026rsquo;s parents a bit more, Marko and his mom fight a giant creature with weird balls, trying to find their ghost babysitter, and the cliffhanger brings back someone from Marko\u0026rsquo;s past. Looking forward to the next issue!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNightwing #15\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eRed Hood and the Outlaws #15\u003c/strong\u003e (Death of the Family tie-ins)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s still a bit ridiculous how Joker has the time to be in all the Bat-books to harass the Batman family, but that\u0026rsquo;s comics for you ain\u0026rsquo;t it? The interesting bit about the Nightwing book is that Joker busted Raya out of prison so that Dick has to take her down, implying strongly that he \u003cem\u003edoes\u003c/em\u003e know who Nightwing is (and hence the rest of the family) despite Batman\u0026rsquo;s denials. Looks like we\u0026rsquo;re getting a showdown at Haley\u0026rsquo;s circus next month, we\u0026rsquo;ll see how this affects Dick\u0026rsquo;s plans to rehabilitate Amusement Mile. To be honest the Nightwing book has been a bit boring to me, making it not always high on the read pile. Hopefully after the DotF tie-in we get some change in the status quo to make the book more exciting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the RHATO issue the highlights are basically Jason being able to take down the GCPD while wearing only a towel and Joker revealing his role in Jason\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;upbringing\u0026rdquo; so to speak. I haven\u0026rsquo;t been that big a fan of RHATO since Ken Rocafort left this book to work on \u003cem\u003eSuperman\u003c/em\u003e, but I am looking forward to what Scott Lobdell does when he crosses over Arsenal/Starfire with the \u003cem\u003eTeen Titans \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGreen Lantern #15 \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003eGreen Lantern New Guardians #15 \u003c/strong\u003e(Rise of the Third Army tie-in)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eGreen Lantern \u003c/em\u003efinally shows us proof of Baz\u0026rsquo;s innocence in the terror attack, and with a federal agent at the scene hopefully it gets him cleared. But more importantly, someone from the Green Lantern Corps finally gets in touch with Baz! In New Guardians, Kyle takes on Larfreeze to add the color orange to his arsenal! Seriously, I\u0026rsquo;m not too excited about this whole Kyle learning to be a rainbow lantern thing, I hope they wrap it up soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least they finally encountered the third army, and with the GLC being aware of the Guardian\u0026rsquo;s madness hopefully things start moving along in this Green Lantern crossover next month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWonder Woman #15\u003c/strong\u003e - the most significant thing about this issue is that it\u0026rsquo;s the first appearance of Orion of the New Gods in the New 52! (That and I\u0026rsquo;ve finally caught up with reading Wonder Woman) The issue also implies that the New Gods have been aware of Earth for a while now and that Orion is a regular visitor, with his own contacts and all (but one of them is a hobo). Of course, when Diana and Orion meet for the first time they slug it out for a bit (seems to be the standard for two superheroes meeting each other for the first time). The series has been great so far, and mostly stand alone from the rest of the new 52 too. I like the scenes were Hela has to deal with being mortal now lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupergirl #15 \u003c/strong\u003e(He\u0026rsquo;l on Earth) - ugh this crossover has been so boring/mediocre and I feel like Kara is being really stupid in following this He\u0026rsquo;l person around. But then again, we\u0026rsquo;re 15 issues in and she still doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand Earth, still doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand who Superman is and basically still hasn\u0026rsquo;t been able to accept the destruction of Krypton. So it\u0026rsquo;s really a problem of the Supergirl book being unable to settle into a status quo yet. Maybe after this whole crossover concludes we\u0026rsquo;ll finally get that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were also a ton of other DC books I didn\u0026rsquo;t read this week: Blue Beetle (I think this is ending?), Batwoman (art here is still great-looking, seems I should catch up on this), Catwoman (should I even care about this?), Legion of Super Heroes (this book is entertaining, but with so many characters, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to get invested in). I grew up as a Marvel fan, but DC seriously needs to work harder on making their books more interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Peter is at a pretty good point in his personal life: he has a good, fulfilling job at Horizon Labs so he doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to miss the bills, Aunt May is well taken care of by Jameson Sr. so he doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about her all the time, and there were even some signs of how he and Mary Jane still cared so deeply for each other. After everything Peter had given to the world as Spider-Man, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too much to ask for him to pass the baton to someone else and ride off into the sunset to live happily ever after (maybe after foiling one last big supervillain plot of course). Peter could still make occasional appearances as a mentor or tech supplier for whoever would be the new Spider-Man. It would be a well-deserved rest and retirement for someone who has had to bear so much responsibility for the past 50 years of \u003cem\u003eAmazing Spider-Man,\u003c/em\u003e an ideal fantasy ending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlas, when I read ASM #698, the opening shot of the Dying Wish story arc that would end the book, I knew that it would remain just that: a fantasy. The powers-that-be (meaning Spider-man scribe Dan Slott and the Marvel editorial team) had prescribed a darker ending for the dearly beloved Spider-Man hero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0026rsquo;ve probably read all about it on the internet by now. The ending of \u003cem\u003eAmazing Spider-Man\u003c/em\u003e has been one of the most (if not the most) controversial and divisive story lines not only for the year but maybe for the entirety of the \u003cem\u003eAmazing Spider-Man \u003c/em\u003erun, with the only other possible contender being the deal with the devil in the much-criticized One More Day story arc back in 2007. The difference between 2007 and 2012 is of course the internet is more widely spread and the creators are more accessible, specifically current series writer Dan Slott who is very open and active on Twitter. Many fans have not reacted well to the controversial ending of Dying Wish and the identity of the new Superior Spider-Man, with many lashing out in forums and reddit and social media, some directly threatening Dan Slott via his twitter account. I doubt One More Day writer JMS ever had this amount of vitriol thrown at him over the internet at that time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fan reaction is understandable (though the threats aren\u0026rsquo;t) - Peter Parker was a well-loved character and to give him an ending like this can feel like a betrayal to fans who have been rooting for him all these years. But not all stories have a happy ending. Sometimes the hero doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it against the overwhelming odds. Sometimes he doesn\u0026rsquo;t get the ending he deserves. Sometimes the villain doesn\u0026rsquo;t get his comeuppance. And maybe, just maybe, sometimes the villain gets the chance to play the hero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd understandably after reading \u003cstrong\u003eAmazing Spider-Man #700 \u003c/strong\u003ea lot of people are not planning to pick up the upcoming Superior Spider-Man series, the same way a number of people stopped reading ASM after One More Day. And that\u0026rsquo;s fine; not all stories are for everybody, and for some readers all they want is to read more Peter Parker as Spider-Man; they don\u0026rsquo;t want to read about some villain pretending to be Spider-Man. As comic book fans, we all know that eventually Peter Parker will find his way back to us somehow (if only because he has a movie coming out in 2014!), but for now it\u0026rsquo;s the end of Peter\u0026rsquo;s story and someone else takes over. If one doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to read stories about that, then it\u0026rsquo;s fine and that frees your comics dollars to maybe pick up something new and just come back when Peter eventually does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for the rest of us, the ones who want to keep reading, \u003cstrong\u003eAvenging Spiderman #15.1 \u003c/strong\u003epicks up where ASM 700 left off and gives us a glimpse of the new Spider-Man\u0026rsquo;s persona, leading into \u003cstrong\u003eSuperior Spider-Man #1\u003c/strong\u003e on the second week of January. There are many more stories to be told and to be read and to be enjoyed. And if we don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy them? Then Peter would be coming back sooner than we\u0026rsquo;d expect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m curious as to where Slott will take our new hero. Will his be a tale of redemption, of making up for past wrongs? Will he strive to be the hero Peter was and even surpass him, in order to justify his \u0026ldquo;Superior\u0026rdquo; title? How much influence will Peter have over the new pilot? (We\u0026rsquo;ve already seen Peter\u0026rsquo;s instincts and muscle memory reflect in the new protagonist) Will Carlie and/or heaven forbid the Trapster eventually figure things out? Will icky things happen to MJ? Slott says they still have a few tricks up their sleeves and that fans should stay tuned to \u003cem\u003eSuperior Spider-Man\u003c/em\u003e. But the new book and the new protagonist have a high standard to live up to and surpass if they are to be worthy of being called \u0026ldquo;Superior\u0026rdquo;. Let\u0026rsquo;s see where this ride takes us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "When I first heard about Amazing Spider-Man ending and being replaced by a new Superior Spider-Man series starring someone other than Peter Parker, my first thought was: maybe they\u0026rsquo;re finally retiring Peter for good. Peter is at a pretty good point in his personal life: he has a good, fulfilling job at Horizon Labs so he doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to miss the bills, Aunt May is well taken care of by Jameson Sr.",
