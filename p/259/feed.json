This issue ends with the new team starting the rescue mission, hopefully we\u0026rsquo;re in for an action-packed third issue.

This issue focuses more on present-day Thor as he tries to track down the god butcher and all he finds are more victims. Hard to predict how Jason Aaron plans to end this thing, since the god butcher is still around at the time of future Thor, we can only assume that Thor either loses (not likely, since that means his death) or he won\u0026rsquo;t be able to come up with a permanent solution. Ribic\u0026rsquo;s pencils and Svorcina\u0026rsquo;s colors seem to be getting more epic with each issue, I\u0026rsquo;ll just leave you with a quick taste:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#93d3d33421a8aa2c83ca93e16daee22c-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2012/12/last-week-in-marvel-now-avengers-thor-all-new-x-men-and-others/thor3_hub5bbb0ccd1fe4044c2b93c694240a276_684260_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"93d3d33421a8aa2c83ca93e16daee22c-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2012/12/last-week-in-marvel-now-avengers-thor-all-new-x-men-and-others/thor3.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"23 Dec 2012 4:57pm\"\u003e23 Dec 2012 4:57pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll-New X-Men #4 \u003c/strong\u003ewas a bit disappointing for me though still pretty good.

Of course it\u0026rsquo;s already amazing that we\u0026rsquo;re at issue 4 when Marvel NOW! isn\u0026rsquo;t even two months old! That being said, Bendis and Immonen are still doing great here in terms of some excellent dialogue and panels and I\u0026rsquo;m still eagerly looking forward to the next issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust some quick hits for the other Marvel NOW! releases this week: \u003cstrong\u003eIndestructible Hulk #2 \u003c/strong\u003esees a skeptical Tony Stark visiting Banner at his new SHIELD laboratories (Tony has been visiting a lot of people recently) and there\u0026rsquo;s a funny panel where Tony tries to reinforce his self-confidence after witnessing just how much of a genius Banner is. This issue doesn\u0026rsquo;t really build up to any story arc but rather cements Banner\u0026rsquo;s role as a SHIELD guy especially with regards to Tony. \u003cstrong\u003eFF #2 \u003c/strong\u003esees an attack on the Baxter Building right after the original Four supposedly should have returned but didn\u0026rsquo;t, and the substitute Four gets to show off a bit. The first two issues of both \u003cem\u003eFantastic Four \u003c/em\u003eand this book actually form the introductory story arc, broken across the two books so it\u0026rsquo;s better to be following both. Fraction\u0026rsquo;s writing is ok so far, but I\u0026rsquo;m not really a fan of Allred\u0026rsquo;s art style though I know a lot of people are. \u003cstrong\u003eAvengers Arena #2 \u003c/strong\u003etells me that we should be expecting issues focusing on each of Arcade\u0026rsquo;s 16 battle royale contestants which is good - a lot of them look unfamiliar and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure whether this is their first series. This issue focuses on Deathlocket, who\u0026rsquo;s apprently the daughter of the guy who invents the Deathloks. We also get another death in this issue, but it\u0026rsquo;s one of the new kids and feels a bit like a throwaway. I\u0026rsquo;m still iffy on this series, but let\u0026rsquo;s see where Hopeless takes it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m kind of \u0026ldquo;meh\u0026rdquo; overall on the last three books I\u0026rsquo;m reviewing, they haven\u0026rsquo;t really wowed me so far.\u003cstrong\u003e Cable and X-Force #2 \u003c/strong\u003egives us a more solid look and what\u0026rsquo;s going on and how their team came together, but we still have no idea how they got to the point where the Uncanny Avengers needed to be taking them in. Cable is apparently having prophetic visions of disaster and supposedly this is going to lead the team to more shenanigans. \u003cstrong\u003eThunderbolts #2 \u003c/strong\u003efollows a mostly boring first issue, but gives us a better idea of the kind of missions Ross has in mind for his team. The artwork isn\u0026rsquo;t the best, it seems like the artist is using the same outlines for every unmasked face; there\u0026rsquo;s a panel where Ross just looks like Punisher (in the same panel) except painted red. This is my first time with Steve Dillon\u0026rsquo;s work and I\u0026rsquo;m not impressed. \u003cstrong\u003eX-Men Legacy #3\u003c/strong\u003e kinda feels like the writer Simon Spurrier is tripping with us a bit but at least he\u0026rsquo;s bringing some perspective to what it\u0026rsquo;s like to be David Haller. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to the next issue where he actually interacts with some X-Men! I get that the book is supposed to be Legion-focused but still, it\u0026rsquo;s X-Men Legacy, not Legion Legacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s it for Marvel NOW!

The party had come into a village tavern looking for information, and there was this tavern wench who was acting a bit suspiciously in their eyes. As she exited the main tavern room (presumably to get more ale or whatever), one of the party members who for some reason was armed with a pitchfork declared that he would stop her from leaving the room by throwing the pitchfork in her path. A couple of disastrous rolls later and the tavern wench had died from a thrown pitchfork. Things escalated quickly and soon the party was holding the tavern patrons hostage inside the building as the local watch was trying to get in.

First, the non-Marvel NOW! series:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHawkeye #6\u003c/strong\u003e is the highlight of this week\u0026rsquo;s Marvel releases. The book is consistently funny, down-to-earth and awesome, and this issue is one of the best so far. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t heard about it, the series written by Matt Fraction is one of Marvel\u0026rsquo;s best ongoings right now. The book tells stories of what \u0026ldquo;Hawkguy\u0026rdquo; is up to when he\u0026rsquo;s not out Avenging against alien threats or hydra or whatever. He owns an apartment building and has a dog and Tony Stark comes over to help set up his A/V system so he can watch a DVRed copy of the final season of \u0026ldquo;Dog Cops\u0026rdquo;. David Aja is killing it with the art too. Nothing too hyper-realistic, the art is simple and straightforward but we get excellent panel layouts, especially with conversation pages where there\u0026rsquo;s like 20-30 panels each. This issue in particular feels like a comic strip version of a sitcom; except sitcoms don\u0026rsquo;t usually have gangs of amusing thugs who say \u0026ldquo;Bro!\u0026rdquo; all the time.

Not that there aren\u0026rsquo;t any other superteams that could be defending our world of course, but one of the great things about X-Factor is that the stories are more or less cut off from the rest of the Marvel universe unless absolutely necessary (well, it seems Alex up and vanished from this book supposedly to join the Avengers, so there\u0026rsquo;s that), which means Peter David is free to have out of this world things happen to the characters. It isn\u0026rsquo;t always the best book Marvel puts out, but it never goes into that boring zone where you\u0026rsquo;d wish you were reading something else. Oh, and as I write this I realize I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading Peter David writing X-Factor since the 90s!

Or maybe not, depending on what happens with this issue\u0026rsquo;s cliffhanger. Alternate universes are really great, it gives writers a chance to explore characters in a different light, and XXM writer Greg Pak has brought us a lot of that. We get younger versions, battle-hardened versions, versions with different sexuality and race (is that a black Cyclops?!) as the team jumps across dimensions.

This final issue isn\u0026rsquo;t very action-packed, but it wraps up some dangling threads, with Psylocke clearing things up with her brother, a surprisingly lucid Deadpool talking Evan through how to handle all the stuff he\u0026rsquo;s been through and the fate of Fantomex (is he really dead? Then who\u0026rsquo;s that female version in the Marvel NOW Uncanny X-Force previews?). We also find out what future Wolverine told our current Wolverine and how it relates to Daken\u0026rsquo;s ultimate fate as shown in UXF #34 (I\u0026rsquo;m kinda hoping Daken stays dead - it adds a lot to Logan\u0026rsquo;s character that he has that low point in his history). It\u0026rsquo;s a great ending to a great run, hopefully Sam Humphries\u0026rsquo; new Uncanny X-Force will be just as great.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

First, the non-Marvel NOW! series:\nHawkeye #6 is the highlight of this week\u0026rsquo;s Marvel releases. The book is consistently funny, down-to-earth and awesome, and this issue is one of the best so far. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t heard about it, the series written by Matt Fraction is one of Marvel\u0026rsquo;s best ongoings right now.",
