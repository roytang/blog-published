When you have been reading (and speaking) English so much from an early age, you come to have an instinctive grasp of what is and what is not proper sentence construction. Some sentences just look right and some just look wrong. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying I have perfect mastery of the English language or anything. But I am for the most part capable of proper sentence construction. I like to think that being a programmer (or at least, a good programmer) correlates with a tendency towards good grammar as well, given how the syntax rules of programming languages are even stricter than the rules of English grammar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to be pretty anal about it too. I would correct most people given any opportunity, especially online in forums and social media and what not. These days I\u0026rsquo;m less inclined to do so, at least for strangers on the internet whose first language may or may not be English, unless the grammar is especially atrocious or the poster was asking for it in some way. I guess the advice in the following tweet mostly applies for me these days:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHere\u0026#39;s what I was taught about manners: Correcting someone\u0026#39;s \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/grammar?src=hash\u0026amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003e#grammar\u003c/a\u003e in public is rude.

But that\u0026#39;s just me... \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/R1A6wPqFPI\"\u003ehttps://t.co/R1A6wPqFPI\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u0026mdash; Diana B.

Speaking good English is often seen as a sign of privilege. I imagine even foreigners make some judgments based on how good your English is; I imagine that my \u003ca href=\"/2019/04/i-got-a-us-visa/\"\u003eUS Visa interview\u003c/a\u003e might have been a bit more difficult if I wasn\u0026rsquo;t fluent. That being said, it may be a thing that\u0026rsquo;s on the downturn, given the recent rise of anti-intellectualism locally (or is it really recent?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will still often correct friends and family though. The people who know me well know that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t signify any ill will or malice on my part, just a lingering obsessive desire for correct grammar. It\u0026rsquo;s the same way a slightly misaligned painting hanging from the wall would bother other people (okay, that would bother me too).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion: I had to review this post a few times to make sure I made no grammatical errors, that would be embarrassing.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

This is not entirely inaccurate, though I prefer not to tinker with real world stuff because of my poor dexterity. My tinkering is usually limited to software and tech devices.

I guess this contributes to my aptitude for software development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was thinking about this because there\u0026rsquo;s some contrast when I\u0026rsquo;m working with non-technical people who easily get frustrated with why things don\u0026rsquo;t work. They often won\u0026rsquo;t even try simple things like restarting something or pushing buttons to see what happens. I guess there is some level of fear or intimidation involved, they are worried that if they try things they don\u0026rsquo;t understand they might break something. While that\u0026rsquo;s a concern, modern tech is a lot more resilient and uh, well, shall we say \u0026ldquo;idiot proof\u0026rdquo; than back in the old days, but I guess that\u0026rsquo;s difficult to communicate to someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a technical background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally though, with the modern internet giving video tutorials for most anything, there is little reason to not be a tinkerer these days, but I guess if you didn\u0026rsquo;t grow up with that mentality it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to adjust especially when you\u0026rsquo;re older. For younger people who grew up on the internet just trying to push whatever buttons until you figure out what you want seems to come naturally with the usage of tablets and smartphones and such. My nieces certainly handle modern technology a lot better than their grandparents do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world needs more tinkerers and technical people anyway, and maybe a tad less of people like salesmen, marketers and propagandists.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Sometimes they follow me back for one reason or another, and it gives me a little bit of anxiety. The anxiety is because here is this person whose content I like, who followed me back probably because of an interaction we had, and she is expecting that my tweets will be more of the same kind of content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut often it\u0026rsquo;s not. I don\u0026rsquo;t write about the same kind of thing all the time - one only needs to look at this blog to see that. I write on a variety of topics that interest me, from \u003ca href=\"/tags/software-development/\"\u003estuff I learn working as a software developer\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"/tags/movies/\"\u003emovies\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"/tags/games/\"\u003egames\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"/tags/tv/\"\u003etv shows\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"/tags/philippines/\"\u003ethings that are going on in my country\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"/tags/quotes/\"\u003equotes I like\u003c/a\u003e and all other kinds of stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a while I considered that blogging might be more effective if I had a more focused blog, instead of this chaotic willy-nilly mess I\u0026rsquo;ve refused to give up on since 2002. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried starting topic-centered blogs before, about stuff like \u003ca href=\"/tags/mtg/\"\u003eMagic the Gathering\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"/tags/comics/\"\u003ecomic books\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"/tags/royondjango/\"\u003esoftware development using Django\u003c/a\u003e, but most of those efforts collpased and I just absorbed the contents back into this blog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think having a focused blog depends really on your goals. Like, if your goal is to have a blog with a lot of followers and to grow your audience and to monetize through ads or newsletters or other methods, then focused, specific content is the way to go. But for me and this blog, as I like to remind myself, I\u0026rsquo;m writing largely for myself. This blog and this website are my presence on the internet, more than any social media account. Thus, it should reflect all my interests in totality, not just the ones that I can monetize or get me more work or whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m reminded of how sometimes on Twitter famous people like tech personalities will comment on something like politics and they\u0026rsquo;ll get people who are disagreeable and go \u0026ldquo;I follow you for your tech content, please keep your politics out of this\u0026rdquo;, which is ridiculous. Just because a person is primarily known for a certain thing doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean their opinions and personalities can be limited to that thing only and for all time. People are multi-faceted, they have many views and many interests and they should be allowed to express themselves on whatever topic they like (within reasonable limits obviously no to hate speech thanks.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a barely related blog note: something I\u0026rsquo;ve been putting off for a while, I merged categories and tags on this blog. It just seems to make more sense. I probably broke some links somewhere though, I\u0026rsquo;ll figure it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

With \u003ca href=\"/2019/04/were-in-the-endgames-now/\"\u003eWar of the Spark\u003c/a\u003e now out and the metagame not yet established, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d be foolish and waste my wildcards on some brewing. As a reminder, I\u0026rsquo;m still an F2P player on Arena, so wildcards are precious and few lol. I did have some 50k in gold and a few gems saved up when War of the Spark hit, so i have already played a few sealeds (only 1 got to 7 wins) and opened quite a few packs. One of the nice constructed decks I\u0026rsquo;ve seen is that Grixis control shell with Nicol Bolas Dragon God, but since the previous, I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to finish off opponents by exiling things with Ashiok, Dream Render and then ultimating Kaya, Orzhov Usurper. Luckily I had most of the cards needed for an Esper control shell, just needed to burn some rare wildcards to flesh out the manabase and a couple of mythics here and there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s my first totally unoptimized draft:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"mtgdecklist\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"header\"\u003e\n    \u003ch4\u003eEsper

(For some reason Arena gives me a warning that Teferi requires a sideboard!) The control matchups seem manageable, depending on draws. Fast decks (i.e. RDW) are a bit more challenging, might need some cheaper spot removal like Moment of Craving. I did manage to ultimate Kaya for 20+ damage a couple of times already, so that\u0026rsquo;s fun. I don\u0026rsquo;t have that much time for testing though, so I imagine this is a list that I will be optimizing over time. Any suggestions are welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

With War of the Spark now out and the metagame not yet established, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d be foolish and waste my wildcards on some brewing. As a reminder, I\u0026rsquo;m still an F2P player on Arena, so wildcards are precious and few lol. I did have some 50k in gold and a few gems saved up when War of the Spark hit, so i have already played a few sealeds (only 1 got to 7 wins) and opened quite a few packs.",

I\u0026rsquo;ve already blown past the series finale and wrapped around to the start and currently at season 2, so close to completion. The series is as great and insane as I remember. It\u0026rsquo;s like a more outrageous version of ensemble comedies like Parks and Recreation, and though I am fonder of PNR, I can see why 30 Rock is the more award-winning show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth \u003cstrong\u003eStar Trek Discovery\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eThe Orville\u003c/strong\u003e finished their second seasons this month. Discovery closed off their time loops neatly and sent the Discovery into an unknown future, meaning they get to start season 3 now no longer bound by Star Trek history and free to forge their own path. The season was ok, I enjoyed the classic Trek references and all the timey-wimey stuff. The Orville had a great season, with the introduction of a new enemy empire and possibly one of the best TV space battles of all time. They ended their season with a timey-wimey episode as well, looks like that\u0026rsquo;s a trend for April.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/strong\u003e final season started up in April of course, and its only halfway through.

            "title": "More thoughts on Avengers Endgame and the MCU",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI already wrote about Avengers Endgame a bit in \u003ca href=\"/2019/04/were-in-the-endgames-now/\"\u003eyesterday\u0026rsquo;s post\u003c/a\u003e, but that was a bit rushed and I had more thoughts, so here we are. I figured I might as well get everything out. There will be unmarked spoilers for Avengers Endgame and Agents of SHIELD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore even going into the movie that was seemingly sold out everywhere despite being on almost every cinema screen in the Metro, I was thinking to myself what a phenomenon. Endgame is the culmination of a decade\u0026rsquo;s worth of movies, 22 in total, and even some number of shows, something unrivalled in all of movie history. It\u0026rsquo;s a new form of serialized event entertainment - even though there have been movie franchises with continuity before, most have been limited to trilogies, and the MCU blows them all out of the water. In my head it\u0026rsquo;s more akin to an extended HBO or Netflix series, one that only gets three episodes a year, and each episode is an event in that you can go to the cinema and watch it with your friends. And Endgame was here, trying to put a bookend on all of that, an entire decade worth of stories, with dozens of characters and the stakes no less than half the universe. The scale of it is mind-boggling and very ambitious, and if they dropped the ball on this one it would be so terrible and a huge waste and it would take another decade to even attempt to conclude another story in this manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe movie starts with the cold open of Clint and his family getting dusted. This could have easily been done as a post-credits scene in Infinity War, but having this here allows them to remind the audience of the stakes involved at the very start. (And saves them having to credit Jeremy Renner in both movies.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNext we get the trailer scene of Tony in space recording his message to Potts. The trailer makes this out to be kind of a hopeless-we\u0026rsquo;re-about-to-die situation for Tony (and Nebula), but the movies resolves it quickly by having Carol come in to save them at the last minute. At first I was confused a bit about whether we were going to see the Captain Marvel post-credits scene in this movie, but they save some time by having all of that (including introducing Carol to everybody and explaining Thanos and all) happen off-screen. Tony gets back to Earth but he\u0026rsquo;s still pissed at cap and they part ways.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWith Nebula now on Earth, they know where Thanos is and the plan is to go beat him up, get the stones and use that to resotre all the dusted people. But Thanos has destroyed the stones, making the snap apparently irreversible. Thor is frustrated and goes for the head this time, and we timeskip five years.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBoth the timeskip and the length of it caught me a bit off-guard, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting it. I can imagine that Infinity War could\u0026rsquo;ve ended here too (if not for the pesky detail of Carol not yet being introduced.) Aparently five years was not enough for the people of the world to move on. That\u0026rsquo;s understandable, but I would have assumed they would clean up the mess a little bit.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNext we have the rat that saves the world. Pure blind luck gets Scott out of the Quantum Realm; the only reason it took five years to get to this point is that rat was lazy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eContinuing the MCU tradition of trying to complete the Community cast, we get a 2-second cameo by Ken Jeong/Senor Chang. Later on we also get a slightly longer cameo from Yvette Nicole-Brown/Shirley!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eScott gets to meet grown-up Cassie, setting up the stage for her Phase 4 adventures as Stature, and perhaps, the Young Avengers? Who else would be there?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAfter some meandering, Scott makes his way to the Avengers compound, and finally explains his ludicrous timey-wimey plan of using the quantum realm to do a time heist. They need someone smart to figure this out so they go to Tony, and we get to meet his daughter Morgan (I would guess at 4 years old). Tony dismisses their plan as some fantasy Back to the Future-type nonsense. Apparently (as would be explained further on), Back to the Future rules do not apply in the MCU - changing the past does not affect the future. I initially thought they would try to use time travel to go back and redo the battle of Wakanda, this time with more foreknowledge and Carol on their side and thus stop the snap from even happening, but this throws that out the window. There\u0026rsquo;s no getting around it now - the snap is irrevocably part of MCU history and future films will have to work around that or otherwise deal with the consequences.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThey need another smart guy, so they go see Bruce, who is now Smart Hulk. Not what I was expecting, though not unprecedented from the comics. Banner has had a weird character arc since Age of Ultron, going from permanently Hulk to unable to Hulk and now both Banner and Hulk.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTony figures it out and comes around, so they try to get the gang back together to do the Time Heist. Rocket and Bruce go to pick up Thor, who is now a depressed fat drunk idiot apparently. Far Thor is a bit of a disservice to the character - but given that during the last few movies he\u0026rsquo;s lost his mother and his father and his girlfriend and his home and his posse and half the remaining Asgardians and he feel responsible for the snap because he didn\u0026rsquo;t go for the head, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a little justified. Hey, at least Valkyrie and Korg survived, so that\u0026rsquo;s something.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNatasha tracks Clint swordfighting some Yakuza in Tokyo and gives him hope.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSo the Time Heist crew are: Steve, Tony, Bruce, and Scott going for the three infinity stones in New York 2012, Rocket and Thor going for the Ether in Asgard 2013, Nebula, Rhodey going for the power stone on Morag in 2014, and Clint and Natasha going for the Soul Stone in 2014 as well. They only get one round trip each, so no one is allowed to fail\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI was pleasantly surprised all the appearances of characters from previous movies: the Ancient One, Rumlow, Agent Sitwell, Loki, Alexander Pierce, Frigga, even Natalie Portman\u0026rsquo;s Jane Foster! Did they actually get Portman to shoot a scene gain, or just reused footage from Dark World? (I assume the latter). Tt\u0026rsquo;s amazing that they were able to shoot new scenes with actors like Tilda Swinton and Robert Redford and not have that info leak\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSome great throwback moments include:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0026ldquo;I can do this all day\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yeah, yeah\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe Ancient One punching Bruce out of the Hulk\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe elevator scene from Winter Soldier turned on its head by Cap whispering \u0026ldquo;Hail Hydra\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCap, Iron Man and Hulk going back to the battle of New York made sense, since they could blend in during the fight somehow and Tony has access to Stark tower\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThor does his blubbering idiot thing but gets a bit of his mojo back after talking to his mother and finding out he was still worthy to summon Mjolnir\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOnce you know that Clint and Natasha are going for the Soul Stone, you already know one of them has to die; the only question was which one. Natasha unfortunately, did not have a spouse and children to go back to\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRhodey and Nebula successfully conk out idiot Peter Quill and grab the Power Stone from him. It\u0026rsquo;s weird that they chose to go back to this time instead of say, after Gotg1 when the power stone was safely in the hands of the Nova Corps. I guess they figured it was easier to get it from Quill rather than try to infiltrate Xandar, but coming back to this time creates an opportunity for Nebula to get her wifi network crossed with 2014 Nebula and so 2014 Thanos finds out about the entire Time Heist and sends 2014 Nebula back to 2023 as a sleeper agent\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSteve and Tony hop to 1970 as their back up plan for getting the tesseract. Steve catches a glimpse of Peggy, but she looks a bit too young considering she should be 50ish at this time. Tony meets up with Howard and I am momentarily confused because I am more familiar with Dominic Cooper than John Slattery but here we are. Howard saying Tony is about to be born tells us Tony is more than 50 in 2023, quite old already as well. Oh, and Jarvis is here too.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Time Heist is successful! Everyone but Nat makes it back home, and they mourn her for all of ten seconds before going to build their own Infinity Gauntlet. She probably deserved more than that, but she is still slated for an upcoming movie, however that works, and this movie is all about a sendoff for Cap and Tony, so she gets less focus\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e(As the third act is beginning, I suddenly get the urge to pee, but I can\u0026rsquo;t go now! And I\u0026rsquo;m in the middle of the row so going would bother a lot of people and I end up uncomfortably holding it in for an hour. This is my excuse in case I screw up some facts below)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2014 Nebula brings 2014 Thanos and his warship through the time machine into the present day. One would wonder how they got enough Pym particles to shrink the entire warship, but presumably they had enough time to study and clone the tech before 2014 Nebula called to them. The ship did not pop out full size in Avengers compound as I expected, instead appearing in the sky above\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBruce prepares to use the gauntlet, and without explanation everyone suits up, as if expecting they\u0026rsquo;re about to be attacked by the Mad Titan they thought they killed a while back. Bruce snaps, and a phone call confirms the undusting worked, but then they get space bombarded by Thanos\u0026rsquo; warship\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eClint is left alone to run away with the gauntlet to protect it from beasties. The original three (Steve, Tony and Thor) go face to face with Thanos directly. Thor, probably bursting with a chance to redeem himself, dual wields Stormbreaker and Mjolnir and uses the lightning to get out his sweatpants and fashion himself new armor and braid his beard. They go at it\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2014 Gamora frees 2023 Nebula and they go save Clint just when 2014 Nebula was about to take the gauntlet from him. Bruce is trying to keep the rubble from collapsing on Rhodey, Rocket and himself as Scott heads their way\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThanos vs the original three is a close fight, but the Mad Titan has them on the ropes when suddenly Steve wields Mjolnir! Completely predictable, but it\u0026rsquo;s something the fans have been clamoring for since Age of Ultron. Thor cheers \u0026ldquo;I knew it!!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn spite of everything, Thanos beats them back, shattering Steve\u0026rsquo;s shield. Steve struggles to get up, barely breathing, and all seems lost when he gets some radio comms from somewhere. It\u0026rsquo;s Sam! Right, all the dusted people are back! Took them long enough! \u0026ldquo;On your six\u0026rdquo; is a throwback to their jogging days back during Winter Soldier\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMagic portals from Doctor Strange\u0026rsquo;s peeps pop up all over, and the reinforcements are here: T\u0026rsquo;Challa, Shuri, Okoye and the armies of Wakanda! Sam, Bucky, Wanda, Quill, Drax and Mantis! Peter Parker, Spider-man! Pepper in the Rescue Armor! Hope van Dyne! Valkyrie and the Asgardians! Wong and his magic friends! 2014 Gamora and 2023 Nebula! Scott goes Giant-Man and busts Bruce, Rhodey and Rocket out of the rubble! Thanos calls down his armies, the Black Order and the Leviathans from the battle of New York. Everyone is geared up for a rematch of Wakanda, and Steve finally utters those magic words: Avengers Assemble! (We\u0026rsquo;re already assembled, Steve!). Hands down the best moment of the movie!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNot much to say about the battle itself, its great and everyone has their moments. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a problem with the whole girl power moment after Carol comes in\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTony\u0026rsquo;s response of \u0026ldquo;I am Iron Man\u0026rdquo; as he snaps his gauntlet is weird but I understand why it\u0026rsquo;s there. His journey begins and ends with that line. His body can\u0026rsquo;t take the power of infinity and he dies. Pepper tells him its time to rest\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTony gets a long funeral scene, and some characters notably appear for the first time in the movie: Janet van Dyne, Maria Hill, Nick Fury and some teenager I don\u0026rsquo;t recognize but later find out is supposed to be the kid from Iron Man 3. Some posts are also naming him as \u0026ldquo;Iron Lad\u0026rdquo;, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t jive with the Young Avengers Iron Lad origin, but I suppose it\u0026rsquo;s a possible future something\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnd now, the weakest part of the movie\u0026rsquo;s plot: Steve going back to the past to return the infinity stones (and Mjolnir) to where they got them, to minimize timestream damage. So many questions:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhy is Steve the only one to go? Hank Pym is back, they can make more Pym Particles again.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhy is his shield whole again? Did Shuri repair it?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDid he go back to Asgard and inject the ether back into Jane Foster?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow did he make the tesseract a cube again? How did he put the mind stone back into the sceptre which he didn\u0026rsquo;t bring?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow did the reunion with Red Skull on Vormir go? Did he get a refund on the price paid for the Soul stone?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere are a bunch of timey-wimey problems but probably there are multiple ways to justify things and you shouldnt think about them too hard and just accept them. For the record, here is what I believe. Presumably, returning the infinity stones to where they got them removes the branch timeline that was created when they originally got them. This means:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReturning the time stone to the Ancient One means the events of Doctor Strange still happen in the prime timeline, and that time stone was the same one Thanos used in Infinity War\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReturning the sceptre to Agent Sitwell means it still has the same mind stone used in Age of Ultron etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReturning the space stone (now Tesseract) to the SHIELD vaults means it does all of its stuff in the prime timeline as expected, and is still the same space stone used in Infinity War\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReturning the ether to Jane Foster means the events of Dark World still unfold as they did\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAll of these are merged back into the prime timeline via \u003ca href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAlreadyChangedThePast\"\u003eTV Tropes: You Already Changed The Past\u003c/a\u003e, so they all already happened in the prime universe. This means four of the stones used in Infinity War and later destroyed were also the same ones used in Endgame\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHowever, there are at least two changes Steve would have been unable to repair:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLoki escaping with the Tesseract in 2012\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe removal of 2014 Thanos, Gamora, Nebula and all of Thanos\u0026rsquo; crew from their time. This means it was also unnecessary to return the power stone and soul stone to this branch timeline, but I guess they did it anyway\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnother mystery is in what timeline did Steve get his last dance with Peggy and hence grow old etc. The fact that he was able to appear on the bench as an old man shortly after being sent back implies to me that he grew old in the prime timeline (in yet another instance of You Already Changed The Past), and that Peggy simply kept the real identity of her husband a secret to her dying day\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe real problem with this whole affair character-wise is that it means Steve became selfish and chose to live out his life given the chance, instead of going back to his friends as expected. I like to think that seeing Peggy again in 1970 made him realize he was always meant to be with her and thus made him decide to do what he did\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHanding off the shield to Sam: I expected it to be Bucky, given that in the comics he got to be Cap before Sam, but this is okay too. Though I think Steve could\u0026rsquo;ve given Bucky a few parting words as well\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eQuill pretty much got the short end of the stick in IW/EG: Fans hate him now for screwing up the battle on Titan, his girlfriend is dead, and now his leadership of the Guardians is in question\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNotable deaths/absences:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2018 Gamora truly dead and gone. No explanation given for what happened to 2014 Gamora, as she wasn\u0026rsquo;t shown being dusted. Presumably we\u0026rsquo;ll see her and Thor again in Guardians 3\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNo Vision this time, but presumably Shuri would be able to restore him sans mind stone, especially since he and Wanda are slated for a Disney+ show\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNatasha dying was sad, but she is slated for a solo movie, and EG leaves at least two outs for her coming back: one is via a Soul Stone refund as mentioned above, and another is Bruce saying he tried to bring her back when he did the snap\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn Agent Coulson appearance would have been nice, although he presumably died after the end of the last season of Agents of SHIELD. This movie also leaves Agents of SHIELD in a weird place: in the last season they had Infinity War happening concurrently with the season finale, and they delayed the start of season 6 until after Endgame, but given that they now have to live with a 5-year time gap where half the people are dead, IDK if they\u0026rsquo;ll have to adapt their scripts to that\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn future movies, they now have access to a time machine! They can\u0026rsquo;t change the past, but they can do silly things like bring back dead characters to help lol\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFuture movies also have to deal with the fact that half the population skipped ahead 5 years and also that the world is a mess. Things certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t look like a mess in the Far From Home trailer though. Presumably Peter Parker\u0026rsquo;s friends Ned, MJ and Flash all got dusted in IW so that they are all still the same age in Far From Home\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhew, I wrote a lot! I guess it\u0026rsquo;s justified given how much I liked the movie and the scale of it and everything. As I mentioned in the spoiler-free review, they could end the MCU here and it would be fine. A fitting end and tribute to the past decade of movies. I am even tempted to watch it in the cinemas a second time, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll have even more insights then!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I already wrote about Avengers Endgame a bit in yesterday\u0026rsquo;s post, but that was a bit rushed and I had more thoughts, so here we are. I figured I might as well get everything out. There will be unmarked spoilers for Avengers Endgame and Agents of SHIELD.\nBefore even going into the movie that was seemingly sold out everywhere despite being on almost every cinema screen in the Metro, I was thinking to myself what a phenomenon.",

The spoiler season was well-executed (despite some leaks during the last week), allowing us to see the story unfolding through the cards in a clearer way than ever before: from the dreadhorde invasion of Ravnica, the counterattack by the guilds, the arrival of the Amonkhet God-Eternals, and the death and betrayal that soon followed.

The rocking was felt strongly in Metro Manila; I normally don\u0026rsquo;t feel any earthquakes and only learn of them after the fact via friends or social media. But this time I was on a bed and I could feel it physically shaking, which was impressive given I was only on a second story. Imagine what it must have been like to be in a high-rise condo. Many of my friends working in the business districts had to evacuate their high-rise offices via stairs, and I put off a planned trip that afternoon to Ortigas since it looked like I might have trouble getting home if I went ahead. Thankfully all my friends and family are safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy last real memory of actually feeling an earthquake was the one back in 1990 that collapsed the Hyatt in Baguio. I was still in grade school then and I distinctly remember that quake hitting while we were in the parking lot waiting around for the school bus to get going. I\u0026rsquo;m sure we\u0026rsquo;ve had strong earthquakes since then, but none made a lasting impression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarthquakes are not an uncommon occurrence here, but during recent years there has been talk of a devastating \u0026ldquo;Big One\u0026rdquo; which could theoretically do a lot of damage to Metro Manila, which meant a lot of people were worried, justifiably so. I\u0026rsquo;m disappointed that I didn\u0026rsquo;t instinctively find a table or door frame to position myself under and just sat there silently as the shaking happened. I guess we should also count ourselves luckly that there weren\u0026rsquo;t many casualties so far for this quake, unlike the 1990 one which was I think the second most lethal earthquake to hit the country ever. It\u0026rsquo;s also a pleasant surprise how the high-rise buildings in the business districts are holding up. I worry that because of the way business is done in the Philippines, there may have been shortcuts taken that weaken their structural integrity, but fortunately that has not been the case. So far. Hopefully, we will be able to fare as well if the hypothetical \u0026ldquo;big one\u0026rdquo; actually hits.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

These days, well, the internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of people in the Metro skip town for the Holy Week, heading off to beaches or wherever to beat the summer heat or taking advantage of the holiday to visit their family in the provinces. Our family generally doesn\u0026rsquo;t do that, being practicing Catholics and all, we like to just stay at home and suffer the summer heat. The great thing about all these people leaving the city is that the normally super congested Metro Manila gets to breathe for a bit. From Maunday Thursday through Easter Sunday, traffic is the lightest it ever is for the entire year (culminating in the post-Easter traffic mess caused by all the people travelling back from the provinces). The power and water crises we\u0026rsquo;ve been going through for the past few weeks is temporarily alleviated as the demand from the city residents goes down - our water pressure has been pretty good since Thursday, though we did end up using more power to aircon our way through the summer afternoons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis summer seems hotter than it has ever been, not uncommon during the past few years.

(I imagine that Android has a similar issue, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never purchased anything from the Play Store, so I won\u0026rsquo;t bother to check.)

Mobile gaming fares even worse than PC gaming, despite the wide variety of PC configurations, the software-level support for games is pretty much standardized at the OS-level and companies like Microsoft are careful to support backward compatibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of my pipe dreams is of course to get into game development, and for a while I considered mobile as a possible option for that (if I ever get around to it), but with the state of the ecosystem these days that seems unlikely.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Not for the ranked ladder - whenever I go into the competitive multiplayer mode I find myself stressing out and feel like my blood pressure is going up and I can\u0026rsquo;t manage more than one or two games at a time. I still am able to find ranked matches, but they always feels so intense, and you have to worry about being cheesed and yes I often do poorly. The mode I\u0026rsquo;m enjoying these days is Starcraft 2 Co-op, a mode which was released together with Legacy of the Void. Some friends of mine have been playing the coop mode recently and I got enticed to join in on the fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically there are mission maps similar to the campaign missions, except they require two players working together to accomplish objectives. You can choose between a few difficulty levels and play with friends, or queue up to be matched with anons. There are a number of different coop commanders available with different army compositions and special abilities. Completing missions gains you experience for the commander you chose, which lets you level them up to gain upgrades. A few come fully unlocked, some are unlocked because I had purchased all three campaigns. The ones that are locked you can still play up to level up, after that they need to be purchased for $4.99 per commander. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of content too even after you\u0026rsquo;ve maxed the levels, as there are mastery and ascencion levels to be climbed, and there are weekly \u0026ldquo;mutation\u0026rdquo; variants that are much more challenging than the normal missions. One thing I like about Starcraft 2 is that there are a lot of achievements, and that includes coop mode too so that adds a lot of replay value for me as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have been enjoying the mode, and due to various freebies, I initially had nine commanders unlocked. I enjoy playing a variety of styles so I levelled them all to max, and the mode is fun enough that I am considering purchasing a few of the locked commanders as well. (Maybe all of them!) It\u0026rsquo;s a lot less stressful than ranked, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about being cheesed (and sometimes you get to do the cheesing yourself!), and a lot less toxic, people are generally friendly and don\u0026rsquo;t blame you too much for screwing up. I\u0026rsquo;m a bit old so my reflexes probably aren\u0026rsquo;t good enough for ranked anymore, but I\u0026rsquo;m happy I can still play in real-time well enough for the highest difficulties of coop mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was some discussion in in-game chat about how the game was \u0026ldquo;dead\u0026rdquo;, but these sentiments seemed to come mostly from people who preferred competitive multiplayer modes, so maybe not many people are playing ranked anymore? But coop seems to be going strong - I never have trouble matching up even with anons. Apparently Coop mode has been profitable enough for Blizzard that they\u0026rsquo;ve still been releasing new content for it fairly recently, last year saw the release of the latest coop commander Zeratul, and there are more commanders rumored to be in development. So I guess somehow the business model is working for them which is great since it gives the game legs to go on for a few more years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSide note: I really dig the packaging for all 3 SC2 games and am glad I got them physical copies. There are some nice artworks on the boxes and some inserts with a bit of lore, and Legacy of the Void even came with some free codes for WoW and Hearthstone (I wonder if I can still claim this free pack lol)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#ca94d5dee527178ec49432151619b7c0-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2019/04/starcraft-2/starcraft2_packaging_hua0a6cb034bb25cf60534af269223a5b8_298612_300x0_resize_q75_box.JPG\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"ca94d5dee527178ec49432151619b7c0-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2019/04/starcraft-2/starcraft2_packaging.JPG\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"18 Apr 2019 5:56am\"\u003e18 Apr 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n",
