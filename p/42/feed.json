Take one or two and write them out in detail. Next time you’re in front of a warm crowd, work on telling the story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea being of course, that such an exercise trains you to be more vulnerable in front on an audience. I thought about this advice for a bit and found it difficult to remember any particular moments in my life that I feel particularly embarassed or ashamed about. All people have such moments of course, so there are two possibilities: (a) my embarassing moments are so terrible brain has blocked out such memories for my own sanity; or (b) I don\u0026rsquo;t remember them because I don\u0026rsquo;t care too much and I move on quickly from them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do remember being an insecure and self-conscious teenager growing up, so maybe I should have more embarassing memories from that era? But looking back now on any moments back then that I might have considered embarassing, they don\u0026rsquo;t seem so bad, at least not compared to other people\u0026rsquo;s embarassing stories. For all such moments that I can recall, I generally don\u0026rsquo;t feel a tinge of regret - I think they were things that contributed to my growth as a person and that I should have done anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an example, the first possibly \u0026ldquo;embarassing\u0026rdquo; moment I could think was the first office Christmas party I went to as a working person. Now, if you\u0026rsquo;re from the Philippines, you know they have this thing where they expect new hires to give a \u0026ldquo;performance\u0026rdquo; during the office Christmas party, as portrayed in this comic:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#667dc6f6dc4c2f5315f780faa29ba199-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2019/03/embarassment-office-christmas-parties-and-singing-off-key/opismeyts_huc2e037c38fd8c0199ca1b958e53d8853_222769_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"667dc6f6dc4c2f5315f780faa29ba199-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2019/03/embarassment-office-christmas-parties-and-singing-off-key/opismeyts.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"14 Mar 2019 5:56am\"\u003e14 Mar 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImage credit: \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/opismeyts\"\u003eOpismeyts\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow back then I was fresh out of college and not a very social animal. And they wanted us to do this ridiculous looking dance that was popularized by local noontime shows of the era. Performing in public was not something I wanted to do, and I had a lot of anxiety leading up to it, as I recall I even considered skipping the event completely. But of course I went through it anyway, and though I cringed at myself the whole time, I think I did learn to laugh at myself a little bit. I credit this event for helping me \u0026ldquo;lighten up\u0026rdquo; as it were, be more willing to plow straight through my anxieties, and be more open to doing ridiculous things in public. (I would still be averse to say, volunteering for such a thing, but there should now be a decent possibility of convincing me\u0026hellip;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days, it\u0026rsquo;s rare that I feel embarassed about anything. Sometimes there\u0026rsquo;ll be awkwardness somewhere when I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do, but I think that wit can push me through it. I also used to be pretty self-conscious about something like singing in public, like at a videoke session or whatever. This might be understandable given that I\u0026rsquo;m just terrible at singing - the odds that I can carry a given tune are a bit low. I used to always refuse when offered the videoke mic. But these days I\u0026rsquo;m more willing - there was a realization at some point that if I sang in public, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t the one to suffer, it would be the people listening LOL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is popular advice that goes \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t sweat the small stuff\u0026rdquo;, and in the grand scheme of things those small embarassing moments you have are pretty much always small stuff, even though in the moment they may feel like almost everything is falling apart. Be willing to laugh at your own embarassments, and move on. Life is too short to be embarassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

But it\u0026rsquo;s probably better if my naps were predictable, like say, a quick nap after lunch (when I\u0026rsquo;m likely to be sleepy anyway), instead of the irregular schedule I have now which messes up my sleep cycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe common advice for fixing a sleep cycle is to have a regular time of the day when you go to bed and sleep, so that your body gets used to sleeping at this time. This has proven\u0026hellip; difficult for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I really need to find the discipline to establish a regular routine, with scheduled naps throughout the day if needed.

I noticed this with my \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/duolingo/\"\u003eDuolingo lessons\u003c/a\u003e, the past few weeks I\u0026rsquo;ve always been doing them right after breakfast, still sitting at the table. I bring my iPad with me during breakfast for reading the news, so it\u0026rsquo;s easy to transition into the Duolingo app. Doing it a regular time and so early day makes it a lot less likely that I \u003ca href=\"/2019/01/broken-streaks/\"\u003ebreak the streak\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eit reduces the amount of decisions you need to make during the day, and can also reduce procrastination. For example, if I allocated certain hours of the day to be \u0026ldquo;productive hours\u0026rdquo; and some hours to be \u0026ldquo;gaming hours\u0026rdquo; and so on, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to make that decision during the day. And I can\u0026rsquo;t procrastinate on being productive, since I know the rest of my time is already allocated\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehaving a regular rhythm makes it easier to get through difficult days\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main downside of a routine like this is\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s boring! I dislike heavily regimented schedules that are predictably always the same. I mean, that may even be one of the reasons why I\u0026rsquo;m not working full-time anymore. I\u0026rsquo;ll need to think about this some more. A kind of hybrid approach where some time blocks are more flexible might be more feasible for me, or maybe a varying schedule depending on the day. We\u0026rsquo;ll see. But for sure I have to do something!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I haven\u0026rsquo;t done this in a while, taking my \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/daily-walks/\"\u003edaily walk\u003c/a\u003e in the early morning. I used to do it pretty regularly, except back then I confined myself to the inner roads of our subdivision, or doing loops around the covered court in the nearby seminary. Walking the same routes every morning and doing repetitive routes got boring after a while, and combined with my erratic sleep schedule the habit soon fell off the wayside. I resumed my walking habit when I took a break from work in 2016, but this time mostly doing it late in the afternoons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfternoons have been getting more difficult lately, with some busyness in the schedule and the sudden yet inevitable onset of the summer heat, so I decided to try shifting back to mornings again. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how long it lasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking during the early mornings, before the sun has even broken, has a completely different atmosphere than the afternoons or even the evenings. The streets glow a pale blue and are nearly empty, though traffic is already starting to build up at some of the busier intersections. There are few other people out on their feet (as opposed to in cars) this early, enough that I would involuntarily nod when I passed some other early morning walker. I\u0026rsquo;m surprised to find that a nearby Jollibee operated 24 hours, and that the nearby Starbucks didn\u0026rsquo;t. I assumed it was the other way around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pass by a student on her way to school, with a companion accompanying her as she flags down a jeep. I commiserate with how early students need to get up to go to school in this country. I remember my own childhood when my mom would pick me up and drag me over to the sink to splash my face with water to get me going at five in the morning. Class usually started at seven, but the school bus would pick us up around six or even earlier. Somehow, we may be teaching kids to hate mornings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not one of those \u0026ldquo;not a morning person\u0026rdquo; people. I don\u0026rsquo;t need coffee to get started in the mornings either. I enjoy sleeping in when I can, but I\u0026rsquo;m always willing and able to get up early if I needed to. Combined with my tendency to sleep late into the night, this has led to my terribly erratic sleep schedule. Even as I\u0026rsquo;m walking out on the streets before the break of dawn, I expect myself to be taking a second sleep after getting home and having breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun starts to break through the night as I near the end of my route, a couple of corners away from home. My walk this morning is a bit shorter than my usual target of steps. There are some areas I prefer not to traverse before the light of day, so my options are a bit limited. As I get used to walking in the early mornings again I\u0026rsquo;ll try a few different routes to see if I can increase my steps. In the meantime, I turn the corner and head back home, looking forward to the morning\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003epan de sal\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It\u0026rsquo;s a pretty neat service that allows you to write privately online. It\u0026rsquo;s not public like blogging is, so if you\u0026rsquo;d like to develop a daily writing habit but don\u0026rsquo;t want things to be available to the world, it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty good option. You can of course, just write on paper or on local files and just not upload anything to the cloud at all. But there\u0026rsquo;s some benefits to an online service like this one too - the most obvious one is that you can write anywhere, with any internet connected device, but they also have a few other nifty features like tracking streaks (which can be great for \u003ca href=\"/2019/01/dont-break-the-chain/\"\u003ebuilding habits\u003c/a\u003e), and 750words even allows you to attach daily metadata to your posts (such as a number indicating your mood for the day or how many hours you slept) and it can later show you a chart of how that metadata changes over time. They also have stats like how fast you type, or what mood your writing indicates and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was reminded of this service because I found the export files I got from them a while back. More than a year\u0026rsquo;s worth of daily posts, 365 entries apparently according to the site. I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about writing a python script to parse the export files and mass-import the posts into this blog (back filling 2011-2012 when I wasn\u0026rsquo;t blogging much), but there\u0026rsquo;s a few issues with that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003egenerally, the style of entries is more \u0026ldquo;what I was doing this day\u0026rdquo; than the kind of stuff I write now, which can be fine, as it still provides a good window into what was happening with me in the past\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esome entries may contain information I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t normally write in a public post. I may name names, talk about people I\u0026rsquo;m annoyed with, and so on\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eit was not uncommon back then for me to have a mental block and not knowing what to type that often led me to just typing words at random until I either hit the target goal or subconsciously hit upon a topic I\u0026rsquo;d like to talk about\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess the privacy is the real issue. The best option is probably to export them as Hugo drafts, then review each draft one by one before having them go live on the site. I\u0026rsquo;ll add this to the list of small side projects I may never get around to finding time to do (this list may be growing too quickly!)\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned 750 Words before. It\u0026rsquo;s a pretty neat service that allows you to write privately online. It\u0026rsquo;s not public like blogging is, so if you\u0026rsquo;d like to develop a daily writing habit but don\u0026rsquo;t want things to be available to the world, it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty good option. You can of course, just write on paper or on local files and just not upload anything to the cloud at all. But there\u0026rsquo;s some benefits to an online service like this one too - the most obvious one is that you can write anywhere, with any internet connected device, but they also have a few other nifty features like tracking streaks (which can be great for building habits), and 750words even allows you to attach daily metadata to your posts (such as a number indicating your mood for the day or how many hours you slept) and it can later show you a chart of how that metadata changes over time.",
