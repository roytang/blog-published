It took a few years for the Philippines to catch on, \u003ca href=\"http://www.interaksyon.com/infotech/philippine-internet-connection-turns-20-years-old-this-month\"\u003ethe first internet connection in the country was only set up in 1994\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy personal experience with the internet came a bit later, during our freshman year in University, sometime in the schoolyear 1995-1996. Around that time a couple of friends and I would walk out to this computer shop along Katipunan avenue that had internet access. Computer shops weren\u0026rsquo;t prolific back then, and most of them offered only document editing and printing services. They didn\u0026rsquo;t even have LAN gaming back then, as DOOM had only come out the year before and Starcraft was just a gleam in Blizzard\u0026rsquo;s eye. This particular computer shop we trekked to had 2-3 terminals with internet access, which at that time we mostly used to browse anime-related websites and fanfiction (RIP \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime_Web_Turnpike\"\u003eAnime Web Turnpike\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInternet usage grew quickly in the succeeding years. A couple of friends got internet connections first. One of them lived near the University so a bunch of us happened to hang out there often, not just for internet access but also to read manga and watch anime. We jokingly referred to his house as \u0026ldquo;the Entertainment Capital of UP Village\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forget when we got our own internet connection at home. I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember the provider we used. We stuck with one of the monthly plans for a while, but also went through a period of trying out prepaid internet access plans (RIP ISP Bonanza) and sometimes even hacking a free email service to also give me internet access (RIP Edsamail). It was the days of dial-up modems and beeping sounds, when piracy consisted of arcane commands issued in dark IRC channels. (The first time I got pirated music wasn\u0026rsquo;t off the internet however \u0026ndash; for some reason I had gotten an MP3 of Oasis\u0026rsquo; Wonder Wall on floppy disks. Yes, multiple disks).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from the piracy and the fanfiction, the internet was a treasure trove of information. I quickly learned the usual web development skills \u0026ndash; HTML and CSS were relatively easy, and I had a geocities website set up back in the day, a strange green-text-on-black-background kind of thing (I was never particularly good at web design). My email address for most of the university years was a Yahoo one (RIP Yahoo 2016), which I often used to join discussion groups on various geeky topics like video games and anime and what not \u0026ndash; these days we have reddit for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, internet in the Philippines has come a long way and is a big part of daily life for most people. There\u0026rsquo;s still a lot of improvement to go \u0026ndash; broadband here is still very expensive and very slow compared to other countries and there is no real competition yet, something hopefully to be solved soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was your first encounter with the internet?\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "No, not that kind of history, don\u0026rsquo;t worry.\nTwenty-five years ago this month, the first website went up on the world wide web. That was 1991. It took a few years for the Philippines to catch on, the first internet connection in the country was only set up in 1994.\nMy personal experience with the internet came a bit later, during our freshman year in University, sometime in the schoolyear 1995-1996.",

And I can see why people find it hard to explain without spoiling things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s about strange things happening in a small town. Creepy things. It\u0026rsquo;s a mystery. It\u0026rsquo;s suspense. It\u0026rsquo;s not a jump-scare sort of thing if you\u0026rsquo;re not into that. Well, there\u0026rsquo;s maybe a little bit of jump scares. The best description I\u0026rsquo;d say it\u0026rsquo;s about as scary as an X-Files or Doctor Who episode. So if that\u0026rsquo;s not too scary for you, you\u0026rsquo;ll be fine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s about a child who goes missing in a small town (not a spoiler) and the succeeding events. It\u0026rsquo;s about the mother searching for her son. It\u0026rsquo;s about a group of kids trying to solve a mystery. It\u0026rsquo;s about a small-town police chief in over his head. It\u0026rsquo;s about the 80s. It\u0026rsquo;s about kids in the 80s, music in the 80s, school in the 80s, small American towns in the 80s. It\u0026rsquo;s about outcasts and bullies and first times and trying to fit in and how they all deal with these stranger things\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s like Stephen King wrote an episode of X-Files and it was directed by Stephen Spielberg starring the cast of Stand By Me. The acting is great too, especially the kids\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe minor spoilers follow\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s kind of told in that weird True Detective way, with perspectives jumping around a lot among the ensemble cast. Past and present scenes are interspersed with only context to rely on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt keeps you hooked. I wanted to watch only a couple of episodes at first but ended up awake past three AM at episode six. I finished it the net morning\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love how the mystery unfolds to different parties and separately they uncover parts of it and they all come together in the end to force a resolution. I love how the characters overcome their horror-movie tropes. I love all the 80s references and the geeky references\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was satisfied with how it ended and all came together. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what to expect for a second season though\u003c/p\u003e\n",
