            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eEvaluation of programmer performance is notoriously hard. You want to be accurate and at the same time fair such that all programmers on your staff are evaluated in the same matter. However, there are no good, objective, universally accepted standard metrics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt follows from the fact that there are no good, objective, universally accepted standard metrics for program size. Typically each programmer in a team will not be doing the same task or even the same type of task, so in order to produce fair evaluations you will need some standard metric of program size to normalize any evaluation. For example, you could choose to use code quality (bugs) as a metric for programmer performance, but not every programmer is assigned to do the same complexity of programs and some modules may be more poorly designed than others resulting in more bugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLines of code is nice, until you realize that more lines of code does not necessarily mean a larger program or system, it may just mean your programmers don’t write particularly concise code. Often, different programmers will write the same program with different lines of code equally well. There are other possible metrics, but they all have different flaws and none of them capture the complexities of program size particularly well. Function points for example are meant to determine program size based on functional complexity but does not take into account technical complexity. Agile teams will often used a fuzzy metric called story points formed by team consensus but these are notoriously inaccurate and may change in relative size from sprint to sprint and definitely change in relative size across teams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat complicates things even more is that even the best, most senior programmers can slip into poor program quality due to schedule pressure, unreasonable clients or requirements, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are some pitfalls too in trying to find accurate metrics. There are unpleasant stories of companies wanting to get a more accurate picture of how programmers spend their time so they monitor them while working or interview them regularly about how they work or insist that they maintain accurate timesheets even when working on multiple problems at the same time. Such methods may backfire and have a tendency to even reduce programmer productivity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I would suggest (and probably is unavoidable) is instead a more subjective approach, combining multiple heuristics to get as fair an evaluation as possible. I would suggest something like the following combination:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHave the programmer define his own goals/targets for the evaluation period. At the end of the period, go over the goals with him and discuss how closely he came to meeting them. These may be quantitative targets or qualitative (\u0026ldquo;I feel like my code has been of reasonably good quality\u0026rdquo;). You can compare against the other feedback in this list if there’s any disagreement\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGet feedback from a technical perspective from a mentor or senior developer who has worked closely with the programmer. The feedback can answer some simple questions like \u0026ldquo;Is his technical skill adequate?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Can he be assigned more complex functions?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Has he been assigned the appropriate amount of work?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;Has he created any problems that someone of his skill level should not be expected to do?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;How has he contributed to the overall team?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Does he provide good estimates?\u0026rdquo; etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGet feedback from other people he has worked with. For people who haven’t worked that closely with him, the feedback will be leaning more towards soft skills rather than technical, i.e. how well he works with other people, how manageable he is, how helpful he is, and so on.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the above are subjective, but in combination should give you a relatively good picture of how well the programmer is performing relative to his peers. Optionally, you can combine it with whatever corporate-sanctioned metrics you need as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eWhen blogging and social media started to explode in popularity, it held a great promise: it would give a voice to the masses. Where previously there were gatekeepers in traditional media channels who controlled whose opinions could be published or broadcast, the internet meant that anyone with an internet connection could publish and voice out their thoughts and people would be all smart and there would be lots of intelligent discussion and it would be great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that did kind of happen \u0026ndash; there was now a wealth of information and opinions and discussions online \u0026ndash; but people being people there was a lot of silly, frivolous stuff too. Memes, jokes, 4chan, and all that. And that was all fine and great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was some dark stuff too. Spammers and scammers and whatnot trying to take advantage of people. And more recently with all the political activity it seemed like it had come to a head. Lies, damn lies and propaganda. It had always been happening before, but now the scales were larger and the stakes were higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of discussing opposing points of view, people joined social media groups  supporting one side or another, discussions giving way to echo chambers and crowds castigating people who didn\u0026rsquo;t share their views. Online trolls were paid to harass opposing personalities and reinforce their benefactor\u0026rsquo;s propaganda. Outright false information was spread using social media.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was our fault too. We seek out those opinions that feed our biases and don\u0026rsquo;t bother questioning their veracity. Many times we don\u0026rsquo;t even bother reading past the clickbait headlines and make judgments without all the information because who has time for all that context right? Many acted like fanatics where their side could do no wrong and the other side were demons who could do no right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA friend of mine, disgusted with the outright lies and propaganda of the opposing camps, has started censoring comments he disagrees with on his posts. I felt that stifling discussion was counterproductive, but he insisted that in this new era, a wide variety of approaches was necessary, with both moderates maintaining balanced views and encouraging discussion; and fanatics pushing aggressively to counter the opposing propaganda. Perhaps it was true, but it lessened my hopes that we would be able to raise the standard of online discussion to a higher level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I started writing this post the original title was \u0026ldquo;The Unfulfilled Promise of Social Media\u0026rdquo;, but I realized the adjective there wasn\u0026rsquo;t appropriate. If anything, the promise of democratized discussion has been completely fulfilled \u0026ndash; I had just forgotten that democracy did not necessarily mean people would be smarter or more enlightened. Just like in real-life we are vulnerable to charlatans and demagogues and lies and propaganda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the more reason we need to be vigilant with what we read, share, comment and post online. We need to give adequate consideration to opposing points of view, to weigh the facts against speculation. We need to learn and apply critical thinking, and to teach other people to do so. We should strive to elevate discussions to higher levels (although it can often be tiring to do so!). It is an ongoing struggle for me to improve and be critical of my own thinking, but I believe it to be a worthy cause.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I think many schools will offer that option now.\nIf that option is not available to you, there are a lot of free materials online for self-learning. You could start with languages that don’t need much setup, such as Javascript or Python.",
