Not all of it applies to the site, since I do have a bunch of image content around as well, but enough that I was spurred to apply many of the points and also include some additional changes I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to do. Secondary objectives include: improving site performance, accessibility, and code output; and hopefully making the site menus more organized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLayout changes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSimplified top header content. V-card and some other stuff moved to the footer. Merged \u0026ldquo;Blog\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Notes\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Links\u0026rdquo; into \u0026ldquo;Posts\u0026rdquo; for shorter menu.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRemoved sidebar. Most of the sidebar links for my own use/benefit anyway, and not for the potential blog reader. Most of the content has been moved into the home page, footer, and the new explore page.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdded submenus to most listing pages.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStandardize display of page title/description where possible\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdded support for \u0026ldquo;prefers-color-scheme: light\u0026rdquo;. I still \u003ca href=\"/2021/03/4d1fb5fa3502d4df0ff4f70f9891a7c3/\"\u003edefault to dark mode\u003c/a\u003e though!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSwitched to a monospace font. Honestly I find it hard to decide whether I like monospace or sans-serif more, but let\u0026rsquo;s go with this for now.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCleaned up/reduced the meta info at the bottom of each post.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClient-side performance:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efull-size images are now set to lazy load, so the browser doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to download them all immediately for example when \u003ca href=\"/albums/sketchbook\"\u003eviewing an album\u003c/a\u003e. Only the thumbnails are loaded immediately, full-size images are shown only when activating \u003ca href=\"/2020/07/hugo-lightbox/\"\u003ethe lightbox\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efeatured image for blog posts now use a thumbnail when shown in list view.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also wanted to improve \u003ca href=\"https://www.webbloatscore.com/\"\u003ethe WebBloat score\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s currently fine for text-heavy blog posts, but I guess I can\u0026rsquo;t avoid a higher score for image-heavy content since the crawler they use ignores the fact that I lazy load the full-size images and they are initially hidden. Something to consider in the future.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContent changes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003enew front/home page with content samplers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eadded \u003ca href=\"/explore\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;Explore\u0026rdquo; page\u003c/a\u003e where I can put links that don\u0026rsquo;t belong in any of the submenus\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eimproved \u003ca href=\"/now\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;Now\u0026rdquo; page\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ecleaned up some out of date stuff in the About pages\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003euse profile photo as favicon\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBackend/code changes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHTML Validation: Most pages should now validate without warnings/errors on the \u003ca href=\"https://validator.w3.org/nu\"\u003eW3C HTML validator\u003c/a\u003e. There was actually a lot of broken HTML I had to fix (due to me mistyping things and so on.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMade sure most images had alt-text, even if just default values.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eScore of 75/100 on the \u003ca href=\"https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/roytang.net\"\u003eMozilla Observatory\u003c/a\u003e. It was at 20/100 before. The only thing I hadn\u0026rsquo;t implemented yet was the Content Security Policy (CSP) header, as it would have caused some issues on certain pages.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also tried to generally reduce the page weight, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t actually that high before, so I don\u0026rsquo;t think there\u0026rsquo;s any measurable change there. Minifying HTML/CSS was a possibility, but that just makes it harder for me to debug things, and really feels like something too serious for a hobby site like this.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScripts and cookies:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe site already uses minimal JS in a few places: there\u0026rsquo;s a captcha for comments, and the \u003ca href=\"/locations\"\u003elocations page\u003c/a\u003e requires JS, and some of the stat pages load data remotely via JS, but that should be it. 99% of the pages of the site should be JS free.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also don\u0026rsquo;t use any cookies myself. But I do have Cloudflare enabled on the site, and they do add a \u003ccode\u003e__cfduid\u003c/code\u003e cookie, supposedly to detect bots. This \u003ca href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/deprecating-cfduid-cookie/\"\u003ecookie is being deprecated by May 2021\u003c/a\u003e though, so by then the site should be cookie-free.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat should be it! I had some other features in mind to implement (never ending scope creep when you have a personal project really), but I\u0026rsquo;ve already spent too much time on this and need to work on my other shenanigans as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne last thing: attaching some images so that I can compare to the future look of the website:\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It\u0026rsquo;s not because the book is bad or anything, it\u0026rsquo;s just that Gibson tends to describe everything very vividly, and almost all of it from the POV of our lead character Case, who is sometimes in the real world, sometimes in cyberspace, and sometimes simply just drunk or high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found myself taking time with each scene to visualize where Case was and what was going on. In later parts of the book, it became even more complicated because Case gained the ability to see the world from the POV of his ally, the cybergirl Molly. So for many chapters the POV would consistently shift between Case in the real world, Case in cyberspace, Case looking through Molly\u0026rsquo;s eyes, and so on. Some of it even takes place in space / low-gravity scenarios, so the perspectives being described can be challenging to imagine. Throw in a lot of high-tech / near-future slang and Rastafarian accents and it can make for a challenging read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made it to the end, somehow, though every step of the way I doubted whether I understood what was really going on. In fact, I had to read a plot summary afterwards to confirm that yes, I did in fact understand the story and I was not being dumb. Hard to tell without spoiling anything, but it\u0026rsquo;s really the sort of thing you\u0026rsquo;d expect from a cyberpunk story anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did enjoy the book, though I suspect I would have liked it more as a movie, as that would have been easier to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eWhen I was much younger, I used to strongly identify as \u003ca href=\"/2008/02/im-lawful-good/\"\u003eLawful Good\u003c/a\u003e. Whenever I\u0026rsquo;d play any of the old-school DND RPGs like Baldur\u0026rsquo;s Gate or Neverwinter Nights, I\u0026rsquo;d find my main character almost always being a Lawful Good Paladin goody-goody type. This was back when I was younger and more idealistic and a stronger believer in \u0026ldquo;rule of law\u0026rdquo;-type principles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the years have gone by, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that my alignment has shifted considerably. Part of it is a strong disillusionment with the \u0026ldquo;law\u0026rdquo; part of lawful. As I\u0026rsquo;ve become more immersed with events in my country and the world, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that adherence to law and order isn\u0026rsquo;t always in the best interest of people or society. The imperfect men implementing the laws can always be corrupted or can find ways to abuse or circumvent the law, while staying within the purview of legality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd even in the ideal case where a society is able to consistently \u003ca href=\"/2019/11/laws-not-men/\"\u003eapply the laws over the whims of men\u003c/a\u003e, the laws in place can still be disadvantageous to the progress or greater good of society. Laws in place have a tendency to be used to preserve the status quo, which in many cases means reinforcing inequality or imbalanced power structures, favoring the entrenched and the elite over the greater majority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still largely advocate for following the law and obeying the authorities, but only where it makes sense. In order for society to progress, we must be willing to shake off old norms and challenge the law and authorities where applicable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe original online alignment quiz is no longer available on the current Wizards/DND site, but there are some that have \u003ca href=\"http://easydamus.com/alignmenttest.html\"\u003ereplicated it elsehwere\u003c/a\u003e. I recently took it again to confirm what I\u0026rsquo;ve know for a few years now (image result attached). My current alignment is \u003cstrong\u003eNeutral Good\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://easydamus.com/lawfulgood.html\"\u003eDescription of Lawful Good\u003c/a\u003e | \u003ca href=\"http://www.easydamus.com/neutralgood.html\"\u003eDescription of Neutral Good\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe DND Alignment system is of course an imperfect and vastly oversimplified method of ascertaining one\u0026rsquo;s personality (after all, very few people would openly accept being called \u0026ldquo;Evil\u0026rdquo; on this scale), but I find it can sometimes be helpful as an abstraction of a person\u0026rsquo;s general outlook on life, as long as you know the model\u0026rsquo;s limitations. Individual moments or actions of course, are not obliged to follow one\u0026rsquo;s given alignment, and as it can see here, alignment can easily shift over time. The alignment system is probably roughly as useful as Myers-Briggs.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",

Not surprising, but the show isn\u0026rsquo;t that bad, really.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eOver the past couple of years, I\u0026rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d do reviews of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday\u0026rsquo;s review is for \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1015930/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition/\"\u003eBlood Rage: Digital Edition\u003c/a\u003e. This is a Norse mythology themed game based on a IRL boardgame. It\u0026rsquo;s one of those \u0026ldquo;place your guys on the map\u0026rdquo; boardgame where each player vies for control of provinces. The game is divided into three ages, and at the end of each age one of the provinces is destroyed as part of ragnarok. The players place units in each of the provinces, which have limited slots for units. During your turn you can choose to pillage a province, and other players can fight you for it if they have units there as well or can send units from adjacent provinces. A successfully pillage earns you a stat boost, and successfully defeating other players earns you glory, which is used to score for victory at the end of the game. The age ends when all the provinces have been pillaged or all the players no longer have any possible actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the start of each age the players draft 6 cards that will be available for them to use during the age. These include battle cards (which give you bonuses or abilities when fighting to pillage territories), upgrade cards (which give you either new abilities or new units or monsters to summon, each with special powers), or quests (which give you glory and stat bonuses at the end of the age if you fulfill their conditions).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe battle and upgrade cards are mostly themed around the Norse Gods - Odin, Thor, Loki, Frigga, and Tyr. Each god has a different set of effects, and some can change your strategy so that you can win without having to actually win battles. For example, Tyr\u0026rsquo;s battle cards are all about giving you bonuses to combat, but Loki\u0026rsquo;s cards are all about earning you benefits when you lose combats. In many of our games, one of the player ends up being the \u0026ldquo;Loki player\u0026rdquo; who just joins every battle he can trying to gain those Loki bonuses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBattles are encouraged though; many of the upgrades and quests reward you with more glory for fighting and dying in battle, and having your units destroyed in ragnarok gives glory bonuses as well. At the start of each age, all previously destroyed units are again available for placement, so constantly getting into fights and getting sent to Valhalla can be a strategy as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;ve also gotten and played two of the expansions DLCs: \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1354120/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition__Mystics_of_Midgard/\"\u003eMystics of Midgard\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366580/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition__Gods_of_Asgard/\"\u003eGods of Asgard\u003c/a\u003e (recently released). Mystics add a new unit type that can be drafted, including an annoying unit that can\u0026rsquo;t be killed as long as it has a province to retreat to after battle. The mystics usually end of being high draft picks. Gods of Asgard adds two randomly chosen Norse God figures to the board (among the 5 mentioned above), each one applies special properties to the province where they\u0026rsquo;re in, and they move do a different province after every pillage attempt. For example, Tyr makes it so that battles in the province only count battle cards and not the strength of the involved units; while Frigga makes it so that units in the province cannot die in battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game was a bit buggy when we first got it in mid 2020, since it was just released, but it has steadily improved since then. We played it again recently after some time away and noted many improvements to the UI and quality of life changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game is fun; we\u0026rsquo;ve played a reasonable amount of it (I\u0026rsquo;m at around 47 hours as of this writing.) It\u0026rsquo;s the kind of game where it\u0026rsquo;s easy and fun to mess around with what your opponents are doing, especially if you drafted some of the trickier cards. The only bad side would be that the games tend to go long, especially if someone drafted a good Loki deck or the Mystics are around or other such tricks. In our last session, we played 2 games for around 3 hours total.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Just in time for the one year anniversary of the world\u0026rsquo;s longest lockdown. SinoVac isn\u0026rsquo;t the best choice, but many of my doctor friends say they\u0026rsquo;ll settle for it if that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s available for them. I think QC is planning to use AstraZeneca for their citizens, but worrying is that AZ\u0026rsquo;s efficacy has been shown to be not so good against certain variants such as the South African one, which has already been detected in the country. Cases have been on the rise in the past couple of weeks as well, possibly due to the variants. We may very well be in a race against time now (maybe we always have been). The next month may be the most crucial phase of the pandemic for us, as vaccination drives hopefully kick into gear to try to overcome the accelerating spread.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"links-of-interest\"\u003eLinks of interest:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ohhelloana.blog/catching-up-on-my-bookmarks/\"\u003eOhHelloAna.blog shared a whole bunch of bookmarks\u003c/a\u003e.

Not a big deal, I was just surprised lol.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGenerally the pandemic and the quarantine hasn\u0026rsquo;t hit me as bad as other folks. My day to day routine hasn\u0026rsquo;t actually changed that much, since I didn\u0026rsquo;t really go out too often even pre-pandemic. That being said, I do miss being able to go out to places just to wander around, take my daily walk in a public place like \u003ca href=\"/2021/03/1366349139559129088/\"\u003ethe QC circle\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"/2020/01/saturday-morning-up/\"\u003ethe university campus\u003c/a\u003e, or even just loitering at the mall. It\u0026rsquo;s not that I miss being able to hang out with other people (although I do to some degree as well). More like I miss the ability to be outside, alone, in public, just sitting quietly and letting the universe wash over me.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatching:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWandaVision\u003c/strong\u003e is done!

I have more spoiler-related thoughts, but they may be too much for this space.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m almost done with season 2 of \u003cstrong\u003eStar Trek: Enterprise\u003c/strong\u003e, which means I\u0026rsquo;m about halfway through the series overall.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Flash\u003c/strong\u003e started its new season last week, but it feels like their episodes are like 90% nonsense now. (Used to be closer to 60% nonsense.). Second ep of \u003cstrong\u003eSuperman and Lois\u003c/strong\u003e was okay, although we are definitely getting more moody teenager problems.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGaming:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSecond Fire Emblem Three Houses run: still WIP. Moving forward slowly, ever so slowly.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI got last month\u0026rsquo;s Humble Choice, and decided to go ahead and install and try out some of the games in the bundle.\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI started by playing \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127610/Iris_and_the_Giant/\"\u003eIris and the Giant\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s a nice little tactical battle indie game with CCG mechanics \u0026ndash; think Slay the Spire, but with turn-based tactical RPG battles that can also feel very puzzle-like. I\u0026rsquo;ve been enjoying well-designed indie games recently, and this one seems to fall into that bucket. It has a unique, minimalist aesthetic and the story is about a young girl\u0026rsquo;s mental health? Maybe? I\u0026rsquo;ll know more if I actually managed to finish a run.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also tried to play a game of \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/392110/Endless_Space_2/\"\u003eEndless Space 2\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;m not unfamiliar with 4X games of course, but this one was a bit confusing for me. In the one game where I managed to get anywhere, it felt like I was always behind in tech, and there\u0026rsquo;s so many indicators and UI elements on the different views that I don\u0026rsquo;t really understand. I can see there\u0026rsquo;s going to be a learning curve for this one, so it may take a few games for me to get the hang of it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSpeaking of Humble choice, the next one has Control as a showcase game, but I already got that off PS+, so I think I\u0026rsquo;m pausing on this one.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSaturday regular gaming group decided to play \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1015930/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition/\"\u003eBlood Rage\u003c/a\u003e again yesterday, and we found out there was new DLC so we all decided to buy that and try it out. Might do a review for this game this week!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlso did quite a few Starcraft 2 1v1s with friends this past week. I don\u0026rsquo;t consider myself very proficient with SC2, mostly because I\u0026rsquo;m very micro-averse, but I still enjoy playing it. Maybe not ladder though. We recorded some of our games, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bINjaPjt1M\"\u003ethe first one is up on the Team Camote youtube channel\u003c/a\u003e, if you\u0026rsquo;d like to watch me be terrible.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBecause of reasons, I browsed some Ludum Dare games the other day. My favorite is this short and simple one: \u003ca href=\"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/a-monster-hunter-story\"\u003eA Monster Hunter Story\u003c/a\u003e.

I\u0026rsquo;m about halfway through, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I understand everything that\u0026rsquo;s going on. Might need to look for a recap later on.

            "summary": "March has begun. Did it ever really end?\nThe world:  Vaccination finally starts in the country, with initial donated batches of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccine arriving in the country. Just in time for the one year anniversary of the world\u0026rsquo;s longest lockdown. SinoVac isn\u0026rsquo;t the best choice, but many of my doctor friends say they\u0026rsquo;ll settle for it if that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s available for them. I think QC is planning to use AstraZeneca for their citizens, but worrying is that AZ\u0026rsquo;s efficacy has been shown to be not so good against certain variants such as the South African one, which has already been detected in the country.",
