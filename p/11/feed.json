My only issue with this is that\u0026rsquo;s a relatively new feature. Even though browser support is near universal (minus the much-maligned and quite ancient Internet Explorer), I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if there will be issues or how it renders when viewed in an older browsers or in other contexts such as in a feed reader or a screen reader. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to accidentally show spoilers! I suppose that\u0026rsquo;s a minor concern at this point, and maybe I should just be confident that people who make those tools have taken the visibility toggle into account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(I\u0026rsquo;ve also edited the CSS post to point to this one so anyone who sees it has better information!)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA while back one of the biggest leaks of personal information in history was made by hackers accessing the Commission on Elections database here in the Philippines. More than 50 million voter registration records, including information such as full names, date of birth, address, among others. A small percentage of the data leaked also included email addresses and even passport numbers. The hack exposed more than half of the country’s population to the possibility of social engineering and other exploits.\nIt was certainly a national embarrassment, especially for those of us working in software development. But the truth of the matter is that securing publicly accessible sites against determined bad actors is difficult, very difficult. It’s something that needs to be taken into account on all levels of the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t consider myself any kind of security specialist, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s something that software developers of all levels need to at least have a passing knowledge of, especially in this modern age where many tech companies store personal/private data for large numbers of users. I tend to classify the security practices and vulnerabilities under several levels:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePhysical / hardware layer - this means controlling the physical access of unauthorized personnel to hardware that contains private information. It would take serious levels of screw-ups for a system to be compromised in this manner, or perhaps a well-placed bribe. It is however, comparatively easy to detect any breaches in this layer. In any case, this is not really a concern for the software engineer.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eServer OS and local network level - this means that controlling the access to the actual OS running on the machine and the corresponding local network the server is on. Practically as bad (sometimes worse) than compromising the hardware layer, a compromise on this layer means the bad actor can access everything, possibly remotely, making it much more difficult to detect. Securing your system on this layer involves among other things making sure known vulnerabilities on your OS are patched or worked around and network access is restricted as needed. This is often the concern of people like network engineers or devops people who are setting up and securing your servers.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eApplication container level - this doesn’t necessarily mean your application itself, but typically websites and web applications will be running inside a container software such as a webserver like Apache, Tomcat, ISS, etc. Securing this layer is often just a matter of making sure the latest security patches are applied and known vulnerabilities are closed and access is restricted as needed. If this layer is compromised, the bad actors will typically have access to any files deployed in the container (which may contain other information that will facilitate further leaks). I also include here securing vulnerabilities in the database software used as your backend.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eApplication level - this refers to your security in the design of your application itself. Typically, problems in the first three layers above will be the responsibility of people setting up the servers and the server software, who are probably a different set of people than the development team. Concerns from this layer onwards are more applicable to the actual application developers.  Application-level security can be further broken down into several levels:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUser authentication - this refers to your application’s implementation of user login and session control, and management of things like passwords, password reset requests, two-party authentication, etc. If the implementation is poor, your application may have vulnerabilities like bad actors being able to identify your users’ usernames by enumerating login requests or being able to brute force their passwords.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFunctional security - this refers to how your application grants rights to each user as to which functions in the system he is able to access. As an example, in a typical system, normal users should not be able to access functions restricted to administrator users.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUser-specific Data security - this ensures that only relevant data for each user can be accessed by each user. For example, if I’m logged in as User ID = 1, I shouldn’t be able to view the data for User ID = 2 simply by changing a parameter such as USER_ID=2 in the URL.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDomain-specific security - this refers to additional security rules specific to the domain your application is involved in. For example, your security rules may demand that sensitive information can only be viewed by users with specific privileges and would need to be masked for other users. This may introduce some special logic in your program development.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLogging - applications typically log a lot of information to log files and audit trails, to facilitate debugging of problems and often also for statutory purposes. Security restrictions may require making sure that sensitive data is not included in the logs and audit trails.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCode level - this refers to security in coding practices in both the code used to write your application and also any third-party libraries or frameworks used by the application. This is highly experience-based and requires knowledge of the most common vulnerabilities as a result of coding practices. Organizations such as OWASP regularly publish lists of the most common vulnerabilities, many of them resulting from poor coding decisions such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, etc. Modern frameworks will typically provide standard ways for developers to minimize the chance of introducing the most well-known vulnerabilities.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDatabase level - this refers to security in the design of the database itself. Examples of concerns on this level are whether sensitive information is encrypted or hashed or whether financial data such as credit card information is stored in the database and secured appropriately (for credit card information specifically, there are standards laid out for managing credit card data that you have to comply with in order to be certified to handle credit card transactions). I guess I would also include in this layer how database backups and purged data are handled - are they backed up and encrypted separated from the main database? - although the protection of such backups may be outside the scope of the application developer.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThird party code - modern day applications use a lot of third party libraries and packages, not to mention code that developers are copying from StackOverflow. And rightly so - since using these dependencies means savings in effort and more productivity. But developers need to be aware of the cost every time we add a new dependency; not only are we dependent on that third party library working correctly, but also that it is generally secure. And if a security issue is found, will it be fixed in a timely manner? And this kind of thing can be difficult to track. There have been stories of websites being exposed to security breaches or even things like embedded crypto miners simply because they added a node.js dependency that had another dependency that had another dependency that was compromised. It\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing more senior developers on the team should be aware of and on the lookout for.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn modern settings, developers often specialize into roles like frontend and backend. And one might think that security concerns are limited only to the backend side, but one should not neglect security on the front end either. There are security concerns on the browser/JavaScript level as well, and you have to make sure that your frontend is aligned with the backend\u0026rsquo;s security paradigms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften times many clients will require that a third-party security audit will be done near the end of the project, and the development team will need to address any security concerns that come up during the audit. I’ve been on the receiving end of these a few times and I’ve found the companies doing them to be fairly thorough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s better for your dev team to be generally aware of security best practices from the very beginning, as it may be more costly to correct security problems towards the end of a project. It\u0026rsquo;s the kind of valuable tribal knowledge among developers that you can carry easily across projects and companies and tech stacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "title": "Bespoke vs Product Development",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eFor most of my time working on software projects, it has always been for bespoke projects. Bespoke basically means a software program or package tailor-made for a specific client. The client provides all the requirements, the team fleshes out more details and specifications, some prototyping may or may not ensure, and implementation proceeds thusly. It’s relatively straightforward compared to product development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI only started getting involved with “product”-like projects over the in the latter half of my career as a software developer. A \u0026ldquo;product\u0026rdquo; is a more general use software program or package, perhaps sold to the mass market or as a service. My experience is mostly with products that are targeted towards the public sector (government agencies and such) and not for general consumer use. Though I imagine many similar issues and pitfalls as I discuss here can occur in other types of product development as well. These are largely issues of \u0026ldquo;building for multiple clients\u0026rdquo; as opposed to \u0026ldquo;building for a specific client\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe project lifecycle is markedly different: you start with an idea for a product, perhaps based on something you’ve already built before, and shop it around to potential clients who could use such a system. A number of clients put out tenders for projects where they specify it has to be a pre-built product instead of a bespoke solution. Typically you use the requirements from these tenders to direct your development while you don’t have clients signed up yet. That’s right, you start development work ahead of time even when you don’t have clients signed up yet. These tenders typically have significant lead time before the actual implementation, so you kind of hope that if you somehow magically win with your proposal, you have everything (or at least most of it) done and in place and ready for the client.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTenders can also sometimes have a requirement to have a demonstration during the tendering process. Therein lies the first problem - since you probably don’t have the product ready yet, there’s probably some crunch time needed in preparing and setting up the demo. Some iffy code will need to be written, sacrificing code quality and maintainability in order to meet the timescales for the demo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, since you want to gain traction as quickly as possible, you try to shop around to as many clients as you can. That means you try to bid for as many tenders as you can, and different clients can have different requirements. This of course creates more problems for the development team in the form of conflicting requirements and even worse, possibly conflicting demo schedules. It’s something that management has to be cognizant of and the company will need to pick and choose its battles. Poorly handled, it could put a lot of pressure on the development team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was discussing this the other day with a younger developer working in another company. They were working on a project that was headed in this direction and he was asking whether things would get better once they have more things, and I kind of laughed a little bit before telling him there’s a good chance it would get worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem of conflicting requirements gets even more complicated when the clients are actually paying for your product because now you have even more responsibility to fulfill their custom requirements. One would think that if you were making an off the shelf product you’re not really subject to the whims of the clients too much, but when you’re trying to gain traction in an existing market you will sometimes need to make compromises to get clients to choose you over more established products, which probably means catering more to their whims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd really, even clients in the same space needing the same product will have their own requirements, idiosyncrasies and ways of doing things. Sometimes even when there are statutes in place dictating standards (like what data should be recorded and so on), different clients will still have different ways of meeting those standards such that your system may not be able to cater for all of the differences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, your product has been planned with such variations in requirements in mind. This means making your system flexible and/or configurable enough to handle any differences between clients, or at least changes can be kept small and manageable between clients. This assumes of course that you had the foresight to predict ahead of time what the differences would be and planned your system architecture accordingly, and that you didn’t have a lot of poor and hard-to-maintain code littered throughout your system because of needing to meet conflicting demo requirements! The more customizable your system needs to be, the more well-structured, modular and lightly coupled the code has to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you don’t have the above, well then likely you’re looking at introducing even more bad code and stretching your code base with code smells everywhere in order to accommodate tight deadlines and conflicting requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s also a lot more that would need to be customizable than you might expect. Some things that clients want tailored for their needs are: UI theme or individual UI elements; menu structures; field names and error messages; message/email/notification templates; access control rights; form layouts, what fields are included in each form, field validation logic; reports, what fields are included, and even retrieval logic. These are just some examples, there are many more that are difficult to foresee just how the clients might want them customized, so most likely even with the best-designed system there will still need to be some level of customization done for each client.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow to avoid such pitfalls? It helps if your product has a strong identity and design from the very start, but that means having a strong product manager or management team with a good understanding of the domain required for your system. The product manager will need to manage the clients’ requirements and the direction of future development. The product manager has to be able to assess the client requests and say “no, that’s not how our product works,” when faced with requests that will make things more complicated for the development team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe above are drawn from my personal experience and from a few other developers’. I’m sure there are ways to handle product development to avoid these problems of course, but I believe that far more projects encounter these difficulties than do not, but it mostly comes down to management understanding the concerns and making adjustments to resources and schedules accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "For most of my time working on software projects, it has always been for bespoke projects. Bespoke basically means a software program or package tailor-made for a specific client. The client provides all the requirements, the team fleshes out more details and specifications, some prototyping may or may not ensure, and implementation proceeds thusly. It’s relatively straightforward compared to product development.\nI only started getting involved with “product”-like projects over the in the latter half of my career as a software developer.",

Looks like they\u0026rsquo;ll have more to do for me next week so at least I\u0026rsquo;m keeping busy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso managed to do two online quiz nights again, doing more poorly this time, but still pretty fun. The second one was held last night (Black Saturday), and it was a team effort, so it involved our trivia team on an FB Messenger call while watching the quiz via FB live. FB Live sucks for this kind of thing due to lag, but we had fun (but still did not do well.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince it\u0026rsquo;s Easter Sunday and the folks haven\u0026rsquo;t seen their grandkids for a while, me and the bros set up a Zoom call so all the grandkids could see the grandparents, everyone all together at once. As could be expected, it was kind of chaotic, but also all kinds of fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"watching-lately\"\u003eWatching lately\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the weekend to watch a few movies, notably completing the Hobbit trilogy. This trilogy wasn\u0026rsquo;t as good as the LotR one (talk about high bar to meet right?), but pretty watchable in its own right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also watched The Departed, pretty intense movie. Gradually building up to watching the Irishman on Netflix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I watched this fantastic collaborative fan-made shot-by-shot remake of Back to the Future II put together during quarantine, featuring all kinds of ridiculousness: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcUUjWbVc4I\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcUUjWbVc4I\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheck the \u003ca href=\"/page/lists/2020/movies/\"\u003e2020 movies page\u003c/a\u003e for my commentary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, I also rewatched the last two seasons of Community (now surprisingly available on both Netflix and Prime Video at the same time!), mostly to prep for a trivia round, but also because it\u0026rsquo;s a fun underrated show and more people should watch it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome things of interest:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ai-art.tokyo/en#/\"\u003eAl Gahaku\u003c/a\u003e, an AI \u0026ldquo;artist\u0026rdquo; that takes an existing photograph and modifies it to look like a renaissance-style painting.

I had a Deluxe edition preorder with our local game store, but given they\u0026rsquo;re all closed IDK how that\u0026rsquo;s going to work now. The store collected information from everyone who preordered so that they can give out info, but no updates yet. I suspect they\u0026rsquo;re going to try to set up some kind of delivery service, but don\u0026rsquo;t want to promise too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlas even if I could get my FF7R copy, I don\u0026rsquo;t even have my PS4 at home as it was borrowed by my brother in February. I was planning to get it back right before the FF7R release, but eh, life in quarantine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dug up some old draft blog posts that I never published, so I polished them up and we should have some new content for the coming week (other than these weeknotes).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than that, I\u0026rsquo;ve been considering re-organizing how this blog/site is organized. I was recently reading Kev Quirk\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://kevq.uk/why-i-dont-use-a-static-site-generator/\"\u003epost about why he doesn\u0026rsquo;t use a static site generator\u003c/a\u003e, it kind of tempted me to consider switching back to Wordpress. The main problem with Hugo running this site at the moment is that the build time is quite long, so feedback can take a while. (Still the same issue I \u003ca href=\"/2019/11/one-year-with-hugo/\"\u003ereported in November\u003c/a\u003e.) Anyway, I considered going back to Wordpress, and while that\u0026rsquo;s certainly a viable solution, there are some things that I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of doing that would be complicated to do in Wordpress\u0026rsquo;s data structure. Also, my gut doesn\u0026rsquo;t like the idea, although there are certainly some pros. I\u0026rsquo;ll need to think about this a bit more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeday, we\u0026rsquo;ll find our way back to the world we once knew, but it will have moved beyond us.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I\u0026rsquo;m writing this early in the morning, so IDK yet how the church will adapt the usual fanfare to this whole pandemic thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe summer heat has begun to settle in during the last few weeks of quarantine. I can\u0026rsquo;t sit without a shirt or rest or my arms anywhere without sweat threatening to accumulate on the contact surface. Coincidentally around the first week of the lockdown, our aircon in the only airconditioned room in the house started making funny noises so we\u0026rsquo;ve stopped using it. At least we get to save electricty?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall this week much less productive than the last. I felt a stronger tendency to \u0026ldquo;veg out\u0026rdquo; as it were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t get to write any new blog posts this week (other than the weeknotes). It seems kind of difficult to get your thoughts together when your brain is constantly distracted by the state of the world. I mean, how could I ever finish a post titled \u0026ldquo;Things learned from a crisis\u0026rdquo; when things are moving so quickly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWork has gotten a bit busier this week, as there are some things a client is asking me to do that he says are urgent, but really is little more than just saving them a bit of effort by automating stuff. I will say however that I\u0026rsquo;m amazed how strong his business still seems to be going, given they\u0026rsquo;re an industry that I don\u0026rsquo;t really consider essential. Still, more work is fine, as it helps distract me from the prevailing mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe did two online quiz nights again. I even managed to win one of them! These are a fun distraction (even though there are no prizes!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"watching-lately\"\u003eWatching lately\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSeason 4 of Kim\u0026rsquo;s Convenience came out on Netflix. It continues to be an light, enjoyable and easy to binge show, though the season was only 13 eps long so it was over quickly.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also finished watching Star Trek: Picard S1, via Prime Video.\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt started off slow, and I was worried it would be one of those conspiracy theory shows where the conspiracy part dragged on forever (X-Files may have traumatized me a bit).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBut it wasn\u0026rsquo;t! It started picking up the pace around episode 5 or 6, as the elements behind the conspiracy came back into view.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnd while Picard\u0026rsquo;s new crew seemed so motely and largely unnecessary during the first half, they each ended up with satisfying character arcs and backstories\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cdetails class=\"spoiler\"\u003e\n    \u003csummary\u003e(Spoilers)\u003c/summary\u003e\n    although the reveal Rios\u0026rsquo; history that ties in to the whole synth issue seems awfully convenient.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cp /\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m glad we got to revisit old friends like Seven of Nine, Data, Riker and Troi, and even Hugh, just to see what they\u0026rsquo;ve been up to.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI must admit I felt a great deal of satisfaction when \n\u003cdetails class=\"spoiler\"\u003e\n    \u003csummary\u003e(Spoilers)\u003c/summary\u003e\n    Riker shows up near the end with a whole armada (although realistically it seems logistically impossible for Starfleet to have put such a large number of top-of-the-line ships together so quickly)\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cp /\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eonly 1 new movie watched this week, the first of the Hobbit trilogy.

If you like perusing people\u0026rsquo;s personal sites, this one is always fun to check out, and the current release has a ton of sites!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"gaming\"\u003eGaming\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew Humble\u0026rsquo;s Choice is kind of meh for me. I may pause again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLots of multiplayer gaming again this week. SC2 with my usual gaming group. Armello with my other gaming group. And now even my brothers are asking around if we all have Left 4 Dead 2 installed (but we haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten around to a session yet.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo progress on Megaman LC this week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI purchased Divinity: Original Sin 2 a couple of weeks ago in anticipation of an extended lockdown and finally started it up this week. I played a premade character first to get a feel of things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, this week was the start of spoiler season for the next MTG set, Ikoria. And it\u0026rsquo;s kind of crazy; they\u0026rsquo;re doing a crossover with Toho to feature Godzilla-themed alters for certain cards. There was a leak before that Godzilla would be in the set, which seemed ridiculous, but here we are! I think the set comes out in a week, and it looks pretty sweet, looking forward to playing it on Arena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonal projects: Thinking of finally adding a set of new trivia questions to the \u003ca href=\"https://triviastorm.net/\"\u003etrivia app\u003c/a\u003e. Mostly because our quizzing activity has kind of gone up while in quarantine (including random friends sharing quizzes etc.) A lot of the older questions/answers are kind of low quality too, so I want to implement some kind of weighted random selection so that newer questions are more likely to be picked. But first I need to cobble together a decent data set. Most of it will be movie and TV related I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecent site changes: Not much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s highly probably that our lockdown is going to be extended by at least a month. Sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
