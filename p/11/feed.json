            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eOver the past couple of years, I\u0026rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d do reviews of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday\u0026rsquo;s review is for \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1015930/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition/\"\u003eBlood Rage: Digital Edition\u003c/a\u003e. This is a Norse mythology themed game based on a IRL boardgame. It\u0026rsquo;s one of those \u0026ldquo;place your guys on the map\u0026rdquo; boardgame where each player vies for control of provinces. The game is divided into three ages, and at the end of each age one of the provinces is destroyed as part of ragnarok. The players place units in each of the provinces, which have limited slots for units. During your turn you can choose to pillage a province, and other players can fight you for it if they have units there as well or can send units from adjacent provinces. A successfully pillage earns you a stat boost, and successfully defeating other players earns you glory, which is used to score for victory at the end of the game. The age ends when all the provinces have been pillaged or all the players no longer have any possible actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the start of each age the players draft 6 cards that will be available for them to use during the age. These include battle cards (which give you bonuses or abilities when fighting to pillage territories), upgrade cards (which give you either new abilities or new units or monsters to summon, each with special powers), or quests (which give you glory and stat bonuses at the end of the age if you fulfill their conditions).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe battle and upgrade cards are mostly themed around the Norse Gods - Odin, Thor, Loki, Frigga, and Tyr. Each god has a different set of effects, and some can change your strategy so that you can win without having to actually win battles. For example, Tyr\u0026rsquo;s battle cards are all about giving you bonuses to combat, but Loki\u0026rsquo;s cards are all about earning you benefits when you lose combats. In many of our games, one of the player ends up being the \u0026ldquo;Loki player\u0026rdquo; who just joins every battle he can trying to gain those Loki bonuses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBattles are encouraged though; many of the upgrades and quests reward you with more glory for fighting and dying in battle, and having your units destroyed in ragnarok gives glory bonuses as well. At the start of each age, all previously destroyed units are again available for placement, so constantly getting into fights and getting sent to Valhalla can be a strategy as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;ve also gotten and played two of the expansions DLCs: \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1354120/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition__Mystics_of_Midgard/\"\u003eMystics of Midgard\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366580/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition__Gods_of_Asgard/\"\u003eGods of Asgard\u003c/a\u003e (recently released). Mystics add a new unit type that can be drafted, including an annoying unit that can\u0026rsquo;t be killed as long as it has a province to retreat to after battle. The mystics usually end of being high draft picks. Gods of Asgard adds two randomly chosen Norse God figures to the board (among the 5 mentioned above), each one applies special properties to the province where they\u0026rsquo;re in, and they move do a different province after every pillage attempt. For example, Tyr makes it so that battles in the province only count battle cards and not the strength of the involved units; while Frigga makes it so that units in the province cannot die in battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game was a bit buggy when we first got it in mid 2020, since it was just released, but it has steadily improved since then. We played it again recently after some time away and noted many improvements to the UI and quality of life changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game is fun; we\u0026rsquo;ve played a reasonable amount of it (I\u0026rsquo;m at around 47 hours as of this writing.) It\u0026rsquo;s the kind of game where it\u0026rsquo;s easy and fun to mess around with what your opponents are doing, especially if you drafted some of the trickier cards. The only bad side would be that the games tend to go long, especially if someone drafted a good Loki deck or the Mystics are around or other such tricks. In our last session, we played 2 games for around 3 hours total.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Just in time for the one year anniversary of the world\u0026rsquo;s longest lockdown. SinoVac isn\u0026rsquo;t the best choice, but many of my doctor friends say they\u0026rsquo;ll settle for it if that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s available for them. I think QC is planning to use AstraZeneca for their citizens, but worrying is that AZ\u0026rsquo;s efficacy has been shown to be not so good against certain variants such as the South African one, which has already been detected in the country. Cases have been on the rise in the past couple of weeks as well, possibly due to the variants. We may very well be in a race against time now (maybe we always have been). The next month may be the most crucial phase of the pandemic for us, as vaccination drives hopefully kick into gear to try to overcome the accelerating spread.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"links-of-interest\"\u003eLinks of interest:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ohhelloana.blog/catching-up-on-my-bookmarks/\"\u003eOhHelloAna.blog shared a whole bunch of bookmarks\u003c/a\u003e.

My day to day routine hasn\u0026rsquo;t actually changed that much, since I didn\u0026rsquo;t really go out too often even pre-pandemic. That being said, I do miss being able to go out to places just to wander around, take my daily walk in a public place like \u003ca href=\"/2021/03/1366349139559129088/\"\u003ethe QC circle\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"/2020/01/saturday-morning-up/\"\u003ethe university campus\u003c/a\u003e, or even just loitering at the mall. It\u0026rsquo;s not that I miss being able to hang out with other people (although I do to some degree as well).

Moving forward slowly, ever so slowly.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI got last month\u0026rsquo;s Humble Choice, and decided to go ahead and install and try out some of the games in the bundle.\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI started by playing \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127610/Iris_and_the_Giant/\"\u003eIris and the Giant\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s a nice little tactical battle indie game with CCG mechanics \u0026ndash; think Slay the Spire, but with turn-based tactical RPG battles that can also feel very puzzle-like. I\u0026rsquo;ve been enjoying well-designed indie games recently, and this one seems to fall into that bucket. It has a unique, minimalist aesthetic and the story is about a young girl\u0026rsquo;s mental health? Maybe? I\u0026rsquo;ll know more if I actually managed to finish a run.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also tried to play a game of \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/392110/Endless_Space_2/\"\u003eEndless Space 2\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;m not unfamiliar with 4X games of course, but this one was a bit confusing for me. In the one game where I managed to get anywhere, it felt like I was always behind in tech, and there\u0026rsquo;s so many indicators and UI elements on the different views that I don\u0026rsquo;t really understand. I can see there\u0026rsquo;s going to be a learning curve for this one, so it may take a few games for me to get the hang of it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSpeaking of Humble choice, the next one has Control as a showcase game, but I already got that off PS+, so I think I\u0026rsquo;m pausing on this one.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSaturday regular gaming group decided to play \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1015930/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition/\"\u003eBlood Rage\u003c/a\u003e again yesterday, and we found out there was new DLC so we all decided to buy that and try it out. Might do a review for this game this week!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlso did quite a few Starcraft 2 1v1s with friends this past week. I don\u0026rsquo;t consider myself very proficient with SC2, mostly because I\u0026rsquo;m very micro-averse, but I still enjoy playing it. Maybe not ladder though. We recorded some of our games, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bINjaPjt1M\"\u003ethe first one is up on the Team Camote youtube channel\u003c/a\u003e, if you\u0026rsquo;d like to watch me be terrible.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBecause of reasons, I browsed some Ludum Dare games the other day. My favorite is this short and simple one: \u003ca href=\"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/a-monster-hunter-story\"\u003eA Monster Hunter Story\u003c/a\u003e.

America is back, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThis past week, embrassingly our local police and anti-drug agency got into a \u003ca href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/pnp-pdea-shootout-bungled-buy-bust-operation-ever-gotesco-quezon-city\"\u003eshootout\u003c/a\u003e \u003cem\u003eagainst each other\u003c/em\u003e near the Ever Gotesco mall in Quezon City. Both sides claim they were doing a buy-bust, which is impossible. As usual, there is little transparency about what actually happened, and many promises of \u0026ldquo;impartial\u0026rdquo; probes and investigations. People speculate that at least one of the parties involved really was dealing drugs, and they got into a shootout because they were afraid of being EJK\u0026rsquo;ed.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"links-of-interest\"\u003eLinks of interest:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t have any of these today, sadly. This is why I don\u0026rsquo;t have a newsletter, I\u0026rsquo;m unable to promise regular content lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"my-stuff\"\u003eMy stuff:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThis week was busy with family and medical errands, so not much else was accomplished.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/albums/sketchbook/\"\u003eStill sketching\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatching:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWandaVision\u003c/strong\u003e penultimate ep, people still liked it, but it was a bit meh for me. Still looking forward to next week\u0026rsquo;s finale, as there are still so many things to wrap up!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStarted watching \u003cstrong\u003eStar Trek: Enterprise\u003c/strong\u003e, the last of the non-animated Trek shows I have yet to watch. (I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen the TOS animated series). It\u0026rsquo;s Scott Bakula! Their uniforms here remind me of something like modern astronaut wear, so I assume they wanted something closer to \u0026ldquo;modern day\u0026rdquo; Earth to bridge to the Star Trek future. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting because at this point the relationship between the humans and Vulcans isn\u0026rsquo;t well established, there is no federation, no prime directive, etc, so we get to see the beginnings of those things later on I guess?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlso watched a couple of movies this week. First was \u003cstrong\u003eSpace Sweepers\u003c/strong\u003e, a Korean space sci-fi adventure on Netflix. Entertaining enough, though the plot is easily predictable and the villain seemed like a moron. Great visuals and special effects, miles apart from anything local cinema has to offer. One-inch barrier of subtitles, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSecond movie was \u003cstrong\u003eOnce Upon A Time In Hollywood\u003c/strong\u003e. This was a very laid-back, relaxed movie, unfolding mostly as a series of slice-of-life vignettes of what life was like Hollywood in 1969, with no real plot urgency to speak of. The climax sort of just happens through no real actions by the main characters. Fairly long, took me four sittings to get through. Was surprised to find out later that it was based on a true story of a massacre that took place at that time, with Margot Robbie playing a real-life actress who was the victim in the actual massacre. The story unfolds a bit differently, probably due to the presence of fictional protagonists Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth (portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt). Bruce Lee also makes an appearance!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLast week was also the premiere of \u003cstrong\u003eSuperman and Lois\u003c/strong\u003e on CW. I still like these positive portrayals of Superman better than something like Snyder\u0026rsquo;s Man of Steel, although I\u0026rsquo;m a bit meh on the premiere overall. Everything about the teens gives me Smallville vibes. They had a really big missed opportunity to \u003ca href=\"/2021/02/1364758520885772288/\"\u003ematch a scene from the opening sequence with a classic comic cover\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGaming:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePlayed a bit of Civ6 now that the Barbarian Clans mode has dropped. Restarted a few times with Kublai Khan before I got a decent start. Not super impressed with the Barbarian Clans mode so far, seems like the main effect is that we get more city-states going into the endgame. Will probably still try it out for a few games.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSecond Fire Emblem Three Houses run still in progress, finally got to the Edelgard decision point, and went as I planned.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHave been trying to figure out why I\u0026rsquo;m having \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/lquag0/sf5_is_it_expected_to_be_so_hard_to_find_a_match/\"\u003eso much trouble finding matches in Street Fighter V\u003c/a\u003e. Still no luck though. I want to indulge myself by getting the season 5 pass, but it\u0026rsquo;s not worth it if I can\u0026rsquo;t actually find matches.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlways annoying whenever this happens, but next month\u0026rsquo;s PS+ games include FF7 Remake, which I\u0026rsquo;ve already played and finished. Good for everyone else though! New content was also announced for the PS5 version of the game, which is also annoying since it\u0026rsquo;s probably goinna be a while before I bother with a PS5 (maybe waiting for a smaller version!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEdit: One of my loyal readers pointed out I failed to mention that we played a few games of 4-player Free For All in Starcraft 2 last Saturday.
