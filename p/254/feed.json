Most of the GL history seems to be intact, and the GL books are all leading towards some sort of \u0026ldquo;third army\u0026rdquo; event, I hope it happens soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eGreen Lantern Corps\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting enough for me to want to read it before AvX #6 this week\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eGreen Lantern: New Guardians\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting, but I don\u0026rsquo;t see where this is going. Is it possible for Raynier\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Rainbow Guardians\u0026rdquo; to become a real team?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eRed Lanterns\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; mildly interesting, but I don\u0026rsquo;t see where this is going. I\u0026rsquo;m not convinced the Reds were the best corps to give their own series\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTeen Titans\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting for me, but only because Red Robin is here. The team\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;coming together adventure\u0026rdquo; has been going on for far too long and they need to reach some sort of status quo\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBlue Beetle\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting, but the character has yet to find a status quo\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eLegion of Super-Heroes\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting storylines, but way too many characters, not very accessible\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eLegion Lost\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting, but they can\u0026rsquo;t get back to their own time without changing the book title, so it kinda limits what\u0026rsquo;s going to happen and makes them always on the run\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAll-Star Western\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting, but weird. Not really a superhero book, though it has ties to Gotham City. I\u0026rsquo;m not particularly interested in the backup stories though\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDeathstroke\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; not interesting, seems to be mostly just Slade killing a bunch of guys for one reason or another. I\u0026rsquo;m not confident about it with Liefeld coming on, but I\u0026rsquo;ll probably still read it for a while since I can\u0026rsquo;t resist a  train wreck\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSuicide Squad\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; meh, the squad composition at the moment isn\u0026rsquo;t very interesting, the only real personalities there are Deadshot and Harley (at least they\u0026rsquo;re giving her something to do aside from being a Joker fangirl)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eStormwatch\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; mildly interesting, if only because they\u0026rsquo;re going to need to be fighting the JL at some point. Some of their science-y explanations are ridiculous though\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eGrifter\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; meh, doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be going anywhere serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eVoodoo\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; meh, not sure where it\u0026rsquo;s going. Also, with all this Daemonite activity going on, how is it Stormwatch isn\u0026rsquo;t seriously cracking down on them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eResurrection Man\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; I like the concept, but the storyline seems to be going nowhere serious\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMan O War\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; I tried to bear with this, but it just bored me. I only managed to read up to issue 7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eJustice League Dark\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting, though they\u0026rsquo;re not really a real \u0026ldquo;team\u0026rdquo; at the moment. But the team composition is solid, especially they dropped Shade who wasn\u0026rsquo;t really doing anything for the book. Andrew Bennet seems a better fit\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSwamp Thing\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting, but might be a bit too weird for some, since a lot of the book feels like Alec Holland being on an acid trip of some sort. Feels very Vertigo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnimal Man\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; see Swamp Thing. Art is pretty good, but still weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFrankenstein, Agent of SHADE\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; interesting enough. Art is\u0026hellip;  unique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eI, Vampire\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; surprisingly interesting, even if I\u0026rsquo;m already reading another Vampire series (American Vampire). Curious to see where it goes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDemon Knights\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; surprisingly interesting, the team composition is nice and varied (Vandal Savage, wut) and the storylines are a fresh reprieve from superhero stuff\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDC Comics Presents\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; Deadman was ok, Challengers less interesting for me. Good series for them to keep around and showcase lesser-known characters\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the second wave of the New 52, of which we are only one or two issues in:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBatman Incorporated\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; looking good, easily better than both Detective and Dark Knight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEarth 2\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; the second issue was a bit slow, but it looks interesting enough\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWorlds\u0026rsquo; Finest\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; the first issue wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best, but I like the idea of this comic so I\u0026rsquo;ll keep reading it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDial H\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; off to a good start, but I can\u0026rsquo;t help but wonder whether they\u0026rsquo;ll be running out of hero ideas at some point. Also, Pelican Army!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eGI Combat\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; okay, I didn\u0026rsquo;t like the last war book, I\u0026rsquo;m not gonna bother with this one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Ravagers\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ndash; giving this a shot, although at the moment it just seems like another \u0026ldquo;bunch of super teens on the run from evil forces\u0026rdquo; kinda deal, and that\u0026rsquo;s already what Teen Titans is doing at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m probably going to keep on reading a good 70-80% of the books going forward, I don\u0026rsquo;t feel compelled to read every single one of them any more. It\u0026rsquo;s still a good chunk of books to read, and makes me look forward to the new releases every week.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I finished 11 and 4, which was good enough for 39th place despite my pretty bad tiebreaks. This means I finished in the money, hooray! Feels good to have a decent finish after playing this game for what, seventeen years now? Playing in Day 2 was great, the tables weren\u0026rsquo;t as crowded as Day One! Hah. I still made a lot of bad plays though, I mostly got lucky with a lot of my wins. With tighter play I might have gone as good as 13-2.\u003cfigure style=\"width: 540px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nOZlY4k8DC8/T99O13bdziI/AAAAAAAAAOU/t5RzS6Rhafo/s720/IMG_20120617_155930.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg title=\"My finish\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nOZlY4k8DC8/T99O13bdziI/AAAAAAAAAOU/t5RzS6Rhafo/s720/IMG_20120617_155930.jpg\" alt=\"My finish\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003e39th!\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from the main event, another thing I participated in during the second day was the Magic Rules Challenge! This was a fun thing they had where they set up a booth manned by a couple of judges. You could go up to them (no entrance fee) and answer up to three rules questions in a row. If you get questions right, you get foil cards! Well, the foil cards I won weren\u0026rsquo;t very useful or valuable, but I had a lot of fun with the rules questions themselves, I really enjoy that stuff. I\u0026rsquo;d hang out there between rounds not only to join but also to watch other people play.

Makes me excited about playing Magic again. Looking forward to the next GP Manila in a couple of years!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
