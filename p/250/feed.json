Writer Dan Slott is very excited for the last two issues of the Amazing Spider-man run and has been hyping it up. A lot of fans are worried at where the franchise is going and who the new Superior Spider-Man will be, Dan Slott has two issues left to wrap things up in a satisfactory fashion and provide us an ending that lives up to the hype.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing as how I\u0026rsquo;m always gushing about Bendis and Immonen\u0026rsquo;s new flagship X-Men book, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a surprise that \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview\u0026amp;id=14400\"\u003eAll-New X-Men #3\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e rounds out the top of my list, hopefully the creative team gives us some fresh action this time around, looking forward to the original five coming face-to-face with present day Scott Summers!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonorable mentions: \u003cstrong\u003eHawkeye #5\u003c/strong\u003e is also out this week and has been a great book so far.

But that may have been a product of reading too many preview pages so that basically the only surprise I got was the shock ending of what Red Skull was doing to Xavier\u0026rsquo;s corpse. The second issue felt a lot better though, there were some scenes that I felt were quite well-written - Havok receiving the old man\u0026rsquo;s thanks, the scenes with the mutants while watching Honest John\u0026rsquo;s broadcasts, how Rogue manages to escape her captors, etc. Also, how great of a villain name is \u0026ldquo;Honest John the Living Propaganda?\u0026rdquo; Heh. (I think he\u0026rsquo;s a new guy introduced by Remender, I can\u0026rsquo;t find any info from before this issue). I\u0026rsquo;m not a big fan of Cassaday\u0026rsquo;s artwork (which contributed to my being underwhelmed by the first issue) - it feels like he\u0026rsquo;s a bit hit or miss. There are some great panels here, but there are also some that are drawn strangely (Lilandra looks bald in one of the panels - that may have been a colorist problem though). Still, Remender\u0026rsquo;s writing more than makes up for the art, though I do hope Cassaday can keep to schedule so that the book doesn\u0026rsquo;t slip schedules too much (see: \u003cem\u003eAstonishing X-Men)\u003c/em\u003e, I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to where the Red Skull is taking is!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll-New X-Men #2 (Marvel)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#e4829a85d8af806dff2f15de299344bc-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/this-week-in-comics-2012-12-01/all-new-x-men-2-561_hudcc67953afc8cd2d65625691e23e992e_115800_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"e4829a85d8af806dff2f15de299344bc-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/this-week-in-comics-2012-12-01/all-new-x-men-2-561.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"30 Nov 2012 1:09pm\"\u003e30 Nov 2012 1:09pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI was quite excited for the second issue of Bendis\u0026rsquo; X-Men and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t disappointed. The art team was great on this book, on par with the first. Immonen\u0026rsquo;s pencils look better with the coloring in ANXM compared to his New Avengers run (though that was great too!). Bendis is known for being a great dialogue writer and he doesn\u0026rsquo;t disappoint. There are some great scenes here with Hank trying to convince the young ones to go along with him, Wolverine\u0026rsquo;s reaction to Jean, Iceman\u0026rsquo;s reaction to himself, and that ending - well, you bring five teenagers who are used to saving the world into a situation like that, what did you think they were going to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuick Hits - Other Marvel\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#072bf4fc851018093eac411e7f0714eb-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/this-week-in-comics-2012-12-01/a\u0026#43;x2_hu4d86e8271e97ecc9d28133b7c006ac60_1787552_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"072bf4fc851018093eac411e7f0714eb-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/this-week-in-comics-2012-12-01/a\u0026#43;x2.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"30 Nov 2012 1:09pm\"\u003e30 Nov 2012 1:09pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA+X #2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a book I read simply because Chris Bachalo was drawing the Rogue/Black Widow story, I\u0026rsquo;m kind of excited to be having Bachalo and Immonen be the regular X-men artists once the new \u003cem\u003eUncanny X-Men\u003c/em\u003e launches, I really enjoy their work. The other story in this issue is Kitty Pride visiting Stark Resilient with a cold (the cold is relevant to the story!)  \u003cstrong\u003eThor - God of Thunder #2\u003c/strong\u003e shifts the focus back to young viking Thor with only glimpses of what\u0026rsquo;s happening to his future selves.

Which is fine, I guess it gives Hickman more space for his upcoming Avengers run. \u003cstrong\u003eX-Men Legacy #2\u003c/strong\u003e felt like it had just a bit too much of traipsing inside Legion\u0026rsquo;s mindscape, but at least we finally get to see some of the other X-Men (it\u0026rsquo;s not a solo book, right?) \u003cstrong\u003eX-Treme X-Men #7 \u003c/strong\u003eis still a terribly named book, and the art in this issue was a bit off for me.

The main draw for me is the artwork headlined by Rocafort; this issue\u0026rsquo;s pencils and coloring are great, especially with the level of detail. This issue gives us a bit more insight into Clark\u0026rsquo;s current status, especially vis-a-vis his pre-New 52 love Lois Lane. The rest of the book involve Clark and Kara getting beat up by a strange new visitor from their home planet, and it looks like Clark and Kara\u0026rsquo;s relationship isn\u0026rsquo;t going to get better anytime soon. This may be Kara\u0026rsquo;s new status quo for the New 52, maybe they want her be more stand alone from her famous cousin this time around.

There\u0026rsquo;s even a scene where Black Manta is explaining how strong Arthur is even outside of the seas.

This future was last seen in Batman #666 (pre-New 52, also written by Morrison). \u003cstrong\u003eTalon #2\u003c/strong\u003e was okay, though the art wasn\u0026rsquo;t very good for me. I like that the book basically giving DC a way to flesh out the Court of Owls after Snyder introduced them in Batman, but aside from that they\u0026rsquo;re going to have to grow Calvin Rose into his own character. \u003cstrong\u003eSavage Hawkman #14 \u003c/strong\u003ewraps up his crossovers with \u003cem\u003eGreen Arrow\u003c/em\u003e and Deathstroke, although everything is told in an unusual chronological order. They probably just put GA and Hawkman together as a prelude to their teaming up in the upcoming \u003cem\u003eJLA\u003c/em\u003e book. From this issue it looks like there are more Thanagarians on Earth than we expected - they were a pretty big deal pre-New 52 so who knows what they have planned for Thanagar these days. \u003cstrong\u003eTeen Titans #14\u003c/strong\u003e wraps up the Cassie origin story but to be honest it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like it resolved very much.
