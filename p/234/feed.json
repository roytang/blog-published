            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eSo in this dream, I was taking part in some sort of problem-solving contest. The other participants were people I knew (relatives, friends, coworkers and the like). The fate of the world may have been on the line or something.  Anyway, they give us the problems to solve and there\u0026rsquo;s three questions and the questions are hard: each question gives you a bunch of real-world facts and you have to find out a specific piece of information, but it looks they\u0026rsquo;ll be requiring a lot of computation and stuff.   I ask I can go do the solving in my room (conveniently, the contest is taking place at our old house back in Kamias), so I go there and boot up TWO computers and start writing programs/scripts to do computational work, internet searches, pattern analysis, etc.  I\u0026rsquo;m at this for a while and there\u0026rsquo;s no progress so I decide to go back and check how the other participants were doing. One of them tells me he\u0026rsquo;s already answered like 10-15 questions and I\u0026rsquo;m like \u0026ldquo;What, weren\u0026rsquo;t there only 3 questions?\u0026rdquo; He tells me to go back and check the paper.  I look for the paper they gave me with the questions and sure enough there were actually 5 pages of questions, and the later pages were easy questions like multiple choice, essay, with some that can be answered subjectively etc.   I facepalm and sit down with a pen to start answering the questions. Someone might have also put a Lego Transformer (it was a G1 Autobot - Trailblazer. This fact is irrelevant, but I like it) on the desk while I was answering. It was around this time I woke up.  And that\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m already awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "So in this dream, I was taking part in some sort of problem-solving contest. The other participants were people I knew (relatives, friends, coworkers and the like). The fate of the world may have been on the line or something. Anyway, they give us the problems to solve and there\u0026rsquo;s three questions and the questions are hard: each question gives you a bunch of real-world facts and you have to find out a specific piece of information, but it looks they\u0026rsquo;ll be requiring a lot of computation and stuff.",

The three Justice Leagues (JL, JLA and JL Dark - the magic guys) start hunting for this magic thing called Pandora\u0026rsquo;s Box which they think can cure Superman or something, but the box radiates evil and makes them all fight one another. The leader of the Secret Society, the Outsider, makes an appearance and reveals that the box is actually a device that can open a gateway to his parallel world Earth-3. Then he uses the box to bring the Crime Syndicate of America (you might want to research them) over to our world. It is revealed that the Outsider is actually the \u0026ldquo;Alfred\u0026rdquo; of Earth-3 and the female Atom of the JL is actually from Earth-3 and was the one who jabbed a sliver of Kryptonite into Superman\u0026rsquo;s brain to make him kill Dr Light, and that Cyborg\u0026rsquo;s mech parts were actually an evil robot called Grid.
