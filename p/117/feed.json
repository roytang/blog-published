            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eSo after so many months of development you deployed your webapp to production and it\u0026rsquo;s up and running and everything is fine and you celebrate and your work is done right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo days later you get an urgent support call in the middle of the night. (Your clients are halfway across the world.) They\u0026rsquo;re asking why the website is inaccessible. You check via your browser and sure enough there\u0026rsquo;s an error 500. You have to ssh into the server. Half-asleep, you have to quickly comb through the log files to figure out if there\u0026rsquo;s something you can do about it right now or you have to sadly tell the client that the team has to handle it in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody expects software errors. And nobody can predict how they will happen. (If we could do that, there wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be any errors!) But in general you should stay ahead of future headaches during development time by having robust error handling and reporting principles in place for your development team to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two classes of errors:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eValidation errors \u0026ndash; checks on user inputs. These errors are expected, and the most important thing here is to \u003ca href=\"/2016/11/unclear-error-messages/\"\u003epresent clear error messages that tell the user what was wrong and how they can correct it\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEverything else is an unexpected error, which we can breakdown further according to how the development team would react:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0026ldquo;That shouldn\u0026rsquo;t happen!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; the broadest category, usually caused by human errors in coding/configuration or hardware problems. Examples include: database failure, typos in configuration files, different data formats used by different developers, unexpected system crashes and so on.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0026ldquo;Hmm, oh yeah, we didn\u0026rsquo;t think of that.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; i.e., design flaws or unhandled cases. These are errors caused by program flow or usage that was not anticipated in the program\u0026rsquo;s design but are considered valid use.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0026ldquo;That can\u0026rsquo;t possibly happen!\u0026rdquo;, also popularly known as \u0026ldquo;We have no clue how that happened.\u0026rdquo; Most unexpected errors start out under this category then after some detective work (some developers use the term \u0026ldquo;debugging\u0026rdquo;), it transfers to one of the above categories.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnexpected errors may also be either recoverable (the user can either attempt to repeat the operation to continue or use other functions in the system) or catastrophic (the entire system or subsystem is completely unusable.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, what happens when an unexpected error occurs? There\u0026rsquo;s a number of things that probably need to be considered:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe user needs to be aware that it\u0026rsquo;s not an error on his part and that the problem needs to be reported to support or the system administrator.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe user needs to be presented with enough information to give to the support team to allow them to determine the cause and fix the error.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe program needs to capture what information it can to help the support team find and fix the error.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor client-side errors (typically JavaScript problems, but can also be problems in HTML/CSS rendering), all of the above are difficult, since the mechanisms by which you present #1 and #2 and by which you can do #3 may be compromised by the error. Typically for any client-side errors, you are almost entirely reliant on the user\u0026rsquo;s description of the error and the steps that led to it \u0026ndash; not the most reliable source of information, but you make do with what you have. If you are unable to reproduce the error during debugging, you are in for a whole lot of speculation and trial and error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor server-side errors, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit easier than client-side errors. The first two items are typically handled by having a catch-all error page in the application that gives an error code and message for unexpected errors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the last item, it generally means logging, either to a file or a database-backed audit trail (the file is more reliable). Generally we log the error/exception encountered, including the stack trace, and some log messages on each request/page access. A majority of the time, having the stack trace is sufficient. The access logs allow us to back-trace previous steps which might have contributed to the problem. Any special conditions encountered in the code should also be logged \u0026ndash; this helps to identify errors that can only happen under some combination of special conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0026rsquo;t want to log too much information (what to log might need to be a separate post all on its own), but just enough to help the support team determine the cause of the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, the error is specific to the data being used by the users, or happens only in the environment they are using. And the support team investigating the problem will often not have access to that data or that environment, so your logging and the error reports have to be good enough to allow them to deduce the conditions that caused the error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eError handling for deployed systems is already hard \u0026ndash; so make sure not to make it harder on the future support team by having standard error handling and logging mechanisms.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Oftentimes it is counter-intuitively not worthwhile to keep adding more people to try to catch up. Some implications of larger team/project size may not be immediately obvious.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt my old job I used to have this group of coworkers I had Friday lunch outs with. Inevitably, every Friday around noon someone would message the others asking \u0026ldquo;where are we eating?\u0026rdquo;. Now, there are a lot of good places to eat around the area and we\u0026rsquo;ve all been working there a while so most of the time we don\u0026rsquo;t care where we eat and we\u0026rsquo;d say we\u0026rsquo;ll decide when we get to the elevators. We get to the elevators but we\u0026rsquo;re still not sure where to eat. So we take the elevators down and we\u0026rsquo;ll figure it out downstairs. What often happened is that we ended up walking around, wasting time and eventually just choosing a place at random. It was a weird sort of decision-making.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecision making can be tough, especially for big, complicated decisions that need to be evaluated on multiple axes. Buying a house, choosing a new job, and yes, even where to have lunch, these are all examples of possibly tough decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, you are able to put forth a set of requirements for your decisions and then you check which among the available options best fulfills the requirements. Sometimes that approach is insufficient. It can be because you are lacking information or have too much information or have too many choices or none of the choices are acceptable or you are unable to properly evaluate the trade-offs between different criteria, or maybe even that your subconscious has a set of \u0026ldquo;secret\u0026rdquo; requirements that you are unable to formalize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome notes I\u0026rsquo;ve kept on decision-making:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSpending too much time on decision-making is a cost. Be aware if there is a time limit to your decision making.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFor most things, decision-making should be quick and easy. Minimize decision making for unimportant (read: low cost or low impact) stuff. For example, remembering passwords. Either use an app or a scheme so that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to decide or try to remember what the password for each site is. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t sweat the small stuff.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s okay to use your guts or emotions to make an initial decision, then validate if it\u0026rsquo;s okay using more empirical criteria. If your emotions don\u0026rsquo;t lead anywhere, measure and use data, pros/cons to determine best course of action\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUnderstand the difference between an acceptable choice and the best choice. It may be easier to settle merely for a choice which is acceptable rather than spending extra time to try to find the best choice.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eNot making a choice is also a choice. Sometimes not all the choices will satisfy your standard or requirements. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget that abstaining or deciding not to do anything can also be a valid choice.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf you’re having trouble choosing between some options, that means they are mostly within an acceptable range for you (if any of the options was flat out unacceptable you would have rejected them on the spot). In that case, just choose one at random (literally roll a dice if you can’t decide) and go. If it turns out later that it wasn’t the best choice, figure out if there was any information that would have helped you, take note of it for next time.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBe careful when making big purchases. Even if you have already made a decision, you may want to delay it a bit for really big amounts to give your subconscious some time to ponder it. (This is really more about money management than decision making\u0026hellip;  but I had it in this list so here you go)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eIn moments of self-doubt, ask other people for advise. It can be friends and family or even random strangers on the internet.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack to the lunch out story. Some years later, a different lunch group (that I was occasionally a part of) thought of a better approach: they set up an automated email that got sent out to the members around 11:30am. The program would choose at random one of the nearby places to eat, making the decision for the group. If anyone objected to the randomly selected choice, they bore the responsibility for providing the new choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife is too short to waste on poor decision making.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
