The main question for me going in was: have I actually watched this before in the theatre? My memory says no, but this movie does have the ice palace scene I originally thought was in World is Not Enough. I can\u0026rsquo;t remember any of the other plot details though. I think I would have if I had seen it before, because I actually really liked the film and think it\u0026rsquo;s the best of the Brosnan run. I mean, I didn\u0026rsquo;t even remember the betrayal towards the end, and that took me by surprise this time. The likely explanation seems to be that I had caught the later parts of the film on cable tv which is why I remember the ice palace thing, so I will consider this NOT a rewatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I read up on it after watching, apparently this film had a mixed reception, but I liked it. It has the campiness of the earlier films, and some good throwbacks and references, as it\u0026rsquo;s the 40th anniversary of the film. I mean, I agree the invisible car was a bit silly, but maybe about as much as everyday use of a jetpack (\u003ca href=\"/2021/03/c6152994fa5ddf4b9c3302bcddfdd699/\"\u003eThunderball\u003c/a\u003e) or going into space (\u003ca href=\"/2021/06/cbb6135fa20b48a488982eccc7df76ce/\"\u003eMoonraker\u003c/a\u003e). There\u0026rsquo;s also an actual honest-to-goodness sword fight here that goes on quite a bit, first with fencing swords and later with actual swords. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s just that I really enjoy swordfights lol. I also liked the car vs car battle later on in the movie; Bond has not had to face anyone with the same level of fancy car gadgets before, so it was fun. Also, the villain plot was to use something akin to C\u0026amp;C\u0026rsquo;s ion cannon! A space laser! I really would have remembered that!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI liked the opening theme performed by Madonna, but didn\u0026rsquo;t actually recognize her in the cameo. This is the first film without Desmond Llewelyn as Q, as he had passed away the year before release. John Cleese is an adequate replacement, but this is also his final appearance in the role. This movie was also apparently Rosamund Pike\u0026rsquo;s first film. Hally Berry is ok as a Bond girl, nothing too exceptional. Her character was quite competent at first but then got captured (twice) in the second half. I believe this film is also the first time Bond has faced a North Korean villain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall I think a fitting end to the Brosnan run and as a 40th anniversary celebration of the series. The campiness is fine, especially since the upcoming Daniel Craig era would be much more serious and gritty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"army-of-the-dead-2021\"\u003eArmy of the Dead (2021)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatched this yesterday, mostly as background while I did other things, so not paying 100% attention I guess. I remembered reading that Tig Notaro (who plays the helicopter pilot) was never on set with the other actors (due to covid or something I guess) so every time she would be in a scene I\u0026rsquo;d mentally note how she\u0026rsquo;s not shown together with the others or was possible just edited into the shot. I really led with that lol, it\u0026rsquo;s what was foremost on my mind while watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a reasonable action movie and zombie/heist flick, if not a bit predictable. I liked that safecracker guy, he really had a passion for his work, too bad he died. I actually thought more of their team would survive, but maybe I just haven\u0026rsquo;t seen enough zombie flicks. There\u0026rsquo;s an obvious setup at the end for a possible sequel, but Batista won\u0026rsquo;t be coming back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"valerian-and-the-city-of-a-thousand-planets-2017\"\u003eValerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnded up watching a second movie later in the day. I had been meaning to watch this for a while as it looked good. It\u0026rsquo;s an ok sci-fi movie to watch, but not a must-see as the plot is kind of predictable / cookie clutter, and there\u0026rsquo;s this one sequence in the middle which felt unnecessary and was just an excuse to get Cara Delevingne in a dress. Visuals are super pretty though, all the space stuff and the special effects and the City of a Thousand Planets all look great. The main guy Valerian fights waaaay too well, so that needs a bit of suspension of disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI only learned after watching that this movie was actually a French production directed by Luc Besson (of \u003cem\u003eFifth Element\u003c/em\u003e fame), and was based on a French comic called \u003cem\u003eValerian and Laureline\u003c/em\u003e. That\u0026rsquo;s right, the comic actually had Laureline on equal billing with Valerian but noooo, the movie had to be titled for Valerian only. Actually, the comic seems more interesting from \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val%C3%A9rian_and_Laureline\"\u003ethe wikipedia description\u003c/a\u003e as it seems to be more time-travel focused (Laureline is actually supposed to be from 11th-century France), but the movie doesn\u0026rsquo;t really give us much background on either of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, this movie got mixed reviews and was a flop, so a follow-up in the same universe seems unlikely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"superstore-season-5\"\u003eSuperstore season 5\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI binged the first four seasons of Superstore on Prime Video \u003ca href=\"/2020/09/weeknotes-09-13/\"\u003eback in 2020\u003c/a\u003e, and over the weekend I saw the fifth season was already up, so I had it as my background watching for most of the weekend and actually finished it already by Monday. Season 5 is pretty much more of the same flavor, though there are a bit more Filipino references (which I always enjoy) since there\u0026rsquo;s a stronger focus on the character Matteo, who in the last season was arrested by ICE because he was an illegal immigrant from the Philippines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-ones-who-walk-away-from-omelas-by-ursula-k-le-guin\"\u003eThe Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas by Ursula K. Le Guin\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone gave me a copy of this because I mentioned I\u0026rsquo;d never read any Le Guin before. It\u0026rsquo;s super short but quite thought-provoking, making you think about what costs any possible utopia could have. But I also think the ending is projecting a bit of optimism, in that no matter what darkness you discover, there\u0026rsquo;s always the option of just walking away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure whether to log this in my \u003ca href=\"/lists/media/books/\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;books read list\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e category, given that it\u0026rsquo;s not really a book and the length is actually barely a short story, but hey it\u0026rsquo;s my list, I\u0026rsquo;ll do what I want. It did make me want to seek out other Le Guin works, I\u0026rsquo;ll see what I can find.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Pretty sure I saw this in the theaters when it came out, but for the life of me could not recall any of the plot details at all. Turns out it was because the plot was a bit unnecessarily convoluted. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to tell straight away that Sophie Marceau is on the bad guy side, given her henchmen, so that was no surprise. Renard was a bit boring, revenge yada yada, bullet in my head, etc. The master plan here, originally misdirected as terrorism, turns out to just be financial all along. What assured me that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t insane and that I did see it in theaters was that as soon as I saw Denise Richards name in the opening credits I remember she played a nuclear physicist in this one. Probably the weakest of the Brosnan ones so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still have a scene of Brosnan in some kind of ice building (?) in my random access memory, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t here so I think that\u0026rsquo;s a sign that I may have actually seen his next and last Bond film \u003cstrong\u003eDie Another Day\u003c/strong\u003e before and just blocked out any memory of it for some reason. We\u0026rsquo;ll find out next week I suppose!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"barry-season-1\"\u003eBarry (season 1)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started this late last week, and the season is only eight episodes but I only finished last night because each episode is a bit stressful to watch. Stressful in the sense that you pretty much expect that bad things are going to keep happening and that things are just going to get tougher for the protagonist. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit like Breaking Bad, where the protag just keeps getting into deeper and deeper trouble, but where Walter White started to revel in his notoriety, Barry just wants out, but he can\u0026rsquo;t get a break, and keeps on finding himself forced to do bad things. It\u0026rsquo;s very good, but also very dark. The season ends in a surprisingly satisfactory manner while still setting up possible follow-up storylines. I\u0026rsquo;m a bit tempted to just stop there and be happy with the show as it is and not continue to the second season as the show might actually get worse, we\u0026rsquo;ll see how long I hold it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"loki-season-1\"\u003eLoki (season 1)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeason finale ended earlier today.

The whole thing is even telegraphed completely in the first episode: removing the TVA means multiversal war; we are told the stakes from the very beginning and nothing really changes in that regard even up to the final episode and the reveal of who was actually behind the TVA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of which, I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of the whole \u0026ldquo;reveal a new character and info dump his background in the last episode\u0026rdquo; treatment that character got. I get that the reveal was necessary for the larger MCU set up, but there\u0026rsquo;s no reason it could have been done or hinted from earlier episodes so that he didn\u0026rsquo;t have to monologue his back story for like 60% of this episode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pacing of the entire six-episode runs just seemed so off to me; basically nothing interesting happening during the first three episodes (other than the reveal of a female Loki variant, which should surprise us why?), then some interesting stuff in episodes 4 and 5 and finally this disappointing finale was like 90% dialogue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ramifications for the entire MCU at large are huge of course, and as a setup vehicle for the greater cinematic multiverse the series does the job well. But on the smaller scale, as a series standing by itself we got an anticlimactic finale, Renslayer and Mobius don\u0026rsquo;t get any kind of resolution or advancement to their character arcs, and our protagonist ends up right back where he was from the start - lost and alone. So unsatisfying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will of course still watch the eventual season 2, and I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to What If in August, but this finale just left a sour taste in my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Pre-pandemic, it\u0026rsquo;s nothing I\u0026rsquo;d just take some biogesic and sleep it off, but now we have to worry about Covid. To be sure, I had an RT-PCR swab test taken by Monday lunch time. My brother and his family had passed by the house Sunday morning and we hung out a bit outside shooting the breeze, so aside from the seniors I live with, I was worried for them, so the test was mostly to be sure and for peace of mind. I thought the test itself would be uncomfortable, but it was super quick, swab went in and out once per nostril, then one more in the throat. It was a bit pricey, as someone comes to your home to do it, but the results came quickly, got the NEGATIVE result the next morning. Hugh sigh of relief. By then my fever had gone down.

Possibly! She occasionally enjoys action movies. The themes are very family-focused, despite all the violence.

I mean, she survives a car exploding and tumbling in midair, and also a fall from several stories high where she bumps her head a couple of times along the way. She basically just gets up and shrugs it all off, it\u0026rsquo;s helluva plot armor.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTaskmaster fight sequences were great, but the character was severely underused, and the actress really got off easy I think?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe scene at the end with Nat not wanting to leave with the others \u003cstrong\u003eon a plane\u003c/strong\u003e even while Ross and his men are still a ways away seems ridiculous, and the cut to \u0026ldquo;2 weeks later\u0026rdquo; leaves much to be desired; some people on Reddit claim there was probably a scene where she made a deal with Ross but the scene was cut; regardless, it\u0026rsquo;s an annoying discontinuity in the theatrical cut\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI wish they could have managed one or two more fanservice cameos, and not just Valentina in the post-credits scene. Like, I would have wanted to have Chris Evans\u0026rsquo; Cap meet up with Nat in the \u0026ldquo;2 weeks after\u0026rdquo; scene so they go break out their friends together.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than the above, I don\u0026rsquo;t seem to have any complaints about the main plot itself. I watched very few trailers and didn\u0026rsquo;t have any real idea about the other characters like Red Guardian or Yelena, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any expectations to fail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole \u0026ldquo;family\u0026rdquo; theme reminded me of the recent Fast and Furious memes about family lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
