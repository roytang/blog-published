            "title": "Digital Boardgames Review: Root",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eOver the past couple of years, I\u0026rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d do reviews of them. This is my fourth such review, and this time I\u0026rsquo;m gonna talk about \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/965580/Root/\"\u003eRoot\u003c/a\u003e. This is a IRL boardgame by Leder Games with the Steam version published by Dire Wolf Digital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoot is a competitive game themed about multiple factions vying for supremacy in a forest area. Each faction vies for control of clearings, draws cards that provide special abilities or items, and generally tries to stop the others from winning the game, which is done via points. The base game has four different factions to choose from (with the Vagabond faction having three different variants) and each faction plays very differently and scores points differently. So there is a bit of a learning curve to familiarize yourself with all the different factions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe cats (Marquis) faction are the like the dominant empire in the area, and they gain points primarily by establishing more buildings, but among the factions they get the fewest actions per turn.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe birds (Eyrie) represent an old empire trying to make a comeback; they score points primarily by establishing roosts but they follow a strict set of decrees that govern what they must do each turn. If they fail to obey the decrees, their government goes into turmoil, loses some points and has to start over with a new leader.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Woodland Alliance represent plucky rebels aiming to establish their own government. They earn points by spreading sympathizers across the map. Whenever other factions attack them or move troops through sympathizer clearings, they earn more supporters, which can be used to establish bases (which let you recruit warriors) and gain even more supporters.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFinally, the Vagabond is a freelance adventurer, wandering around the land digging up treasure for ruins and trading for items. He gets stronger the more items he has, can score points by crafting new items, completing quests, or fighting other factions. He can lend his support or even ally with one of the factions for a coalition victory. The Vagabond has several variants that start with different item sets and each have a unique special action.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe recently released (on Steam anyway) Riverfolk expansion adds two more factions and three more Vagabond variants to the game, adding replay value and more variation to an already very varied game. Each game lasts around an hour or so, which is totally reasonable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoot is without question the one my regular gaming group has spent the most time playing among the digital boardgames. Not only because it\u0026rsquo;s fun (and we love interfering with whatever the others are planning), but it mostly because it has a feature none of the other games we\u0026rsquo;ve tried have: asynchronous multiplayer games. That means we can start a game and take our turns even while the others are offline, and people can just come and take their turn as they please (within the limit of minimum one turn every three days).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat means at the end of our weekly gaming sessions, no matter what we\u0026rsquo;ve played, we usually end with starting a new Root game, that we play throughout the following week. Sometimes we can get two or three games done during the duration of the week, finishing the last game when we start our next weekly gaming session. We\u0026rsquo;ve been playing the game almost continuously since the Steam release in September 2020 and the physical boardgame has at least two other expansions lined up that aren\u0026rsquo;t on Steam yet, so it\u0026rsquo;s very likely that we\u0026rsquo;ll continue to play it for many more months and perhaps years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It seems like a simple thing, but that kind of thing contributes towards the kids being \u0026ldquo;prepared\u0026rdquo; for a better math education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad also made a comment last week about how when we were young they (our parents) would often be bringing home activity books for us. Basically books with number puzzles, crossword puzzles, logic puzzles, that kind of thing. I loved those activity books! Among other things, I\u0026rsquo;m sure that contributed to my love of math and problem solving, which often appears as \u0026ldquo;natural aptitude\u0026rdquo; to others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a form of privilege: parents having the time and energy and know-how to instill additional knowledge in their kid from a young age. I can\u0026rsquo;t expect poor to lower-class people who work hard all day and are tired at night to be able to do that. So less privileged kids tend to grow up thinking they are bad at math, and they have trouble teaching their kids, and the vicious cycle perpetuates itself and inequality grows in succeeding generations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring lunchtime on weekdays, I often find myself watching reruns of a certain local quiz show shown on cable TV, and I find myself alternating between laughter and frustration whenever one of the contestants fail a simple math question. Things like \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rsquo;s the decimal equivalent of 3 and a half percent\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rsquo;s 75% of 200\u0026rdquo; - questions I\u0026rsquo;d expect any elementary school graduate should be able to do. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to shake your head and blame the poor education system in this country - which is certainly a factor, but I can\u0026rsquo;t help but consider how this kind of inequality, compounding across generations, also contributes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you do? Adults who grew up without this privilege often think their case is hopeless. \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Mahina lang talaga ako sa math\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e (\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just really bad at math\u0026rdquo;), people often lament, as if it were some innate ability that they were not fortunate enough to acquire at character creation. And even if they wanted to get better at math, most will not have the time or energy to do so, due to daily life struggles. I would guess at some level it\u0026rsquo;s also a bit harder for such adults to re-learn math as their brains have already been wired not to think that way. It\u0026rsquo;s probably not an insurmountable handicap like a physical injury, but it can be challenging nonetheless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m just rambling. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a point, nor a solution. I don\u0026rsquo;t know where this post was going.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I had never done a Ludum Dare or a game jam before, heck I haven\u0026rsquo;t even made anything I consider a \u0026ldquo;real game\u0026rdquo; before!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game jam has two modes you can choose to submit to. The 72-hour version (called the \u0026ldquo;Jam\u0026rdquo;) was easier, as you could have a team of people working together, and you could use any assets you had legal access to. The 48-hour version, called the \u0026ldquo;Compo\u0026rdquo; (which I guess is short for competitive?), is much more challenging. You can only work solo, and all assets must be created within the 48 hour period (with a few exceptions like fonts etc).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no intention of working with a team; in fact I didn\u0026rsquo;t tell anyone I planned to participate until after the jam started last Saturday at 9AM local time. I figured I would try my best and if I finished within 48h, I would submit for the jam. If I didn\u0026rsquo;t, I had an extra 24h to try for the compo, and I could even ask for help!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat meant I would be working alone, which meant I would have to do things like art and sounds and music! I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any experience doing pixel art for games or anything like that, so I figured I could get by on \u0026ldquo;programmer art\u0026rdquo;. For sound effects, I knew there were online generators I could use, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried some before. Background music was the real challenge: I have no musical talent at all, so even if I could find tools to do it, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t know how to put anything together. These were problems for me 48h into the future though. When the jam started, I just dove in to code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, not really. I woke up late and had to do some errands so I missed the start time by a couple of hours. Still, I dove right in as soon as I was free!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-tools\"\u003eThe tools\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the gamedev/programming part, I decided to use the Godot Engine game development framework. I had been trying it out since earlier this year, and I was pretty happy with it compared to Unity. The IDE was a lot lighter, the APIs felt more intuitive, and basically it made it easier for me to get into the guts of a game. Unity is great, but it always seemed geared towards 3D gamedev. Godot makes 2D gamedev feel like a first class citizen. I prefer working on 2D because I feel like that\u0026rsquo;s something more achieveable for me as an indie. Doing sprites and such is more in my wheelhouse than 3D models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the art, I\u0026rsquo;ve never tried any pixel art creation tools before, so I just searched online. I settled on \u003ca href=\"https://www.piskelapp.com\"\u003ePiskel\u003c/a\u003e which had the advantages of (a) being free; and (b) running entirely in-browser, without needing me to create an account. Very low friction! I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried such tools before so I was impressed with how mature they were. There were functions similar to what you\u0026rsquo;d find in paint, plus support for layers and export to various formats, including into spritesheets. It was perfect for what I needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor sound effects, I used another free online site \u003ca href=\"https://sfxr.me/\"\u003eJSFXR\u003c/a\u003e. Basically just kept rolling one of the settings until I got a sound I like. Godot\u0026rsquo;s AudioStreamPlayer didn\u0026rsquo;t seem like it accepted WAVs, so I used \u003ca href=\"https://convertio.co/wav-ogg/\"\u003econvert.io\u003c/a\u003e to convert the files to OGG.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor background music, a friend suggested I tried \u003ca href=\"https://onlinesequencer.net/\"\u003eOnline Sequencer\u003c/a\u003e. I tried it out for a while, banging out random notes since I knew nothing about how to compose music. I looked at a few interesting ones created by other people and tried to adjust the random notes I was banging out to better follow the patterns I saw. I still don\u0026rsquo;t understand, but I was able to create a couple of tracks I was fairly happy with (they sounded like music!) which I used as BGM in the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also used one of my \u003ca href=\"/tags/sketchdaily\"\u003esketchdaily\u003c/a\u003e attempts to generate some \u003ca href=\"https://roytang.net/2021/04/1385956018509664263/\"\u003esplash screen/cover art\u003c/a\u003e for the game. The final game used a slightly cleaned up and modified version of that one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also needed a Dynamic font, since using Godot\u0026rsquo;s built-in fonts didn\u0026rsquo;t allow me to resize text. The Compo rules allow you to use fonts you didn\u0026rsquo;t make during the jam, so I just used Xolonium-Regular from one of the Godot tutorials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-game\"\u003eThe game\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe theme of the jam was \u003cstrong\u003eDEEPER and DEEPER\u003c/strong\u003e, so I figured I\u0026rsquo;d go the easy route and do something with digging or undersea exploration. I felt like digging would be the more common approach, so I went the other way, since I\u0026rsquo;m a contrarian. I decided to do something inspired by things like the underwater level in TMNT (NES) or the underwater level in Earthworm Jim (SNES). These were the frustrating underwater levels I grew up with, so I wanted to replicate that experience a bit. Basically moving around underwater, with a time limit and trying to avoid obstacles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the idea was to have a deep-sea diver exploring underwater. But for some reason the ocean is full of spikes, so he has to keep moving and swimming to avoid them. All the while trying to go deeper and deeper. I added in a few enemies like jellyfish that acted as moving obstacles, and seeker fish that actively tried to chase you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also added an oxygen tank mechanic to serve as the timer. The tank would be getting depleted constantly as you kept breathing and you had to avoid running out. There would be little things that generate air bubbles you can pick up to increase your oxygen level (this part was inspired by the 3d mario games). Initially the bubble generator was just a jar, but later I changed the sprite to a clam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also decided to add a collectible in the form of gems that you can pick up on your way down. Basically to add more things to do in each stage. And it added a bit of risk-reward mechanics: should I waste time trying to get this gem, when I might run out of air or get hit by enemies? When I added it I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how the gems would be relevant in the game. I eventually decided to have the player earn extra lives whenever he collects 5 gems. The initial gem sprite was a diamond but later changed to a pearl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s the basic gameplay: Avoid obstacles, collect gems, avoid running out of air, try to get as deep as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe controls were simple:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eyour diver is constantly sinking\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eyou can move left or right using arrow keys\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eyou can swim up (or bounce, in my internal terms) by pressing space bar.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bounce was kind of a flappy bird bounce: you hit spacebar and you go up by a fixed amount after which you begin sinking again. I wanted the controls to be not too smooth so that you needed to know the bounce distance really well to navigate tighter corridors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I had something basic working, I showed it to some friends to get some feedback, and got some good ideas and bug reports from them. (I figured showing it to other people and getting suggestions was fine within the compo rules, as long as I did all the actual creation work myself!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the end of Saturday (around 16h after jam start, 32h before compo deadline), I was mostly done with all the mechanics and gameplay and such. But content was lacking: I only had five screens (\u0026ldquo;stages\u0026rdquo;) for the player to navigate through, which I felt was too short. Creating levels was fairly straightforward though once I had all the components ready. The feedback from my friends was also pretty good. By this point I was fairly confident I could finish in time, and probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t lose too much sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent Sunday working more on the game, in between a bunch of family errands. I added another five levels, and fixed a lot of bugs. By the end of day Sunday (around 9h before compo deadline), I was ready to submit. Godot lets me export both to web and to Windows binaries. I could have also exported to other OSes, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to test them. I was originally planning to host the game here on this site, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t decide how / where to put them in the site structure. Instead I went ahead and deployed the game to itch.io, as I already had an account there. This was a relatively easy and straightforward process (though I did have to answer some tax-related questions).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the game is here on itch.io: \u003ca href=\"https://hungryroy.itch.io/diver\"\u003ehttps://hungryroy.itch.io/diver\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLudum Dare requires the source code be made available, I have it up here: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/roytang/diver\"\u003ehttps://github.com/roytang/diver\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd finally, the page for my entry on the Ludum Dare site itself: \u003ca href=\"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/diver\"\u003ehttps://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/diver\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"aftermath\"\u003eAftermath\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter submitting your game, you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to review and rate other people\u0026rsquo;s games, and you want to earn at least 20 ratings to get a \u0026ldquo;final score\u0026rdquo;. Coming in, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really aim to \u0026ldquo;win\u0026rdquo; the compo or anything like that, I just wanted to finish a game. But after submitting and checking out a few of the other submissions, I felt a bit more confident about my chances and am hoping for a decent finish. The \u0026ldquo;play, review, and rate\u0026rdquo; period lasts for 21 days after the jam ends, so it\u0026rsquo;ll be a while before I know the outcome of that! I am doing my part by playing through some of the entries and rating them and leaving helpful comments where I can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, very impressed with how Ludum Dare works. The more ratings and quality feedback you give, the higher your game appears in the listings. This makes it more likely for you to receive ratings and feedback yourself, thus incentivizing the same and creating a positive feedback loop!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy biggest takeaway is that I learned how to build something with as small a scope as possible. In many of my past attempts, scope creep was always one of the bigger problems. I was used to playing big, epic games like grand strategy or long RPGs or open world games, so I often wanted to make games like those. The 48h limit helped me narrow my focus and reject stuff that would endanger that deadline. I had to discard some other ideas for enemies and stage elements because they would make things more complicated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did enjoy the experience, no matter the outcome, I\u0026rsquo;ve already exceeded my own expectations. I expect to try my hand at game jams again moving forward. Building experience by making a series of small games might be a better way for me to find a path into \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; gamedev. That is, as opposed to \u0026ldquo;hobbyist\u0026rdquo; gamedev, which is the new level I consider myself at now that I\u0026rsquo;ve completed a Ludum Dare!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome screenshots of the game attached below!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The central idea was \u0026ldquo;give what you can, take what you need.\u0026rdquo; Stories spread of heartwarming stories like a poor old man donating some food even though he had very little and an ice cream vendor giving away the remnants of his cart for the day to those in the queue.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGovernment critics pointed out the need for these pantries was largely a result of the lack of support from the government. (They\u0026rsquo;re not wrong.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePredictably, it didn\u0026rsquo;t take long for the government to butt in, with \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/roytang/status/1384280033351462912\"\u003ethe police reportedly investigating the people behind the pantries for communist links\u003c/a\u003e. Some other national government people even said they might require permits. For what, giving food away?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe backlash was predictably quick, with netizens and even local government offcials and senators castigating the critics. Mayors started chiming in that the community pantries were welcome in their cities and that there was no permit required to help each other.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHowever, notable spokespersons of the NTF-ELCAC still insisted on insinuating communist links to the pantries. There were also the usual critics who decried people getting stuff for free, speaking from the privilege of their safe houses and expensive cars. Critics also raised whether these pantries were spreading covid because of how people spend a lot of time queued up.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSome women in Pasig went viral for a bit after they were caught on video raiding a community pantry and getting much more than could be reasonably expected, one of them even carting off a trayful of eggs. They supposedly claimed they were going to give away to their neighbors. They later \u003ca href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-ph/entertainment/other/mga-babaeng-nanlimas-sa-community-pantry-sa-pasig-dumepensa-na/ar-BB1fUtan\"\u003eapologized\u003c/a\u003e, but supposedly they \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/news5ph/status/1384855185932042241\"\u003ewere planning to file charges against the person who took a video of them\u003c/a\u003e. My take: the thing about decentralized movements like this is that they tend to easily self-correct through the vigilance of the participants as seen here. There have been no other reports of similar incidents after this one went viral, so at the very least they served as an example of what not to do.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLast Friday, a community pantry started by actress Angel Locsin ended in disaster when an old man died while in the queue. Blowback from the pantry critics and the DDS was fierce. Locsin \u003ca href=\"https://www.gmanetwork.com/entertainment/showbiznews/news/76345/angel-locsin-issues-apology-after-senior-citizen-dies-in-line-at-her-community-pantry/story\"\u003equickly issued an apology\u003c/a\u003e and accepted the blame, drawing contrasts with how the national government never apologizes or admits to mistakes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRecently, news broke that the National Security Adviser \u003ca href=\"https://onenews.ph/gag-order-imposed-on-parlade-badoy\"\u003ehad imposed a gag order on the notorious NTF-ELCAC spokespersons re: community pantries\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProbably one of the reasons we can\u0026rsquo;t have nice things: \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/LaTtEX/status/1384416859701792771\"\u003epeople can\u0026rsquo;t be generous without some other people becoming suspicious and assigning nefarious motives\u003c/a\u003e.
