            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI finished reading \u003cem\u003eSnow Crash\u003c/em\u003e in around three weeks, slightly faster than the other comparable work I\u0026rsquo;ve read this year, which was \u003ca href=\"/2021/03/neuromancer/\"\u003eNeuromancer\u003c/a\u003e. Comparable of course only in the sense that they both have some kind of worldwide internet-like network as a central plot point. Otherwise, they are not really that similiar, though the review is made easier by having a base for comparison. Snow Crash is much less cyberpunk than Neuromancer, and maybe takes itself a little less seriously too? I mean, the main character\u0026rsquo;s name is \u0026ldquo;Hiro Protagonist\u0026rdquo;, so that ought to tell you something immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnow Crash was published in 1992, while Neuromancer came out in 1984, so definitely the latter book does take a bit of inspiration from the older one, in terms of cyberspace. The version here in Snow Crash is called \u0026ldquo;Metaverse\u0026rdquo;, and it is actually more akin to a shared virtual reality, much like you were plugged in to a MMORPG such as World of Warcraft. Users of the Metaverse even use goggles to participate, something that only became possible in reality during the last 5 years or so. Hiro in this case is one of the premiere hackers of the metaverse, having contributed a lot to the functionality of the virtual world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is only the second Stephenson book I\u0026rsquo;ve read, after Cryptonomicon \u003ca href=\"/2004/11/cryptonomicon/\"\u003ewaaaay back in 2004\u003c/a\u003e. I was worried that I would encounter the same issues I had with Cryptonomicon here - the general wordiness and the slow pace. Thankfully, Snow Crash turned out to be faster paced and easier to follow than the other book. The plot moves along at a reasonable clip, and revolves almost exclusively around the actions of Hiro and his partner, the Kourier who calls herself Y.T. (for \u0026ldquo;Yours Truly\u0026rdquo;) as they navigate this strange world where the United States has suffered from a severe economic collapse and had to cede parts of California to what are now a bunch of autonomous and sovereign microterritories, many of them belonging to private franchises with colorful names such as \u0026ldquo;Mr Lee\u0026rsquo;s Greater Hong Kong\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;The Mafia\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe core of the plot revolves around linguistics, history, archaeology, computer science, and such (unsurprising given the subject matter of Cryptonomicon). It uses this idea that an ancient civilization was able to use language can be used to propagate a \u0026ldquo;virus\u0026rdquo; throughout society by hacking the human brain, in the same way that code can propagate a virus through a computer network. The bad guy in this story is trying to use this concept of a virus derived from an ancient language to control people and create an all-powerful religion with him at the helm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book\u0026rsquo;s title \u0026ldquo;Snow Crash\u0026rdquo; is the name of a digital \u0026ldquo;drug\u0026rdquo; that the bad guy distributes throughout the Metaverse to target hackers. The drug is actually a digital image of random black and white bits (a bit like what a TV/monitor looks like when it loses a signal in those days, literally a crash that looks like snow) that affects hackers\u0026rsquo; brains in a certain way. I guess I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t spoil any more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy one complaint would be the ending felt abrupt, although everything was wrapped up neatly, it all happened mostly outside the purview of our protagonists. I do like it more than Cryptonomicon, which was a later book of his (published in 1999). This one felt easier to grok.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eOver the past couple of years, I\u0026rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d do reviews of them. This is my fourth such review, and this time I\u0026rsquo;m gonna talk about \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/965580/Root/\"\u003eRoot\u003c/a\u003e. This is a IRL boardgame by Leder Games with the Steam version published by Dire Wolf Digital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoot is a competitive game themed about multiple factions vying for supremacy in a forest area. Each faction vies for control of clearings, draws cards that provide special abilities or items, and generally tries to stop the others from winning the game, which is done via points. The base game has four different factions to choose from (with the Vagabond faction having three different variants) and each faction plays very differently and scores points differently. So there is a bit of a learning curve to familiarize yourself with all the different factions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe cats (Marquis) faction are the like the dominant empire in the area, and they gain points primarily by establishing more buildings, but among the factions they get the fewest actions per turn.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe birds (Eyrie) represent an old empire trying to make a comeback; they score points primarily by establishing roosts but they follow a strict set of decrees that govern what they must do each turn. If they fail to obey the decrees, their government goes into turmoil, loses some points and has to start over with a new leader.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Woodland Alliance represent plucky rebels aiming to establish their own government. They earn points by spreading sympathizers across the map. Whenever other factions attack them or move troops through sympathizer clearings, they earn more supporters, which can be used to establish bases (which let you recruit warriors) and gain even more supporters.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFinally, the Vagabond is a freelance adventurer, wandering around the land digging up treasure for ruins and trading for items. He gets stronger the more items he has, can score points by crafting new items, completing quests, or fighting other factions. He can lend his support or even ally with one of the factions for a coalition victory. The Vagabond has several variants that start with different item sets and each have a unique special action.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe recently released (on Steam anyway) Riverfolk expansion adds two more factions and three more Vagabond variants to the game, adding replay value and more variation to an already very varied game. Each game lasts around an hour or so, which is totally reasonable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoot is without question the one my regular gaming group has spent the most time playing among the digital boardgames. Not only because it\u0026rsquo;s fun (and we love interfering with whatever the others are planning), but it mostly because it has a feature none of the other games we\u0026rsquo;ve tried have: asynchronous multiplayer games. That means we can start a game and take our turns even while the others are offline, and people can just come and take their turn as they please (within the limit of minimum one turn every three days).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat means at the end of our weekly gaming sessions, no matter what we\u0026rsquo;ve played, we usually end with starting a new Root game, that we play throughout the following week. Sometimes we can get two or three games done during the duration of the week, finishing the last game when we start our next weekly gaming session. We\u0026rsquo;ve been playing the game almost continuously since the Steam release in September 2020 and the physical boardgame has at least two other expansions lined up that aren\u0026rsquo;t on Steam yet, so it\u0026rsquo;s very likely that we\u0026rsquo;ll continue to play it for many more months and perhaps years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
