            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eSome stuff I\u0026rsquo;ve watched lately. Spoilers for Gunpowder Milkshake and MotU: Revelation are marked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"casino-royale-2006\"\u003eCasino Royale (2006)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond film no. 21, and the first for Daniel Craig. The final era in this James Bond run, looking forward to it. Casino Royale is new to me, but I\u0026rsquo;ve seen two of Craig\u0026rsquo;s Bond films, so I have an idea of what to expect: a more serious and much less campy James Bond, grim and determined. The tone here is much closer to Dalton\u0026rsquo;s two films than any of the other runs. Since it\u0026rsquo;s kind of a reboot, it takes place early in Bond\u0026rsquo;s career, in fact he earns his double-O status right in the cold open. Craig\u0026rsquo;s Bond is younger, brasher, more vulnerable, and a bit more prone to mistakes, like letting himself getting caught on camera assassinating a prisoner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe theme song here is \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnzgdBAKyJo\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;You Know My Name\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e by Chris Cornell of SoundGarden fame. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit more alternative than recent theme songs; I like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudi Dench is back as M, the only actor carried over from previous incarnations. We don\u0026rsquo;t get any of the usual support staff like Moneypenny or Q. Bond spends most of the first half of the film alone in the field, and the second half supported by treasury agent Vesper Lynd (played by Eva Green). Mads Mikkelsen plays the protagonist, terrorist financier Le Chiffre, who Bond challenges to a high-stakes poker game at the titular Casino Royale. Also making an appearance is an old Bond ally, CIA\u0026rsquo;s Felix Leiter, who we last saw mauled by a shark in Dalton\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"/2021/07/4e93006d466cb2f6a53325cba8e27b63/\"\u003eLicense to Kill\u003c/a\u003e. (He has been recast as a black man for the modern age of James Bond.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plot is reasonable and action-packed. Daniel Craig probably feels the least \u0026ldquo;Bond-like\u0026rdquo; compared to what his predecessors have established for the role, but his Bond is pretty good and is portrayed as relentless and unstoppable, in spite of his mistakes. The on-foot chase scene in Madagascar near the start of the film is great, especially all the crane shots. Le Chiffre seems a bit incompetent for a villain. The final third of the movie (after the poker game) plays out a bit strangely, for a while I was like \u0026ldquo;What the heck is going on?\u0026rdquo; There is a betrayal in the end that I didn\u0026rsquo;t see coming, which erased any doubt in my mind whether I had actually watched this one in the theaters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking forward to the rest of Craig\u0026rsquo;s run!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"gunpowder-milkshake-2021\"\u003eGunpowder Milkshake (2021)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe watched this during our Saturday online gaming session watch-along. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have high expectations for the film, as I thought it was kind of an ultraviolent grim John-Wick style thing and I didn\u0026rsquo;t really think Karen Gillan and Lena Headey would be good to lead that kind of movie. It does turn out to be ultraviolent, but not super grim, and in fact maybe even a little goofy. There are some great action sequences and fight scenes here, but as soon as I saw that \n\u003cdetails class=\"spoiler\"\u003e\n    \u003csummary\u003e(Spoilers)\u003c/summary\u003e\n    Karen Gillan was going to have a fight scene in the doctor\u0026rsquo;s office with her arms all floppy from anesthesia\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cp /\u003e\n, I was like, ok this movie is already worth watching. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a very deep, complicated plot or anything, but overall a decent popcorn watch. A fun, ultraviolent, very bloody, very much not for kids movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"batman-the-long-halloween-2021\"\u003eBatman: The Long Halloween (2021)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a 2-part entry to the DC Universe animated movie line, an adaptation of the famous comic of the same name by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale. The story covers an early year of Batman\u0026rsquo;s career as he works with Captain Jim Gordon and then-district attorney Harvey Dent to face both the Gotham mob and a serial killer that kills once a month, on the holidays. The film mostly covers the same story beats as the comic (which I had to review because it\u0026rsquo;s been probably more than a decade since I read it!), with a bit of a twist towards the end of the first part that changes the eventual ending in the second part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0026rsquo;t help but compare this storyline to \u003ca href=\"/2008/07/movies-the-dark-knight/\"\u003eThe Dark Knight (2008)\u003c/a\u003e as it covers some of the same elements: organized crime in Gotham and the origin of Two-Face among others. In fact I believe the comic book was one of the inspirations for Nolan\u0026rsquo;s eventual plot for TDK. I would guess that TDK changes were largely due to the need to focus on The Joker, who is more of a minor villain The Long Halloween, and I can\u0026rsquo;t help but imagine what if Nolan had chosen to stay more faithful to TLH storyline, what kind of movie could we have gotten?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, this particular animated version is pretty good, mostly faithful to the source material, and I like the animation style here. Jensen Ackles is a serviceable Batman voice, and Troy Baker is a pretty good Joker; for a moment I wondered if it was Mark Hamill in the role. Part one was released back in June, and part two just last week, so I only watched both parts today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think the next DCU animated movie project is \u003cstrong\u003eInjustice\u003c/strong\u003e, based on the game series of the same name, also looking forward to that!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"masters-of-the-universe-revelation-season-1-part-1\"\u003eMasters of the Universe: Revelation (season 1 part 1)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also watched this during Saturday\u0026rsquo;s watch-along. This one is a bit controversial, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d write about it even though technically the season is only halfway through. The controversy is because the show\u0026rsquo;s plot mostly focuses around Teela and a quest she undergoes after the events of the first episode: \n\u003cdetails class=\"spoiler\"\u003e\n    \u003csummary\u003e(Spoilers)\u003c/summary\u003e\n    He-Man and Skeletor are presumed dead in a battle and Teela leaves the service of King Randor out of anger over having Adam\u0026rsquo;s secret withheld from her for so long.\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cp /\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice work is pretty good; we immediately recognized Lena Headey\u0026rsquo;s voice as Evil-Lyn, and Mark Hamill as Skeletor is unmistakeable. We didn\u0026rsquo;t recognize Sarah Michelle Gellar as Teela though! The storyline so far is okay, though not super original. It kind of felt like a typical JRPG party-gathering and going on a quest thing, really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of old fans didn\u0026rsquo;t like the focus being taken away from He-Man and focusing on a female character, which many imagined as purely a diversity play. I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s much too early to judge the season overall, since it\u0026rsquo;s only halfway through, but even then, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong about focusing on some other characters, as the show is explicitly titled \u0026ldquo;Masters of the Universe\u0026rdquo; without the \u0026ldquo;He-Man and the\u0026hellip; \u0026quot; prefix. It\u0026rsquo;s probably best to see where Kevin Smith takes us for the eventual second part (for which we have no release date yet).\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The main question for me going in was: have I actually watched this before in the theatre? My memory says no, but this movie does have the ice palace scene I originally thought was in World is Not Enough. I can\u0026rsquo;t remember any of the other plot details though. I think I would have if I had seen it before, because I actually really liked the film and think it\u0026rsquo;s the best of the Brosnan run. I mean, I didn\u0026rsquo;t even remember the betrayal towards the end, and that took me by surprise this time. The likely explanation seems to be that I had caught the later parts of the film on cable tv which is why I remember the ice palace thing, so I will consider this NOT a rewatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I read up on it after watching, apparently this film had a mixed reception, but I liked it. It has the campiness of the earlier films, and some good throwbacks and references, as it\u0026rsquo;s the 40th anniversary of the film. I mean, I agree the invisible car was a bit silly, but maybe about as much as everyday use of a jetpack (\u003ca href=\"/2021/03/c6152994fa5ddf4b9c3302bcddfdd699/\"\u003eThunderball\u003c/a\u003e) or going into space (\u003ca href=\"/2021/06/cbb6135fa20b48a488982eccc7df76ce/\"\u003eMoonraker\u003c/a\u003e). There\u0026rsquo;s also an actual honest-to-goodness sword fight here that goes on quite a bit, first with fencing swords and later with actual swords. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s just that I really enjoy swordfights lol. I also liked the car vs car battle later on in the movie; Bond has not had to face anyone with the same level of fancy car gadgets before, so it was fun. Also, the villain plot was to use something akin to C\u0026amp;C\u0026rsquo;s ion cannon! A space laser! I really would have remembered that!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI liked the opening theme performed by Madonna, but didn\u0026rsquo;t actually recognize her in the cameo. This is the first film without Desmond Llewelyn as Q, as he had passed away the year before release. John Cleese is an adequate replacement, but this is also his final appearance in the role. This movie was also apparently Rosamund Pike\u0026rsquo;s first film. Hally Berry is ok as a Bond girl, nothing too exceptional. Her character was quite competent at first but then got captured (twice) in the second half. I believe this film is also the first time Bond has faced a North Korean villain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall I think a fitting end to the Brosnan run and as a 40th anniversary celebration of the series. The campiness is fine, especially since the upcoming Daniel Craig era would be much more serious and gritty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"army-of-the-dead-2021\"\u003eArmy of the Dead (2021)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatched this yesterday, mostly as background while I did other things, so not paying 100% attention I guess. I remembered reading that Tig Notaro (who plays the helicopter pilot) was never on set with the other actors (due to covid or something I guess) so every time she would be in a scene I\u0026rsquo;d mentally note how she\u0026rsquo;s not shown together with the others or was possible just edited into the shot. I really led with that lol, it\u0026rsquo;s what was foremost on my mind while watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a reasonable action movie and zombie/heist flick, if not a bit predictable. I liked that safecracker guy, he really had a passion for his work, too bad he died. I actually thought more of their team would survive, but maybe I just haven\u0026rsquo;t seen enough zombie flicks. There\u0026rsquo;s an obvious setup at the end for a possible sequel, but Batista won\u0026rsquo;t be coming back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"valerian-and-the-city-of-a-thousand-planets-2017\"\u003eValerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnded up watching a second movie later in the day. I had been meaning to watch this for a while as it looked good. It\u0026rsquo;s an ok sci-fi movie to watch, but not a must-see as the plot is kind of predictable / cookie clutter, and there\u0026rsquo;s this one sequence in the middle which felt unnecessary and was just an excuse to get Cara Delevingne in a dress. Visuals are super pretty though, all the space stuff and the special effects and the City of a Thousand Planets all look great. The main guy Valerian fights waaaay too well, so that needs a bit of suspension of disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI only learned after watching that this movie was actually a French production directed by Luc Besson (of \u003cem\u003eFifth Element\u003c/em\u003e fame), and was based on a French comic called \u003cem\u003eValerian and Laureline\u003c/em\u003e. That\u0026rsquo;s right, the comic actually had Laureline on equal billing with Valerian but noooo, the movie had to be titled for Valerian only. Actually, the comic seems more interesting from \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val%C3%A9rian_and_Laureline\"\u003ethe wikipedia description\u003c/a\u003e as it seems to be more time-travel focused (Laureline is actually supposed to be from 11th-century France), but the movie doesn\u0026rsquo;t really give us much background on either of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, this movie got mixed reviews and was a flop, so a follow-up in the same universe seems unlikely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"superstore-season-5\"\u003eSuperstore season 5\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI binged the first four seasons of Superstore on Prime Video \u003ca href=\"/2020/09/weeknotes-09-13/\"\u003eback in 2020\u003c/a\u003e, and over the weekend I saw the fifth season was already up, so I had it as my background watching for most of the weekend and actually finished it already by Monday. Season 5 is pretty much more of the same flavor, though there are a bit more Filipino references (which I always enjoy) since there\u0026rsquo;s a stronger focus on the character Matteo, who in the last season was arrested by ICE because he was an illegal immigrant from the Philippines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-ones-who-walk-away-from-omelas-by-ursula-k-le-guin\"\u003eThe Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas by Ursula K. Le Guin\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone gave me a copy of this because I mentioned I\u0026rsquo;d never read any Le Guin before. It\u0026rsquo;s super short but quite thought-provoking, making you think about what costs any possible utopia could have. But I also think the ending is projecting a bit of optimism, in that no matter what darkness you discover, there\u0026rsquo;s always the option of just walking away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure whether to log this in my \u003ca href=\"/lists/media/books/\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;books read list\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e category, given that it\u0026rsquo;s not really a book and the length is actually barely a short story, but hey it\u0026rsquo;s my list, I\u0026rsquo;ll do what I want. It did make me want to seek out other Le Guin works, I\u0026rsquo;ll see what I can find.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
