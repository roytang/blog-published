Looks like he moved to a wordpress site in 2006 and to a personal domain in 2009, but neither are accessible now. He founded a digital media startup called \u003ca href=\"https://digitallifeasia.com/\"\u003eDigital Life Asia\u003c/a\u003e and I found him \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/joeyalarilla\"\u003eon Twitter\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eClair\u0026rsquo;s Tech Blog\u003c/strong\u003e - I knew Clair from HS, though we weren\u0026rsquo;t batchmates.

Are Discworld books really so same-y that it feels like I\u0026rsquo;ve read this before?\u0026rdquo; The good news is that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t true, Discworld books aren\u0026rsquo;t super-samey; I have read it before, \u003ca href=\"/2016/12/805050532834353152/\"\u003eway back in 2016\u003c/a\u003e in fact.

Ok, so I guess that means they are a bit same-y, but on the other hand I am getting better at retention because I actually recognized it this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I went ahead and completed the re-read and proceeded to the next City Watch book, \u003cem\u003eMen at Arms\u003c/em\u003e. And this one was totally new to me, for sure. So, this is a bit of a double review. And maybe a review of the Discworld series as a whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ndash;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eGuards! Guards!\u003c/em\u003e we get Pratchett\u0026rsquo;s treatment of common fantasy tropes such as dwarves, dragons that can\u0026rsquo;t possibly be flying, and unknown heroes becoming king by slaying evil dragons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have the effrontery to be squeamish, it thought at him. But we were dragons. We were supposed to be cruel, cunning, heartless, and terrible. But this much I can tell you, you ape—the great face pressed even closer, so that Wonse was staring into the pitiless depths of his eyes—we never burned and tortured and ripped one another apart and called it morality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ndash; Terry Pratchett, \u003cem\u003eGuards! Guards!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eMen at Arms\u003c/em\u003e, Pratchett expands on the cast of the City Watch subseries, explores the guild structure of the city of Ankh Morpork, and expands the lore of races such as dwarves and trolls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.\nBut the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that’d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years’ time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.\nThis was the Captain Samuel Vimes “Boots” theory of socioeconomic unfairness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ndash; Terry Pratchett, \u003cem\u003eMen at Arms\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, yes, the Discworld books are maybe kind of same-y, but that\u0026rsquo;s kind of a good thing? You usually know what to expect. They\u0026rsquo;re light reading, they\u0026rsquo;re funny in a dry British humor kind of way, and Pratchett likes to attack and parody and deconstruct common fantasy tropes. I like the books, despite their sameyness, although I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if I\u0026rsquo;ll ever be able to work my way through the entire series.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

And worst of all, I ordered Tostitos cheese dip and they bought spinach dip instead!! The weird thing is, there were some other items that were out of stock that they called me about (even though I explicitly set that if there were missing items, just don\u0026rsquo;t buy them??), yet for the dip, they just went ahead and bought a different flavor. I ended up having a long convo with their customer support about how disappointed I was, and somehow despite saying there\u0026rsquo;s nothing they could do, they later ended up offering me P100 store credit as compensation. I guess it will be useful if ever we decide to try this again. Anyway, we ended up doing a supplementary grocery run yesterday to cover the items the online delivery didn\u0026rsquo;t get (and the cheese dip!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatching:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOnly one movie watched this week, continuing the James Bond run: \u003ca href=\"/2021/04/1a1ab3ad610478ba3b672b0a89c26333/\"\u003eOn Her Majesty\u0026rsquo;s Secret Service (1969)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupergirl\u003c/strong\u003e has started up again, carrying over baggage from the cut-short previous season, same as Flash.

Still, the daily counts kept rising, hitting record highs of almost 10k cases daily. Even before the dust has settled on the bubble response, they decided to announce last night a reversion to the stricter ECQ. Shades of last year, during the run up to the first lockdown announcement: rumors circulated via chat groups about the impending lockdown before the government finally made their announcement. As can be expected, memes quickly circulated about how we came back to ECQ more than a year after the first lockdown. The lockdown is imposed only for one week, during the Holy Week period, presumably to take advantage of the two holidays in the week to minimize economic impact. The fact that they imposed two different levels of responses one after another \u003ca href=\"/2021/03/1375737016407625729/\"\u003ereeks of poor planning and analysis\u003c/a\u003e, as if they were just making all this up as they go along, which might not be far from the truth.
