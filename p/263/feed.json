I randomly think of things to write about while I\u0026rsquo;m idling or commuting or waiting in line or any of the dozen or so other opportunities during the day when my mind wanders, but because of laziness and/or lack of discipline, these ideas never get very far. I think one of the problems is that because this is a personal blog, I don\u0026rsquo;t have any focus. That is, in this space I can literally write about anything I want so I end up not writing anything. Does that make sense?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway what I decided was: I\u0026rsquo;ll just start a new blog. What the hell right? But this time, I\u0026rsquo;ll focus on a topic for the blog. Restrictions breed creativity, or something. I needed to choose a topic that (a) I was fairly knowledgeable and passionate about; and (b) I would have something regarding that topic to write about on a regular basis. I\u0026rsquo;ve actually tried this before for Magic the Gathering, since I pretty much enjoy that game a lot, but the problem with MTG was that I was an irregular player and rarely had something new to write about. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to choose something else right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe easiest area that covers the above requirements for me right now is easily reading comic books. I read a ton of them and I enjoy them and I follow the regular weekly releases and am usually excited for the next week of releases. So it seems like something I would be able to write regularly about. So, here we go: \u003ca href=\"/source/ireadcomicbooks\"\u003eI Read Comic Books\u003c/a\u003eÂ (originally I was just going to go with a wordpress.com site, but I was like aw what the hell, domains are cheap)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully it helps me get into the groove of regular writing, and somehow that groove propagates back to this blog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Edit 2020: I no longer have the ireadcomicbooks.com domain, but all posts from that blog have been imported into this one. The link above has been updated as well.)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

But before he does he pulls a whammy on our favorite wall crawler. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t been spoiled by the internet before you read it, the big reveal near the end of the issue comes as a shock and makes you go back and re-read the rest of the issue seeing it in a different light. How\u0026rsquo;s Dan Slott going to write himself out of this one? Or does he really have to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the Marvel NOW! side, we have a few new series launching this week. The one I liked most was Waid and Yu\u0026rsquo;sÂ \u003cstrong\u003eIndestructible Hulk #1\u003c/strong\u003e, which brings us a Bruce Banner with a new approach to life with the Hulk and of course Yu\u0026rsquo;s amazing artwork. Looking forward to where this book takes the gamma giant.Â \u003cstrong\u003eCaptain AmericaÂ \u003c/strong\u003eis the other Marvel NOW! #1 this week and it looks a solid set-up to a big sci-fi arc by Rick Remender. I\u0026rsquo;m not a big fan of John Romita Jr\u0026rsquo;s art (in fact I hated him during his AvX issues), but I can tolerate him to see what Remender does with Cap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJourney into Mystery #646\u003c/strong\u003eÂ didn\u0026rsquo;t relaunch with a #1 but the series has a new focus - the Asgardian Sif. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how popular it\u0026rsquo;s going to be compared to Gillen\u0026rsquo;s Loki-focused run as Sif is a much more niche character so they\u0026rsquo;re taking a risk here similar to X-Men Legacy focusing on Legion. Still, Kathryn Immonen\u0026rsquo;s initial story arc seems interesting, and there\u0026rsquo;s some great interior art here by Valerio Schiti, check it out:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#87cca54cace555138cedd00e7ce9e114-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/this-week-in-comics-2012-11-24/jim646_hucdf14dc005dace70138efb9929a52675_1558918_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"87cca54cace555138cedd00e7ce9e114-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2012/11/this-week-in-comics-2012-11-24/jim646.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"24 Nov 2012 8:07am\"\u003e24 Nov 2012 8:07am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOther quick Marvel reviews:Â \u003cstrong\u003eHawkeye #4\u003c/strong\u003e is still pretty good although Javier Pulido is subbing for artist David Aja in this issue; he does a decent job but I think I\u0026rsquo;d still rather have Aja as a regular.Â \u003cstrong\u003eDaredevil #20\u003c/strong\u003e gives us a supervillain that has a better plan for using his powers than just simply robbing banks and getting beat up by supers on a regular basis.Â \u003cstrong\u003eAvengers #34\u003c/strong\u003e is the end of Bendis\u0026rsquo; run and while the End Times story arc wasn\u0026rsquo;t too spectacular, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of fan service in this issue with almost every active Avenger making an appearance, an artist jam session in the final pages (my favorite is the Oliver Copiel page!) and a long essay by Bendis at the end detailing how his Avengers/New Avengers run came about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the DC side, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing I\u0026rsquo;m too excited for this week.Â \u003cstrong\u003eJustice League #14\u003c/strong\u003e concludes the two-parter Cheetah story, but this feels a bit too much like filler for me; Geoff Johns need to up his game if Justice League is going to be one of DC\u0026rsquo;s driving comics the way Avengers is for Marvel.Â \u003cstrong\u003eRed Hood and the Outlaws #14\u003c/strong\u003eÂ still has Rocafort doing the cover art, but the interior art is a bit more\u0026hellip;mediocre. I reckon Rocafort can only handle one full-time gig and right now that\u0026rsquo;s Superman, but it\u0026rsquo;s too bad because the art was one of the biggest selling points for RHATO.Â \u003cstrong\u003eGreen Lantern New Guardians #14Â \u003c/strong\u003eis just an entire issue of Kyle training to become the rainbow lantern or something, let\u0026rsquo;s see if this actually goes somewhere interesting.Â \u003cstrong\u003eNightwing #14\u003c/strong\u003e has the lead going toe to toe with Lady Shiva, but that\u0026rsquo;s about the only thing exciting here; the rest of the book is set-ups with the Penguin and the Joker and Grayson\u0026rsquo;s amusement park pet project. I\u0026rsquo;m a bit behind on the other DC books, hopefully I\u0026rsquo;ll have more DC to rave about next week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to read at least one book outside the big two each week, and this week it\u0026rsquo;sÂ \u003cstrong\u003eClone #1\u003c/strong\u003e which is released by Image Comics and part of Robert Kirkman\u0026rsquo;s Skybound imprint. I\u0026rsquo;m not too familiar with the creative team, it seems the writer is doing his first book. The art isn\u0026rsquo;t anything to write home about, but I guess it\u0026rsquo;s servicable. The story is okay for a first issue and brings to mind the interesting question: what would you do if you found out you were a clone? I may read the next couple of issues to see where it goes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it for this week and my first post on this blog!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
