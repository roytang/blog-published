I’ve had this post in the works for a while, and it kept getting longer and longer (possibly my longest post to date). I also had my friend \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DavidRamirezSFFwriter/\"\u003eDavid\u003c/a\u003e review it first to make sure I wasn’t saying anything too ridiculous, and he and I discussed some of the things and some of his points made it into the final post.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve basically lived all my 40-odd years in Metro Manila (barring maybe at most half a year total spent outside the Metro). I started commuting around when I was 10-11 years old, so that’s around 1989ish. Jeepney fare then was I think P1.50? Maybe that was the student fare. I remember it took two rides to get to my elementary school so I needed P6 for a round trip. The minimum fare these days is P9, so the increase has been 600% in 30 years. Probably still a bit too low, as jeepney drivers are still quite poor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring GS, HS and college I rarely ventured too far from home (schools were always nearby) and mostly stuck to Quezon City. I only got to go to the other Metro cities when someone else was driving me there for some reason. I do remember one time I had to take a late night bus ride home from Paranaque during HS, it was my first time commuting in a fully-packed standing-room only bus. For the most part, I didn’t care too much about traffic growing up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still remember when the MRT3 opened up (Wikipedia says this was in ‘99), I took a ride during the first week just to go to Robinson’s Galleria, I think, for no reason. I was amazed because the train made it so much easier to go to Ortigas which before that had seemed very far (even back then the buses were always full). I remember thinking back then that the MRT3 had effectively reduced the space between cities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2003, I got a job in Ortigas in Pasig, around 13-14km from home. Not too far, and the commute route was a reasonable 45-60 minutes most days (and 30 mins on really good days). I took the MRT most of the time to Ortigas, as I still have some notes from around that time telling me it was a 1500-step walk from the MRT station to my office. North Avenue station was the first station on the North side, so although there was often a queue, it was reasonable and it wasn’t too hard to get on a train. On the way home from Ortigas, I’d prefer the bus. Since Ortigas was in the middle of the route, the MRT would be quite full by the time it got to Ortigas station, so the bus was easier and I’d often get to sit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracking my social media, I can tell I started complaining about the \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/roytang/status/22969325502\"\u003eMRT\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/roytang/status/11074462310\"\u003etraffic\u003c/a\u003e around 2010 onwards. Most probably the build-up to the problem started a few years before that, in the later half of GMA’s term. Traffic and commuting and the MRT had gotten constantly worse since then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I left the Ortigas job in late 2015, I had to allocate somewhere around 2-3 hours for travel time, and even then I’d still occasionally be late. Even today, Google Maps tells me driving that distance at around 10am would take around 3 hours. MRT lines famously grew to be sometimes a kilometer long during rush hour at North Avenue. This was the line to get into the station! By this time I usually preferred taking an FX to ortigas, but that queue usually took at the minimum 30 mins to \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/roytang/status/242417436496896000\"\u003e1 hr\u003c/a\u003e, possibly longer. By this time I had also started taking taxis and ubers where possible (I had the privilege of being able to afford more expensive rides), but even this was quite difficult..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoincidentally (or not), the traffic troubles coincide with the continuous years of economic growth since the time of GMA. Then-President Noynoy Aquino famously \u003ca href=\"https://ph.news.yahoo.com/aquino-traffic-sign-booming-economy-110430239.html\"\u003epointed out this correlation\u003c/a\u003e, a bit of a tone deaf remark politically (in response to the complaints about traffic), but he was not incorrect. The big problem with the improved economy is that like elsewhere in the world, the gains are not evenly distributed, most of the economic gains went to big metropolitan areas like Metro Manila, which means people are still incentivized to work and move here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis would not in and of itself have been a problem if the government managed Metro Manila well and scaled up infrastructure as needed to anticipate the economic growth. It’s not just the current admin or the previous admin or the local governments that’s dropped the ball, it’s basically everyone in the national and local governments since the 80s. This catastrophic traffic was \u003ca href=\"https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/10/08/19/palafox-traffic-fixes-8-lrt-lines-edsa-long-walkway-no-more-mm-govt-offices\"\u003epredicted at least 40 years ago\u003c/a\u003e yet not much has been done. It’s obvious that Metro Manila is overflowing and congested, even our water and power infrastructure is being pushed to the limit in the past year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIntermission\u003c/strong\u003e: Signs you might be living in Metro Manila:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWearing your backpack in front to avoid theft\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNot leaving your wallet and cellphone in your pockets while commuting to avoid pickpockets\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWaiting at least one hour in the queue for an FX or Jeep or a taxi\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWaking up at 5am or earlier to get to your 9pm job and just recovering some sleep in the FX or bus\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCramming yourselves into the MRT or bus like a can of sardines\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHaggling with your taxi driver because your destination is “too far” or “there’s too much traffic”\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGoing to wait for the bus at the no loading/unloading zone like everyone else because if you waited at the actual loading zone you’d never get anywhere\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWalking a kilometer upstream of where you’re going to get a better chance of actually getting on a bus\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAllocating an extra hour or two to your travel time to important meetings to allot for the occasional MRT breakdown\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNot enjoying December even though it’s holiday season because you know the traffic is going to be horrendous\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHanging around some extra hours at the office or at the mall rather than exhausting yourself trying to get a ride during rush hour\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eActually walking at least 5km to get to work when all else has failed\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSolutions\u003c/strong\u003e: Before the \u0026ldquo;dami mong angal, ano solusyon mo?\u0026rdquo; crowd get into this, I\u0026rsquo;ll go ahead and make some suggestions. I’m not a city planning expert or anything, just a layperson giving some suggestions that I think are reasonable and/or common sense, and probably better than coming up with inane ideas like “coding by car brand” or suggesting that people just wake up earlier to get to their destinations or denying that we have a mass transportation crisis. The solutions I suggest here are not intended to be a “be-all, end-all”, but perhaps can be the starting point of discussions. And, I know that given the implementation track record of our government this may be difficult, but spitballing solutions to these problems also requires perhaps not a little bit of optimism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShort-term solutions\u003c/strong\u003e: It’s sad to say this, but I don’t believe there are any viable short-term solutions. None that can cause widespread relief from the traffic problems anyway. Most of the systemic solutions will be on a timeline of 5 years or more, and will definitely cost serious money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOn a personal level\u003c/strong\u003e, the best thing any individual could do would be to adapt his own situation as much as possible. If your commute is in the order of 2-3 hours or more per direction, I would strongly suggest looking for a better arrangement, either look for a job closer to home, rent a place closer to your work, or ask for WFH privileges. I realize that not everyone can afford these changes, but sometimes you’ll be surprised at what you can afford.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find that people are often quite bad at evaluating tradeoffs in time vs money, with a general preference towards money. For example if you’re working in an industry like mine (software development) where the salaries are generally higher than the average in the Metro, there’s a good chance you can afford to pay a bit more for rent or accept a lower salary if it brings you closer to home. But many people will refuse that tradeoff because for them money is the most important thing. Never mind that you’re wasting 5-6 hours daily in traffic. If money were really that important to you, consider spending it to save maybe 3-4 hours of travel time and use the extra time to freelance online and earn more money. Being stuck in traffic doesn’t earn you more money, it takes away your time and your energy and your mental health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEmergency powers\u003c/strong\u003e: I actually don’t mind giving the government emergency powers to the government to help speed up procurement timelines and such, but senator Grace Poe has a point when she says the \u003ca href=\"https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/09/14/1951678/grace-poe-emergency-powers-ok-if-backed-master-plan\"\u003eDoTr has to at least provide a specific plan/outline\u003c/a\u003e as to how they are going to use those emergency powers, instead of just granting them a blank check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMove jobs and labor out of Metro Manila\u003c/strong\u003e. Or at least out of the major business districts (Makati, Ortigas, Taguig). Of course, the government can’t force businesses to move to less congested areas or outside the Metro altogether, but perhaps the economics can be made to favor moving out. The problem with this is that labor and capital are caught in kind of a loop: capital wants to establish offices where the labor market is so they prefer the business districts and are willing to pay higher salaries there; labor wants to work where the salaries are high and there are many options so they prefer those areas too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne common suggestion I see (on reddit, etc) is to \u003cstrong\u003eincrease the minimum wage in the provinces to reduce the flow of labor to Metro Manila\u003c/strong\u003e. This is a reasonable first step, although it affects mainly the lower-skilled workers. For example, if a construction worker could be paid the same rate in his home province as in MM, he would be less inclined to go to MM. For higher-skilled work this can be a challenge, since it requires that those companies move or establish offices in the provinces, and increasing salaries run counter to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might be also good to incentivize (provide tax breaks or benefits) things like:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCompanies that provide work from home days for their workers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCompanies that provide shifting or flexible hours to avoid rush hour\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCompanies that establish in less populated regions (PEZA incentives, but more widespread)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCompanies that provide relocation assistance for new hires in less populated regions (so they live closer to work)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAffordable housing in major business areas\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the problem with incentives like these is that not only are they revenue-negative, they also add to the administrative burden, i.e. more work is involved to make sure the incentives are going to the right companies. I think it would probably be a simpler approach to \u003cstrong\u003ejust disincentivize (i.e. tax) companies that have offices in major business areas\u003c/strong\u003e, to discourage further congestion in those areas. The additional tax rate can be made to scale according to the number of employees the company has, so as not to penalize smaller businesses, and the more you contribute to congestion, the more you pay. This has the added benefit of raising money for the needed infrastructure improvements elsewhere. It should be a national government imposed tax (so the cities can’t muddle with it), though the local governments can be asked to help in collections to simplify effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMove government offices out of Metro Manila.\u003c/strong\u003e While we can’t force companies to move out of Metro Manila, there is one big employer that we can just order to, and that’s government. As an example, just near where I live, there’s the Department of Agriculture, Department of Agrarian Reform, Bureau of Jail Management and Prisons, National Housing Authority, etc. There’s no reason these offices have to be in Metro Manila; heck for the DA and DAR it’s probably better to have their main offices closer to the farmlands. There’s also camps like Camp Crame and Camp Aguinaldo. I can see an argument for having the civilian police headquarters in the metro (but probably not smack-dab in the middle of EDSA), but why the military headquarters? Many of these government facilities aren’t in the more congested business districts, but the more we can reduce the overall population of Metro Manila, the better. And moving them to the provinces has the benefit of adding jobs to those areas too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInfrastructure:\u003c/strong\u003e Obviously MM needs a lot more of everything: more trains, more train lines, bridges across Pasig River, etc. The focus should be on improving mass transportation options instead of more roads or routes, since those \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/10/23/6994159/traffic-roads-induced-demand\"\u003ejust incentivize people to drive more\u003c/a\u003e. We as a country are hopefully on a path to continue economic growth, so our infra needs to be better able to scale up with that growth, and that means mass transportation. This is already a well-known thing, I’m not saying anything new here, the bigger problem is that the governments take forever to implement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSubway:\u003c/strong\u003e I am cautiously optimistic about the planned subway from Quezon City to Taguig. David is worried that it will likely be flooded a lot of the time, and that’s much more costly than just an equivalent above-ground rail line. I think the major difference is that the above-ground rail line would have more right of way issues so it may take longer to complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBikes:\u003c/strong\u003e It would be a big change culturally, but if we really want the city to be able to support larger populations, we have to promote usage of bikes. That means developing bike lanes and bike-friendly roads bike-friendly parking and having companies provide work lockers so people can change and not be smelly after biking to work. Having a bike culture would be a much more efficient use of road space and also improve the health of the population in general and be very eco-friendly. Much better than our current trend of more and more motorcycles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMass transportation:\u003c/strong\u003e we need more, not less. As a lifelong commuter I cringe whenever I find private car owners complaining that PUVs are causing all of the traffic and there should be fewer of them on the street. Try commuting during the rush hours when it’s difficult to get a ride and see if you still have that sentiment. It’s true that PUV drivers need a lot more discipline, but the solution there is to revamp the business model of those services to avoid having the drivers behave that way. The boundary system has to be the single biggest cause of PUV traffic problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJeepney (and Bus) Modernization:\u003c/strong\u003e I support the goals of jeepney modernization, though in general I think the government is going about it the wrong way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack when we lived at our grandmother’s house, our next-door neighbor was a jeepney driver. I like to think that he owned his vehicle (it was always parked at their house), but for all I know he was paying a daily boundary somehow. He ran the Project 2-3 route along Kamias/Anonas, and sometimes he’d recognize us kids when we get a ride on his jeep, and he’d refuse to accept our fare. There is a romanticized notion of the jeepney driver as the serial pull-up-by-your-bootstraps informal entrepreneur, symbolic of Filipino genius and creative expression with all their decorations, and I think such a thing would be fine in smaller municipalities. For a large, densely crowded beast like Metro Manila, it’s simply not an approach that scales, and it’s time to move on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePublic transport is a public good\u003c/strong\u003e. I believe transport routes should be treated similar to services like water or power. A single service provider, chosen through a competitive bidding process, would serve each area or route/set of routes. If you’ve tried any of the good public transportation systems in other cities like Singapore or Hong Kong, you know this is how it works. Public transport routes are a centralized service, not run by individuals cowboys jostling with each other for riders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn’t propose to immediately replace existing jeepney and bus operators with such service providers. It’s ridiculous to think such a transition could be done in a one-time, big-time manner. I would choose a few pilot routes/areas where we can introduce the new service providers. They can initially be competing alongside the existing PUVs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe service providers could propose the initial fare rate themselves as part of their bids. One of the criteria for the competitive bidding process would be that the rates must be reasonable. Competition with the existing routes would also hopefully keep the rates in line. Rate increases would be subject to approval by a regulatory commission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn theory, each route/area being monopolized by a single service provider means each driver no longer needs to compete with other drivers on the next route. But we’ll need strict SLAs in place to make sure the service is being provided as expected. The franchise grant should impose certain requirements such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEuro-4 compliant engines\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efixed salaries, benefits and no commissions for drivers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePrioritize existing drivers of the same jeepney routes when hiring\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eobservance of fixed stops.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMinimum of X vehicles in the field during lean hours and minimum of Y hours during rush hours (as defined by government - need to conduct studies on the optimum numbers for each route).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePenalties for traffic violations by their drivers (with some leeway)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnd so on\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther factors such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewhat kind of vehicles to use (maybe subject to branding guidelines and maintenance standards)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehow much to pay the drivers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecan be left up to the service providers, for them to balance vis-a-vis their proposed rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would however prefer we get higher capacity vehicles than just the 20-22 passengers that jeepneys today can support. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking something like the public buses/shuttles used in Hong Kong or Singapore. I believe they are smaller than the city buses we have on EDSA, so they can navigate our narrower streets. Maybe prescribe a minimum passenger capacity for vehicles? Actually I would assume the economics are in favor of more capacity (since it means each trip can earn more money), so it might happen naturally. Of course not all routes would be able to support such buses, so maybe only where it makes sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this scheme, we may end up with transport fares slightly higher than what we have now. Probably closer to FX rates really. And honestly, it’s a bit anti-poor, but I think it’s something we have to live with. One of the big reasons the jeepney modernization plan is hard to pull off is because the current fares mean that drivers earn very little for a day’s work. At least this way the market determines the initial rates and the drivers don’t have to live in abject poverty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned, we pilot the program on a few routes, and then we can observe the first few routes for a maybe 3-6 months. Are there enough vehicles servicing the route? Are drivers earning enough money? Has traffic worsened? Then adjust the parameters for the next set of routes. We should aim to strike a balance between low fares and reasonable income for the drivers and service providers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the goals should be to make it attractive for existing drivers to switch over to working for the service providers. And also slowly wean people away from using jeeps. Same process could be applied to buses too. Franchise grants can be relatively short so that non performing suppliers can be replaced easily. Once the public gets used to the new service, we can phase out the old jeepneys on a per route basis. (Not all the old jeepney drivers will want to work for the service providers, alternative livelihood assistance may be needed for them)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePremium transportation options:\u003c/strong\u003e Senator Grace Poe (her again?) was derided recently for a suggestion to have “business class trains” in the MRT to encourage the upper class to take public transportation. Trying to do this in the MRT now is ridiculously impractical (which is why she was derided for the suggestion). However, I do agree that having premium transportation options available to the more affluent might be a good idea. It can still help to reduce the number of cars on the road. I’m especially fond of the P2P buses that were introduced to the Metro a few years back. They’re a lot more expensive than regular buses, but they’re comfortable and as long as it’s not rush hour, there’s not much of a queue. I often take a P2P bus where available. Maybe more routes are in order? Perhaps along the hopefully soon-to-be-finished North-South skyway?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePort congestion is also an issue\u003c/strong\u003e that contributes to the traffic as well. A lot of trucks are needed to carry the cargo offloaded in the port of Manila to the provinces. I would suggest developing other ports North and South of Metro Manila and diverting as much of the port traffic there as possible. I know we already have some existing nearby ports such as the port of Batangas, but AFAIK there’s still a lot of cargo traffic from outside Metro Manila passing through the port of Manila. The goal should be to minimize that. David also suggests developing freight rail lines from the port of Manila to provincial hubs. Freight rail can fast track cargo shipments instead of relying on trucks which add to traffic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOptional:\u003c/strong\u003e Another issue with Metro Manila is that it’s composed of different fiefdoms, er, cities. Each of them have their own jurisdictions and traffic rules and so on. This is unnecessary and contributes to the chaos. I would suggest \u003cstrong\u003ehaving a centralized authority managing transportation issues\u003c/strong\u003e in MM. Something like how Transport for London manages transportation in the greater London area. This body would be responsible for things like:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emanaging service providers, rates, traffic rules\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eenforcement\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003econducting studies\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eproposing solutions\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eand so on.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe traffic management duties of the MMDA can be absorbed by this new body. This requires taking away some autonomy from the local governments, so it requires legislation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stark reality is that no matter the denials, we are in the middle of mass transportation crisis in Metro Manila and will probably remain that way for the foreseeable future. We may get some short-term relief from some projects that may finish in the next couple of years (North-South Skyway, etc). But in the long term there is much, much more that we need to do to turn Metro Manila into a sustainable megacity. The idealist in me still hopes we can get our act together and somehow get there. Like I said, a reasonable amount of optimism is needed. We shall see, shan’t we?\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "(Note: This post discusses the traffic situation in Metro Manila. I’ve had this post in the works for a while, and it kept getting longer and longer (possibly my longest post to date). I also had my friend David review it first to make sure I wasn’t saying anything too ridiculous, and he and I discussed some of the things and some of his points made it into the final post.",

            "title": "Comics Review: House of X/Powers of X",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhile you slept, the world changed.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven\u0026rsquo;t reviewed any comics on this blog for a while, so today we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about Jonathan Hickman\u0026rsquo;s triumphant (so far) return to Marvel: House of X/Powers of X and the upcoming Dawn of X wave of books. Spoilers abound so be aware. Also while writing this I realized how absurd comic books must seem to nonreaders, but really that\u0026rsquo;s what makes it all fun! (I mean, the Justice League is also crazy right now too!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the unaware, House of X and Powers are X are two 6-issue miniseries to chart a new direction for the X-Men books moving forward. The architect of this new direction is writer Jonathan Hickman, known for his big status quo-changing ideas. His previous run on Avengers culminated in the multiverse-changing events Infinity and Secret Wars 2, so expectations were high for his X-Men run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoX/PoX is really two miniseries that are closely intertwined, enough to be considered a single 12-issue maxiseries. And Hickman is certainly presenting some big ideas, some of it retconning a lot of what was previously known in the X-Men\u0026rsquo;s history. The main conceit is that Moira MacTaggert is revealed to be (and always has been) a mutant - with the power to reset the timeline back to her birth if she dies after her mutant powers have manifested. Prior to the current storyline in HoX/PoX, Moira has lived through nine of her own timelines, and she has used each successive timeline to figure out how to get mutantkind to \u0026ldquo;winning\u0026rdquo; in the inevitable conflicts against humanity and technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 12 issues of HoX/Pox are told in a nonlinear fashion, with the opening issue of House of X showing Xavier\u0026rsquo;s new plan for mutantkind to become an independent nation on the living island of Krakoa - a far cry from Xavier\u0026rsquo;s dream of \u0026ldquo;coexistence\u0026rdquo; that has defined the X-Men since the very beginning. House of X tells the story of the establishment of this mutant nation, and the incredible resurrection workflow developed using a combination of mutant powers that means that the trope that X-Men don\u0026rsquo;t stay dead is now canon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowers of X covers the Moira affair, what happens in her different timelines and what she discovers. In this week\u0026rsquo;s final issue of Powers of X, we get the final revelation that she discovered in her sixth life: there is no victory. Mutantkind loses, and they always lose, inspite of the belief that mutants were the inevitable successor to humanity. This leads to her decision in her tenth life to try a completely new approach: to get all the mutants (heroes and villains) working together for a common cause. And to do this, she has to break Charles Xavier, whose optimistic dreams never work out and inevitably lead to conflict with others like Magneto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 12 issue maxiseries has concluded, but we are still left with a lot of burning questions. For me, foremost in my mind is: is this really the main 616 Marvel universe? All signs point to yes, but the main issue is that this is a massive upheaval of the X-Men status quo. Typically a writer during his run will introduce some fresh ideas but somewhere down the line some other writer will roll back some of those changes and we revert to some version of the status quo. This feels different, like there\u0026rsquo;s no coming back from it, because the fundamental nature of the mutants and their conflicts has forever been changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is also unclear at this point what the endgame is for Moira and Charles this time around. How does the Krakoa plan change the inevitable loss to an artificially-evolved post-humanity? There are still redacted portions of Moira\u0026rsquo;s notes in the last PoX, and she refuses to let any precogs live on Krakoa, implying she (or they) still have something to hide about the future. It would have been naive to assume all our questions would be answered before the end of Hickman\u0026rsquo;s run (which may end up being 2-3 years long, comparable to his Avengers run.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring a previous issue, precog Destiny also implied that Moira may live up to 10 or 11 lives, and Moira is only on her 10th. It is still possible that this current timeline gets \u0026ldquo;reset\u0026rdquo; at some point and Moira gets to live an 11th life, albeit she may have to do so without her mutant powers. That 11th life could still possibly be the 616 as we know it, although that would mean the rest of Hickman\u0026rsquo;s run would be reset later on, so that seems even more unlikely. In order for this current timeline (Moira X) to stick, she would have to be depowered, so that when she eventually dies the timeline doesn\u0026rsquo;t reset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m trying to imagine what the X-Men are going to look like post-Hickman. If it\u0026rsquo;s true that mutantkind \u0026ldquo;always loses\u0026rdquo;, then his run has one of two outcomes: (a) whatever Moira is planning succeeds and mutantkind wins, establishing itself as the successor to humanity, and in which case I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what future X-Men stories look like after that; or (b) Moira\u0026rsquo;s plans fall apart, and mutantkind loses yet again. (b) seems far more likely, with Destiny pretty much introduced as Chekov\u0026rsquo;s gun that Mystique is going to demand be used later on. Of course, knowing Hickman, all of this may very well culminate in some sort of status quo-shattering climax a few years down the line that nobody would have expected. (I certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t predict a multiversal collapse at the start of his Avengers run!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome other minor notes and questions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI kind of still question the inevitability of mutants losing since there it at least one known timeline where mutants \u0026ldquo;won\u0026rdquo; and humanity was reduced to almost nothing, and that was Age of Apocalypse (though, the mutants kind of ruined that timeline for themselves).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe mutant resurrection engine seems quite fragile, since it\u0026rsquo;s reliant on five different mutants (six counting Xavier), so any one of them dying could disable the resurrections permanently\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewhile we understand why Charles behaves so radically different from previous incarnations (because Moira had succeeded in breaking him), a lot of the other X-Men still feel very out of character, especially the cultish behavior in House of X #5\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe introduction of Dominions, godlike entities existing outside of space and time, is a completely new addition to Marvel cosmology AFAIK\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewhy is all of this happening now? After all these years, why have Moira, Charles and Erik decided to start their Krakoa nation at this point in time? What was the triggering event?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI haven\u0026rsquo;t said much about the art in these two series, because the implications of the story are already a lot, but the art is great, although by the end  a lot of the faces seemed a bit samey to me. But I especially like a lot of the coloring work, especially in the X2 timeline and during the assault on the Mothermold\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, there are a lot of other details and questions arising out of the maxiseries, which we assume Hickman will resolve during the next few years of X-books. Regardless of where his run ends, just the beginning of it is already a huge success in that it has sparked a lot of discussion about the X-Men and their future in the online communities, not to mention being the best-selling comic book titles for the past 12 weeks. The hype is real, and is a fresh shot in the arm to a franchise that was a bit weakening after years of the \u0026ldquo;mutant extinction\u0026rdquo; following House of M back in 2005. I have no idea where Hickman is taking us during this run, but I dig it, and I\u0026rsquo;m down for the ride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePS I\u0026rsquo;m still angry about this (from House of X #1):\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#274311800566ef3afc3555fe9169ef39-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2019/08/1159134490913988608/EBYSqotU4AEXMCK_hua7b7d377ee7f1ae65756de1ae4f7c242_140650_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Well, that’s annoying\" title=\"Well, that’s annoying\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eWell, that’s annoying (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"274311800566ef3afc3555fe9169ef39-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2019/08/1159134490913988608/EBYSqotU4AEXMCK.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eWell, that’s annoying\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"10 Oct 2019 12:00am\"\u003e10 Oct 2019 12:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2019/08/1159134490913988608/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA post about making a guy \u003ca href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/own-my-tweets/\"\u003emaking an archive of his twitter data\u003c/a\u003e made the rounds lately, so I figured I should make my own post about my ongoing efforts in this regard. I mentioned in an \u003ca href=\"/2019/08/ephemeral-social-media/\"\u003eearlier post\u003c/a\u003e that I like being able to use social media to dig through my own history. But as the first link above says, these social media sites can go away since nothing lasts forever. In the spirit of the \u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/own_your_data\"\u003eIndieweb principle to own your data\u003c/a\u003e, for the past few months I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on archiving most of my social media content on my own site. I also intend to cut down on my social media accounts and activities, and having a backup of all the data on my own site helps with that effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRequirements and considerations:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI wanted my content from external sites to appear on this site, not necessarily as a post. I would create new content types as necessary\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePrivacy: I would only import content that I considered okay for public consumption. Actually almost all of my social media accounts are fully public, except for Facebook, where I restrict access because I use it to post pictures of family. More on this when I talk about importing from facebook.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eComments and reactions: Ideally I would be able to preserve comments and reactions to my content as well (tweet replies/likes, fb comments/reacts, quora comments, etc), but that kind of runs afoul of the privacy requirement, since technically those commenters did not consent to me publishing their comments on my own site. I decided to be more conservative with this regard. Also it would have required a massive effort, since most of the backup data exports did not include third party comments. Only selected comments from certain sources are included in this site.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSyndication links: As much as possible, I wanted to retain links to where an entry originally existed. Many of my older entries have been cross-posted across different social media platforms, so they will have multiple syndication links.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother question is if I were to import content from Twitter, Facebook, etc, how would they appear on the blog? Would they be imported as posts and it will all be one giant mess, etc? I decided to maintain my traditional blog posts as the primary focus of the site, and the content from social media would largely be confined to some new sections (these are meant to map to \u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/posts#Types_of_Posts\"\u003eIndiweb post types\u003c/a\u003e):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/notes/\"\u003enotes\u003c/a\u003e: microblog-like status updates\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/photos/\"\u003ephotos\u003c/a\u003e: photos, sketches, screenshots, and definitely memes. Basically anything with an image\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/links/\"\u003elinks\u003c/a\u003e: links and bookmarks shared from various places\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/replies/\"\u003ereplies\u003c/a\u003e: replies to content on other sites. This is mostly just twitter replies at the moment.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/reposts/\"\u003ereposts\u003c/a\u003e: reposts/shares of content on other sites. This would include twitter retweets and tumblr reblogs.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also wanted two types of home page: one is the more traditional homepage listing only the most recent posts, while another would be a firehose of all posts+the above content, currently \u003ca href=\"/stream/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. Unfortunately, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t (yet) figure out how to paginate this page with Hugo, as the pagination support is limited to the homepage and listing pages and not to custom pages. Maybe someday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically, I wrote a hodgepodge of different python scripts to import data from various social media sources into this hugo blog. It has been a huge effort, and frankly the sort of thing I only expect someone as insane as me would do. The scripts are \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/roytang/blog/tree/master/utils/importers\"\u003eavailable on this blog\u0026rsquo;s own repo\u003c/a\u003e, but they are not portable at all and highly specific to my use cases and require certain temp files I keep around on my local filesystem that are unavailable in the repo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome technical challenges I encountered:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLink rot. As much as possible I wanted to preserve the intent of the original items. This meant following and resolving link shorteners so that the original URL would be preserved in the archive here (instead of say, the t.co URL twitter uses or bit.ly that twitter used to use). But those shorteners didn\u0026rsquo;t always resolve to the same URL as they did before. Some sites have changed their structure so that the original URLs are no longer available and they just redirect to their homepage, etc. Some sites like imgur deleted old images from when they were starting out (they no longer delete any images as of now), so their links would resolve to something like \u0026ldquo;imgur.com/removed\u0026rdquo;. Some URL shortener services are no longer around (like ping.fm), so for those entries crossposted using ping.fm, the contexts are forever lost. Some reposts What is archived here now represents a \u0026ldquo;best effort\u0026rdquo; at trying to reconstruct the original content as it was.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePermalink scheme. Given the link rot issue above, I needed to make sure I chose a reasonable permalink solution for the new content types, since I would want to avoid changing the permalinks in the future.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDeduplication. Since I had a lost of content cross-posted across different social media sites, I had to do some amount of duplicate detection. i.e. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want the same content to be posted under two separate entries, one from twitter and one from tumblr. This involved some rudimentary matching based on content and date posted. The matching was challenging since the date posted wouldn\u0026rsquo;t always be consistent across platforms\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHugo performance and limitations. With all this data imported, the number of content pages shot up from around 1000+ to roughly 15,000+, pushing the Hugo static generation to its limits. Generation time shot up from \u0026lt; 10 seconds to \u0026lt; 2 minutes. For a while, it was even reaching as long as 5-10 minutes, forcing me to do some template optimization to keep the performance reasonable. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how much further I could optimize my templates; I tried switching to some other themes to see if they fared any better with this amount of content, but the generation times were generally in the same ballpark. Perhaps I will revisit this again in the future. I\u0026rsquo;m also starting to miss some features of dynamic sites, like the ability to create custom queries, something like \u0026ldquo;list all replies tagged #mtg\u0026rdquo;, which are proving difficult if not impossible to do with Hugo. There\u0026rsquo;s also that limitation on the homepage pagination I mentioned earlier. I do still like having the entire site be statically generated, perhaps in the future I will explore my options for more versatile lists and searches.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ll also discuss each import source a bit, and the particular challenges each one posed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/quora\"\u003eQuora\u003c/a\u003e: I had already been planning to stop using Quora since I spoke about it \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/quora/\"\u003ein a previous post\u003c/a\u003e. Since Quora has no concept of exporting a backup of your data, importing my Quora posts involved a little bit of JS console sorcery and a little bit of web scraping as well. I imported each answer I had as a post on this site. After this import, I expect to no longer be using Quora. I\u0026rsquo;ve also unsubscribed to all their summary emails. It\u0026rsquo;s too bad, there\u0026rsquo;s often some interesting content there, but more and more it feels like Experts Exchange.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/goodreads\"\u003eGoodreads\u003c/a\u003e: For a while I used to use Goodreads to track my reading and post book reviews. Although Goodreads did provide a data export, it was kind of barebones, and importing required a lot of manual work. Luckily, there weren\u0026rsquo;t that many entries to import. I imported all of the book reviews into this blog as posts, and any further reading I can just talk about on the blog directly. I do not expect to be using Goodreads again.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/plurk\"\u003ePlurk\u003c/a\u003e: Plurk is an old social media site that I used around 2010-2011, mainly because a certain friend group of mine was very active there. Looks like everyone stopped using it around 2012-2013ish though. Their data export was very good, and I was able to import all the plurk content (most of it crossposted from twitter via ping.fm) and I included the plurk comments too. (Those comments were all public anyway.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/tumblr\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e: I\u0026rsquo;ve had the \u003ca href=\"https://tumblr.roytang.net\"\u003etumblr blog\u003c/a\u003e since 2008! I enjoyed using the Tumblr account mainly because there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of memes there and there\u0026rsquo;s content I follow, but I realized a while back I could just follow them via RSS. All my tumblr blog content has been imported either as notes, links or reposts. I don\u0026rsquo;t expect to be using tumblr much moving forward, although I still like it as a syndication endpoint; I may eventually re-enable syndicating my content to tumblr. I also have a second (currently inactive) \u003ca href=\"https://ireadcomicbooks.tumblr.com/\"\u003etumblr blog focused on comics\u003c/a\u003e that I have not yet imported, as the content there is primarily comic book covers and excerpts. I may do so in the future.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/pocket\"\u003ePocket\u003c/a\u003e: I use Pocket mainly for link sharing, so all the stuff from Pocket gets imported as links. I still intend to use Pocket moving forward, and there is an active script that imports new links I\u0026rsquo;ve shared.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/ireadcomicbooks\"\u003eWordpress\u003c/a\u003e: My blog was previously running on Wordpress before migrating to Hugo of course, so no importing of the original posts was necessary. I did, however run a short-lived comic-book focused Wordpress blog (a predecessor of the Tumblr) from 2012-2013 on the ireadcomicbooks.com domain (no longer active). I imported the posts and comments from that old blog into this one.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/youtube\"\u003eYoutube\u003c/a\u003e: I imported a selection of videos uploaded to my Youtube channel, mostly game videos and sketch timelapses. That account also had some videos uploaded by my niece, but those are her content not mine, so they were not migrated into this blog. I expect to still occasionally use Youtube for video uploads (since it\u0026rsquo;s very convenient for general internet sharing), but very sporadically so I don\u0026rsquo;t have any automated migration set up.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/flickr\"\u003eFlickr\u003c/a\u003e: I don\u0026rsquo;t use this much anymore, but I did have a few photos uploaded here, so they are now merged into this site.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/roywantsmeat\"\u003eroywantsmeat\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"/source/royondjango\"\u003eroyondjango\u003c/a\u003e: roywantsmeat was the blogger incarnation of this blog. \u003ca href=\"http://roywantsmeat.blogspot.com/\"\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s still up!\u003c/a\u003e. I mostly did this import to get syndication links since presumably all the posts from that blog had been imported to Wordpress and then to this blog. But that was not true! Apparently there were some missed posts, so some content gets to live again. \u003ca href=\"http://royondjango.blogspot.com/\"\u003eRoy on Django\u003c/a\u003e was a second short-lived blogger blog I had, focused on Python/Django, now the posts from their contain syndication links back to blogger as well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/twitter\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e: Twitter is still my most actively used social media channel, so a whole bunch of tweets have been imported as notes, replies and reposts. A lot of the past content was cross-posted from other sites though. I have a script that actively imports new tweets as notes, replies and reposts. I also had a \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/roy_mtg/\"\u003esecond twitter account dedicated to mtg\u003c/a\u003e, tweets from that account have been imported as well. If you reply or like a tweet that points to one of my blog posts, they are also automatically imported as comments to that post. (This is not retroactive.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/instagram\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e: Instagram was challenging to import. This was actually the first import I attempted. There was a data export, but the problem was it did not provide any way to derive the original instagram URL. For a while I researched on how the instagram slug was derived, thinking maybe it could be algorithmically determined. Eventually I gave up and looked for other means. Since there is currently no public API access, I had to use a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/realsirjoe/instagram-scraper\"\u003escraper library\u003c/a\u003e to get the instagram URLs then used some matching algorithm to combine them with the data export, and voila I was able to import all the entries as photos. I still plan on using Instagram moving forward (primarily for sharing sketches), but currently there is no viable way to automatically import newer entries. I tried using \u003ca href=\"https://ownyourgram.com/\"\u003eOwnYourGram\u003c/a\u003e for a while, but that \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/aaronpk/OwnYourGram/issues/85\"\u003eran into some trouble\u003c/a\u003e after some Instagram changes broke their scraping algorithm, so we\u0026rsquo;re stuck.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/facebook\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e: Ah, this was the most challenging import of all. The challenges were (a) first, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want all of my FB content to be publicly available on this blog, so there was a lot of manual vetting/review that had to be done; and (b) Facebook\u0026rsquo;s data export (both JSON and HTML formats) did not make it easy to get the URL for any given post, I had to do some scraping to get the correct URLs; and (c) the data export wasn\u0026rsquo;t even very complete; among other things it didn\u0026rsquo;t include visibility settings (would have helped with the manual review) or the application used to post (would have helped with deduplication); and (d) the data model wasn\u0026rsquo;t straightforward, since a given URL could refer to a post, a photo album, a single photo, etc and some items wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even have a single canonical URL, multiple URLs could be pointing to the same thing. I actually ended up rewriting the import script completely (you can see in github I have an fb2.py) after I\u0026rsquo;d already imported some posts. While I will still be probably using FB moving forward (for sharing family photos mostly), I do not intend to import any further Facebook posts into this blog. (Any content which could be public will be cross-posted elsewhere instead)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you weren\u0026rsquo;t keeping track, moving forward I generally still intend to still be regularly using Twitter, Instagram, and sometimes Youtube, and somehow syndicate that content back to this site. In some future update, I will probably attempt to reverse this. That is, change it so that I post on this site, and the content automatically gets syndicated to Twitter/Instagram/etc as appropriate. This is \u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/POSSE\"\u003eIndieweb POSSE principle\u003c/a\u003e, which makes a lot of sense, assuming I am able to overcome the technological hurdles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now, the archive is available for your perusal.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

If I ever wanted a wiki again, a markdown-based one powered by Hugo would be much more appropriate anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only significant piece of content I had there was a custom set design for a theoretical second set of Legends block. This was a riff on how Coldsnap was released supposedly the final set in the as-then uncompleted Ice Age block. I figured the older sets deserved the same treatment too and so I started putting together a hypothetical second set for Magic\u0026rsquo;s first expansion Legends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do not claim to be a very good set designer for Magic, all content here is based on prevailing design ideas from more than a decade ago and are presented as-is.
