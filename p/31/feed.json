It\u0026rsquo;s interesting enough not only on its own, but also for the discussion generated around any piece about qutting social media. I will admit I\u0026rsquo;ve been flirting with the idea myself, but that\u0026rsquo;s a topic for another day. Of particular interest to me at the moment is this comment about the article on \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20934675\"\u003eHacker News\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy biggest issue with social media is less that it\u0026rsquo;s distracting (IMO not necessarily an unhealthy thing) but that it has, for me, more than anything else seemed to make all aspects of my life a competition with others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Instagram, you\u0026rsquo;re competing with others on who has the happiest life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn LinkedIn, you\u0026rsquo;re competing with others on who has the steepest career trajectory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven on Twitter, perhaps more acutely in certain jobs or industries, it seems like you\u0026rsquo;re competing with other in gaining professional influence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt creates a lot of anxiety that stems from a feeling like you\u0026rsquo;re constantly on the verge of falling behind others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlenty of scholars/thinkers/philosophers have said something to the effect of focusing on just being a better version of you. Social media enables the exact opposite i.e. forcing you to constantly evaluate how you compare to others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt reminds me of my previous post \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/comparison-is-the-thief-of-joy/\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;Comparison is the Thief of Joy\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e. This kind of mindset is applicable to real life as well as social media, though I do agree that social media tends to exacerbate the problem. If you are the type of person who has this mindset, then yes it\u0026rsquo;s probably a good idea to reduce/control/filter your social media usage accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI generally don\u0026rsquo;t suffer from this problem, mainly because I outgrew comparing myself to other people a long time ago, but also because I tend to aggressively filter my social media channels so that I\u0026rsquo;m only seeing content from people that are of interest to me. I wonder sometimes about those people who whine that Twitter is so toxic or some such complaint. Don\u0026rsquo;t they know they control the kind of people who appear in their feed? Why are they following toxic people? (I understand that this may be more of a problem that is difficult to control once you get to higher follower counts, but hey that\u0026rsquo;s the price you pay I guess.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhat related: Our 25th high school reunion is coming up next year, and this early our batch has a thread about High School Reunion Anxity (HSRA). Here are some excellent words from a batchmate that I thought were good to share (removing some stuff specific to this person and the batch, since the post was to a private group. Will happily cite the original poster if she requests it):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0026rsquo;re not alone. It\u0026rsquo;s common to feel a lot of anxiety about attending a high school reunion. Our 25th at that. Kasi ohmaygad ganyan na ba tayong katanda?!\n\u0026hellip;\nThe second common barrier to attending is HSRA. Mostly because you might feel your life didn\u0026rsquo;t turn out the way you wanted and that other batchmates have done so much better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo 2a - your life didn\u0026rsquo;t turn out the way you wanted. You know what? My life didn\u0026rsquo;t turn out the way I wanted. \u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m willing to bet nobody\u0026rsquo;s life turned out exactly the way they planned. And that\u0026rsquo;s OK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2b - other batchmates have done better. OK so please for your own mental and emotional health do NOT compare other people\u0026rsquo;s external stuff (visible on Facebook, Instagram, etc) to your internal stuff. That\u0026rsquo;s illogical and bad science. Also will drive you crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n",

A couple of weeks ago, a friend pointed out that I might enjoy playing the recent Jeskai Nuneca decks that had become popular recently. I checked out a sample decklist, and you bet I jumped at the chance to play Mulldrifters again lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe set about to gather the cards. Since we almost never sell cards, even draft chaff, we had most of the cards available already. The only exception was red elemental blasts/pyroblasts for the sideboard and some extra Archaemancers which we ended up getting from a shop. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have Ash Barrens (apparently a pauper staple), and didn\u0026rsquo;t want to bother looking, so I made do with extra common fetches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the pauper deck to my first event today, completely blind to what the meta was lol. I figured I\u0026rsquo;d just enjoy the event and see how the deck plays and what the meta is like.

expect, since it was pauper I expected it to play a bit more like a limited format compared to Standard or Modern. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The format is diverse with a lot of different decks and most of the matchups are highly interactive. I wish I could say I placed well too, but after a couple of good matches, I folded to some misplays. Here\u0026rsquo;s the match record:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR1 2-0 vs MonoU Faeries/Delver\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR2 2-0 vs RG Madness\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR3 1-2 vs U/B\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR4 0-2 vs Boros\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR5 0-2 vs MonoU Faeries/Delver\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made one misplay in R3 when I agreed with my opponent\u0026rsquo;s assessment that both my spellstutters would die after he disfigured them both. We later agreed that one of them should have survived and two of this spells should have been countered. I also made a mistake when I allowed my R5 opponent to Snap his own Spellstutter to counter my Preordain when I had a Standard Bearer on the board. This is a result of not playing this card since Apocalypse! Lol. A few other minor mistakes in sequencing in the other games, but nothing too major. And I needed better sideboard plans, since I almost never knew what to pull out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving forward, I might play a bit more of this format, at least it provides a fun and cheap alternative to Modern for paper Magic!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I am aware of the existence of Pauper as a format in MTG, but I never paid too much attention to it before. A couple of weeks ago, a friend pointed out that I might enjoy playing the recent Jeskai Nuneca decks that had become popular recently. I checked out a sample decklist, and you bet I jumped at the chance to play Mulldrifters again lol.\nWe set about to gather the cards.",

However, when I tried doing this, I can\u0026rsquo;t get it to work consistently. The main problem is that I have unsteady hands, so when I hold the pen in place to do the smoothing, there is often still some slight movement so I guess this is why I can\u0026rsquo;t trigger it consistently. Would you know if there is any workaround or alternative for someone like me?\u003c/p\u003e\n",
