            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eWooo!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure how to begin; my brothers and I have been wrestling fans for almost twenty years now, and as far as I can remember this was the only time that the WWE ever came to the Philippines. The last time was a long time ago, and although I wanted to see it, there was no way I could convince my parents then that the largish amount of cash needed to go was worth it. This time, I was determined to go, and I bought tickets for my brother Alvin and ourﾂ_pamangkinﾂ_Gelo (so I spent for three tickets total.) We only got Upper Box B tickets at the Araneta Colliseum, but that was enough. Some people were telling me it was a waste of money to see the show, but after the experience of last night, I have to say it was really worth it! In fact, I can only imagine that the \u0026ldquo;main\u0026rdquo; Monday Night RAW shows are probably even better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not going to discuss the ins and outs of Wrestling here, I\u0026rsquo;ve had my share of getting people to understand why I follow it. (Of course it\u0026rsquo;s scripted! So are 80% of other TV shows!) But the most important thing to understand is that it\u0026rsquo;s a show. Not only that, it\u0026rsquo;s a hell of a show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey really know how to hold a live-audience show, everything they do is designed to pull in the crowd, get them to participate. They encourage the chanting, and they ad lib some of the responses to roll with how the crowd is going. It\u0026rsquo;s all about the crowd, the Wrestler\u0026rsquo;s job is to control the crowd, and every Wrestler plays his role well. And watching it live is a lot better than watching it on TV, because you\u0026rsquo;re there, and you\u0026rsquo;re part of the show, and you pay attention even to the matches that would\u0026rsquo;ve been boring on TV. You even respond and boo Tyson Tomko and Gene Snitsky, even if odds are you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t care about them if you were watching it on TV. And you appreciate every single performance. Even the heels are clapped for on their way out; I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s the same with the US-side RAW episodes since the loser departures are almost never shown on-air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe matches held were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEugene vs Snitsky \u0026ndash; huge pop for Eugene, the crowd is really into him, especially the teenage girls (I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why I saw so many teenage girls in the crowd, I have no idea what Wrestling\u0026rsquo;s true demographic is). Eugene had a toy stuffed bear with him and the crowd tore Snitsky apart with boos when he destroyed the thing. Eugene wins via Rock Bottom! Funniest bit: Someone in the crowd tried to pull off a ghost fighter reference by trying to start a \u0026ldquo;Tapusin na yan!\u0026rdquo; chant, too bad the crowd didn\u0026rsquo;t follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorie and Lita vs. Trish and Maria with Val Venis as special guest referee \u0026ndash; huge pop for each one of the divas. We all know these are beautiful women, but too bad we were too far up to really appreciate it. I will say that from where I was seated Trish Stratus\u0026rsquo; cleavage was more visible than her face. :p Now, diva matches aren\u0026rsquo;t usually the most entertaining wrestling-wise, as the crowd is usually into it because they like to see beautiful women jumping at each other. After a few exchanges, the crowd got a little antsy and started the \u0026ldquo;We want puppies!\u0026rdquo; chant. (One of my companions was a 12-year old. I think he thought the puppies referred to Torie Wilson\u0026rsquo;s pet dog.) Anyway, Torie and Lita win via some form of cheating. Funniest bit: There was this sequence where three of the divas were rolling over each other and knocked down Val Venis and started rolling over him. Val Venis got up smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob Van Dam vs Tyson Tomko \u0026ndash; the crowd was really into RVD, and Tyson Tomko got a lot of heat. People were a bit bored with the grappling parts, everyone expecting RVD to get in some high-flying kicks. An \u0026ldquo;ECW\u0026rdquo; chant kept going for a while. RVD hit with the spinning heel kick, then followed-up with the Rolling Thunder (awesome to see live!), and finished with the Five-Star Frog Splash (he had to turn a bit in mid-air 窶歪oz Tomko was at a somewhat wrong angle) Funniest bit: After chanting \u0026ldquo;RVD!\u0026rdquo; a while, the crowd eventually changed the chant to \u0026ldquo;DVD!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMick Foley vs Carlito \u0026ndash; Carlito got a huge pop during his entrance, and started off on the mic saying \u0026ldquo;This place is great!\u0026rdquo; (huge pop) then followed up with \u0026ldquo;Just kidding!\u0026rdquo;, then he proceeds to his heel routine, eventually making fun of local women by comparing them to Manny Pacquiao. Whoa, that was a LOT of heat right there. Mick Foley music interrupted his speech and the Hardcore Legend came in and the crowd went nuts, getting on their feet and cheering as Mick Foley walked around the ring. Mick Foley gets the cheap pop (\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s great to be here in Manila, Philippines!\u0026quot;), and they go at it. Carlito grapples with Foley for a while, and some hair-pulling goes on. Carlito keeps chickening out, but Mick Foley finally grabs him as he\u0026rsquo;s trying to head up the exit ramp. Foley pulls him back into the ring and does the Cactus Jack routine, hitting with the double-arm DDT. He looks around at the crowd and pulls out the sock and the crowd goes wild again! Carlito grabs an apple to chew on, but he turns around spits out apple chunks as the Mandible Claw and Mr. Socko knock him down to the canvas! Mick Foley wins! Funniest bit: Middle of the match, Carlito keeps trying to escape, and Foley eventually does the clucking-chicken gesture, and the crowd starts chanting \u0026ldquo;Chicken!\u0026rdquo; at Carlito (in that unique Filipino pronunciation of the word), eventually prompting Carlito to get a mic and exclaim \u0026ldquo;Carlito is not a chicken!\u0026rdquo; Foley says something to the announcer and it is announced, \u0026ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen, it has been confirmed that Carlito is indeed a chicken!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntercontinental \u0026ndash; Shelton Benjamin vs Viscera. Shelton gets the inevitable \u0026ldquo;Mama\u0026rsquo; boy\u0026rdquo; chants, and Vis gets the huge pops. Shelton whines about we\u0026rsquo;re all just jealous of his momma, and Viscera is huge. Shelton does some stuff, but finished without a T-bone Suplex. Funniest bit: That I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to explain to a 12-year old boy what Viscera was doing to Shelton with that move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Masters and HHH vs Big Show and Ric Flair \u0026ndash; Masters\u0026rsquo; entrance got some pops, but not very impressive without the pyros. Triple H\u0026rsquo;s music hits and the crowd is on their feet, hands in the air! They\u0026rsquo;re all cheering for the most dastardly man in the business today! HHH is the next champion! Big Show and Ric Flair come in next, and the cheers for them are roughly as loud as was for the Game. Anyway, they get it on. Lockups, the usual tag team stuff, ganging up, Big Show doing gorilla presses on everybody, etc. The crowd is really into Flair, every move he makes gets a \u0026ldquo;Wooo!\u0026rdquo; from the crowd. Alvin and I want to see the Pedigree, and finally, HHH manages to grab Flair and go for it! But Show interrupts, and chokeslams the game, then Flair locks the figure four onto Masters and it\u0026rsquo;s over! (Boo, we wanted to see the Pedigree!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Show stops Flair from leaving the ring, and they have a surprise for him! Trish and Maria come out carrying a cake, along with RVD, Eugene and Viscera. It\u0026rsquo;s Ric Flair and Maria\u0026rsquo;s birthday! Triple H comes out and breaks kayfabe, shaking Flair\u0026rsquo;s hand before walking out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWWE championship \u0026ndash; John Cena vs Edge. Main event time! The Steel cage is lowered to the ring; it\u0026rsquo;s a lot lower than it looks on TV, especially from where we were sitting. Edge comes in to some cheers (and jeers), but the next entrance is guaranteed to get the crowd on its\u0026rsquo; feet. John Cena\u0026rsquo;s music hits and the crowd goes ABSOLUTELY INSANE! The champ is here, and there\u0026rsquo;s lotsa chain gang members in the Philippines! Apparently a lot of them were little kids too! Cena and Edge start slamming each other into the cage, Edge tries to get out a couple of times, but Cena is just fast enough to catch him. Edge is knocked down, and the crowd spells it out: \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t see me!\u0026rdquo; The five-knuckle shuffle only gets a two count, and more action ensues. Eventually, the ref gets knocked out. Lita low-blows the ref on the outside as Cena tries to get out the door, then slams the door in Cena\u0026rsquo;s face. Edge hits the spear and the two of them gang up on Cena. Lita gets on the ropes as Edge holds up Cena, setting up for the hurricanrana, but Cena ducks out of the way and Lita\u0026rsquo;s mighty legs toss Edge into the cage! Cena capitalizes, hitting the FU on Lita, then on Edge, then makes the pin for the win! Cena climbs to the top of the cage and holds the championship belt up high and the crowd goes wild! Funniest bit: That the crowd still erupts in cheers when Cena manages to get out of a two-count, despite knowing that there\u0026rsquo;s no way the title would change hands that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, awesome, awesome show. Although Araneta Colliseum, specifically the inside part leading to the Upper Box entrances, was cramped! Helluva lot of people, they probably oversold, seeing as how people filled every nook and cranny of Upper Box B despite supposedly being guaranteed seating. I would post pics, but we were so far, most of our pics were crappy! Terrific experience, I\u0026rsquo;m glad we went to see the show. 沽\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Ironically, she did this on the 20th anniversary of the People Power revolution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I can\u0026rsquo;t pretend to be smart enough to realize theﾂ\u003ca href=\"http://www.houseonahill.net/index.php/blog/permalink/state-of-national-emergency/1/\"\u003elegal implications\u003c/a\u003e of today\u0026rsquo;s events, nor can I provide some detailed analysis of how we keep doingﾂ\u003ca href=\"http://www.thepinoy.net/content/index.php/2006/02/24/philippines-tears-itself-apart/\"\u003ethis sort of thing\u003c/a\u003e to ourselves over and over again, nor am I old enough to note anyﾂ\u003ca href=\"http://www.unlawyer.net/?p=231\"\u003eeerie similarities\u003c/a\u003e with the events during Marcos\u0026rsquo; time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I do know is that whoever advised the President to proclaim a state of emergency at this stage is either an idiot, or an agent of the political opposition out to take her down. I would like to think that any Philippine President, especially one undergoing questions of her legitimacy, would stay away from anything that would show people that she really was the monster they all claimed she was. A threat of curtailing our democractic freedoms in order to handle a \u0026ldquo;coup\u0026rdquo; that is not even visible to the people (much less a clear and present danger) can only be construed as an attempt to desperately hold on to power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYesterday, I was informed through the usual SMS channels that there might be some sort of trouble during the next couple of days. I shrugged it all off, knowing full well that no matter how many warm bodies the opposition manage to pay off to join their rallies, nothing would happen until they presented a viable alternative to the people, an alternative so blindingly obvious people would have to be idiots not to want it. All GMA had to do was weather the storm, same way she did the whole impeachment fiasco, and she would survive. She just had to avoid \u0026ldquo;biting\u0026rdquo; at all the forces taunting her, avoid doing anything patently stupid such as declaring martial law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t martial law, but it was still stupid. And just the sort of mistake her opponents have been waiting for. But will they be able to capitalize on it?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

And I suspect a large majority of Smallville fans are as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, I also figure that there are four types of Smallville episodes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEpisodes that push the whole Clark-becoming-Superman thing (such as the ones where the ship is opened for the first time, or the one where Clark establishes the Fortress of Solitude.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEpisodes that feature comic-book cameos and references (such as the ones featuring appearances by other DC heroes such as the Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg. I\u0026rsquo;m still waiting for Bruce Wayne to pop in somewhere)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEpisodes that push Smallville\u0026rsquo;s internal storylines (such as any episode centered on Chloe, Clark/Lana relationship stuff, Lionel\u0026rsquo;s conspiracies, etc.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eX-Files episodes (most of the \u0026ldquo;meteor freak\u0026rdquo; episodes)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, obviously, the 3 elements of the first list match nicely with the first 3 elements of the second list. This leads me to believe that most Smallville followers merely tolerate the meteor freak episodes so that they can get to the part where Clark tries to name his dog \u0026ldquo;Krypto.\u0026rdquo; The first two seasons were chock-full of \u0026ldquo;meteor freak\u0026rdquo; episodes and I was tempted to give up on the series at that time, but the whole becoming-Superman thing started to get going a bit in the third season, and now in the fifth season it feels like at least 50-75% of the episodes are geared towards eventually reaching the \u0026ldquo;Superman\u0026rdquo; stage. So, I guess I\u0026rsquo;m sticking with Smallville for a while, if only to see how what silly excuse they come up with to resolve that whole \u0026ldquo;Hey doesn\u0026rsquo;t Superman look like Clark Kent did before he wore glasses?\u0026rdquo; thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

For some reason, he soon digressed into how earlier that day he had witnessed a man snatch a cellphone from a young woman inside a jeepney. The young woman was of course dumbstruck as the perp made his escape. My host candidly told me that if only he\u0026rsquo;d had a passenger to watch his cab for him, he would have stepped out of his cab (he was deep in traffic) and given chase himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if to make sure that I believed he would be capable of such a thing, he related how he had once survived a hold-up attempt by three young men, killing one of them in the process. He described the encounter as one that left him wounded and bloody all over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also displayed quite a disdain for drug addicts, as he recounted the time some guy asked to be brought to the pier while carrying a bag ofﾂ_shabuﾂ_in the early morning. Our heroic (?) taxi driver made it a point to choose a route that brought him past a police checkpoint, and he used his headlights to signal to the cops that there was something fishy, so they were flagged down for checking. He told the cops that he didn\u0026rsquo;t care about the taxi fare, just wants to be rid of the guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was the time a snatcher was running past his cab, and he opened the driver-side door to smash into the guy. Once the perpetrator was on the ground, he proceeded to kick him down and even broke his wrist. (He gave me a small demo by flopping around his hand.) He said he then left the guy to theﾂ\u003cem\u003ebarangay tanods\u003c/em\u003e, as a gift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Regalo ko na sa inyo yan,\u0026quot;\u003c/em\u003e were his words, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we went into the inevitable litany of how soft we were on crime. Apparently he had worked in Saudi for more than 10 years, and he preferred the Saudi method of eye for an eye; when a thief was caught in Suadi Arabia, his hands were cut off. He pshawed away any talk of human rights, saying that if a person was guilty he should just be killed right away. He professed a hatred of criminals and drug addicts and implied that he enjoys any chance to deliver some beatdown on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI, of course, was tempted to play devil\u0026rsquo;s advocate and argue for the side of human rights, but I realized that this was a guy who had confessed to killing someone before! Granted, I\u0026rsquo;m not robbing him, but I might get at least a poke in the eye for disagreeing with him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow me, I\u0026rsquo;ve never witnessed a single snatching or holding-upping or anything like that on the mean streets of metro manila. This man was giving me insights on how it was to truly live on the streets. And I found myself thinking, at least at that level there are still people who reject the rampant criminality that apparently pervades our streets (however ends-justify-the-means his reasoning may be).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe taxi driver remarked that robbers and snatchers always say something like \u0026ldquo;I just needed money to buy milk for my baby\u0026rdquo;, which is a totally BS excuse. Many hundreds, if not thousands of our countrymen struggle everyday trying to make a decent, honest living, and as long as there are people able to walk that road, \u0026ldquo;I had to do it to survive\u0026rdquo; is *not* an excuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat sort of petty crime on the streets is a vicious cycle, and even if you say that it\u0026rsquo;s caused by poverty, it also causes poverty by itself\u0026hellip; more often than not the victims are just the sort of people who have worked extra hard to be able to save up for something decent. As the taxi driver mentioned, many of the snatched cellphones are probably not even yet fully paid for. It\u0026rsquo;s a case of poverty feeding upon itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe wandered into more discussions about gun control, the situation in America and Saudi Arabia and almost always his solutions came back to some form of harsh and inhumane punishment or perhaps vigilantism. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s not a bad idea; imagine how much safer Metro Manila might be if we had some sort of Batman-like character prowling the night and scaring the hell out of would-be criminals?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eYeah, I haven\u0026rsquo;t been posting lately. I still have a lot of thoughts running around my head, and often throughout the day I find myself thinking, \u0026ldquo;I should post an entry about this.\u0026rdquo; But at the end of the day, I\u0026rsquo;m tired and I\u0026rsquo;m exhausted from thinking about two hundred different issues and juggling twenty different priorities, so I don\u0026rsquo;t post about it. I note it somewhere and sooner or later it becomes irrelevant and I forget why I wanted to post it in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remarked to one of my coworkers that I often find myself remembering dozens of things in my head simultaneously and he of course reminded me of the popular notion that human beings can only remember seven things at any one time. It\u0026rsquo;s the concept of limitation in humans\u0026rsquo; short-term memory or RAM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is probably mostly true, but as I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten more and more used to this multitasking mode of mine, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that the seven most important things stay on top, but the rest don\u0026rsquo;t really disappear. They fall away for a while, swallowed into your subconscious, only to rear their ugly head again later once you have some free RAM again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy current role at work forces me to be locked in this mode for most of the day. As one of the senior technical guys, I typically field dozens of technical questions from junior developers during a single day and when somebody\u0026rsquo;s problem can\u0026rsquo;t be solved quickly I physically get up from my desk and go walk them through it. And that\u0026rsquo;s just the queries regarding concerns outside my own project. Aside from that I often have to worry about scheduling, technical risks, physical designs and of course the occasional invitation to go down and buy some food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeveloper multitasking is generally looked-down upon in the tech world I know; people are encouraged to work directly on one task at a time to give them focus. Maybe most people have some short period of time at the start of the day to reply to emails and address issues raised by other people. I wish I could have that sort of luxury, but it seems to me that every issue or problem raised to me needs to be resolved five minutes ago. People can\u0026rsquo;t continue coding unless I help them. Schedules can\u0026rsquo;t be finalized until I give my input. Developers can\u0026rsquo;t write program specifications until I hand in the database design. I literally have dozens of dependencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, how do I cope? Simple, I cope the only way I know how. By instinct. This would be a terrifying revelation to anyone I actually work with, but during working hours I\u0026rsquo;m typically buried under so many issues, my only recourse is to dismiss as many as I can as quickly as possible, and that requires a whole lot of working from my gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, my gut has gotten really good at this. But I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure all the people who are incredibly organized and have moleskin notebooks and stuff would tear their hair at such an unorganized method (or is it madness?). And I know, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to get organized, I really am. I have to-do lists, a couple of dozen that tell me what I should be doing. I have log files that theoretically tell me what I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing all day. I try to turn off my email client sometimes, even though I will inevitably have people coming up to me and asking if I\u0026rsquo;d seen the mail they just sent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I can\u0026rsquo;t help it. That\u0026rsquo;s the role I play. People expect me to help them, to provide them guidance. I\u0026rsquo;ve projected myself as being open to consultations, and the company and all of my coworkers appreciate that. And even then I still have my own tasks to perform. I\u0026rsquo;m considering suggesting to the company that I never be considered working on a project for more than a 50% allocation. The other 50% should be allocated to my on-the-fly firefighting tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the day, especially during the past couple of weeks, I\u0026rsquo;ve found myself mentally exhausted. I have a very easy time separating work from personal life, because by the time I step into the elevator after logging out I\u0026rsquo;m already too tired to even think about work issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that I have a bad job, mind you. It\u0026rsquo;s awesome. But I guess sometimes I toss myself into it a bit too much. When my personal load is light, I can easily handle everything tossed at me and people go \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re awesome!\u0026rdquo; and I nod and address the next crisis. But when my load is heavy, well, then things really get exciting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forgot what my point was now, as I unconsciously launched into a narrative of how my typical day goes. I\u0026rsquo;m still getting by with my gut, but I know from experience that gut instinct only gets you so far. Sooner or later, something\u0026rsquo;s gonna give and I\u0026rsquo;ll need to find some way to make sure I can carry this level of awesome-ness to the next level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, and yeah I changed layouts.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Yeah, I haven\u0026rsquo;t been posting lately. I still have a lot of thoughts running around my head, and often throughout the day I find myself thinking, \u0026ldquo;I should post an entry about this.\u0026rdquo; But at the end of the day, I\u0026rsquo;m tired and I\u0026rsquo;m exhausted from thinking about two hundred different issues and juggling twenty different priorities, so I don\u0026rsquo;t post about it. I note it somewhere and sooner or later it becomes irrelevant and I forget why I wanted to post it in the first place.",
