            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI have an applet that calls a JDialog that contains a JProgressBar component.

However, when invoking the above function on Firefox 2/3/3.5 on a Mac, the progressDialog is displayed indefinitely, i.e. it doesn\u0026rsquo;t close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suspected that calling setVisible(true) inside the EventQueue was causing the problem, since it\u0026rsquo;s a blocking call and might block the queue completely, so I tried changing it to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e        // show the dialog\n        new Thread() {\n            public void run() {\n                progressDialog.setVisible(true);\n            }\n        }.start();\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this change, the progressDialog now closes correctly, but a new problem emerged - the contents of the dialog (which included the progressbar, an icon and a JLabel used to show a message string) were no longer shown inside the dialog. It was still a problem only on Mac Firefox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny ideas? I realize it\u0026rsquo;s probably some AWT threading issue, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been at this for a couple of days and can\u0026rsquo;t find a good solution. Wrapping the doStuff() business logic in a separate new Thread seems to work, but it\u0026rsquo;s not easy to refactor the actual business logic code into a separate thread, so I\u0026rsquo;m hoping there\u0026rsquo;s a simpler solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe envt is:\nMac OSX 10.5\nJava 1.5\nFirefox 2/3/3.5\u003c/p\u003e\n",
