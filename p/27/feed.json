This is a general programming principle not specific to game development. In this way, you make it easier to modify your data (like decision trees) without necessarily having to rebuild your code. For example, you could change the dialog message for each pokemon starter choice, or maybe you could add more choices, or make the starter pokemon be Snorlax, MewTwo and Ekans for some reason (those are pokemon right? Lol). Bigger game studios will have separate tools to maintain those data files so that even nonprogrammers can help change those kinds of things in the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

There hasn\u0026rsquo;t been much innovation in the feed reader space in the last decade it seems, which is totally understandable given they are mostly tools used by internet \u0026ldquo;power users\u0026rdquo;, and mostly by older netheads, so the target market isn\u0026rsquo;t very large.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I talk about \u0026ldquo;feeds\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;feed readers\u0026rdquo;, I\u0026rsquo;m not talking only about RSS and the associated readers, but anything that lets me aggregate contents from a set of sources. This includes most social media streams (Twitter, etc), I guess Indieweb microformats readers (though I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried these a lot), and apps like \u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/\"\u003eFlipboard\u003c/a\u003e (which I typically use for my morning news).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecently I installed a self-hosted \u003ca href=\"https://tt-rss.org/\"\u003eTiny Tiny RSS\u003c/a\u003e to take the place of my primary RSS feed reader. I also previously tried Inoreader and Feedly. The jump to TTRSS was mostly to avoid the free account limitations on those services. TTRSS is fine and it\u0026rsquo;s serviceable, but there\u0026rsquo;s still a lot of improvement I would like. I think about feed reader features a lot because (a) I like reading content from a wide variety of sources and feed readers help me do that; and (b) even back when Google Reader was still around I was kicking around the idea of writing my own feed reader. It\u0026rsquo;s one of those side projects that I want to build for myself but never get around to it. I\u0026rsquo;ll note down a couple of features I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about in the past decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first flaw I find in most readers (including social media feeds) is that they typically treat all feeds the same way. In reality, I would like to be able to treat some feeds differently. I can think of at least two categories:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efeeds where I don\u0026rsquo;t mind missing some of their content (since I don\u0026rsquo;t always have time to read), and don\u0026rsquo;t mind just browsing their latest content like a magazine. Flipboard is great for this. Most social media feeds on the other hand seem to want to pull you away from this model by having their feeds be \u0026ldquo;algorithmic\u0026rdquo;. And for traditional RSS readers, having unread counts for this type of feed doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense, and only annoys me and my compulsive need for zero unread counts.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efeeds where I don\u0026rsquo;t want to miss any of their content. Maybe because it\u0026rsquo;s a particular source that I enjoy reading, or because it\u0026rsquo;s a feed I set up for notification purposes or such, or maybe the source is an events page where I want to know all the events they set up. Basically feeds that have a high signal-to-noise ratio for me (although ideally all the feeds I follow have high S/N ratio.) For this kind of feed, the unread counts in traditional RSS readers make sense.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI imagine there could be some in-between categories as well, possibly customizable. Something like a feed where I have unread counts, but also automatically mark as read articles that are too old? IDK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered this when I realized I could import my \u003ca href=\"https://roytang.net/2019/08/1167000875090378752/\"\u003eYoutube subscriptions as RSS\u003c/a\u003e. That gave me a whole lot of new feeds to follow, but I realized it was kind of a waste of time because most of the channels I follow are there for me to browse through when I\u0026rsquo;m looking for entertainment, but usually not the kind of content I want to regularly appear in my feeds. (So they\u0026rsquo;re under the first type.) Importing them basically added a lot of noise to my feed reader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFacebook actually had something like you could add friends to a \u0026ldquo;Close Friends\u0026rdquo; list, and their posts would be prioritized for you and appear in your notification bar. I don\u0026rsquo;t FB much anymore, so IDK if this feature is still around, but as I recall you can\u0026rsquo;t use it with Pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother feature I\u0026rsquo;d like is grouping posts by topic, or the ability to highlight \u0026ldquo;related stories\u0026rdquo; for an article from other sources that I\u0026rsquo;m also following. For example, if there\u0026rsquo;s some breaking news story, and the article about this from NewsSourceA appears in my feed, I could maybe see a link to related articles about the same topic from NewsSourceB, NewsSourceC, and so on that I also follow. Or maybe choose to mark the topic as read or block further content about this topic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is one of my major grips when using Flipboard, especially for the \u0026ldquo;Latest news\u0026rdquo; sections. There\u0026rsquo;ll be like 5 different articles about the latest Trump meltdown, and I encounter them at different points in the feed. I don\u0026rsquo;t mind reading about Trump meltdowns, but it would be more efficient if I could have each instance only appear in my feeds once. I understand this may be a bit challenging since it involves some automated content analysis though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must admit I haven\u0026rsquo;t explored too much the paid features of services like Feedly or Inoreader, so maybe they support something similar to these features already. (I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s unlikely though. And I\u0026rsquo;m not really up for paying the monthly fees haha.) In addition to traditional RSS readers though, I\u0026rsquo;d also like my reader to be able to support following other kinds of sources like social media, ActivityStreams-compliant streams (Mastodon, etc), microformats feeds, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe someday I\u0026rsquo;ll get around to finally building that feed reader I wanted for myself!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I don\u0026rsquo;t use Inoreader anymore, but a recent blog post of theirs recently appeared in my feeds that mentioned they implemented \u0026ldquo;sort by magic\u0026rdquo;. This was a feature that Google reader had 10 YEARS AGO! There hasn\u0026rsquo;t been much innovation in the feed reader space in the last decade it seems, which is totally understandable given they are mostly tools used by internet \u0026ldquo;power users\u0026rdquo;, and mostly by older netheads, so the target market isn\u0026rsquo;t very large.",

They are standing against China, the fascist juggernaut of the modern world, and the odds of victory are low. This week, the police have laid siege to university campuses, and recently the \u003ca href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/hong-kong-university-campus-like-a-warzone-as-night-time-battle-breaks-out-20191113-p53a1f.html\"\u003epolice have evacuated mainland students\u003c/a\u003e from HK, which seems to me as an indication that we are nearing some kind of tipping point, something akin to 1989\u0026rsquo;s Tiananmen massacre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe international response has been tepid at best, although both houses of the US legislature have passed or are preparing resolutions condemning the police brutality. Private companies have been embroiled in controversy for censoring efforts to voice support for the protestors, in a blatant example of how capitalism will not stand in support of freedom if it contradicts the bottom line. The gamer-relevant example is of course Blizzard, who suspended and censored Hearthstone pro Blitzchung for delivering this post\u0026rsquo;s title during a livestream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hong Kong protests are perhaps a microcosm of many of the problems faced by modern society: inequality, authoritarianism, state surveillance, police brutality, the indifference of capitalism, and even China itself. As the decade winds to a close, perhaps the HK revolution and its eventual outcome (whether that be the successful repression of the protests by China or a full-blown rebellion) provide a stark preview of what to expect in the decade to come. Indeed, Hong Kong is the revolution of our time.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a lot more uncommon for me to go to places like Ortigas or Makati nowadays, but when I do I almost always take the P2P bus. The P2P (Point-to-Point) buses were introduced in Metro Manila I think around late 2015/early 2016, as a pricier alternative to the usual city buses. The fares are more expensive, but the buses are also much more comfortable and they don\u0026rsquo;t make stops along their route, only at the endpoints, so their travel time is faster compared to the usual city buses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring a recent P2P trip, the bus driver had another person with him that he mentioned was an \u0026ldquo;apprentice\u0026rdquo;, basically a new hire that was shadowing him to learn the route. During the 45 minute ride, the two of them talked quite a bit about the P2P business model (from the POV of the driver/employee of course). I learned some interesting things so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d write about it. All of these points I just overheard from the two so maybe take it with a grain of salt especially in regards to accuracy of numbers etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe more senior driver had only been in this job since July, but he seemed very satisfied with how much he was earning.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUnlike regular drivers and their boundary system, P2P drivers are salaried, with a daily salary of around P700 + P150 allowance. They are required to render 8 hrs/day for their daily pay.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThey are given an incentive based on the number of people they carry over a day. The example given was if you manage to ferry 225 people in one day, you get a P300 incentive; 300 people is a P500 incentive, and so on. From what I gather, 300 riders is already very high for a single day. The senior driver says this route is comparatively better than the other route (also from the same general endpoint), since that other route is longer and it\u0026rsquo;s harder to meet the incentives.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThey also have overtime pay, around P85-P100 per hour (the two had conflicting info).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe more senior driver says the job is pretty good, \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;basta masipag ka.\u0026quot;\u003c/em\u003e He always drives as many trips as he could to get as much overtime as possible; he sometimes finishes at 11pm, then just eats and goes home to sleep. \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Wala naman akong libangan\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e, he says. (This saddened me a bit.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe senior driver mentioned that they get paid on the 10th and the 25th, but there\u0026rsquo;s also a daily salary?? I think like maybe the allowance is given daily because he said \u0026ldquo;hindi ka magugutom kasi may pera araw-araw\u0026rdquo; or maybe the incentive is given daily? The overtime pay he has to file his extra hours, so that\u0026rsquo;s not a daily thing.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe senior driver says that his last overtime filing was for 100+ hours. At P100/hour that\u0026rsquo;s more than P10K, so not bad.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe senior driver says in this job, your driver\u0026rsquo;s license is much \u0026ldquo;safer\u0026rdquo; than a regular city bus driving job. He claims the traffic authorities \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e apprehend P2P drivers. Presumably because it\u0026rsquo;s a government project? The apprentice says \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;ah kaya pala hindi ka nagseseatbelt\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e, and the senior driver says yes, he never wears the seat belt, even when there\u0026rsquo;s a cop standing right in front of the bus. By contrast, if a cop spotted any normal city bus driver without a seat belt, that would be an automatic infraction.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGiven the economics of his job, the senior driver says he doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel the need to compete with the city bus drivers (\u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;hindi na ko nakikipaggitgitan\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e), and his drive is more relaxed since he doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about picking up passengers etc. \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Parang naglalaro lang.\u0026quot;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe apprentice used to work as a 10-wheeler truck driver (hauling cargo). He says the pay was a bit higher in his last job, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t give him benefits (overtime, SSS, philhealth, etc). This seems illegal to me??\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously I\u0026rsquo;m not from the same economic bracket as those targetted to work in this occupation, but it seems like a pretty good gig, compared to normal city bus driver jobs at least. I\u0026rsquo;m glad the economics are working out for both the drivers and the service providers, as the P2P buses are a pretty good alternative option for those who can afford it.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Hopefully you have a support/DevOps team to handle the response. If not, the dev team themselves have to step in. This usual means a mad rush to figure out what happened and how to fix it, sometimes during off hours and maybe even into the early morning, all while facing pressure from clients and higher-ups. I was advising another developer in such a situation a while back, and it was his first stint as technical lead so he was extra worried. I gave him a few tips to see him through the time of crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eKeep calm. In Tagalog, \u003ca href=\"/2019/04/project-management-tip-kalma-lang/\"\u003ekalma lang\u003c/a\u003e. In a crisis, there can be a lot of stress and pressure to fix things immediately. It\u0026rsquo;s best to keep a level head and make sure the team is keeping it together. Don\u0026rsquo;t let your emotions carry you away, and try to avoid panic.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSolve one problem at a time until you can go home. This is a lesson from the movie \u003ca href=\"/2015/10/10154142633048912/\"\u003eThe Martian\u003c/a\u003e. In a crisis it can be difficult to focus on the task at hand and if you\u0026rsquo;re not thinking straight you might just charge in there blindly and move things around until things get better. Follow step #1, then figure out what are the most pressing problems that need to be solved immediately, then address them one at a time. It can also help your team morale to identify which issues can be left until the next day. This gives them a concrete sense of what is set of problems to focus on, and motivates them to solve those so they can go home.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBe extra careful. In times like these, you may find yourself needing to deploy hotfixes directly to production or maybe even update data directly in the production database, in the interest of expediency. It\u0026rsquo;s also during times like these that you are more likely to make a mistake, especially if your team is under stress and working overtime/during off hours. So it would pay to be extra careful, maybe add an additional layer of review before deploying things directly to production. You\u0026rsquo;re already in a crisis, don\u0026rsquo;t make things worse by making a sloppy mistake.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving to provide tech support during such a crisis is something you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t wish on any developer, but sometimes it can\u0026rsquo;t be avoided. (Some might even consider it a kind of rite of passage so to speak). Make sure to have the right mindset to be able to operate well under such stressful conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

My main criticism for the indieweb movement at the moment is that I don\u0026rsquo;t see a path to mass adoption, especially for the purposes of moving people away from silos like Facebook. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s not really one of the goals. My main issue is with two of the principles outlined in the post above (read the post again for more details):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0026ldquo;Make What You Need / Scratch Your Itch\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u0026ldquo;Use What You Make / Dogfood\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing about these concepts is that there is a lot of work involved and there are significant barriers to entry for getting involved. I mean, most people aren\u0026rsquo;t going to (won\u0026rsquo;t be able to) bother with the first step (getting your own domain), much more be able to \u0026ldquo;make what you need\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s ok for people like me who are comfortable with the highly technical and have a bunch of free time, but for the average person it seems unlikely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can imagine there might be created a service that supports most of the Indieweb features and can easily be adopted by the mass market, although that has a lot of its own challenges as well, and it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like replacing one kind of silo with another? At least it would be a more open silo I guess? I think \u003ca href=\"https://micro.blog/\"\u003emicro.blog\u003c/a\u003e already supports the indieweb stuff, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t yet looked too closely into that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am still moving forward with the indieweb stuff, and I am hopeful that it manages to coalesce into something that can challenge the way the modern internet works, but that may be a long way off. As far as I can tell, adoption is not yet very widespread, and AFAICT the main people driving the effort with their \u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/events/2019-11-13-homebrew-website-club\"\u003eHomebrew Website Clubs\u003c/a\u003e are in Western countries.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAha! I finally managed to finish a book again!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve heard of Cal Newport since years ago tangentially due to his Study Hacks blog, which was pretty good at the time. I haven\u0026rsquo;t followed his career too closely, but he\u0026rsquo;s an academic at Georgetown apparently. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t looking for any career advice in particular, but I did have a recommendation for this book from somewhere so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d give it a go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book is \u003cem\u003eSo Good They Can\u0026rsquo;t Ignore You\u003c/em\u003e, and focuses on what it takes to have a \u0026ldquo;successful career\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy favorite thing about this book is that from the get-go, the author discards something most self-improvement books focus on: passion. The author discards passion as non-essential. A lot of self-improvement books also lay out a bunch of principles and rules and wink at the reader and say something to the effect of \u0026ldquo;You just have to do all of this stuff, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be super successful!\u0026rdquo;, as if all of those rules + a bit of passion are some sort of secret ingredient that allow you to skip past all the hard work necessary to find success. This book doesn\u0026rsquo;t shy away from the concept of hard work. Instead, it embraces it, in the form of what the author calls \u0026ldquo;career capital\u0026rdquo;. Basically, you need to earn enough \u0026ldquo;career capital\u0026rdquo; in order to then exchange that capital for the trappings of a successful career, such as more control over your time. \u0026ldquo;Career capital\u0026rdquo; is what makes you \u0026ldquo;so good they can\u0026rsquo;t ignore you.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike many books of this type, the ideas are presented as if the author came by them scientific analysis, but really the basis seems to be a series of anecdotal success stories of people whose career paths coincide with the author\u0026rsquo;s central thesis. This is not inherently a bad thing, though it does weaken the foundation of the books claims that it\u0026rsquo;s not backed by a detailed scientific study. But for purposes of laying out his ideas in an entertaining manner, the format is certainly sufficient. The success stories are really the meat of the book, designed to lay out the author\u0026rsquo;s rules and show how they are applicable to real, actual careers. And in most of the success stories, he traces their story for more than a decade of building up \u0026ldquo;career capital\u0026rdquo;, again emphasizing hard work over dreaming of overnight success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI personally relate to the concept of not being defined by passion and instead working hard to earn \u0026ldquo;career capital\u0026rdquo; and the idea that you can cash that capital in for more control. This mirrors my own career path where I spent more than a decade working for some multinational company, not really specializing in anything in particular and developing a variety of interests before deciding to use that career capital to go freelance and establish more control over my life. What I don\u0026rsquo;t have yet, is the overarching \u0026ldquo;mission\u0026rdquo; described by the author\u0026rsquo;s Rule #4. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a unifying vision driving my life forward, probably a result of my being very \u003ca href=\"/2019/11/unfocused/\"\u003eunfocused\u003c/a\u003e. Or perhaps I already have one and it is yet to be clearly articulated? Hmm, we\u0026rsquo;ll see. In any case, I find the book\u0026rsquo;s contents quite relevant to my own career and the ideas presented here will probably be relevant to me personally as I try to crystallize my own plans for the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book is a relatively short (Kindle version says 276 pages, and a lot of that is notes and links) and a quick read (I finished it piecemeal over 3 days, but could have easily finished in 1). I think I got it on sale a few months ago for around $4, not bad for that price, and a decent pickup for anyone looking to chart a clearer career path.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

This blog is a great example: it\u0026rsquo;s not the sort of thing that is difficult to monetize or focus into a large audience because I tend to write about a lot of things and no one thing in particular. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried spinning off separate blogs that focus on particular topics only: I\u0026rsquo;ve started an MtG-focused blog and a comic-book focused blog. I can put in the effort for these things because I do have interest, but because of the wide variety of interests, my focus on each one inevitably waxes and wanes, and when I look away from those particular niches to focus on other things for a while, those blogs suffer and eventually die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was thinking about this because the other day I was trying to sort/arrange my RSS feeds and I was like \u0026ldquo;Why am I following so many damn feeds?\u0026rdquo; and the answer was of course because I\u0026rsquo;m interested in so many things.

But at best it\u0026rsquo;s a double-edged sword. It is difficult to find focus true, and one tends to jump from topic to topic at a moment\u0026rsquo;s notice. But there are a lot of perks as well. Life is almost always interesting, there is very little downtime, unless you choose it. There is always some event, some convention, some announcement, some new release to look forward to. Life is short and there is so much of it to appreciate and enjoy that for me personally it would feel like a waste to be so narrowly-focused. The world is huge and there is so much of it to embrace that it seems a shame to stay in one tiny corner of it for all your life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I will kind of just lean into it and enjoy the chaos it brings to life!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Everytime I see it in someone\u0026rsquo;s code I need to stop and mentally remind myself what it does. I figured I\u0026rsquo;d write a devnote to help improve my recall.\nTypically, yield is used in a function with a loop, like so:\ndef some_func(lim): for i in range(0, lim): yield i yield means the function returns a \u0026ldquo;generator\u0026rdquo; that can be used as an iterable in a loop:",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA while back I found myself having to figure out how to compile/build/run a mobile application. The developers previously assigned to the project were no longer available to consult with, but they did leave behind some documentation. However, their documentation quality left a lot to be desired. The instructions they left basically amounted to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ccode\u003enpm install\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ccode\u003eionic serve\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ccode\u003eionic codrova run android\u003c/code\u003e/\u003ccode\u003eios\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, first sign of trouble is that their instructions were basically commands that anyone who knew the app used Ionic would be able to Google. But ok, I gave this a shot, even though I had not used Ionic/Cordova before, I assumed the simple documentation meant it would be straightforward (spoiler: it was not).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFirst problem: \u003ccode\u003enpm install\u003c/code\u003e fails. Okaaaay. I dig around for a bit and figure out there\u0026rsquo;s an incompatibility between one of the packages and my node version (12). Some more digging around tells me that the previous developers likely were using Node 8. I switch to Node 8 and \u003ccode\u003enpm install\u003c/code\u003e finishes successfully, somehow.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSecond problem: \u003ccode\u003eionic serve\u003c/code\u003e throws an error from one of the dependencies. A bit more digging around. Reading ionic docs. Stackoverflow. Turns out there was some extra configuration needed to be added if you\u0026rsquo;re doing this stuff on Windows. (I later found out the previous developers had used Ubuntu.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThird problem: \u003ccode\u003eionic serve\u003c/code\u003e throws a whole bunch of typescript errors. Why? After facepalming for a bit, I dig around again. And dig some more. Looks like dependency issues. But the \u003ccode\u003epackage.json\u003c/code\u003e has dozens of dependencies, it would take me forever to figure out the problem. I find myself digging through the repository\u0026rsquo;s commit history trying to figure out if there was a recent change to the \u003ccode\u003epackage.json\u003c/code\u003e that would cause the issue. What I notice instead is that a couple of weeks before the handover, someone deleted \u003ccode\u003epackage-lock.json\u003c/code\u003e from the repository for some unknown reason. Deciding to try it out, I restore the old version of \u003ccode\u003epackage-lock.json\u003c/code\u003e, do the whole \u003ccode\u003enpm install\u003c/code\u003e dance again, and sure enough the typescript errors vanish. But we\u0026rsquo;re not yet done.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFourth problem: \u003ccode\u003eionic serve\u003c/code\u003e no longer throws an error, but when it launches the browser, there\u0026rsquo;s a cyclic error stacktrace shown. Some stackoverflow answers tells me this is because something can\u0026rsquo;t be serialize it, and I trace the problem to a generic error handler that just calls \u003ccode\u003econsole.log\u003c/code\u003e. I comment this out so that I can see the actual error, which is \u0026ldquo;cordova doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist\u0026rdquo; (or something to that effect). I realize this means that the mobile app uses some native-specific things, so Cordova is required and it\u0026rsquo;s not going to work when served via web, so why did they include this step?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSo instead I do \u003ccode\u003eionic cordova run android\u003c/code\u003e (after installing the necessary Android Studio/SDK things\u0026hellip;this was after my \u003ca href=\"/2019/09/two-backups/\"\u003erecent computer troubles\u003c/a\u003e, so I had a fresh OS install.) And yes, long story short, I am finally able to get the Android app running in an emulator (and eventually in a device, and then the iOS version as well).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recounted this because I could use it as lesson to note that even when you do have documentation, there are so many ways the documentation can be insufficient. In this case:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe dependencies/requirements were not specified\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethey did not have someone actually go through these steps from a fresh install to verify things would work\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA case could also be made that they should have just had something like a Docker setup available, but they actually did have a \u003ccode\u003edocker-compose.yml\u003c/code\u003e in the repository! Sadly, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have worked either because it referenced some environment variables that I had no idea what the value needed to be. And besides, my PC doesn\u0026rsquo;t support Docker (silly Windows Home), but looking at the docker image did clue me in to what Node version to use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this instance, it was also a problem was that the old team was asked to provide the documentation only after the handover (due to circumstances beyond our control). Ideally, a handover would have them available for consultation should there be problems found with their documentation, and the documentation would only be cleared for acceptance after such review. (Realistically, a lot of documentation like user manuals wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be looked at, but in this case, the ability to build the application was kind of crucial!)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eSomething I haven\u0026rsquo;t done in a while: travel with my parents to Bicol to pay respects to our ancestors during the \u003cem\u003eundas\u003c/em\u003e long weekend. In fact, the last time I made this trip was \u003ca href=\"/2004/10/getting-away-from-it-all/\"\u003eback in 2004\u003c/a\u003e, 15 years ago!

But instead of heading there directly, we went first to Naga City in Camarines Sur, where we had relatives and family friends to visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"10-hour-bus\"\u003e10 Hour Bus\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe overnight bus ride from Manila to Naga is longer than the one to Daet, at an estimated 10 hours. We booked a \u0026ldquo;lazyboy\u0026rdquo; Amihan bus, which meant we would be getting a ride at the Cubao Busport that was newly-opened a couple of years ago. My parents were super-impressed with the busport when it first opened, comparing it to an airport terminal. It was my first time using the busport, and I was mostly underwhelmed. I will say it\u0026rsquo;s nicer than other bus terminals in the country, but that\u0026rsquo;s a low standard and nowhere near an airport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#8ee8b97763ced0a4f23ede57e860c975-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/20191029_171737_hu1850e6ec956155ef1a1d4296057d059f_1216801_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"The Araneta center busport\" title=\"The Araneta center busport\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eThe Araneta center busport (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"8ee8b97763ced0a4f23ede57e860c975-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/20191029_171737.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eThe Araneta center busport\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"4 Nov 2019 12:00am\"\u003e4 Nov 2019 12:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 10-hour bus ride was expectedly miserable; I probably got little more than 2-3 hours of shallow sleep (Fitbit didn\u0026rsquo;t even register any sleep at all, although as if to compensate, it gave me an extra 4000 steps for the next day\u0026hellip;). Comparing it to plane rides (which are also generally miserable), the bus ride had more legroom (yay!) but was way more turbulent (impossible for me to read anything). Level of discomfort with the seat back and difficulty sleeping was about the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSide note: I am generally pessimistic about bus rides, because growing up, these trips to Bicol were a lot more common, and I was lot more prone to motion-sickness while on the bus, especially as some of these Bicol roads are exceptionally curve-y. My mom often had to provide me with a barf bag, because me puking due to motion-sickness on these rides was the rule rather than the exception. Thankfully, I\u0026rsquo;m better able to handle it these days. That, and I have bonamine now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"naga-city\"\u003eNaga City\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy uncle picks us up at the Bicol Central Terminal in Naga, and we have a quick breakfast at the local McDonald\u0026rsquo;s. We drop our bags at his house and rest for a while, after which he takes on a few quick stops around the town. It\u0026rsquo;s my first time in Naga (or at least, the first time in adult memory), so everything is new to me. Apparently, the town is well-known for the Penafrancia festival, something akin to Quiapo\u0026rsquo;s Nazareno festival, a religious festival involving pilgrimage from one religious site to another. Except this one uses a water route somehow (?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst stop is the Jesse Robredo Museum. Disclaimer: I\u0026rsquo;ve never met the former Naga City Mayor/DILG secretary or his wife, the current VP, but we are indirectly related through in-law-ness. My uncle here in Naga is married to Jesse Robredo\u0026rsquo;s sister, making him the Vice-President\u0026rsquo;s brother-in-law, I think? Is that how it works? Anyway, for this reason, the current VP is highly regarded on the father\u0026rsquo;s side of the family, despite the country\u0026rsquo;s divisive politics. The museum itself was ok, highlighting J.Robredo\u0026rsquo;s career highlights and accomplishments. It\u0026rsquo;s not super large (I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine that a museum dedicated to a single politician can be), and a visit is probably 30-45 minutes long (including a short AV presentation).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#81f271719a457caa65701bf431b750b9-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/20191030_110729_hu3e0e29eb884911ebc3971284069254c2_1109802_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Jesse Robredo Museum\" title=\"Jesse Robredo Museum\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eJesse Robredo Museum (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"81f271719a457caa65701bf431b750b9-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/20191030_110729.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eJesse Robredo Museum\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"4 Nov 2019 12:00am\"\u003e4 Nov 2019 12:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eMy uncle drove us around town a bit, pointing out this or that. One thing that struck me was that small-town feel of \u0026ldquo;everybody knows everyone\u0026rdquo;, since he would often point to a building/business as we drove past and say it was owned by the son of so-and-so and my dad would be like, \u0026ldquo;ah, the one who went to X school?\u0026rdquo; and so on and other stuff like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLunch-time we visited this restaurant my dad liked, Jimmy and Tang\u0026rsquo;s (no relation, though jokingly they claim to be cousins). Given my peculiar dietary tastes, I\u0026rsquo;m not much for Bicolano food, but my dad loves it of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfternoon was some free time, so I decided to wander around SM City Naga. Having a mall in Naga is not a new thing, I\u0026rsquo;m told SM City Naga has been there since the late 90s. Still, the mall was quite small, and there\u0026rsquo;s the distinct lack of dedicated stores that I like to visit: Comic book stores, gaming stores, bookstores (National doesn\u0026rsquo;t count!). I imagine it must be difficult to have geeky interests in the provinces. In the evening we had dinner at Robinson\u0026rsquo;s Place Naga, which was the newer mall in the area, and quite a bit bigger than the SM. After that we visited the house of my dad\u0026rsquo;s childhood friend and spent the night there. I pretty much just turned it early due to being tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond day in Naga was more restful than anything else. Lunch time we visited the house of some of my folks\u0026rsquo; CFC friends. They served some beef salpicao (among other things I wasn\u0026rsquo;t inclined to eat) that turned out to be quite good but also quite spicy. That\u0026rsquo;s Bicol for you I guess. After we got back we checked in at the CBD Plaza Hotel opposite the bus terminal where we\u0026rsquo;d be leaving for Daet the next morning. The hotel room was a bit cramped, but it was fine for sleeping (and also had wifi so that\u0026rsquo;s good enough for me.) We rested up at the hotel for a bit before I decided to go around and walk the early evening streets for a bit. Dinner was at the SM City Naga food court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"daet\"\u003eDaet\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the morning we had the free non-buffet hotel breakfast, then checked out of the hotel and got on a bus for Daet. It was a mostly uneventful two-hour ride, though I did see an \u0026ldquo;IPOT FOR SALE\u0026rdquo; roadside sign that I wish I had taken a picture of. My aunt who lived in Daet met us at the terminal and brought us to the Canimog Hotel where we\u0026rsquo;d be staying for the night. The owners of the hotel were friends of the family, which is why my folks chose this place to stay at, but we were the only guests for some reason. Apparently the hotel had seen better days, there was a bit of a creepy vibe lol. But also there was fiber internet (Converge), so all good I guess? During all of my other prior trips to Daet, we had stayed at my grandmother\u0026rsquo;s old house, but that was sold off a few years ago, so now we have to stay in a hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#f6d6372950bc3c876ce7e9b94570d979-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/20191101_121422_hu97f2acfc4be18c45b4863959ebd9252a_1111851_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Canimog Hotel (Daet)\" title=\"Canimog Hotel (Daet)\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eCanimog Hotel (Daet) (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"f6d6372950bc3c876ce7e9b94570d979-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/20191101_121422.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eCanimog Hotel (Daet)\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"4 Nov 2019 12:00am\"\u003e4 Nov 2019 12:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter leaving our stuff at hotel, we immediately went out for lunch at a nearby place called KSarap (I had some yummy chicken cordon bleu), then headed straight for the cemetery afterwards, as it was already the first of November. My grandparents were buried at the Camarines Norte Chinese Cemetery, where each family had like a small mausoleum type thing to house their dead.  Ours housed my grandparents, and also an uncle and aunt who had also lived in Daet. We paid our respects by doing the Chinese thing with the incense sticks and the bowing and the putting them into the bowl. My mom and I left earlier because it was blistering hot and wanted to rest. My dad and aunt and cousin stayed behind to man the mausoleum and greet any visitors and such. Because of that small-town \u0026ldquo;everybody knows everybody else\u0026rdquo; thing, there\u0026rsquo;d often be random people who knew the family coming in to visit and pay respects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#f8677f1e7d4edc1e5e0133d90b5d22d7-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/20191101_135509_hu825b9b50ed4b0c6feeb601bea014e15a_1111036_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"My grandparents\u0026#39; mausoleum (Is that the proper term?)\" title=\"My grandparents\u0026#39; mausoleum (Is that the proper term?)\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eMy grandparents\u0026rsquo; mausoleum (Is that the proper term?)

(They don\u0026rsquo;t yet have a full-fledged SM mall in Daet, though I\u0026rsquo;m told one is underway.) Then rest and sleep at Canimog.

I\u0026rsquo;ve visited a few other beaches in my lifetime, but none with waves as strong as the ones on Bagasbas. It\u0026rsquo;s actually gotten famous as a surfing destination during the past couple of decades. A lot has changed on the beach and the boulevard, which now claims to be the \u003ca href=\"https://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/regions/05/13/15/how-long-philippines-longest-boulevard\"\u003elongest boulevard in the Philippines\u003c/a\u003e after they added some bridges to extend it to nearby municipalities.

I believe the house belonged to my dad\u0026rsquo;s aunt, which meant her siblings were my second cousins (?) is that how it works lol. Pretty big family too. Anyway, many of them remembered me from when I was little, but I had little recollection of them, though I tried to get along of course. I did enjoy their stories of Daet and how things have changed along the years, and there was more of that \u0026ldquo;everybody knows everybody else\u0026rdquo; feeling when they were talking about old neighbors or friends who had passed away, or what happened to old buildings or businesses in town, and so on. My dad also enjoyed the food quite a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"anticipated-mass-and-more-thoughts-on-daet\"\u003eAnticipated mass, and more thoughts on Daet\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter lunch we mostly rested up at the hotel and then went out for anticipated mass (it was Saturday the 2nd) in the early afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I had visited Daet many times during my childhood, I find that I don\u0026rsquo;t really have a good \u0026ldquo;mental model\u0026rdquo; of the town, unlike places that I\u0026rsquo;ve visited as an adult. When I was young, we were mostly limited to my grandmother\u0026rsquo;s old house, and the beach, and maybe went out a few times to some other places, but never really enough for me to grasp the size or layout of the town. The big difference now is that internet is ubiquitous, which means I have Google Maps as a reference. The Globe signal can be spotty in some places, but still generally workable. This is a huge contrast to my 2004 visit where I had to go to \u003ca href=\"/2004/10/posting-from-the-boondocks/\"\u003ean internet shop to do internet things\u003c/a\u003e. Even my aunt and cousin have fiber internet here. So now during this visit I at least know the major road names and have some idea of where places are relative to other places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything feels a bit more modern now too. In my last visit, I complained about having to flush the toilet manually with a bucket. Not only is that a thing of the past now, but all of the places we stayed at now had bidets! Ah, bidets, the symbol of modern living. In general, Naga and Daet feel like they could be suburbs of Metro Manila; there aren\u0026rsquo;t any tall skyscrapers like in Makati or Ortigas, but looking at the streets and the shops and so on, it would be hard to differentiate from some of the more far-flung residential QC areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also found it interesting whenever my dad would converse with other people in Bicolano. I don\u0026rsquo;t speak the dialect, but it\u0026rsquo;s close enough to Tagalog that I can often get the gist of what\u0026rsquo;s being discussed. (Closer than something like Cebuano at least.) It\u0026rsquo;s a weird feeling listening to a language that\u0026rsquo;s almost familiar but not. Maybe this is how Spanish people feel when hearing Catalan, or such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"going-home\"\u003eGoing Home\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the mass, we had a fast-food dinner at Greenwich, then went back to our hotel to checkout and then on to the bus terminal. We would be taking a DLTB \u0026ldquo;lazyboy\u0026rdquo; bus from Daet to Cubao, a trip estimated at around 8 hours. The DLTB bus had a bit more legroom than the Amihan bus, but the seats were a bit slippery and any attempt to sleep led to me slipping down into an uncomfortable position. So again, miserable bus trip with little sleep, as expected. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t get motion sickness again this time, so that\u0026rsquo;s something. The bus trip was fairly quick as well - we arrived an hour earlier than I expected. When we got off the bus, we took a grab home and I was glad to be back in my own bed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole trip was worthwhile, it\u0026rsquo;s always good to connect with your roots, no matter how distant they may have gotten. And stepping away from Metro Manila and all its problems was a welcome thing as well (though I did miss my desktop PC). Given my parents\u0026rsquo; age, there is a nontrivial chance that I never get to visit Bicol again; I certainly wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go by myself after all. So it was better to take this opportunity while it was there. Well, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll go again next year? We\u0026rsquo;ll see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore photos from the trip at the \u003ca href=\"/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/\"\u003ephoto dump\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
