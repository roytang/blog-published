            "title": "MTG Arena: Thoughts on Historic",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eMagic Arena\u0026rsquo;s community was in an uproar this past weekend over the latest \u003ca href=\"https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-beta-august-29-2019\"\u003estate of the beta\u003c/a\u003e, mostly over the announced plans for Arena\u0026rsquo;s eternal Historic format that will become relevant with the coming rotation. It\u0026rsquo;s likely that Wizards will backpedal in some way in response to the community, but here are my thoughts for now:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"historic-cards-to-cost-double-wildcards-to-craft\"\u003eHistoric cards to cost double wildcards to craft\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the universally-reviled bit and has been the target of much outrage, accursing Wizards of being greedy etc. On this point I am in agreement with the community that yes, this sucks. On the other hand, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned not to be outraged by ridiculous DLC/microstransaction pricing. If something is too unaffordable, I simply won\u0026rsquo;t indulge it. If I can\u0026rsquo;t afford to craft a historic deck, I won\u0026rsquo;t play the format, until I can. More on this later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWotC\u0026rsquo;s plans for Historic looks to me like they are trying to replicate the \u0026ldquo;scarcity\u0026rdquo; inherent to paper eternal formats like Modern and Legacy. Arena is actually a bit more generous that either MTGO or HS, since both of those don\u0026rsquo;t sell boosters from older sets in their stores. WotC still plans to have Historic sets available, though only in 45-pack bundles (I don\u0026rsquo;t care about this either, as I rarely purchase packs anyway, but some people also dislike this change). The 2-for-1 crafting cost is still uniquely Arena and thus their own bad decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, digital games have to have slightly different business models than IRL counterparts. Arena is unique in this regard since it\u0026rsquo;s the only modern digital CCG that has a strong paper analogue. Trying to replicate the scarcity of paper Magic may have made sense for MTGO, since that platform allows trading and thus cashing out, but for Arena it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost likely the goal is to ensure that Standard is the main gameplay mode especially for newer players, as Standard generall drives sales. But increasing the crafting cost is unnecessary. The barrier to entry for Historic will already be pretty high for a new player anyway, even if the crafting cost was 1-to-1, since a new player will have more sets to catch up with. There is no sensible reason for doing this, as it is only setting Historic up for failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"curated-cards-to-be-periodically-added-to-historic\"\u003eCurated cards to be periodically added to Historic\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this one, the community is more split. There are those like me who consider this a good idea, as long as they are conservative with the power level of the curated cards added to historic. My personal preference is that they release cards that were pretty good in standard during their time, but haven\u0026rsquo;t really found a good place in Modern, so that they have a chance to shine. Clouding the issue is a \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/MTG_Arena/status/1167184191215165440\"\u003erecent tweet by the official twitter\u003c/a\u003e where they suggest that examples of curated cards could be Brainstorm, Firebolt, Wurmcoil Engine, and Dark Confidant, all of which are at least Modern power level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose who dislike this change seem to be mainly because they don\u0026rsquo;t want Historic to be Modern or Legacy. I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest, I would love it if I could play Modern on Arena. But technically, it\u0026rsquo;s not likely that the historic format will ever be the same as Modern (or Legacy), unless WotC goes crazy. It\u0026rsquo;s highly unlikely that they would add the Tron lands or Storm cards or Dredge cards into Historic for example. It would take a lot of cards for historic to even come close to Modern. But I understand the concern \u0026ndash; there are a lot of broken cards in Modern and Legacy, and WotC is made up of humans, so there is a nontrivial risk that they will screw up and add something ridiculous into Historic, breaking the format. The Brainstorm inclusion in the tweet linked above certainly doesn\u0026rsquo;t help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand the appeal of having an eternal format that is Arena sets only, moving forward. Some also want the previous Arena-implemented sets (Shadows over Innistrad, Kaladesh, and Amonkhet) to be included as well. Some prefer that Arena start adding sets one by one working backwards and stopping at Magic Origins. In general, these are all in the same vein. The idea generally is that more recent sets are more \u0026ldquo;balanced\u0026rdquo; in terms of power level, especially since Play Design is now a thing, thus the format will probably be healthier in generally than Modern which is a turn 4 format.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s also a secondary concern that adding curated cards so often (the initial plan is quarterly) will shake up the metagame more often and make Historic even more expensive as a format to get into, as you need to be getting new cards every so often. The assumption is that the curated cards will be high power level staples which would be necessary to participate in the format. Again, such concern could be mitigated by careful curation. If the curation is done well, each batch of new cards could introduce new strategies and make small changes to the metagame without necessarily invalidating entire decks. And again, there is a nontrivial risk of screw-ups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo assuage these concerns in general, what I would do if were WotC would be to introduce two eternal formats instead. One is just Arena eternal - all Arena sets (maybe including Amonkhet, but people don\u0026rsquo;t seem to like Kaladesh very much \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=417766\"\u003efor some reason\u003c/a\u003e), and a second one which is basically just what they\u0026rsquo;re already planning for Historic. More options is always better (although it might \u0026ldquo;confuse the new players\u0026rdquo;, whatever that means).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"managing-your-own-expectations\"\u003eManaging your own expectations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCircling back to my point earlier. If Historic is too cost prohibitive, I won\u0026rsquo;t play it, until I can. In many ways, it\u0026rsquo;s a case of managing your own expectations for an online game. I like playing Magic, and Arena lets me do that at a manageable cost (i.e. free and conveniently). The addition of the Historic format doesn\u0026rsquo;t change that. I can still play Standard regardless of whether I can afford Historic or not. Until this state of the beta, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t even thinking about what happens to my cards that are rotating out, whether I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to use them again or not. For most of those cards, I drafted them, I played with them, I used them with standard decks and I generally enjoyed my time playing Arena (Nexus of Fate notwithstanding). It helps that I am a f2p player, as all I invested was my time, and since I enjoyed my time, it was not wasted time for me no matter what happens to those cards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess it\u0026rsquo;s a different matter if you\u0026rsquo;ve been paying for the cards? IDK, I have a friend who\u0026rsquo;s bought at least a bundle every time a new set comes in, I haven\u0026rsquo;t heard any complaints from him. If you\u0026rsquo;ve invested more into this game, I get that it\u0026rsquo;s a feel bad if you can\u0026rsquo;t make the most of the game by participating in all the available modes because of cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a bit like Wild in Hearthstone. I played Hearthstone for a while before rotation became a thing, so I had a lot of cards that are now only playable in Wild. I don\u0026rsquo;t really play HS anymore, but in the short time when I was active and Wild was available, I probably played only a handful of games. And I never disenchanted all those cards, even if I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to play them much. I don\u0026rsquo;t care that they\u0026rsquo;re just sitting there not doing anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"in-conclusion\"\u003eIn conclusion\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to how WotC responds to the outrage.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Magic Arena\u0026rsquo;s community was in an uproar this past weekend over the latest state of the beta, mostly over the announced plans for Arena\u0026rsquo;s eternal Historic format that will become relevant with the coming rotation. It\u0026rsquo;s likely that Wizards will backpedal in some way in response to the community, but here are my thoughts for now:\nHistoric cards to cost double wildcards to craft This is the universally-reviled bit and has been the target of much outrage, accursing Wizards of being greedy etc.",

We saw \u003cstrong\u003eOne Cut of the Dead\u003c/strong\u003e a comedy zombie film. It was great and it was hilarious, although you must make sure not to lose patience with the first thirty minutes. I went in blind not knowing anything about it other than \u0026ldquo;Japanese comedy zombie movie\u0026rdquo;, so you should too! Easily one of the funniest movies I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in recent years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"young-justice\"\u003eYoung Justice\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack half of Young Justice Outsiders finished this week. I\u0026rsquo;ve honestly been a bit whelmed for this half of the season as I feel like they\u0026rsquo;re all over the place and there\u0026rsquo;s too many plot threads going on at once. Still an enjoyable watch especially for DC fans of course. The thing about having such a large cast is that it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to focus on any one of them too long, but this season was all about Halo, Geoforce and Cyborg so the arc endings pretty much revolved around those three. It feels like so many status quo changes happened in the last episode though, felt a bit crammed. Also, some spoilers:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails class=\"spoiler\"\u003e\n    \u003csummary\u003e(Spoilers)\u003c/summary\u003e\n    \u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI feel like the Light declaring at the end that their gains were sufficient vs Luthor\u0026rsquo;s original plans seemed ridiculous (i.e. controlling Markovia vs controlling and registering all superhumans). They already had one puppet nation under their control (Queen Bee is right there!) and they\u0026rsquo;re literally planning to go against Darkseid, how does controlling Markovia help? Feels like a very post-facto justification.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI did like that they chose not to complete their Judas Contract re-telling in a similar manner and we get a \u0026ldquo;redeemed\u0026rdquo; Tara to contrast with the \u0026ldquo;fallen\u0026rdquo; Geoforce\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cp /\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"fleabag\"\u003eFleabag\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t know anything about this Amazon Prime series going in either, only that it was a comedy and it was well-reviewed. I did enjoy watching it, although it\u0026rsquo;s more of a tragic comedy than anything else. Basically about how people deal with absurdly difficult situations in their daily life. The story is well-told, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I get all the hype.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-boys\"\u003eThe Boys\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother Amazon Prime series. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t read the source material, and I was a bit turned off by the first episode, but I powered through. I knew it would be dark going in, and possibly gratuitous in terms of the sex and violence at some points, so not many surprises there. The plot seems in my head to be \u0026ldquo;What if superheroes were driven by a greedy corporation\u0026rdquo;, which certainly doesn\u0026rsquo;t help address my \u003ca href=\"/2018/10/capitalism/\"\u003emisgivings about capitalism\u003c/a\u003e. The plot also reminds me of Sanderson\u0026rsquo;s book Reckoners, which was also a story about a resistance trying to oppose a superhuman regime led by a Superman-like figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking over the Wikipedia entry for the comic book series, it seems the TV show had some significant divergences, which is understandable, so I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ll be seeking out the comic books. The series was enjoyable enough to binge over a few days, although some parts are a bit predictable. I did like the treatment given to Hugh and Annie/Starlight. The cast is pretty good too, I almost didn\u0026rsquo;t recognize Simon Pegg (because it was such a serious role) and Elisabeth Shue (because\u0026hellip;I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen her in anything in a while?). Oh and Gus Fring is also here!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I ended up enjoying the season overall, as it tackles a lot of issues I relate with. I will probably be watching Season 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"rockos-modern-life-static-cling\"\u003eRocko\u0026rsquo;s Modern Life: Static Cling\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNetflix tried to bring Rocko into the modern era, although strangely none of the characters have aged at all. Although they are cartoon characters so I guess that makes sense? The special is about as ridiculous as the old cartoon was, unsurprisingly, although it does try to convey a message about how change is an inevitable part of life. I did like that they had a reference to my favorite episode, R-E-C-Y-C-L-E Recycle~\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore next month! Maybe!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI brought up among one of my friend groups this Reddit thread where the poster says they were able to buy hundreds of dollars worth of \u003ca href=\"/tags/magic-the-gathering/\"\u003eMagic\u003c/a\u003e cards from a garage sale for around $70. (Not gonna link to the original thread because it might seem like I\u0026rsquo;m shaming the OP.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that there\u0026rsquo;s anything bad with such \u0026ldquo;garage sale finds\u0026rdquo;, as it were. These things are posted every so often on subreddits especially those dedicated to some sort of collectible. I mentioned that while I would be very excited to find something like this in the wild, I might have an attack of conscience because I\u0026rsquo;m potentially cheating someone out of fair market value and taking advantage of their ignorance. I\u0026rsquo;m probably more likely to feel this way if I was dealing with a seller personally (like at a garage sale), rather than some entity indirectly (like at a big store for example).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously, my ethical dilemma is only for the scenario where there is an information imbalance - where I as the buyer have information about the product\u0026rsquo;s fair market value that the seller is not aware of. If the seller knew full well the actual value of what he\u0026rsquo;s selling and he still sells at that price, then I will gladly buy it cheap with no concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"this-is-why-im-not-a-salesman\"\u003eThis is why I\u0026rsquo;m not a salesman\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn such a case, the way to assuage my ethical concerns would be to bring up the possible imbalance. Something along the lines of \u0026ldquo;I think you\u0026rsquo;re selling this for much less than what it\u0026rsquo;s worth!\u0026rdquo;, and if he nods and still wants to sell at that price anyway, then both of you complete the transaction happily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriend O commented:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think people have a kind of \u0026ldquo;code of ethics\u0026rdquo; that applies to marketplaces\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat\u0026rsquo;s a bit different from everyday ethics\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust like how doctors/lawyers/priests have a code of ethics specific to their contexts\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe idea is that participants in the marketplace should assume that everyone else is doing their due dilligence when it comes to price/quality research\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I guess I can satisfy my concerns as well by telling myself that \u0026ldquo;Caveat Emptor\u0026rdquo; applies in the opposite direction as well, so \u0026ldquo;Caveat Venditor\u0026rdquo;?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"hold-yourself-to-a-higher-standard\"\u003eHold yourself to a higher standard\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am only presenting an ethical dilemma here as it applies to myself when I am the buyer in the above scenario, or otherwise the one with information advantage in the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have been on the receiving end of bad trades before of course, numerous times. Such often happens when I foolishly decide to participate in a transaction without doing the necessary research, so I guess Caveat Venditor is accurate. I don\u0026rsquo;t lay blame on the other party for taking advantage of my ignorance either; after a bad trade I will most likely blame myself. Therefore, I don\u0026rsquo;t expect other people I am transacting with to treat me as fairly as I want to treat other people should I have the advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriend J pointed out that holding myself to a higher standard like this can be considered a bit elitist since it\u0026rsquo;s like considering yourself \u0026ldquo;better\u0026rdquo; than others. I think of it more like managing expectations of other people. Other people don\u0026rsquo;t have the same life experiences and values as I do, so some things are more important for me than for them. I would of course love it if everyone was conditioned to treat everyone else fairly in this manner - society would be much the better for it, but I understand the reality of human wants and needs enough to know that\u0026rsquo;s a pipe dream at best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"all-in-theory\"\u003eAll in theory\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, all of this is untested, because I haven\u0026rsquo;t been lucky enough to find a deal like I originally described. Maybe when I\u0026rsquo;m there at that point in time all my ethical questions give way to impulse or greed and I\u0026rsquo;m already at home gleefully counting my winnings before the dilemma comes to mind. But I like to think thought experiments like these help to flesh out one\u0026rsquo;s thought processes so that when the time comes, one is more likely to behave appropriately.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Other people can see and bear witness to your life, but they only see a sliver, a fraction of what it is to be you, and only what you choose to let them see. How other people experience you varies for each group. You have your set of high school friends, who know of your early days of hijinks, your work friends who know how you react to stress and how you unwind, your relatives who know how you are during the holidays in the face of family turmoil, and so on. None of them know the real you, not completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"true-heart\"\u003eTrue Heart\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can\u0026rsquo;t be helped that the \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; version of each person is known only to that person alone. No one else lives the same life exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsider myself. I write a lot about what\u0026rsquo;s going on in my life, whether through social media or through this blog. I strive to be open and honest and true in my dealings with other people, and I am almost always willing to offer up my thoughts without filter, if asked. But despite that, the picture I present to the world is still always incomplete. There are things I omit and things I hold back and things I don\u0026rsquo;t like to talk about. It\u0026rsquo;s something I have since learned to respect in other people as well, despite my inquisitive nature: to hold back when they obviously don\u0026rsquo;t want to talk about something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Don\u0026rsquo;t worry I haven\u0026rsquo;t secretly committed any heinous crimes.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"public-facing\"\u003ePublic-facing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was reminded of this quote only because I was reading some discussion about private content on the internet. In general, if I post something on the internet, I don\u0026rsquo;t expect it to be private, not completely. Otherwise, why post it on the internet at all? Anything on the internet has the chance to be exposed later, one way or another, and we should be careful accordingly. And \u0026ldquo;on the internet\u0026rdquo; here isn\u0026rsquo;t even limited to websites and blogs and social media. \u0026ldquo;Private\u0026rdquo; communications are a weak point too, as anyone can capture a screenshot anytime. If you want to keep secrets, then don\u0026rsquo;t put them on a network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree can keep a secret if two of them are dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"black-mirror\"\u003eBlack Mirror\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a Black Mirror episode where the personality of a human who passed away is recreated based on his social media postings and what not. Because of the nature of humans, I don\u0026rsquo;t believe this process can ever be 100% accurate. What you will get is a shadow of the original human, an approximation of who he chose to present himself as. His true self will have been forever lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

This might be the death knell for Mercurial, although Git was already the super popular choice before. Back when I started using online source control for my personal coding projects I started out with Bitbucket over Github because they offered unlimited private repos and Mercurial (which I had already tried out before at work, so at first I preferred it over git). Now that Gitlab and Github both offer unlimited private repos, there\u0026rsquo;s no reason to stick with Bitbucket either. I had already migrated most of my private Git repos to Gitlab before, but hadn\u0026rsquo;t realized until now that I also had a couple of Mercurial repos there that needed to be migrated as well. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t touched those repos in so long that I didn\u0026rsquo;t even have Mercurial installed locally anymore! (Although I\u0026rsquo;m still using the code locally!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, converting a mercurial repo to git turned out to be straightforward thanks to a project called \u003ca href=\"https://repo.or.cz/fast-export.git\"\u003efast-export\u003c/a\u003e.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI might be lending out my PS4 next month when the latest annual release of a sports franchise rolls around, so I figured I\u0026rsquo;d finish off a PS4 game before the console vanishes on me for a few months. \u003cem\u003eWhat Remains of Edith Finch\u003c/em\u003e came out on PS+ a couple of months ago and people are always raving about how good it is and how it\u0026rsquo;s relatively short, so I decided to give it a go. I went in blind, not knowing anything, since mysteriously no one on Reddit could explain what makes the game good. This is understandably so as any sort of information kind of spoils the story for you. As such, consider yourself warned that this review might be considered spoiler-y. Overall if you like story-based games, just go ahead and play this one, then come back here to read the review if you\u0026rsquo;d like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"1-narratives\"\u003e1 Narratives\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat Remains of Edith Finch\u003c/em\u003e is a first-person exploration game. The gameplay is largely focused around the story and advancing the narrative. The story revolves around the Finch family and their so-called \u0026ldquo;curse\u0026rdquo; which causes many of the family members to die of unusual causes. You spend the game exploring the now-abandoned Finch family house where five generations of Finches have lived since coming to America. As you explore the house you come across shrines for each deceased Finch family member, and each one takes you into a different scenario narrating their individual stories. Each family member\u0026rsquo;s story is told in a different manner: there\u0026rsquo;s one told as if it were a comic book, one told from the point of view of a baby in a bathtub, several are seen through the lens of a child\u0026rsquo;s imagination, and so on. The presentation of the substories and the main story exploring the house is very clever, with the actual text of the narratives often appearing throughout the environment, guiding you where to go next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"2-gameplay\"\u003e2 Gameplay\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGameplay is primarily based on exploration and experimentation. In the main story you explore the house and unlock secret passages and crawl through tunnels and climb to the roof and so on. There are no failure states in the gameplay, you simply keep pushing forward. If you get stuck, you walk around until you figure out a way to advance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe individual substories are the same way, although many of them adjust the control schemes and expect you to experiment accordingly. As an example, in one of the substories you get to fly around as an owl, then later crawl around a cruise ship as some kind of tentacle monster. In another, you\u0026rsquo;re a baby in a bathtub imagining your toys coming to life. In yet another, you\u0026rsquo;re an assembly-line worker in a cannery dreaming of a fantasy world, and you must explore your fantasy world and slice off fishheads at the cannery at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe substories take place in their own little sandboxes, so to speak, and many of them seem like tech demos of cool things a developer would want to try like \u0026ldquo;Ooh, let\u0026rsquo;s make the player a shark on land and he has to fall into the ocean!\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s make a scenario where the player is just flying a kite!\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s not a proble, and it does create some interesting ways of presenting the narratives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this happens from the first person view, which was a bit problematic at times. Since I\u0026rsquo;m getting along with age, I\u0026rsquo;m not as good with first person gaming as I used to be, and playing with this view for an extended period of time can give me some dizziness. Luckily, the game was quite short, and I managed to finish it in two sittings. (Maybe 1.5 hours total)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"3-achievements\"\u003e3 Achievements?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI usually try to go for achievement completion before posting a review, especially for story-based games like this. But this time I didn\u0026rsquo;t bother. Most of the achievements are silly things that you can do during the exploration gameplay, like knocking all of the balls off a pool table. Most can be acquired after completing the game the first time, since that unlocks the ability to replay individual substories. But there was one achievement that required looking through every peephole/telescope in the game, and that seemed like I couldn\u0026rsquo;t do it without replaying everything from the beginning. That didn\u0026rsquo;t appeal to me because (a) I might get dizzy again; and (b) this is the sort of game where it\u0026rsquo;s best experienced the first time around, and successive playthroughs won\u0026rsquo;t be of much value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"4-overall\"\u003e4 Overall\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026hellip;I liked it, though not as much as say, Life is Strange. The exploration of the house is great and the all of the scenes and sandboxes are well set up and very detailed, although the overarching Finch family story is a thinly-veiled framing device to bring together the individual substories. The game is well worth the 1-2 hours to go through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
