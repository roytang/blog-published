I played with my friend Paul, and we had a rather good sealed pool, coming up with a pair of decks that had the basic strategy of \u0026ldquo;Do not block!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, we were only able to go 5-2, ending up as the team in 10th place. Well, it\u0026rsquo;s not like we would\u0026rsquo;ve been able to go to San Diego, but still the 750USD would have been nice. We lost one game to mana flood, and the other loss was one where we were winning \u0026ndash; at least until the opposing team decided to take 3 turns in a row via Walk the Aeons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe could\u0026rsquo;ve won that last one though, but we made a few mistakes such as not being aggressive enough, i.e. deciding to block. The thing about Magic tournaments, you pretty much need to have at most one loss in order to hit top 8, and you can assume you\u0026rsquo;re gonna get at least one loss due to mana screw; so there\u0026rsquo;s really no room for error or bad plays. You must make the best play at every possible time. It\u0026rsquo;s a demanding game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new 2HG format is a lot more fun though, with the thiry life leading everyone to choose aggro strategies. And since you only get one game per round, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more pressure involved, and it\u0026rsquo;s not uncommon for decisive plays to take 5 or more minutes to decide. Fun, but mentally exhausting.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis deck is named \u0026ldquo;Under Development\u0026rdquo; because I basically threw it together two days ago with almost no playtesting. Basically, today\u0026rsquo;s tournament was my playtesting, as I could use it to gauge whether I like the feel of the deck and I should continue using it. Also, it\u0026rsquo;s my first team playing with basic islands again in constructed since forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, as the title implies, I am teh suck. Bad plays cost me at least two matches, leading me to a terrible 1-3 finish (and the one win was a \u003cem\u003eBYE\u003c/em\u003e) My post-tournament analysis is that I am so not used to playing blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick match roundup:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1 vs Dragonstorm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally, really bad matchup. First game is practically auto-loss. Second game, I trickbind the first attempt to Storm, but the lone Hellkite is enough to stand in the way of my Solifuge, and he gets out a second one a few turns later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2 vs GW Scryb/Force\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame 1 goes fast as he mulligans down to 4. I win handily and bring in Electrolyze, Pyroclasm and Serrated Arrows for game 2. Game 2, he had like six small guys in play, I was down to 3 and had 6 mana open. My cards in hand are plaxmanta and remand. I play plaxmanta, in response, remand the plaxmanta, draw my card and show him the topdecked Pyroclasm. Too bad he folllows up with two Spectral Force over the next few turns. =/\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame 3 I lost due to a bad play on my part. My opponent was tapped out with like 5 creatures that are also tapped, and an untapped Mangara (with summoning sickness) On my side, I have a morphed Shapeshifter and morphed Brine Elemental, with Stomping Ground, Plaxmanta and Demonfire in hand. My opponent is at 18, I\u0026rsquo;m at 10. I have six lands in play, if I play the Stomping Ground and take the two life loss, I can lock him down with the Brine Elemental. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what I\u0026rsquo;m thinking however, I play the Stomping Ground tapped and Demonfire the Mangara for 1, then swing for 4.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe correct play should have been:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePlay stomping ground. lose 2 life (down to 8)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAttack with both morphs, Mangara does not block\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUnmorph Brine Elemental, opponent takes 7 and drops to 11\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOpponent\u0026rsquo;s turn: no untap phase, does nothing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMy turn: Swing with morph and Brine Elemental. Opponent attemps to take one down using Mangara. I play Plaxmanta to counter the ability. Unmorph shapeshifter and copy Brine Elemental. Opponent goes down to 6 or 1 depending opn whether Mangara blocked.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMy next turn: PS Demonfire you\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBah, I caved in to fear that time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3: A bye! I get to have a decent lunch! (At 2pm)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: Vs BW Discarder/Rack\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis guy somehow managed to draw 3 castigates in each game that he won. I won the second due to aggro, and we want to game 3. Game 3 was close, very close. During his turn, he was at 4, I was at 6, he had a Mindslicer and a Rack in play. I have no board and 2 cards in hands. He\u0026rsquo;s afraid of the Demonfire, so he plays Smallpox, saccing the Mindslicer, hoping to have us both in topdeck mode and me with no answer to the rack. I let Smallpox resolve, and respond to the Mindslicer trigger by playing Plaxmanta. Plaxmanta survives, and will swing on the next turn for 2; he\u0026rsquo;s at 3 and I\u0026rsquo;m at 5. However, it seems I have no answer to the Rack. My turn, untap, upkeep take 3 from Rack (down to 2), I draw a land and hold in my hand. I swing for 2 with the Plaxmanta, bringing him down to one. But it looks like I\u0026rsquo;m losing to the Rack. I pass the turn to see what happens. He draws an Extirpate and starts looking through my âyard, and I spot the bad play. I HAD A THINK TWICE!!! I could have avoided 2 points of Rack damage, enough for the Plaxmanta to seal the deal. Gah, I am teh suck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the well-deserved loss and drop from the tournament, quite tired. A really bad result for me after more than a month of cutting back on Magic tournaments, not a very good comeback. However, I think the playtesting session was a success, as I found quite a few weaknesses in the deck and also found that I like playing it, it\u0026rsquo;s quite fun. So, I will probably tweak this deck and continue to play it in Standard tournaments for the time being. I probably won\u0026rsquo;t play in Block Constructed until FS comes out, so is my deck for April.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the next part, I will pick apart the deck and see what I can improve. Stay tuned!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m sure a lot of people have experienced it, the feeling of being adrift, directionless. Just living your life day in and day out not knowing where you\u0026rsquo;re going or why. Maybe not everybody though, as I\u0026rsquo;ve met quite a few people who seem quite content with the monotony of their lives, doing the same thing day in and day out, never bothering to overcome the inertia of their daily lives. Lately, I\u0026rsquo;ve been afraid that I\u0026rsquo;ve already become one of those people. My current lifestyle, such as it is, has been quite satisfactory for quite a while, and I could comfortably live the rest of my life this way. I see no need to change directions or shift gears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLately, a friend of mine mentioned that he would probably move to another company soon. That got me thinking again about my own career plans, about whether I would even consider moving to another company. And the conclusion I came up with was \u0026ldquo;Where would I go?\u0026rdquo; Moving to a different company isn\u0026rsquo;t really a change of direction if it was still the same line of work. I\u0026rsquo;ve actually already mentioned it before to the people who give me my performance reviews: if I ever leave my job, it would probably be when I decide to go out and do something new. What kind of \u0026ldquo;something new\u0026rdquo;, they would inevitably ask. And my answer has been the same for a while: I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like to read all these lifehacks, self-help, etc. stuff hoping it would help me decide what I want to do with my life, but so far I haven\u0026rsquo;t found my answer yet. The default path is of course to just stay the course, keep working in the company (or at least in the industry), and move up the corporate ladder or something. But there\u0026rsquo;s always that yearning to break away and to do something for myself; something outrageous, wild, fantastic and / or that will cause people who know me to question why I would throw away a perfectly good, safe and stable career.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer is \u0026ldquo;Because I want to be a rogue.\u0026rdquo; I want to walk the road not taken. I want to blaze my own trail. I want to leave something behind and be remembered for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just wish I knew what the hell that something is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s not that I can\u0026rsquo;t think of something I\u0026rsquo;d want to do. There are actually a lot of things I want to do. But I don\u0026rsquo;t have time to explore the options and figure out which one is the best one, the one I\u0026rsquo;d enjoy the most and hence the one where I would most likely be successful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is it holding me back? One thing is my job of course. As a friend of my said, somehow I\u0026rsquo;ve already planted quite a bit of roots there. But I would be willing to risk leaving it behind, if only I was sure what I would be leaving it behind for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, that\u0026rsquo;s my resolution for this year, right? \u0026ldquo;To find direction.\u0026rdquo; So I have until the end of the year to try to find time to explore my options and find my direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I started to write this post I meant to end it with \u0026ldquo;And if I can\u0026rsquo;t pick a direction by year\u0026rsquo;s end, I\u0026rsquo;ll just choose one and GO!\u0026rdquo;. But truth be told, I want to stay with the company a bit longer, to watch it grow. And to be honest it\u0026rsquo;s really still a valid option to stay, as I genuinely enjoy the work and would probably like to stay at least a while longer to hone my skills in this industry. (And I like the people in the company too) The only real problem with the job is that I don\u0026rsquo;t have much time to pursue other avenues of interest. Therefore I allow myself the safety of deciding that my direction would be \u0026ldquo;Stay for a while and see what happens.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill I choose an ordinary life or a daring life of adventure? Or try to pursue both ends, working as a mild-mannered programmer by day, and writing my own destiny by night?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell\u0026hellip; this post didn\u0026rsquo;t end quite like I\u0026rsquo;d hoped. That happens sometimes\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Most of my gaming is done on the NDS these days, though I wish it had even more good games (When is Phantom Hourglass coming out anyway?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt work, there are two groups of gamers who bring portables, one is the NDS group, the other is the PSP group. Currently, there are more NDS gamers, but not by much. Everything is friendly, and every so often the NDS group ribs the PSP group about getting NDS because they\u0026rsquo;re so much better, and of course the ribbing goes both ways. I think the PSP is nice, but it\u0026rsquo;s still expensive (twice as much as NDS), and the games are more \u0026ldquo;eye-candy\u0026rdquo; type than I\u0026rsquo;d like. NDS games are fun and innovative, while the PSP games feel like they just want you to play PS2 games on a handheld, and I\u0026rsquo;m not terribly excited by PS2 games anymore. (Of course, the announcement of a Final Fantasy Tactics port for the PSP really makes me green with envy\u0026hellip; )\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, the feature that would make me want to get a PSP is that you can watch videos on a decently-sized widescreen handheld.

First game I only saw an Avalanche Rider and the 7/7 echo guy. Second game he put up more of a fight, and the \u0026ldquo;free echo\u0026rdquo; goblin helped him a lot. He get out the Goblin Advisor and went all aggro on me before I managed to stablize. Those exploding goblins can\u0026rsquo;t get past a Dream Stalker! Game record: 6-1, match record: 3-0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFourth round opponent\u0026hellip; well, it seems everybody but me plays red. First game I played out all the tricks my deck had with a Clockwork Hydra. Auramancer\u0026rsquo;s Guile + Hydra meant I could attack without losing +1/+1 counters. He bounces the Hydra, I play it again. He shoots the Hydra, I save it with a lion. He forces my Hydra into a bad block, I blink it out. He tries to Lightning Axe, I flashback the blink. This game was way fun on my end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond game goes long, but he later drops a Pyrohemia. Bomb enchantment! And I had no way to remove it. I tried to play around it, but his Paradise Plume eventually gave him enough life that he could just burn me out with the red Pestilence. I quickly gauge my options: ten minutes left in the round, but my deck is more aggro. I still have enough time to win game 3, so I concede and shuffle quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird game I draw a hand with five lands, a morph guy and the Serra Sphinx. The morph guy doubles as removal (gives +2/-2), so I figure this is good enough, as I don\u0026rsquo;t miss the 3rd-turn creature drop. Bad decision, as I draw into even more lands, and he\u0026rsquo;s more aggro than usual. The game goes long again, and eventually he surprises me with a Teferi I didn\u0026rsquo;t see the first two games. I sigh and realize I\u0026rsquo;m probably going to lose when he flashes the Sorceress Queen-timeshift at end of my turn. We go to time. And I try to stop him from killing me in three swings. Not enough blockers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal game record: 7-3, match record 3-1. I had good enough tie breakers to finish 4th in the pod, and I hoped I could still get a shirt for such a good performance. No such luck though. I take my 3 packs anyway, hoping I get good stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did. (1 Angel of Fury, 1 Groundbreaker, 1 Timbermare)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy flight finished at around 6PM. By this time I had gone with around 2 hours sleep in the past 14 hours, and the only food I had was two ensaymadas for a late breakfast before the flight started. Yeah, dead tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotes on specific cards:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat 3cc blue common morph guy, the one that gives +2/-2? He\u0026rsquo;s awesome. I\u0026rsquo;d pick him high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaltfield Recluse was a card I initially underrated and did not play main. However, I ended up bringing him in every time I could. That -2/-0 really screws the combat odds in your favor, and saves your guys from the occasional bad block or combat trick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of combat tricks: yeah, Brute Force is pretty good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitemane lion is essentially a combat trick with a free bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePongify is fun as expected. I loved it when my opponent attacked with a 7/7 he had just paid echo for, and I shake my head, show him the card and say: \u0026ldquo;Monkey?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, the set is awesome for sealed deck play, the block environment looks good. The design of the cards isn\u0026rsquo;t particular innovative since everything is either a throwback or a reprint, but the choice of cards and abilities to bring back\u0026hellip; everything is awesome. I\u0026rsquo;m definitely going to play the release tournament.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Played yesterday at Galleria. With a whole bunch of people: three from the Zu crowd and I think five or six from the office. Insane number of people, as expected. I got there about ten minutes after the mall opened (I came from work), and I was already preregistered, but I only got to sign up for the sixth flight (Flight F). They had to buy extra tables from a nearby Office Warehouse.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eSince I\u0026rsquo;m going back to work starting on Saturday, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d try to look for ways to improve my productivity at work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve downloaded a few utilities that I can try at work to see if it can improve my workflow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first one isÂ \u003ca href=\"http://www.bayden.com/SlickRun/\"\u003eSlickRun\u003c/a\u003e. Basically it\u0026rsquo;s a Start -\u0026gt; Run replacement \u0026ndash; press a predefined hotkey and a small command line tool appears where I can type shortcut-like commands. One of the features I liked while using Kubuntu was something similar \u0026ndash; I think it was called Katapult. It sorts of automates an old trick I was using before, where I would put shortcuts to commonly used programs in a predefined folder that exists on the path. I\u0026rsquo;ll see if this is better than that one, since this one requires less effort to set up the shortcuts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond is an egg-timer type app,Â \u003ca href=\"http://www.gonebowlin.com/freeware.html\"\u003eAleJenJes Countdown Timer\u003c/a\u003e \u0026ndash; I don\u0026rsquo;t know why it has such a weird name. But anyway, it\u0026rsquo;s just a simple Stop/Go timer I can use for timeboxing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast is a Window WP right-click menu addon,Â \u003ca href=\"http://www.lopesoft.com/en/index.html\"\u003eFileMenuTools\u003c/a\u003e. Some nice common tasks can be added to the context menu, some I do regularly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve also looked at some a few PIM programs, but my experience is that I\u0026rsquo;m not very good at this sort of thing\u0026hellip; the only one that\u0026rsquo;s stuck to me for a while wasÂ \u003ca href=\"http://shared.snapgrid.com/index.html\"\u003eGTDTiddlyWiki\u003c/a\u003e, and I don\u0026rsquo;t even use that regularly anymore. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking I should find some way to integrate task management into my workflow. Maybe I could write the program myself, the requirements are simple:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI want to be able to specify tasks that I want to be reminded of. As an initial example, maybe I could schedule daily, weekly or monthly tasks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAt the start of each day, or when I boot up my computer (configurable), the program would dump all tasks for that day in the middle of my workflow.\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAt the office, it could send me an email.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAt home, I could add a local web page to my Firefox tabs.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s basically it. I can add more features or bells and whistles later. I could probably put together a quick scripts + text files solution, similar to the\u003ca href=\"http://lifehacker.com/software/todo.txt/\"\u003etodo.txt series at lifehacker\u003c/a\u003e \u0026ndash; in fact, I\u0026rsquo;ll go read that first for ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to write more about my time in Hong Kong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the many new things I experienced there was the food. People who\u0026rsquo;ve eaten out with me on a regular basis know that I\u0026rsquo;m quite the picky eater. In general, I dislike eating veggies and seafood (yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m an unhealthy carnivore). In Hong Kong, you cannot avoid vegetables and seafood; every meal comes with some form of green stuff or shrimp or whatnot. I\u0026rsquo;m almost always eating out with the HK colleagues, and since I\u0026rsquo;m a guest in their country, they\u0026rsquo;ll always invite me to taste everything. I\u0026rsquo;ve probably eaten more seafood in those three weeks than I have for the previous years of my life. I\u0026rsquo;m probably exaggerating, but there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance of me being correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince most of my days were spent in the Wan Chai area, we often had lunch and dinner at the restaurants there. Anyone who\u0026rsquo;s been to Hong Kong will probably know about Wan Chai: the area is full of bars and nightclubs and such. It seems that the area is frequented by foreigners. In the evening, many of the clubs have some pretty young women outside enticing passing Caucasian guys to have a drink or two. Of course, I didn\u0026rsquo;t go into the bars or nightclubs because that\u0026rsquo;s not the sort of thing I do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLunch was the expensive meal of the day, since we usually had to pay for it ourselves (as opposed to dinner which was company-reimbursed). The HK guys would usually decide where we would all have lunch and we just go along with them. Most meals cost around 40 HK$ \u0026ndash; more than 2.5 times I normally spend for lunch back home. But these meals are usually larger servings and good quality stuff, not fastfood-level or carinderia-type junk. We get soup, plus drinks (I usually order Lemon Iced Tea or Milk Tea) then the meal itself. Usuallyyou have some meat or fish, plus veggies on the side, and you can choose your viand from rice, spaghetti, mashed potato, etc. Many restaurants allow you to choose from a list of set meals, so sometimes I joke that I can just choose randomly, \u0026ldquo;Today I\u0026rsquo;ll have meal B\u0026rdquo; and just order it without asking what it is. But of course I\u0026rsquo;m a picky eater, so I don\u0026rsquo;t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince dinner is company-sponsored, it seems the HK guys always choose cheaper places for dinner. We ate once at a McDonald\u0026rsquo;s and once at a Yoshinoya. And several times at this small chinese place that had a TV. I kept trying to follow the plot of the TV show aired during dinner but the inability to understand Chinese makes it hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, of course being unable to speak Chinese makes almost everything hard \u0026ndash; I need to ask for help whenever I\u0026rsquo;m ordering, etc. I also started out quite bad with chopsticks. Despite my years of honing hand-eye coordination using the game controller, my dexterity is terrible, and that leads to being really bad with chopsticks. On my first Sunday there, I had to eat lunch alone at a cafe. I ordered some pork with noodles in soup (I like noodles), but I had trouble eating since I\u0026rsquo;m not used to eating noodles with chopsticks. I tried to ask the counter lady for a fork, but she and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand each other. I wonder if the other cafe patrons noticed me eating the noodles in a terrible manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was wondering if my time in Hong Kong would change my eating habits when I got back home, making me less picky in what I eat. Turns out, not by much.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Hit // Run provide additional damage in addition to removal. Main deck cryoclasm is good, as 5 out of 7 opponents had the requisite islands or plains to be targetted. Spike Feeder keeps me alive against Boros/Dragonstorm. People are usually surprised when I play the Strangling Soots in games 2 or 3, but the Soots do something unbelievably good against aggro decks: they trade evenly with Call of the Herd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1: 0-2 vs Mono-green aggro\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUgh. Not a good way to start the day. Multiple weenies, some sporting cloaks or armor, definitely a weakness of my build. I drew mostly lands too. This matchup is probably around 40-60 in their favor, as I need to draw into 2 strangling soots to win, or bring out a Fortune Thief (backed by a Spike Feeder) to stay alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2: 2-1 vs Dragonstorm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt that I had a good game one against Dragonstorm, but I made a misplay where I didn\u0026rsquo;t play the second spike feeder that would\u0026rsquo;ve kept me alive. Even with four dragons out, as long as I survive, there\u0026rsquo;s a chance to win because of Hit // Run. Game two I managed to resolve a Persecute for red, bringing his hand to one mountain. Game three, he didn\u0026rsquo;t draw the storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3: 2-0 vs Rakdos\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucked out here. First game, opponent had mana troubles, only three lands came out, and one got taken by an Acid-Moss. Second game, I was able to deny him of black sources\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethroughout the game, and a Solifuge wrapped him up real nice while Strangling Soot cleared the blockers. Thing about land destruction, it really punishes bad draws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: 2-1 vs WGr Aggro\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis deck was mostly Elephants (Call of the Herd / Hierarch) and random small critters, plus Disintegrate as a finisher. First game, I got him with the second turn ryoclasm + Acid-Moss on the Selesnya karoo. Game two, I sided out all the LD, and brought in the Soots and the Grips, expecting Sacred Ground, Worship, and/or Glare. He drew three Call of the Herd and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop the stampede, I took damage down to 5 and he showed me the Disintegrate. Game three was a race, but I had a Solifuge and an early forestwalker, and the Demonfire in my hand for the win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5: 1-2 vs UR Tron\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was playing in a bad mental state here, holding back on my spells for fear of permission. A friend who was watching rightfully told me that keeping my spells in hand doesn\u0026rsquo;t reduce the number of counters he had. I should\u0026rsquo;ve been playing threats one after another until I could resolve a Hit for massive damage. In the second game, my weakness to Pyroclasm becomes the end of me as it kills half my mana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6: 2-1 vs Triskitron\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew what to do this time. His hand runs out of counters and he desperately throws Demonfire for 16 at me. I stay alive and respond with Demonfire for 9, winning the round. Mental note: When they play the Compulsive Research early, they have a bad hand and are looking for permission! Based on experience during the Gold Rush tournament, I usually side out the Cryoclasms against âTron \u0026ndash; they usually have only 4-8 viable targets, and I\u0026rsquo;d much rather have a Persecute or Krosan Grip available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 7: 2-1 vs Simic-Tron\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like the matchup against SimicTron better, as they have Breeding Pools that the Dryads can walk through. The dryads take him down in game one despite the presence of a Sky Swallower. Game two, I\u0026rsquo;m confident of winning; I have the hellbent Demonfire in hand and he\u0026rsquo;s within reach. But I fear the Commandeer, so I point the Demonfire at a nearby Hellkite instead. Completely illogical, I lost game two because of that. I was thinking I would wait for a Persecute to clear the hand before going for the Demonfire. Game three, he was able to handle all my threats except for an early Elf and Dryad, which took him down to 1 life before he was forced to Wildfire to clear the board. PS Demonfire for one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, a pretty good performance for a \u0026ldquo;Rogue\u0026rdquo; decklist, 5-2, although I had seriously bad tiebreakers so I finished in 17th place, last among the 5-2\u0026rsquo;s. And I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to test my mettle against Boros. And seriously, the metagame here\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s like 50% of people are playing some X-tron deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne more Standard tournament next week before Planar Chaos!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Unfortunately, that one thing I cannot do is something that I do a lot: gaming. Unfortunately, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure gamers drive a huge portion of the desktop market. I boldly predict that desktop Linux will not be able to be a serious challenge to Windows until it can provide some sort of alternative gaming platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was thinking about using Kubuntu continuously for about a week, just to see how it would be, and also to see if it\u0026rsquo;s as stable as they make it out to be. Unfortunately, for some reason booting into Kubuntu now deprives me of internet. I\u0026rsquo;d fix it, but somehow it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem worth the trouble. So, as of now, I\u0026rsquo;m quitting using Linux indefinitely. (I\u0026rsquo;ll miss the bash shell though.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",
