They\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be on a road trip to get Noctis married, but things happen along the way and eventually they have to figure out how to liberate their homeland from The Evil Empire. That\u0026rsquo;s the backstory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story as presented in the game has a few problems. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of significant back story and goings-on that happen off-camera:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s both a feature-length movie (Kingsglaive) and a six-episode anime (Brotherhood) that expounds on the four main characters\u0026rsquo; backgrounds and how the current political situation got to where it is\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s supposedly a whole effort by minor characters like Cor to organize a resistance against the Empire, but we\u0026rsquo;re never really exposed to it\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThen there\u0026rsquo;s Lunafreya, Noctis\u0026rsquo; betrothed, who goes off and does her own stuff to try to undermine the Empire and supposedly help Noctis, but for most of the game it\u0026rsquo;s never really explained what exactly she\u0026rsquo;s doing or how it\u0026rsquo;s relevant\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOne of your friends, Gladio, goes off on a short sidequest of his own and vanishes for a while, and it\u0026rsquo;s never explained WTH that was about. Presumably it will be covered in a future DLC.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother problem is that Noctis and the gang spend most of the game sort of lollygagging around enjoying their road trip without much sense of urgency. Understandably they wanted to present an open world this time (since much of the criticism of FFXIII was for its linearity), but the problem is that the open world is filled with a lot of frivolous things that don\u0026rsquo;t seem particularly urgent given the fate of the world being at stake. I mean, the party spends a lot of time camping out, cooking food, fishing, taking pictures, driving around looking for auto parts, and so on. The sense of urgency is not apparent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suppose the lack of urgency is an acceptable trade-off for the open world, but even for the supposed main story quests in the earlier chapters, it\u0026rsquo;s not immediately clear how they serve to help you overcome the Empire. I feel like there should have been more story quests related to helping establish a resistance and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe later chapters narrow down the open world significantly, and the second half of the game takes place outside the main continent where there is significantly less freedom to explore. It feels a bit like they spent a lot of their design budget on the open world half and so just restricted the second half to the meaty story parts. Reminds me a bit of Xenogears disc 2!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the chapters near the end was also executed very poorly. To establish a sense of tension, most of the systems you had been relying on throughout the game are taken away from you. While this would have been okay for a short segment, the chapter goes on a bit too long and ends up being far too tedious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did find myself surprised by events leading up to the final chapter, although I felt like it was another wasted opportunity. The final chapter gives us a glimpse at a different version of the open world but never really let us see most of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ending itself was bittersweet (and easily trolled haha), but I found it an acceptable ending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharacters\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#789f63e586a9f7d449e790cce4b79cef-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2017/03/review-final-fantasy-xv/RTcRL3u_hu255f50146e4af4e11739e93a6fe4223b_226845_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"789f63e586a9f7d449e790cce4b79cef-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2017/03/review-final-fantasy-xv/RTcRL3u.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"18 Mar 2017 1:30am\"\u003e18 Mar 2017 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I found the main cast of Noctis, Ignis, Gladio and Prompto to have engaging personalities, they don\u0026rsquo;t really have much backstory in-game (most of the character backstories are in Brotherhood). In fact, later on, a startling revelation is made about one of them and none of them really bat an eye at all. It was in the sense of \u0026ldquo;hey, we don\u0026rsquo;t care about that, we\u0026rsquo;re your friends,\u0026rdquo; but it still felt like something that should have been explored further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interaction among the group is great though. They regularly banter and tease each other even during combat. It really felt like they were a group of long-time friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**Combat **\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m an old-school FF fan, so I\u0026rsquo;ll be the first to admit I miss ye olde active time battle. FFXV\u0026rsquo;s battles take place entirely in real-time, with the player controlling Noctis and the other characters controlled by AI. The AI control goes about as well as you could expect, they do fine against weak enemies but against tougher battles you find yourself constantly having to help them with potions or other items. You can command them to do special attacks when available, and they will participate in combo attacks when possible, but for the most part it\u0026rsquo;s just Noctis warping and striking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#d82d2b78eee302311886bbe6f8f6f938-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2017/03/review-final-fantasy-xv/iEmsTOE_hu255f50146e4af4e11739e93a6fe4223b_259480_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"d82d2b78eee302311886bbe6f8f6f938-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2017/03/review-final-fantasy-xv/iEmsTOE.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"18 Mar 2017 1:30am\"\u003e18 Mar 2017 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCombat is fluid and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of movement and jumping around and looking for opportunities to strike from behind. Early on you are discouraged from wandering around at night as the enemies might be too high level, but the combat system is set up such that most tough battles can be overcome simply by having enough recovery items around. I only got a game over once, early in the game when didn\u0026rsquo;t know what I was doing and I tried wandering at night and promptly got squashed by an iron giant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Open World\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe open world gives the party a lot to do. There\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;hunts\u0026rdquo; dished out by people in diners (basically quests to go kill a specific bunch of monsters) and other side quests given out by various characters. There\u0026rsquo;s a fishing minigame, because apparently it\u0026rsquo;s a hobby of Noctis. The fishing minigame is okay, except I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the patience to try to get the most difficult fish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there\u0026rsquo;s the photos and the food porn. A lot of pandering to the modern-day youths here, I\u0026rsquo;m surprised instagram hasn\u0026rsquo;t been invented in their world. Cooking is Ignis\u0026rsquo; specialty, and the game renders each dish really well, sometimes enough to make you hungry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the photos are the specialty of Prompto. It\u0026rsquo;s one of those things that feels really frivolous in the game. Every time you camp you can browse pictures that Prompto has taken so you can save them for later viewing. A later patch provided a photo mode that you can control directly. There\u0026rsquo;s an entire reddit thread about how players have snapped more pics for this game than for their own vacations!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I\u0026rsquo;m no exception. Exporting a lot of photos is a pain though, as there is no batch export option in-game. Attached to this post are a sampling of the photos I got (a bunch of them are from achievements).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAchievements\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of achievements, I was a touch disappointed with FFXV\u0026rsquo;s achievement set. I got the Platinum trophy, but I felt like it was a bit too easy, as there was still a lot of things to do in the game outside of the achievements. I don\u0026rsquo;t want annoying grindy achievements, but I don\u0026rsquo;t want them to be too easy and \u0026ldquo;no challenge\u0026rdquo; either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther stuff\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had this weird Chocobo carnival DLC that somehow takes place in another timeline or something LOL.

Callouts range from Prompto humming the classic victory fanfare after the battle to 2d sprites in the store menus jumping up in down to indicate which characters can equip each item. Classic FF beasties like the Malboro still make an appearance (and are still a pain to fight!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weirdest thing overall has to be the Cup Noodles thing! They had some sort of tie-up with Nissin and Cup Noodles is one of the meals your party can have in the game and Gladio is obsessed with them. Later on you even get a quest to try to find a way to improve on Cup Noodles and it ends with the characters saying there\u0026rsquo;s really no beating the original since it has a perfect mix of ingredients already.

There was a lot of gameplay, some seriously though battles and some annoying dungeons that took forever, but I finished most of it and got the platinum in under a month. Nowadays for an RPG that\u0026rsquo;s very quick for me, an indication of how much I liked the game. There\u0026rsquo;s a bunch more content planned for it, including DLC story packs for each of the other main characters, and high-end boss fights and what not. Not sure if I\u0026rsquo;d still play those since there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more RPGs on the horizon (2017 is a good year for RPG gamers.) But if Final Fantasy XV is the next step for the series moving forward, I find it acceptable.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "title": "Google Code Jam and Competitive Programming",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eBack in 2004, I signed up for the \u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/codejam/\"\u003eGoogle Code Jam\u003c/a\u003e for the first time. Unfortunately I didn\u0026rsquo;t make it past the qualifying round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a bit luckier in \u003ca href=\"/2008/08/google-code-jam-2008/\"\u003e2008\u003c/a\u003e and 2010, making it to round 2 both times. In fact in 2008 as I recall I was one of only two participants from the Philippines who made it to round 2, which allowed me to jokingly brag about being the #2 programmer in the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI registered again a few times after that, and tried again last year (2016), where I only made it to round 1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m no stranger to programming competitions, although the GCJ was the only one I\u0026rsquo;ve ever really participated in. Back in college, one of my friends usually joined such competitions, and I had a good time going over some of the problems with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProgramming competitions don\u0026rsquo;t usually reflect the kind of programming done in most real-world jobs (although it might be interesting to use competitive programming problems in \u003ca href=\"/2017/03/fake-devs-and-whiteboard-interviews/\"\u003ewhiteboard interviews\u003c/a\u003e and see what happens). They focus on pushing the boundaries of the programmers talents in problem solving. You also need to be fairly familiar with algorithmic approaches to searching, sorting, and so on. Having a decent background in math also helps a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Google Code Jam in particular focuses on scaling up your code to handle very large amounts of data \u0026ndash; well past the integer limit sometimes. Each question usually has a small and a large input. For the large inputs, you only have a short amount of time (I think it was 5 minutes?) to submit the output. Presumably you wrote and tested your code before starting the timer, so the short time is really only for your code\u0026rsquo;s execution. You can afford to be inefficient or maybe even brute force your way through the small input, but if you want to solve the large inputs on time you have to be able to optimize your approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I first signed up, I dreamed of winning the entire thing (and of course being able to brag about being the best programmer in the world). But realistically, a lot of the people joining these competitions are \u0026ldquo;pros\u0026rdquo; more or less, so the chance of a \u0026ldquo;casual\u0026rdquo; like me winning are not that high. They are \u0026ldquo;pros\u0026rdquo; not in the sense that they do it for a living, but more of they do a lot of these competitions and regularly practice for them. Websites like \u003ca href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/\"\u003eTopCoder\u003c/a\u003e provide such competitions regularly for those who are interested. Also, I feel like I am very old and rusty, having worked too long in web development stuff where my focus is usually on a different kind of problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I think it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea for programmers of all skill levels to give it a try, just to see where you are at. Who knows, you might even make it all the way! The next Google Code Jam starts soon \u0026ndash; the qualification round is on Apr 7. I signed up, although I\u0026rsquo;m unsure if I will have the time this year even if I advance, due to scheduling problems. But a man can still dream, right? Who knows, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll see some of you there too in the final round!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It was true, he wasn’t used to this much climbing. They were almost at the hill’s peak, but the vegetation didn’t seem to taper off. The trek from base camp had taken them the better part of four hours, most of it only under the light of the second moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look!” He heard Raine’s voice call out from up ahead. “Hurry up and see!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alright, alright,” he said. He finally broke out of the brush and found that the hill’s surface levelled off a bit. As he caught up with Raine he put a hand on her shoulder. “Ok now, what’s so\u0026ndash; Oh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words trailed off as he finally saw what Raine was pointing at. A vast field of bioluminescent blue greeted him. The sea of bright blue lay in stark contrast to the dark of night. It covered most of the hill top and even some of the slopes that trailed off to the adjacent mountain ranges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaine was already running forward and unstrapping her gear bag. “Hey, wait up!” Michael called as he ran after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaine stopped at the edge of the field and lay down her bag. She knelt down and ran her hand through the flower petals glowing with a vivid blue hue. “Look at them Michael! It’s like they’re pulsating!” She looked up and across the clearing. “There must be more than tens of thousands of them here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, we’ll never be able to harvest that many samples,” Michael said with a wry voice. Raine glared at him in return. She began digging through her bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll only need less than a dozen samples. Don’t you dare touch the rest of them!” Raine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael pulled out his handheld and tapped the screen a few times. He raised his eyebrow at the display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was a good call not taking a shuttle here. Not that I enjoyed the hike I mean. The energy field they’re putting out is subtle, but there’s a good chance it would have wreaked havoc with the shuttle’s instrumentation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me that,” Raine said. She didn’t even wait for an acknowledgement and just snatched the handheld out of his hands. She scrolled through the displays. “I think it’s the same signature we saw from the scout telemetry! Similar to the radiation fields on Al Ghedo Prime!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me that!” Michael grinned as he grabbed back his own handheld. Raine could be like an excitable child when it came to her research. Maybe that was the reason he had found it so easy to join her on this first landing expedition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was very rare for an academic to join the preliminary colony establishment missions, much more someone who had spent the past decade in a remote lab. Michael understood the spirit of exploration that drove humanity to colonize as many worlds as they could, but he was no explorer. He rarely travelled, and even when he preferred travelling to well-established colonies, the ones with full populations and their own rich culture. And preferably not trips that take almost four months in hyperspace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Raine was a completely different creature, he mused. She followed her research wherever it took her, whether it was to the heart of a hollow moon or here to the farthest world humanity had ever attempted to colonize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was completely engrossed now. She had laid out her portable instrumentation platform at the edge of the field and was taking a variety of measurements. Michael sighed. There was no talking to her when she was like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, he swiped on his handheld and scanned the display. “The signal here is really great, even though we’re not too high up.” He stared upwards at the second moon and the stars beyond. “In fact, I think the sky tonight is clear enough to see the orbital platform.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm?” Raine said, looking up at him. She had a stylus in her mouth, an odd habit of hers. “Whachusaid?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying not to laugh at her, he looked at his display again. “Ark Thirty-Seven should be dropping out of hyperspace in a few hours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, you have a clear signal from here?” She obviously hadn’t been listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeap. It’s even clear enough for me to see Christine’s telemetry,” Michael said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, you must be excited. You haven’t seen each other in almost a year right?” Raine got up to stand beside him and look at his display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. It’s the longest we’ve been apart in a decade actually,” he confessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah well, you guys don’t really travel that much right?” she grinned at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks for this Raine.” He said after a short pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks for what?” She gave him a puzzled look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All of this.” He waved his free hand in the direction of the field. “And all of that,” he waved again at the multitude of stars in the sky. “I never had it in me to be an explorer, but damn if I don’t see the appeal of it right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know right? For a lot of people, they don’t really think about this stuff,” Raine said. “Like people in the core systems or the factory worlds. They don’t care that humanity is still exploring, they don’t care that we’re still finding new worlds to live on.” She pulled out her own handheld from her pocket. She swiped to the GalWeb app and scrolled through a few dozen posts. “I mean, look at all these people. They’re just happy to have their weekends or their expensive off-world coffees. Thirty-seven different worlds to visit and all they want is to upvote vids of their space cats. They don’t think about what a wondrous age we’re lucky enough to live in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t take you to be the philosophical kind,” Michael said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hah, I’m not, usually. But come on!” It was like a light had come on in her eyes, and she couldn’t hide the spark in her voice. ‘Ark Thirty-Seven! Isn’t that hard to believe? Who would have thought? I mean, two centuries ago before the core systems first developed hyperdrives, did they ever imagine we’d have thirty-seven colonies up and running in such a short time span? Back then, travelling to strange far-off worlds just to study alien flowers might have seemed like pure science fiction!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she was giving her spiel she was continuously browsing her friends’ posts across the GalWeb. Michael smiled and didn’t bother pointing out the other technology she was taking for granted. The technology she was using to see what was going on with her friends on a dozen other planets light-years away, the very same technology that let him monitor Christine’s trip remotely. The ansible. Two hundred years ago, they still had to deal with significant lag between planets in the core system. Faster than light communications would have been unimaginable back then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up again at the shining green light in the night sky, larger than the other stars. He knew it was the orbital platform. Tens of thousands of tons of heavy machinery, all designed to power and the two machines that drove human exploration - the hyperdrive beacon and the ansible. It had been humanity’s sheer luck that both breakthroughs were made within the same decade, enabling the human colonization of remote worlds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t get too excited, young lady. This colony isn’t officially ‘up and running’ you know,” he smiled at her. “At least not until Christine and the ten million other colonists on the Ark get settled in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey listen, about that,” Raine said with some hesitation. “You’re not mad are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mad? About what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That I made you join the advance mission with me? I mean, you’d be with her right now if it wasn’t for me right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heh,” he said. “You know, Christine and I actually had a short fight about it back when I first told her about the trip.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?!? I’m so sooorrrry,” Raine drawled in that weird tone her generation had a habit of using.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be. It wasn’t much of a fight,” he reassured her. “More of a debate. We’re scientists, we don’t really fight. But she didn’t understand why we had to go on the advance mission. She said the planet wouldn’t be going anywhere. I had to walk her through your telemetry data slides so she understood why we couldn’t miss the window.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaine nodded. “Christine’s a scientist too, I knew she’d understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, she also wasn’t happy that I’d be spending my time with a hot young thing like you,” he grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“‘Hot young thing!’” she slapped him on the back. “What the hell Michael, sexism went out of vogue back in the twenty-first you know!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m joking!” he laughed at her. Then he turned serious again. “Christine knows why our research is important. The scoutships really need this sort of data.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael thought about the scoutships. Small, autonomous ships travelling at sublight speeds to unexplored star systems. Literally thousands of them spread across the nearby regions, searching for new habitable worlds - or even the remote possibility of alien intelligence. The scoutships relied on surface survey data from scientists like Raine, allowing their machine intelligence to profile similar planets. The more surface data they could feed to the scouts, the more likely they were to be able to identify possible habitables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked up to the edge of the hilltop. It gave him a clear view of the valley below and the forward bases not too far away. The gigantic steel constructs were at rest now, their job mostly done. They had created a clearing, around one hundred and twenty square kilometers in total, he had been told. In just under a week, the ark’s landing module would come to rest in that clearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe modern arks were marvels of decades of engineering. Self-sustaining systems, filled with robotics, communications, supply lines, replicators, and anything else needed to quickly establish a modern city. They were a far cry from the early ark models, which were mostly just life support systems that could barely keep ten thousand colonists alive during the first hyperdrive colonization missions. Back then the first wave of colonists had to rough it, setting up their own hydroponic farms and comm systems, and dealing with the local wildlife themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days, everything was set up to be ready for the ark as soon as it arrived. Forward missions like the one he and Raine had joined went ahead, bringing the heavy machinery needed to prepare the landing zone and to boost the orbital platform’s capabilities. Explorer teams would have already scouted out the entire continent, making sure there weren’t any threats to the colony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn instant city, with ten million brave souls ready to become the colony’s first official citizens. Many of them would be people like him and Christine and Raine - scientists, engineers, explorers, pioneers, volunteers. But many more would simple be people from the other colonies, hoping to start over with new lives for whatever reasons they had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Michael?” he heard Raine’s voice snap him out of his musings. She was pointing up at the sky. “What is that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s the orbital platform, didn’t I tell you?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The platform is the bright green one, right?” she shook her head. “I was pointing at that other one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What other one?” Michael squinted, but then he saw it. Another pinprick of light, bluish-gray. Difficult to see against the night sky. Raine’s vision was much better than his. “What is that… is it moving?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I think so. It looks like it’s headed for the platform,” she pointed at Michael’s handheld. “Is the ark here early?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it shouldn’t be due for a few days yet,” Michael shook his head. He frowned and began swiping through the displays on his handheld. “I’m not registering any other ship out there, I\u0026ndash; hey!” He slapped the handheld against his palm. “What the heck, I just lost the connection!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Michael\u0026ndash;”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait, just let me see what’s up with this,” Michael said as he tapped a few buttons on the display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Michael! Look!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally looked up at where the orbital platform was. The second light was gone, apparently having already arrived at the platform. And for some reason, the green light from the platform was pulsating wildly. And then moments later, the green light died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What in blazes\u0026ndash;?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the endless night sky was set afire.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It was true, he wasn’t used to this much climbing. They were almost at the hill’s peak, but the vegetation didn’t seem to taper off. The trek from base camp had taken them the better part of four hours, most of it only under the light of the second moon.",

We had to turn off the PC and run out to the _sari-sari _store so that we had some people to talk to.
