Yet I\u0026rsquo;ve worked as a software developer for more than a decade now. Literally zero times have I needed to write a sorting function or balance a BST.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a rudimentary understanding of some sorting algorithms (mostly just bubble sort and selection sort), and I have some idea of how to balance a BST. And if I needed to implement any of those I could probably whip something up after a few tries. (Something buggy and/or inefficient probably.) If I had to interview at a company that used one of these whiteboard interviews, there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor maybe 90% (or even as high as 99%) of modern-day programming work, it simply isn\u0026rsquo;t needed to know these things by heart. Those skills are more necessary if you\u0026rsquo;re doing low level things like writing an OS or a graphics driver or such. For everyday web development or Java or Rails or whatever, it\u0026rsquo;s an indulgence. And even for those instances that you need them, well, the internet is right there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of the idea that not knowing data structures and algorithms means you aren\u0026rsquo;t a \u003cem\u003ereal\u003c/em\u003e software developer. I have a couple of developer friends who jokingly refer to themselves as \u0026ldquo;fake devs\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s supposed to mean someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any formal computer science background and has at best a passing familiarity with data structures, algorithms, and other computer science concepts. As one of them stated \u0026ldquo;I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t know how to make a map without using a map.\u0026rdquo; (I thought about writing a post about that, but it\u0026rsquo;s surprisingly easy \u0026ndash; just look it up.). One of them even asked me to give them a quick crash course in data structures and algorithms because he was applying in a large and well-known software company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me, this term is silly. If you\u0026rsquo;re doing software development work, then you\u0026rsquo;re a software developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not saying knowledge of these things isn\u0026rsquo;t useful. If you want to do more complicated work it is certainly useful to have these tools in your toolbox. Knowing them also makes you more flexible and expands your thinking. And certainly one should be the type of developer who is willing to seek out that knowledge if it turns out you need to use it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the problems with the whiteboard interviewing process isn\u0026rsquo;t that they require knowledge of these things; it\u0026rsquo;s that they require it under pressure, off the top of your head, without access to the internet. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t reflect how programming work happens in the real world, where you often have a team, an IDE, and even the entire internet to help you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, it\u0026rsquo;s often far too costly for companies to evaluate you under real-world conditions, so many resort to this common interviewing process. After all, it is difficult to evaluate the performance of even developers you have been working with for months, what more someone who just whipped up a short function on a whiteboard in twenty minutes? We tried some variations on it at our last company, but for me it is a problem yet unsolved. Maybe someday\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The TV also comes with some technologies to enhance your viewing experience such as 4k X-Reality and Triluminos display. And if you have a gamer in the family, this means you can now maximize the Playstation 4 Pro since it supports gaming in 4K resolution!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eConnectivity \u0026ndash; Wifi is a big deal for me because our current TV is a bit old and only supports wired connection. Wifi makes it a lot easier! The TV also has 4 HDMI slots \u0026ndash; let me see\u0026hellip;  that\u0026rsquo;s one each for the PS4 Pro, Nintendo Switch, and XBox One, plus one more to spare for those times when you want to connect your laptop to a big display (one can dream right?)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAndroid TV \u0026ndash; this means all the apps on the Google Play store can be downloaded and run on the TV. That means built-in Youtube, Netflix, etc, without need for a separate device to stream from!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGoogle Cast \u0026ndash; oh, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know this even existed until now! Apparently TV\u0026rsquo;s can now have Chromecast functionality built-in, without the need for the separate Chromecast device. Awesome! We can just send content from our mobile devices directly to the TV!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNetflix recommended \u0026ndash; one of the things I\u0026rsquo;ve been looking for in a new TV is that I want my folks to be able to easily use my Netflix account. Currently the only way they can use it on the TV is through the PS4, which is a bit difficult if you don\u0026rsquo;t know your way around a controller. Having the TV itself support Netflix will make it a lot easier for my parents to take advantage of Netflix\u0026rsquo;s library of movies and TV shows!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eX-Protection PRO \u0026ndash; to protect against power surges, this seems like it would be really good especially here in Metro Manila where power supply is not always the most stable. Added protection for your investment!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe model has a lot of other features designed to enhance your enjoyment of audio and video content. With all of these features, the Sony Bravia X8000D could definitely be the perfect home entertainment companion for the modern family!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

To be honest I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure about using this blog to participate in a promo, but I was already in the market for a new TV since our living room TV is already starting to have some problems.\nI checked out the product features of the Sony X8000D Bravia on their website.
