I\u0026rsquo;m not going to discuss all the details of the game, you can click through the links above to read more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing we always judge our fighting games on is the \u0026ldquo;random fighter selection\u0026rdquo; feature. SF3: Third Strike didn\u0026rsquo;t have it, but CvS2 and we played that a lot more than SF3 (and we would have never played SF3 had our PS2 not given up on our CvS2 disk). SF4 has a random fighter selection feature, but it\u0026rsquo;s a bit substandard since (a) You can cancel out of whatever selection it randomly gave you and (b) I got six Dhalsims out of seven randoms today! That\u0026rsquo;s insane. Also, in versus mode you have to move the selection cursor back to the random slot when choosing the next fighter (mildly annoying)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother neat feature: during versus matches, the game keeps tracks of continuous wins! Street Fighter sessions at home are generally won in a \u0026ldquo;five-in-a-row\u0026rdquo; basis, i.e. the first player to win five bouts in a row is considered the winner and the session ends. So this feature is pretty useful for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;ve tried playing online, although as usual connection is crap between BayanDSL and PLDT players, and the majority of Pinoy players seem to be on PLDT. Surprisingly, my brother was getting good connection ratings for opponents from Japan! The matching features are okay, despite not having double-blind character selection (this more accurately reflects the arcade experience though!) One thing that seems neat although we haven\u0026rsquo;t tried it yet \u0026ndash; when playing in arcade mode you can allow other online players to challenge you at any time, just like a real arcade game!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne last thing: Cammy\u0026rsquo;s ultra is pretty sw33t.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

After installation I found out that Conflux release events were this weekend so I might as well play, since I was not able to play IRL at this time.

No such luck of course. 🙂 My sealed pool follows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- more --\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"mtgdecklist\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"header\"\u003e\n

No blowout bombs, but quite possible to 6-1 or 7-0 with it. If only the pilot was someone much better than me\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI win round one, lose round two, win round three, then lose two in a row, taking me straight out of top eight contention.

Final record: 4-3.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made so many misplays I lost track of them already.

I need to be able to play tight \u003cem\u003eall the time\u003c/em\u003e if I want to be a serious tournament contender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed there are cards that I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how to evaluate, such as \u003ca href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Manaforce%20Mace\"\u003eManaforce Mace\u003c/a\u003e, which I never use because it seems so slow at 4cc/3equip, but I got my ass whupped by that card in one of the games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlaying Limited now feels so different from playing Limited back when I wasn\u0026rsquo;t a serious tournament player; I now spot a lot more mistakes and see a lot more room for improvement in my game. Unlike constructed where there\u0026rsquo;s a lot less variation in the number of interactions, in Limited basically anything can happen so you need to learn to react to a lot more situations. Maybe I should focus more on Limited again (if only it weren\u0026rsquo;t so expensive!)\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I reinstalled MTGO3 last week because I figured I could get some casual play out of it at least. After installation I found out that Conflux release events were this weekend so I might as well play, since I was not able to play IRL at this time. I was hoping MTGO3 had improved by now, and that they had sufficient server loading, etc. to handle the number of players without the servers being crashy and laggy and whatnot.",

I could\u0026rsquo;ve been able to forgive the fact that they roughly 80% of the story shied away from Street Fighter canon, had the movie\u0026rsquo;s storyline actually been good. As it is, you can expect short, unsatisfying fight scenes, ridiculous background stories, disjointed plot/scenes (reminds me of Smallville and/or Heroes writing =/), terrible wigs and the ridiculous sight of Michael Clark Duncan getting beaned by a pineapple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it was a problem with the theater\u0026rsquo;s copy, but there were no subtitles for the Chinese/Thai dialogues, which made up a nontrivial portion of the movie. Also, did they really, absolutely need to have the Kikoushou? The internal world of the movie would have been so much more consistent if Chun-Li did not magically learn the ability to create a fireball from nothing. And it\u0026rsquo;s totally unexplained as well!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash and Maya were pretty much useless. Gen, supposedly a really old guy who\u0026rsquo;s a rival for Akuma, was played by the same guy who played Liu Kang in Mortal Kombat, except he was wearing a really bad wig and apparently could not die. Michael Clark Duncan is wasted in his role as Balrog, who is not even hinted to be a boxer at all\u0026hellip; in fact he went so far as to use a bow and arrow in this movie. (Oh, and getting beaned by a pineapple)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/altealice\" title=\"altealice on twitter\"\u003e@altealice\u003c/a\u003e asks: are there enough lolz to make watching it worthwhile?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt depends on how \u003cem\u003emababaw\u003c/em\u003e you are at the time I guess. The plain ridiculousness of the storyline makes you want to facepalm. Things seem to happen at random and with no explanation (It\u0026rsquo;s never explained why the hell Bison took Chun-li\u0026rsquo;s father.) I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend watching it in the moviehouse, but maybe pickup a pirated DVD :p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least, it\u0026rsquo;s still better than the Van Damme movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
