I had to do 2000 samples per tile which is why it was so slow. I was getting too much noise/graininess at lower sampling rates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t follow the tutorial exactly. My plate is square and made of glass for one thing. The chocobutternut donut wasn\u0026rsquo;t part of the tutorial, I just wanted to try it (obviously did not turn out too well and all those orange particles on the donut probably really slowed down the render lol). I also didn\u0026rsquo;t bother too much with the stuff in the last two videos of the series which involved adjusting the lighting and other stuff to make the image prettier (wasn\u0026rsquo;t really interested). I actually also tried to model a fork (not in the tutorial), but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get the tines right and gave up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long time ago I read an interview in an old PC gaming mag about how they implemented Age of Empires and there was an image of a 3d mesh of a knight on horseback and I remember thinking \u0026ldquo;That looks really complicated, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably never be able to do something like that.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now that I\u0026rsquo;ve tried this tutorial, I have to agree with that initial assessment \u0026ndash; any complex modelling would surely try my patience. But I was also pleasantly surprised with how advanced Blender is \u0026ndash; I sort of imagined that you had to position and adjust all the mesh nodes/vertices/faces by hand a lot, but actually there\u0026rsquo;s a ton of functions to make some common operations simpler (but it\u0026rsquo;s still a lot of work).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne complaint is that Blender\u0026rsquo;s user interface is very obtuse and daunting though \u0026ndash; I don\u0026rsquo;t usually do video tutorials but I doubt I could have figured this stuff out on my own. Though I suppose it can\u0026rsquo;t be helped given the sheer complexity of the task involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m probably not going into any sort of significant 3d modelling or 3d artwork soon (like I said, not enough patience), but it was good to give it a try so at least I have a passing knowledge of some of the concepts involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",
