            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA while back, news came out that an \u003ca href=\"http://siliconangle.com/blog/2016/08/05/watson-correctly-diagnoses-woman-after-doctors-were-stumped/\"\u003eAI was able to perform a diagnosis after the human doctors were stumped\u003c/a\u003e. Having just finished binge-watching the entire run of Star Trek Voyager, I immediately thought that was the sort of AI advancement that could lead to such things as Voyager\u0026rsquo;s Emergency Medical Hologram, an AI which could replace a human doctor. Of course, it is still very unlikely for this to happen anytime soon, medicine is a very complex field and new things are still being discovered all the time. This sort of approach \u0026ndash; using a set of data (in this case, the patient\u0026rsquo;s genetic data) could be compared to an existing database of past diagnoses to find something similar \u0026ndash; could advance rapidly in the coming years to at least assist human doctors in providing diagnoses for those rare conditions that only few doctors have encountered. It may take a generation or so, but I can see that AI medical assistants might at least be possible in the future\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got to thinking: is my own profession (software development) in danger of being replaced by AI in some far-off future? \u0026ldquo;Software that can write software\u0026rdquo; is an ideal that many programmers have thought about at some point in their careers. I remember that at some point a few years into my career I was already thinking about how it might be possible. But then there was also a project where I had to study the possibility of writing software to convert legacy PowerBuilder code into Java web application, which led to a far greater appreciation of how complicated programming languages are and an understanding that any attempt to generate large systems automatically is a crazy endeavor that would take a large amount of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndividual small software tasks can be easily automated \u0026ndash; this is why we have code templates and code generators and so on. This kind of work is similar to the medical situation above, it\u0026rsquo;s based on knowledge of existing code, so a program can put something together based on previous implementations. But as I mentioned in a previous post, \u003ca href=\"http://roytang.net/wp-admin/post.php?post=1387\u0026amp;action=edit\"\u003ewriting software is about finding the right arrangement of code\u003c/a\u003e, which is largely a creative effort and is much more difficult for software to do, at least until the automation of the lower-level smaller-scale tasks is perfected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I believe new tools will be developed within the near future to automate small parts of the coding process, the overall development of software systems is likely to remain out of reach of AI for a long while. In fact, I believe that software development will be one of the very last fields to be replaced completely by robots, since as other fields start getting more and more automated, there will be a greater need for new software to cover those domains. So most probably doctors and programmers don\u0026rsquo;t have anything to worry about for quite a while\u003c/p\u003e\n",

On any given day if you needed to work overtime or run errands, you\u0026rsquo;re probably saying goodbye to any recreation time on that day. And if you have kids to take care of, that\u0026rsquo;s basically all days\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days I\u0026rsquo;ve found that even if you\u0026rsquo;re not working most days, it\u0026rsquo;s easy enough to feel like there\u0026rsquo;s not enough time for all the things you want to do. Or maybe that\u0026rsquo;s just me because there\u0026rsquo;s a whole lot of things I want to be able to do. I want to be able to learn, read, write, watch, draw, create, play, work on my side projects, argue with people on the internet, and so on. I don\u0026rsquo;t understand people who say they have too much free time and they get bored, I feel like those people just don\u0026rsquo;t have enough things they want to do. The difference between work and leisure is that when you\u0026rsquo;re  at work, you look for enough tasks to fill your required hours, while for leisure you like for enough hours to do the things you want to do\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver since I started working I always had this idea that it was a ridiculous notion that we had to give up so much of our time to work so that in theory we could be comfortable in some foggy unknown future. You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t sacrifice today to enjoy tomorrow, what\u0026rsquo;s the point? Your hour today is the same amount of time as your hour tomorrow. I get that sometimes you have to sacrifice some time today for some sort of multiplicative effect it may theoretically have on the future (i.e. doing something today for 1 hour may earn you multiple hours in the future), but you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t sacrifice so much that you are no longer able to enjoy and appreciate the present (if you have that luxury of course)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe get the same amount of time (24 hours) every day as everyone else though. That\u0026rsquo;s the same amount of time as Einstein or Bill Gates or Barack Obama or whatever other random successful person you want to cite. It\u0026rsquo;s the ultimate equalizer. Other people accomplish so much with the same amount of time, so why can\u0026rsquo;t we?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSupposedly it\u0026rsquo;s all about setting your priorities and focusing on what\u0026rsquo;s important. Unfortunately focus has always been a problem of mine since I like to dabble in a wide variety of things. I look at the list of things I want to do and I tell myself I have to decide to sacrifice some of these so that the others can get done. Focus only on what matters. What if everything matters?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople will say you should cut back on TV or playing video games if you want to get stuff done, that these things are a waste of time. But as John Lennon said \u0026ldquo;Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time\u0026rdquo;. If doing these things is what you want to do, you should go for it, just be aware of what you\u0026rsquo;re sacrificing in exchange\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI believe that some time within this century attitudes of people towards work and time will begin to change. That the idea of working 40-50 hour days being a normal thing will start to fade away. (Or maybe I am being too optimistic). Until that time comes, we all need to consciously manage our time and priorities in order to cope\u003c/p\u003e\n",
