            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAlmost six years ago, \u003ca href=\"/2010/11/randomly-amazed/\"\u003eI had to undergo minor surgery and had to endure the pain of being administered spinal anesthesia\u003c/a\u003e. I was reminded of this recently because a loved one with an even lower pain tolerance than I did recently had to undergo a similar procedure\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a pretty low tolerance for pain myself. I tried to spin it a bit positively in the blog post linked above, but there\u0026rsquo;s no question many times during the procedure I felt miserable and in lots of pain. Even just the process of being put on a dextrose was pretty uncomfortable for me, and laying there on the operating table hunched in a fetal position waiting to be administered spinal anesthesia was far worse. I even had to undergo anesthesia twice because I went back into the OR after some complications!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I\u0026rsquo;ve written before, one of the worst things is \u003ca href=\"/2005/12/the-left-half-of-my-mouth-is-numb-thanks/\"\u003ethe mental anticipation of pain\u003c/a\u003e. Those few moments waiting for the inevitable pinprick that will start an avalanche of pain. There\u0026rsquo;s a balance you have to strike between bracing yourself for the pain that you know is coming and not letting your fear of the coming pain somehow amplify it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor things like spinal anesthesia, or dextrose being hooked up, or blood samples being taken from your arm, you just have to pretty much grin and bear it. If you can\u0026rsquo;t avoid these scenarios you might as well just get through with it as quickly as possible. That\u0026rsquo;s why for medical problems, I prefer just doing what needs to be done, even if it means some measure of pain and discomfort. It\u0026rsquo;s better than letting discomfort linger and possibly reoccur and become more complicated\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrior to that operation, the most pain I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced was \u003ca href=\"/2004/12/i-get-bored-easily/\"\u003ea toothache back in 2004\u003c/a\u003e. (Apparently I write about pain a lot). Toothaches are also pretty bad because unlike the pinpricks described above, they\u0026rsquo;re continuous pain. I only wanted to mention this part because I remembered that my dentist happened to read the blog post linked in this paragraph and gave me a frowny face over email when she read about me complaining of the pain haha\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look forward to the day that medical science advances quickly enough that pain relief is fast, easy, and painless, though that may take a while: apparently \u003ca href=\"http://io9.gizmodo.com/how-does-anesthesia-work-doctors-arent-sure-and-her-1592809615\"\u003ewe don\u0026rsquo;t even completely understand how anesthesia works\u003c/a\u003e, we\u0026rsquo;re just glad that it does. Until then, we just grit our teeth and think happy thoughts and power through the pain\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",

Having just finished binge-watching the entire run of Star Trek Voyager, I immediately thought that was the sort of AI advancement that could lead to such things as Voyager\u0026rsquo;s Emergency Medical Hologram, an AI which could replace a human doctor. Of course, it is still very unlikely for this to happen anytime soon, medicine is a very complex field and new things are still being discovered all the time. This sort of approach \u0026ndash; using a set of data (in this case, the patient\u0026rsquo;s genetic data) could be compared to an existing database of past diagnoses to find something similar \u0026ndash; could advance rapidly in the coming years to at least assist human doctors in providing diagnoses for those rare conditions that only few doctors have encountered. It may take a generation or so, but I can see that AI medical assistants might at least be possible in the future\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got to thinking: is my own profession (software development) in danger of being replaced by AI in some far-off future? \u0026ldquo;Software that can write software\u0026rdquo; is an ideal that many programmers have thought about at some point in their careers. I remember that at some point a few years into my career I was already thinking about how it might be possible. But then there was also a project where I had to study the possibility of writing software to convert legacy PowerBuilder code into Java web application, which led to a far greater appreciation of how complicated programming languages are and an understanding that any attempt to generate large systems automatically is a crazy endeavor that would take a large amount of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndividual small software tasks can be easily automated \u0026ndash; this is why we have code templates and code generators and so on. This kind of work is similar to the medical situation above, it\u0026rsquo;s based on knowledge of existing code, so a program can put something together based on previous implementations. But as I mentioned in a previous post, \u003ca href=\"/2016/08/programming-is-finding-the-right-arrangement-of-code/\"\u003ewriting software is about finding the right arrangement of code\u003c/a\u003e, which is largely a creative effort and is much more difficult for software to do, at least until the automation of the lower-level smaller-scale tasks is perfected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I believe new tools will be developed within the near future to automate small parts of the coding process, the overall development of software systems is likely to remain out of reach of AI for a long while. In fact, I believe that software development will be one of the very last fields to be replaced completely by robots, since as other fields start getting more and more automated, there will be a greater need for new software to cover those domains. So most probably doctors and programmers don\u0026rsquo;t have anything to worry about for quite a while\u003c/p\u003e\n",
