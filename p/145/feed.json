AND make him a new suit when he only had 36 hours to catch Cap and friends. At least Cap got Hawkeye to do his stateside work, so their flight was only one way :p I feel like they probably had to work the Spidey part into the script after the deal with Sony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had known there would be a Giant Man appearance since there was a lego set that spoiled it, but luckily I completely forgot about it and only remembered when Scott said \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve only tried this once in a lab and it almost tore me apart!\u0026rdquo; Fun moment\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Zemo shows the three guys the video of Bucky taking out Howard and wife, Tony asks Steve \u0026ldquo;Did you know?\u0026rdquo; and Steve replies, \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t know it was him\u0026rdquo;. What exactly did Steve know? Did he know that Howard and wife were assassinated, but did not know that Bucky was the assassin? If so, how does he know that? These events happened while he was in the ice. My brother thought it meant that Steve knew that Bucky assassinated someone (since Bucky told him about the incident he discussed with Zemo during the blackout), but that Steve did not know it was Howard. But then it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make sense to reply to Tony that way?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandom: the endings for both Civil War and BvS were both about someone\u0026rsquo;s mother. Okay, not really haha\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Raft: Didn\u0026rsquo;t they also have a Raft in Agents of SHIELD? Then again, the movie guys probably don\u0026rsquo;t care about that show anymore\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the airport fight sequence, I was expecting someone to switch sides at some point and thought it would be Spidey (since you know, Civil War), but happy to be surprised it was Natasha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome minor airport fight nitpicks: after they square off in the middle of the airport they break off into pairs but Vision is conspicuously absent. I don\u0026rsquo;t think he does anything significant until Giant-Man, which is weird given he\u0026rsquo;s the most powerful guy there. Also, at some point Falcon and Bucky ge\u003c/p\u003e\n",
