The results were mostly the same, but the Google site gave me results faster, so this was the one I referenced for subsequent testing. The most important problems to address were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOptimizing image sizes\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRemoving render-blocking JS and CSS in above-the fold content\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLeverage browser caching (through the use of HTTP headers)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMinify CSS and Javascript\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of these are familiar to me since they are very common performance optimizations done in web applications. However, this blog is running on WordPress, which means I should try to look for existing WordPress-based solutions instead of hacking the code myself. (I used to run a custom-built Django-based blog system here, but I got tired of maintaining it myself so I went for tried-and-true WordPress). Here are the optimizations I ended up doing:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUpgraded to the default WordPress Twenty-Sixteen Theme. Not strictly necessary for optimization, but I was previously using the Twenty-Twelve Theme, and the problem with using older themes is that they may not be using newer web development techniques to improve performance. Also, Twenty-Sixteen looked better haha. And yes, I do use the default WordPress themes. Too lazy (as of yet) to look for a nice custom theme, and I don\u0026rsquo;t have the design chops myself to build it, so it will do for now.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFor the image size problem, I found that the biggest offender was the \u003ca href=\"/2016/03/sketching-daily/\"\u003eSketching Daily post\u003c/a\u003e where I broke down how I do my daily sketches. The problem was that I was uploading full-size images of the drawings and they were being inlined into the post \u0026ndash; which meant the browser was loading the full-size image even though it was shown in a smaller size on the post itself. Instead, I manually changed the settings of each image in the post to use one of the smaller-size images generated by WordPress on upload. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#5e6f8afbe11d06811d33a26b4c215b02-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2016/06/performance-optimization-for-wordpress-blogs/wp-image-settings_huc3ccc93e8d0116ad5b05ed14c6c422a1_16871_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"5e6f8afbe11d06811d33a26b4c215b02-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2016/06/performance-optimization-for-wordpress-blogs/wp-image-settings.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"30 Jun 2016 1:30am\"\u003e30 Jun 2016 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n Choosing \u0026ldquo;Large\u0026rdquo; here meant the Large one would be inlined, while I could still set the image to link to the full-size one on click. The full size image is a whole fifteen times larger than the \u0026ldquo;large\u0026rdquo; image! It\u0026rsquo;s something I need to remember in the future if I ever upload huge images again. I also found a link that described how to set the \u003ca href=\"https://made4wp.com/changing-default-attachment-display-setting-insert-image-post/\"\u003edefault image size\u003c/a\u003e (so that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t default to full size all the time), but I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s necessary for now.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo further help with image optimization, I installed the \u003ca href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/\"\u003eWP Smush plugin\u003c/a\u003e, which automatically optimizes (\u0026ldquo;smushes\u0026rdquo;) uploaded images. I found that WP Smush reduces the uploaded image sizes by around 10-15% on average, it\u0026rsquo;s not too bad.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNext was render-blocking JavaScript. If you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar, any \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;script include=\u0026quot;... \u0026quot; /\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e tag in your HTML blocks the rendering of any content below the tag itself until the content of the JS has finished executing. The typical solutions are either to (a) move the script tags to below the content (\u0026ldquo;below the fold\u0026rdquo;) or (b) add an \u0026ldquo;async\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;defer\u0026rdquo; attribute to the script tag. It turns out that there was already a plugin that did (b), \u003ca href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/async-javascript/\"\u003eAsync Javascript\u003c/a\u003e. So I gave it a go, but for some reason it wasn\u0026rsquo;t working. After a bit of debugging, I found that there was an \u0026ldquo;aj_enabled\u0026rdquo; option that wasn\u0026rsquo;t being set. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out any settings page to update it, so I went ahead and edited the plugin directly to set the value: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#36eed300f8d29100ff8ea1e3c36cd5ca-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2016/06/performance-optimization-for-wordpress-blogs/wp-async-js_hu70554058f9d4537be00e9490b1341641_41959_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"36eed300f8d29100ff8ea1e3c36cd5ca-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2016/06/performance-optimization-for-wordpress-blogs/wp-async-js.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"30 Jun 2016 1:30am\"\u003e30 Jun 2016 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n It\u0026rsquo;s generally a bad idea to hack the local copy of your WordPress plugins, since you have to check the impact every time the plugin has a new version, but I decided to live with it for now. After the update, sure enough the JS no longer blocked page rendering.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLastly, I installed the \u003ca href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/\"\u003eW3 Total Cache plugin\u003c/a\u003e. I disabled the WP Super Cache plugin I was using before since they would probably have some sort of conflict. In addition to page caching, this plugin addresses a couple of other issues: it supports HTML/JS/CSS minification (reduces file sizes and HTTP requests) and it allows adding the expiry headers to static content (to leverage browser caching). If you\u0026rsquo;ve done any work on website performance, the settings for the plugin are straightforward to understand, but I also referenced the guide at \u003ca href=\"https://gtmetrix.com/wordpress-optimization-guide.html\"\u003ethis link\u003c/a\u003e. The plugin looks okay, but there\u0026rsquo;s an unfortunate side effect: the minified JS created by the plugin does not respect Async Javascript, so it blocks above the fold content from rendering. It\u0026rsquo;s a problem I\u0026rsquo;ll have to try to resolve in the future.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the above changes, I retest the site:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#21b8bf5fee6eb583237d7c9920559f3b-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2016/06/performance-optimization-for-wordpress-blogs/wp-report_hu9a07672283dc6dda715aae2184dde23f_16606_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"21b8bf5fee6eb583237d7c9920559f3b-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2016/06/performance-optimization-for-wordpress-blogs/wp-report.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"30 Jun 2016 1:30am\"\u003e30 Jun 2016 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMuch improvement indeed!

It made think of a time when we were kids and we tried running a business\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a summer from years ago. Perhaps 1988 or 1989, or maybe a year or two earlier, I can\u0026rsquo;t be sure. I was young, my brother was younger by a few years, my female cousin older by a few years. Back then our families live under the same roof, my grandfather\u0026rsquo;s house\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe needed something to keep us occupied during the summer. We probably already had a Nintendo around this time, but my brother and I were only allowed one hour of video games a day, so we needed something else to fill the time. I think it was my mother who suggested we run a small business over the summer, sell some food things to people\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur house had a \u003cem\u003esari-sari store.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eSari-sari\u003c/em\u003e stores are like small family-owned convenience stores in the Philippines, often run out of the house directly, with the storefront little more than holes in the wall that make up the house\u0026rsquo;s facade. The one in our house had one small window and one large window, each covered by rusty metal bars half a foot apart. It sold soft drinks (cokes and sprites and whatnot), beer to the local tambays, small bags of chips (Chippy, Clover Chips, Tortillos, etc), small chocolates and packs of nuts and such. As kids we spent a lot of free time at the store, especially when the parents were away. After my grandfather died, the store was taken over by a beloved family friend who had been living with us forever. She often indulged us kids our whimsies, which often meant our parents came home to find out they now owed a bunch more pesos to the store. That summer, we had decided to sell ice candy to the people in the neighborhood through the store\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could be forgiven for not knowing what ice candy was, at least if you didn\u0026rsquo;t live in the Philippines. It\u0026rsquo;s a treat made out of frozen flavored water, usually in a long plastic bag that gives it an elongated shape. In the US, they might be called \u0026ldquo;freeze pops\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents gave us some \u0026ldquo;seed money\u0026rdquo; (and I suppose my uncle gave my cousin some as well). I think my brother and I would have a separate stock from our cousin, but we would both be selling in the same store. We went to the nearby grocery store and bought the materials we\u0026rsquo;d need: some powdered flavoring and packs of small plastic tubes. When we got home, our mother showed us how to prepare the ice candy. We would mix the flavoring (I think we used orange flavoring. I liked orange back then) in some water, then pour the flavored water into the plastic tubes and tie a knot in the end to seal them. Then we would leave the tubes in the freezer overnight, and we would sell them the next day\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember them being a hit, especially with the neighborhood kids. We sold them for I think a peso each, or maybe a peso and fifty centavos. (Things were simple and cheap back then.) I think my cousin used slightly larger plastic tubes and sold her ice candies for a bit more. In theory, we would then reinvest the day\u0026rsquo;s income into more flavoring and plastic tubes for the next day, but I think it turned out that our parents just gave us more money for the next day\u0026rsquo;s materials. So perhaps it was less of capitalism and more of \u0026ldquo;here\u0026rsquo;s a fun way to earn allowance during the summer\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI specifically remember my younger brother enjoying the business and dreaming of making it big as a businessman. His imagined future business was still ice candy. He imagined having an ice candy empire well-known throughout the land, with rich and famous personalities such as the president coming to his stores to buy ice candy. So maybe the exercise did manage to impart a little bit of entrepreneurial spirit to us after all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember at the end of that summer, we were happy with the amount of money we had earned, and we talked about doing it again the next summer. But we never did\u003c/p\u003e\n",
