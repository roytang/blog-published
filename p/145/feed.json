With recent events I\u0026rsquo;ve found myself getting into more discussions, debates and otherwise friendly arguments online. The quality of these interactions hasn\u0026rsquo;t always been the best, and many times I feel like I should have stopped engaging sooner or maybe not participated at all. I\u0026rsquo;ve considered some points to help me decide in the future whether to bother engaging other people online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonally, I\u0026rsquo;ve always been both used to and biased in favor of vibrant and open debate and discussion. And I\u0026rsquo;m happy to say many of my closest friends are of the same temperament. But one thing I\u0026rsquo;ve learned is that \u003cstrong\u003emany people don\u0026rsquo;t like their views being criticized\u003c/strong\u003e. For some people, posting on the internet is putting themselves out there and risking being criticized (as if receiving criticism were a bad thing in and of itself!). I do think that more people voicing their opinions can only be a good thing, so maybe we can try not to be so aggressive when we know the person doesn\u0026rsquo;t like criticism or isn\u0026rsquo;t used to an open debate. \u0026quot; I understand that you believe that, although have you considered the studies that say \u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1222\" style=\"width: 836px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#f8dff1d9da1ba1bb035397e7cc6d0c49-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2016/05/debating-on-the-internet/discussion_hu1e6b6f008ac53ad78a5c7d9e861c8940_109375_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"(Image cribbed from a friend)\" title=\"(Image cribbed from a friend)\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e(Image cribbed from a friend) (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"f8dff1d9da1ba1bb035397e7cc6d0c49-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2016/05/debating-on-the-internet/discussion.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e(Image cribbed from a friend)\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"24 May 2016 12:30am\"\u003e24 May 2016 12:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAccept that you are not going to \u0026ldquo;win\u0026rdquo; any debate.\u003c/strong\u003e From experience, it is very rare to win a debate on the internet.

It can be difficult, sometimes people can pretend to be open to discussion but really just want to reinforce their own views. It\u0026rsquo;s easiest if you already know the person. For example, if the person has a history of not believing easily-verifiable facts, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s better not to engage at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**Know what you are looking for. **Typically, there\u0026rsquo;s one of three things I want out of a discussion: (a) I want to gather more information to help in my own decision-making; or (b) I want to point out misinformation or logical problems; or (c) I want to present my own point of view for others to consider. If you\u0026rsquo;ve already met your goals, you can safely consider tapping out \u0026ldquo;I just wanted to say that I think X is a better choice. Take that as you will\u0026rdquo;. Of course sometimes there\u0026rsquo;s a fourth thing I want: just to engage in a lively discussion 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAvoid attacking the other person\u003c/strong\u003e, even when he/she is obviously being a bloody idiot. Bloody idiots can have opinions too after all. It should be possible to point out logical flaws or misinformation without taking things personally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**If you are aiming to convince others to change their position, you should be willing to change yours as well. **Not only is it more sincere, it\u0026rsquo;s also fair. It will make your own arguments more compelling if you can show a willingness to question your own assumptions as well. That being said, you probably only need to employ this if the other people are willing to change their positions too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**Don\u0026rsquo;t take things personally, and don\u0026rsquo;t respond to criticism in anger. **If someone says something like your work is cringeworthy, instead of taking offense maybe you can ask the person to elaborate \u0026ldquo;Which parts did you find problematic and why?\u0026rdquo; If the person is not willing to discuss in detail, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s no longer productive to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKnow when to tap out of a discussion.\u003c/strong\u003e You have to learn to recognize when other people are (a) not willing to consider other points of view; or (b) not looking for a debate or discussion or pros and cons. It will usually become obvious once they reply one or two times (sometimes it will be bloody obvious when they say something like \u0026ldquo;I believe in X no matter what\u0026rdquo;). Unless you are really enjoying the debate (which I am sometimes wont to do!), it\u0026rsquo;s probably not productive anymore to continue discussion. In that case, it\u0026rsquo;s probably better to just agree to disagree and move on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m probably still going to occasionally dive into a debate just to be a devil\u0026rsquo;s advocate or even just for fun though, but hopefully these guidelines help me (and maybe even you!) recognize when it\u0026rsquo;s unproductive to engage and just to move on.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Here is a truth: every person can be boring or interesting to other people, it all depends on whether those other people share the same passions or culture with you. I work in software development, so when I encounter another software developer in the wild, we can easily have good conversations even if we are strangers. Being a true person facilitates this: when people see that you are honest and open and unpretentious, those who share your interests and passions will be more likely to gravitate to you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\"\u003eAside from that, one other tip I can give you is: be interested in other people. What you think of other people matters more to them, so if you show interest in them, they are more likely to show an interest in you. This means being willing to listen to them and their stories to figure out where their interest lies, and asking them questions to make them elaborate on those interests.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\"\u003eBeing a true person helps here too, because people can easily spot fake interest.

Berkun writes about a number of diverse topics such as how to think critically and how to interact with other people and how to spend your attention. Maybe \u0026ldquo;Big Ideas\u0026rdquo; is a bit grandiose, as many of these essays tackle things that seem more like they should be common sense but aren\u0026rsquo;t.

The game is created by Paradox, well-known for a number of other grand strategy games mostly with a historical basis such as Crusader Kings. I\u0026rsquo;ve owned Crusader Kings II for a while now but never got into it too deeply because (a) it\u0026rsquo;s just a bit too overwhelming; and (b) I find the combat way too obtruse. Stellaris was supposedly a simpler and friendlier version of Paradox\u0026rsquo;s other grand strategy games, which piqued my interest. Reading a few posts over on \u003ca href=\"http://reddit.com/r/Stellaris\"\u003er/Stellaris\u003c/a\u003e was enough for me to impulse buy the game last week. Review summary: game is great and adds a lot of interesting stuff to the 4x genre, but there are some flaws that will hopefully be improved upon in succeeding patches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gameplay framework is basically similar to other 4x space strategy games such as Master of Orion: \u0026ldquo;eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate\u0026rdquo;. You\u0026rsquo;re in charge of a burgeoning galactic empire. You send out science ships to survey nearby and distant star systems. You build colonies and outposts to extend your reach. You assign scientists to research new technologies that help you improve your empire. You encounter other starfaring alien races and either build fleets of spacecraft to bludgeon them into submission or use diplomacy to make friends, form alliances and eventually a federation. You can also encounter primitive alien species who have yet to make it off-world and choose to either observe them passively or try to speed up their development or uplift them to become new allies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStory\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ll start with this because it\u0026rsquo;s my favorite thing about the game. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of weird to be talking about story in a 4x strategy game, they\u0026rsquo;re not really well-known for that, Civilization stories about Gandhi\u0026rsquo;s warmongering aside. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the trope inversions Stellaris has done. There are abundant special event chains to be encountered and some of them are hilarious really. These are reminiscent of Crusader Kings\u0026rsquo; own event chains, the part of that game I found the most enjoyable. Combined with 4x strategy games penchant for emergent user stories, this means there will often be a lot of stories to tell about how your empire achieved galactic domination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#335d47f389483de83b8222dab5e757bc-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2016/05/stellaris-review/20160517155217_1_huf5e4c5fc2541463877fb3ad91d146d72_395701_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"This is why you shouldn\u0026#39;t let your officers drink on duty\" title=\"This is why you shouldn\u0026#39;t let your officers drink on duty\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eThis is why you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t let your officers drink on duty (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"335d47f389483de83b8222dab5e757bc-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2016/05/stellaris-review/20160517155217_1.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThis is why you shouldn\u0026#39;t let your officers drink on duty\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"18 May 2016 11:55pm\"\u003e18 May 2016 11:55pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e**Victory **\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadly there are at the moment only two victory conditions available in game: Domination (control 40% of all habitable planets) and Conquest (be the last independent empire standing). That being said, there are a few options to achieve both goals; they need not be achieved through warfare, but can be done through diplomacy. You can ally and eventually form federations with other empires and share victory conditions with them, which means you can achieve Conquest through alliance-building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDiplomacy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of diplomacy, you can do the usual resource trading and asking for border access and offering alliances or non-aggression pacts and such. But comparing it to their other games like Crusader Kings it\u0026rsquo;s admittedly quite shallow. Even some more complicated options that are available in simpler games like Civilization V are surprisingly unavailable. There is no way to bribe other empires for alliances or border access or maybe even declaring war on common enemies. I also wish there were special event chains or technology choices that involve diplomatic relations. Hopefully they can improve upon these things as they iterate with future patches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t know therefore aliens\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a variety of alien races available to play, and you can customize your species at the start of the game. There are a number of customization options: you can control what type of climates your species can easily adapt to, what ethics your race follows (which can affect your diplomacy and sometimes your research options), and add other special traits that give bonuses to happiness, resource acquisition, etc. All other empires in the galaxy will feature procedurally-generated species as well. At the start, each empire is only inhabited by one species, but as you encounter more and more alien races, your planet populations can become more a mix of your native species and foreign species and maybe even robot workers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eResearch and Technology\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResearch and technology is split into three fields: physics, engineering and biology. These technologies will unlock new ship components (allowing you to design new ships Master of Orion style), improve your empire\u0026rsquo;s capabilities and provide new building and station options. Unlike Civilization\u0026rsquo;s technology trees, research options are dealt at random. You are given 3-4 alternatives to choose from every time, and sometimes you\u0026rsquo;ll be lucky enough to have a rare technology as a research option. In the late game, there are even dangerous technologies that provide significant benefit but can lead to your empire facing one of a few late-game crises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMid to Late Game\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the game is fun to play, it starts to get weak in the mid to late game when most of your exploration is already done. More often than not, other empires will hamper your mid to late game exploration, and your science ships will have precious little to do in the later stages except maybe analyze debris from your space battles. The game also needs more special event chains in the mid to late game as it descends into long stretches of building things interspersed by the occasional war. It\u0026rsquo;s something they\u0026rsquo;ve roadmapped for the next few patches, to add more events specifically for colony-related events, so that\u0026rsquo;s something to look forward to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s also a need for more resource sinks in the late game, as your empire has caps on how many of each resource you can store. In my most advanced game, I was at the resource cap all the time despite spending as much as I could on buildings, stations and spacecraft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the biggest problem is a technical one. As the number of planets and spacecraft under your control increases, the game encounters noticeable slowdown. At this point, the fastest speed is only slightly faster than the normal speed near the start of the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve owned the game for a bit less than a week and have managed to bring three different saves to the mid to late game but finished none of them. You are able to delegate most of your planets to AI sectors (in fact you have no choice as there is a limit to the number of core planets you can directly manage), but empire-building and expansion can still become tedious in the late game given the normal size of the generated galaxies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBugs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also encountered a few bugs as I played. Nothing game-breaking or crash to desktop stuff, but things like quests becoming impossible to complete under certain conditions, or supposedly stone-age species owning starships, that kind of thing. Steam achievements also seem a bit buggy, I think they stopped firing after a certain point in the game. They\u0026rsquo;re planning a number of bug fixes within the next couple of months so hopefully most of these problems get addressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConclusion\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot more to touch on as I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I\u0026rsquo;ve only scratched the surface of Stellaris, but this review is already way longer than I thought it would be. Stellaris is a fun, great game, providing a few good twists on the 4x genre, and very much like the Civilization games, there\u0026rsquo;s a strong tendency to play for much longer hours than you were planning to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there are still some flaws especially in the mid to late game. Paradox has a good track record of improving their games incrementally with free updates (I recently reinstalled Crusader Kings II after a couple of years and was happy to find a few features that weren\u0026rsquo;t there before), so hopefully many of these problems get ironed out in the next few months. I\u0026rsquo;ve already played way too much of this game than I expected, so I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to set it aside for a few months and come back to it later.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The game is created by Paradox, well-known for a number of other grand strategy games mostly with a historical basis such as Crusader Kings. I\u0026rsquo;ve owned Crusader Kings II for a while now but never got into it too deeply because (a) it\u0026rsquo;s just a bit too overwhelming; and (b) I find the combat way too obtruse.",
