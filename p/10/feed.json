It kind of died off, mostly because I haven\u0026rsquo;t been good about going through my backlog of feeds and sources to get much content for the section. I\u0026rsquo;m bringing it back here as a regular section (for now), so that (a) I force myself to go through all that stuff at least once a week; and (b) people who aren\u0026rsquo;t super interested in what\u0026rsquo;s going on with me have more stuff to read in these weeknotes. I also considered just having a separate weekly \u0026ldquo;linkblog\u0026rdquo; post with the links of interest section, but figured maybe I\u0026rsquo;d check first if I can keep up with the volume needed for that sort of thing? Also, a lot of these are available on my \u003ca href=\"/links/\"\u003elinks\u003c/a\u003e list, which I also share to Twitter/Masto as they come, so if you follow me there, you might have seen me tweet some of these, and this is just sort of a weekly recap.

Not bad for a kids\u0026rsquo; show, covers most of the mythos fairly well, though I\u0026rsquo;m disappointed at how Peter treats Gwen like a sidekick given in the comics she\u0026rsquo;s the love of his life. I\u0026rsquo;m only halfway through, maybe that changes later? I always felt Spider-man was better as a serialized TV series than the constant movie reboots. He has a lot of nice street-level villains and supporting cast that can only feature in a longer storyline than blockbuster movies can afford.

To help reinforce my book reading, I\u0026rsquo;ve switched up my evening meals reading from the day\u0026rsquo;s news to whatever book I have on tap at the moment.

It\u0026rsquo;s kind of annoying, like I slept on it wrong. I thought it would just go away on its own, but now I\u0026rsquo;m thinking maybe it\u0026rsquo;s one of those old age things where things just hurt randomly and you have to live with it?!?

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eOne habit I now have that I wish I had started much, much earlier in life would be conducting regular, periodic reviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese reviews are a sort of written introspection of the time period in question, the target audience being future me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m reminded of the important of this because I had been going through old files the last few months and I really enjoy reading through some older entries and basically traipsing through younger me\u0026rsquo;s mind. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of a time machine in a way. And it helps me by providing a sort of foundation for my thinking, so I understand how my thinking has (or has not) evolved through the years, what mistakes I\u0026rsquo;m still prone to, or which ones I\u0026rsquo;ve overcome, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to start this habit on and off again since basically the early 2000s. This blog is part of that effort, as you can see by the \u003ca href=\"/archives/\"\u003earchives\u003c/a\u003e. (Although, not everything can be logged publicly in a blog.) I really only managed to get into a regular discipline of reviews starting around 2017 though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy current regular reviews/tracking systems:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edaily tracker. This is a custom system I built for myself basically just to log things on a day-to-day basis, with categorization, search and summary metrics and graphs. Most useful for expense and tracking what I eat. This tracker is the reason I have a pretty good idea of where my money is going. (I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are OTS systems that can do this, building your own isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eweekly reviews. For things I\u0026rsquo;ve done throughout the week, any big expenses, etc. Helps me remember when I did things. I used to do this privately, via text files, but last year mostly moved it to regular weekly blog posts called \u003ca href=\"/tags/weeknotes\"\u003eweeknotes\u003c/a\u003e. Having the weekly reviews on the blog gave me a regular public cadence. Most of the things I log in weekly reviews are ok to be public anyway; any private stuff stays in the daily tracker\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emonthly finance checks. This is the review habit I\u0026rsquo;ve had the longest, but it\u0026rsquo;s also evolved a lot along the way. Basically I just go through all my bank accounts and credit cards and billing statements, make sure all transactions for the month check out/are legit, check if there are loans/investments I need to follow up on, make sure all bills are paid, and get a snapshot of what my current financial status is. I can cross check the deltas with the numbers from the daily tracker, to make sure there\u0026rsquo;s not any money I\u0026rsquo;m losing unnecessarily.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eyearly reviews. These are on the blog as \u003ca href=\"/tags/yearnotes\"\u003eyearnotes\u003c/a\u003e. There are entire years of my early career that seem like a blur - I have very little idea what I was up to in those years. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to lose that kind of time again.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to all of that, I\u0026rsquo;ve recently also resumed doing \u003ca href=\"/2019/03/750words/\"\u003e750words\u003c/a\u003e, mainly because the old export files from that service were among the old files I was going through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this might seem overmuch for most people, but I find it works for me. It helps me with my thinking, helps me manage my anxiety, and having the past to scroll through is certainly better than doomscrolling all the time. (There is probably some danger of becoming too obsessed with the past, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s worth it as long as you\u0026rsquo;re aware of the risk.) The past informs the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelated:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2005/10/on-journalling-or-how-hard-it-is-to-keep-up-a-blog/\"\u003eOn Journalling, or How Hard It Is to Keep Up a Blog (2005)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2018/05/logs-and-memories-and-audit-trails/\"\u003eLogs and Memories and Audit Trails (2018)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e(there\u0026rsquo;s probably more.
