The problem is the abundance of these dexterity-based minigames! I thought everything was fine when I did the squats thing, but then later there\u0026rsquo;s a harder pull-ups thing!

A \u003ca href=\"https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@ignaloidas\"\u003ehelpful person\u003c/a\u003e provided me one via Mastodon. It\u0026rsquo;s an interesting site, basically an invite-only reddit-like site, mostly focused on tech stuff, so in theory the discussion quality should be fairly high. The chain of invites is public too, each user\u0026rsquo;s profile shows you who invited him, so in that way it\u0026rsquo;s kind of similar to a certificate chain of trust? We\u0026rsquo;ll see if this scales up well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI enjoyed this \u003ca href=\"https://mxb.dev/blog/the-return-of-the-90s-web/\"\u003erecent article about the 90s web\u003c/a\u003e.

Nothing major, just a consult that had been put off due to all of this. Before letting us into the hospital, there were the usual temperature checks, but they also had us fill up a form with name, address and contact details, I assume for contact tracing purposes. We waited for a couple of hours in the doctor\u0026rsquo;s queue (my mom was only there to get a referral, which in itself only took like 5 minutes). The hospital was mostly empty, we didn\u0026rsquo;t see any actual sick patients in most of the waiting areas I think. Seating was limited - they had blocked off the seat rows such that only 2 out of every 4 seats was usable. I was super anxious about touching anything, and probably used hand sanitizer at least 5 times during the visit. Their canteen was open, I only went in to get some water while waiting.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWatched mass via Facebook again today.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGCQ in Metro Manila was supposedly only up to the 15th. It\u0026rsquo;s the 14th, and we still don\u0026rsquo;t know what happens after that. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure the IATF has already announced their recommendations. There are rumors going around that we may get sent back to ECQ. Some authorities are saying limited restaurant dine-in will be available this week. In spite of this, my mom already scheduled some tests at the hospital, a result of the referral consult I mentioned earlier.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAs of last night, we are at 25293 cases (+607 from the day before, +4052 from last week), 1074 deaths (+22 from the day before, +80 from last week), 5706 recoveries (+252 from the day before, +1265 last week). Jumps slightly lower than last week, except for recoveries which are about the same, so that\u0026rsquo;s good news.

(Maybe 1 in 10 weren\u0026rsquo;t wearing their masks correctly though.). I went into the nearby Jollibee to see what it was like. Not as many people inside, and the guard took my temp told me to stand aside before later motioning me to get into a particular queue. The queues are spaced (should have taken pictures), and there\u0026rsquo;s tables in front of the cashiers to keep you from getting too close.

Basically an explosion in confirmed cases; over 50% jump from last week. Large jumps in deaths and recoveries too, thought not as alarmingly large as the cases. Regardless of the DoH\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;tardy\u0026rdquo; / \u0026ldquo;fresh\u0026rdquo; massaging of the data, it looks bad, and the explosion in cases kind of aligns with the last days of the ECQ.

The virus is still around, but both the US and my own country have gotten distracted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe US is in its second week of police brutality/black lives matters protests. Meanwhile, our government took on a sidequest of trying to enact a wide-ranging and easily abusable anti-terror bill, triggering some smaller (by comparison to the US).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven\u0026rsquo;t written about the terror bill, mainly because I haven\u0026rsquo;t had the opportunity to dig into it too deeply.

We don\u0026rsquo;t actually get that many terror attacks pulled off, the last big one was Marawi (which I heard some Congressmen citing, tbf), which was back in 2017. And that was mostly a problem with Islamic militants. I don\u0026rsquo;t hear any of the bill proponents talking about how specifically the limits on govt powers holds them back. How would these added powers prevent another Marawi? Did they actually have intel leading up to the Marawi siege that they couldn\u0026rsquo;t act on due to limited powers? I find this difficult to believe because\u0026hellip;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewhat about the authorities\u0026rsquo; history of impunity? It\u0026rsquo;s hard to believe that they are being restricted by the law in anti-terror activities when they don\u0026rsquo;t seem to let the law get in the way for much lesser things. I guess this is the crux of the issue for most people, one of trust. Even if you say there are safeguards in the law, they are still easily abusable. The bill extends the detention period for terror suspects to I think is it 30 days, extendable? But given the speed (or lack thereof) of local courts, even if you challenge any violation of the safeguards, the challenge may take longer to resolve than the detention period. Maybe we should consider cleaning up our justice system first?
