According to the table from the original article (\u003ca href=\"https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/highest-income-tax-rates-world-160000035.html),\"\u003ehttps://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/highest-income-tax-rates-world-160000035.html),\u003c/a\u003e that\u0026rsquo;s the second lowest tax bracket (200sgd + 3.5% of the excess over 30k sgd). While the 240,000php annual salary is in the third highest bracket for the Philippines, taxed at 20%. Obviously Singapore has a lower tax rate than we do, but it seems a bit disingenuous to be comparing one of the lowest brackets with one of the highest. The highest tax brackets are 20% for Singapore and 32% for the Philippines\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe comparison was a bit exaggerated, but that\u0026rsquo;s fine. Singapore tax rates are lower. How much money do they collect? According to \u003ca href=\"http://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2015/RevenueandExpenditure.aspx,\"\u003ehttp://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2015/RevenueandExpenditure.aspx,\u003c/a\u003e it was some 61B SGD (around 2T PHP) in 2014. For a population of 5.67M, it comes out to roughly 11K SGD (362k PHP) per capita. Roughly 36% of that was corporate and personal income tax (which I assume are the ones levied as a portion of income)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the Philippines, revenue was at 1332B PHP in 2014 (source: \u003ca href=\"http://www.bir.gov.ph/images/bir_files/annual_reports/annual_report_2014/cmtt.html\"\u003ehttp://www.bir.gov.ph/images/bir_files/annual_reports/annual_report_2014/cmtt.html\u003c/a\u003e) for a population of 100M, roughly 13k PHP per capita. Roughly 58% of that was for taxes on net income (which I assume includes both corporate and personal income tax)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo: Singapore has lower tax rates, but they manage to collect almost 3x as much money per citizen somehow, and less of it is from income taxes. As far as I can tell, complaining about the poor quality of service vis-a-vis the tax rate is ridiculous given the PH government has almost 20x as many people to serve and is earning only around 2/3rds the revenue). The Singapore government can afford to provide better services because their citizens earn more money and hence the government earns more money, despite the lower tax rates. Even if we were able to utilize all the govt revenue 100% (with nothing lost to corruption/inefficiency), we\u0026rsquo;d still have only 4% as much to spend on services per capita as compared to the SG government. As pointed out by a friend, SG also has a much smaller area to govern and hence much lower expected expenditures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it\u0026rsquo;s not a straightforward \u0026ldquo;we should be getting better services because we have a higher tax rate!\u0026rdquo;. We still need to build up our economy so that we can support lower tax rates without giving up too much in social services. At the very least, comparing ourselves with Singapore is an apples and oranges type of deal\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It\u0026rsquo;s a huge book, and the first half took me more or less three weeks to slog through (I started it in late December), but by the time I got to the middle of the book, a lot of exciting things were happening and my pace improved considerably. I finished the second half of the book in around 2-3 days. The great thing is that the book resolves a lot of the dangling plot lines from Way of Kings, rewarding the reader with serious payoffs for the stories of Kaladin and Dalinar and a deeper look at Shallan\u0026rsquo;s back story. The first half builds up to a second half full of great action sequences that the reader is anticipating. Interspersed with Kaladin and the Kholin family\u0026rsquo;s action is Shallan\u0026rsquo;s back story and her dangerous forays into studies and investigations that dig up even more plot lines left to be resolved for later books. Sanderson\u0026rsquo;s world-building is again top notch as he introduces us into new exotic locales in this world and constructs an interesting mythology around the spren and the Parshendi. The book ends on a satisfying note at the same time leaving some threads hanging and the greater plot looming on the horizon. It\u0026rsquo;s too bad the next book isn\u0026rsquo;t scheduled until 2017\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/18436248-roy-tang\"\u003eView all my reviews\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Quality is decent (not sure how to tell what the resolution is, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter to me) The selection is as expected, kind of limited. Strangely, there is no House of Cards. Works with our Chromecast!  Edit: All the other Netflix shows (aside from HoC) seem to be there. A number of shows I binged while I was in UK (The Office, Fringe, House MD, Fairy Tail) are not there. There are less movies than I would have expected (mukhang malayo pa sa US), but they seem to have all the Batmans for some reason. I suggest people take the free trial first to see if they like the content offered, though I suppose they will try to add more later.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
