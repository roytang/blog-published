One of the games I\u0026rsquo;d been meaning to play for a while now was Zero Time Dilemma, the third game in the Nonary Games trilogy. I\u0026rsquo;ve only previously played the 2nd game in the series, Virtue\u0026rsquo;s Last Reward, which is a bit appropriate given how the events in these games often unfold nonlinearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"#eec3f3dcaf74c2aba71bfe2db6d3e39e-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2019/03/zero-time-dilemma/ztd-phi_hu2d16a9ba67469bfb9806d424cff0a232_107631_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"eec3f3dcaf74c2aba71bfe2db6d3e39e-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2019/03/zero-time-dilemma/ztd-phi.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"20 Mar 2019 5:56am\"\u003e20 Mar 2019 5:56am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZTD is pretty good, but the story is understandably complex, given how it builds off a series of games that already involved espers and time travel and multiple timelines and cults and world pandemics and so on. It didn\u0026rsquo;t help that it\u0026rsquo;s been 4-5 years since I played VLR, and that game already had an overly complex plot so I can barely remember the details from that game as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile it\u0026rsquo;s a story-based series, the gameplay largely consists of two parts: (a) escape rooms; and (b) decision-making. The escape rooms part are entertaining enough, nothing too difficult, but satisfying enough to solve everything. The decision-making part is used to unlock branching timelines, and the path to the \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; endings is determined by your ability to find the correct decisions to unlock the correct events. Not all decisions are binary or multiple-choice; some of the more important ones require text or numeric input, making it impossible to guess them. At multiple points, you will need to reference information learned from other branches of history (don\u0026rsquo;t worry, there is a story reason for why this happens).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTook me a couple of weeks of playing sporadically to finish the game. I enjoyed the game enough to spend a couple of late nights to finish it once I got really going. I will shamefully admit I did get stuck in one place and in my impatience I googled my way past it.

I have a good grasp of communication skills and think I have a decent chance of writing good copy. My main issue is that I\u0026rsquo;ve been exposed many times to sales/marketing practices that just seem dishonest downright or scummy. This happens both with me as a customer and with me on the side of the company trying to do the sales/marketing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn example in the software engineering sphere would be a developer writing project proposals in response to tenders, and he is asked to write a technical response confirming that their product supports a particular tender requirement. Except he knows for a fact that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t, and when he raises this concern, he\u0026rsquo;s told not to worry about and that they\u0026rsquo;ll just implement the feature if/when they win the contract. And apparently that\u0026rsquo;s a regular practice in some companies. Disclaimer: I\u0026rsquo;m not saying I have been personally involved in such a situation, but I do know such situations exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand the motivation from the sales side, but not only is that intellectually dishonest (to say the least), it also puts your engineering teams in a bind should the project push through - you now committed them to do an extra feature without proper estimation or scheduling and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me it\u0026rsquo;s okay to sell something by promoting its strengths and advantages, but not by being dishonest about its capabilities or weaknesses. I suspect that this cripples me a bit in the real world where people with less scruples are more willing to bend the truth to make money. But for me personally, honesty and integrity are more important than making more sales.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

That\u0026rsquo;s around a 9.375% deficit. Given that, why would it be necessary for a large number of areas (I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if there are even unaffected MW service areas) to have service interruptions for majority of the hours of the day? (Over here, I think we get like very weak water pressure a couple of hours a day and that\u0026rsquo;s it). Obviously they can\u0026rsquo;t just cut 9.375% of the hours, they need to add some buffer, that\u0026rsquo;s fine. And households would of course compensate for reduced hours by consuming more during the time they do have water. But why so extreme, so immediately? At worst I would have expected that they cut service hours by at most 50% (so households have water during half the day), then if that\u0026rsquo;s not enough come out with an advisory saying \u0026ldquo;okay, we\u0026rsquo;re still consuming too much water, we need to cut more hours\u0026rdquo;. As it is, their announced service interruption hours are highly inaccurate, so it seems they can\u0026rsquo;t even predict what\u0026rsquo;s going to happen with their service. Conspiracy theories aside, I prefer to attribute all of the issues to sheer incompetence first, but is there something I\u0026rsquo;m missing here, some kind of engineering reason or what, for the service interruptions to be so widespread and unpredictable?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIf I could give some advice to someone starting out in their software development career, it would be this: Don\u0026rsquo;t stay in the same place too long. The first company I worked at, I stayed with them for thirteen years, which I now feel was way too long. I have to admit, the work was hard and challenging, but I was young and had a lot of energy and was willing to work the long hours. I was good at the work and the enjoyed the company of the people I worked with so in a certain sense I got comfortable with the status quo and stayed a bit too long. But given a do-over, I would probably prefer to have left after maybe 4-5 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopping jobs too quickly can be fantastic for your salary growth, but it has some disadvantages - you don\u0026rsquo;t build close enough relationships, and too many hops doesn\u0026rsquo;t look good on your resume. Four to five years seems like a good period to stay, long enough to learn as much as you can and build your network before moving on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main advantage of not staying too long comes in the form of personal growth. When you stay at a place too long you tend to stagnate. Sure, it\u0026rsquo;s software development so somehow you\u0026rsquo;re always improving, but not improving as quickly as you would be if you were to be thrust into a new environment every few years. Your personal network of like-minded professionals will grow quicker as well when you switch companies. I was thinking about this because I was recently asked if I could refer any senior developers and I realized my personal network of high-level senior technical guys wasn\u0026rsquo;t that deep because of me staying in the same place for so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t consider this a \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/choose-without-regret-and-the-fear-of-missing-out/\"\u003eregret\u003c/a\u003e, I\u0026rsquo;m still pretty happy and satisfied with where I am in life. Thinking about this is more of an alternate universe \u0026ldquo;what if\u0026rdquo; scenario. I have to admit that staying that long did have some advantages - I got to work with and meet some good people, younger ones even, who became good friends. But this is not an argument in favor of staying that long, as you would still have the chance to build relationships even if you move on. It\u0026rsquo;s possible in that alternate universe I may have made even better friends or may have even been friends with the same ones I have now somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, given a chance to give advice to my younger self, I would probably recommend the second path. There is more uncertainty there to be sure, but life is risk, and to live is to explore. Taking the change to move to a new environment optimizes for personal growth, and it\u0026rsquo;s probably better to be doing it when you are young and full of energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
