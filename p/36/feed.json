But it\u0026rsquo;s probably better if my naps were predictable, like say, a quick nap after lunch (when I\u0026rsquo;m likely to be sleepy anyway), instead of the irregular schedule I have now which messes up my sleep cycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe common advice for fixing a sleep cycle is to have a regular time of the day when you go to bed and sleep, so that your body gets used to sleeping at this time. This has proven\u0026hellip; difficult for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I really need to find the discipline to establish a regular routine, with scheduled naps throughout the day if needed. Routines have a few benefits:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eit makes it easier to \u003ca href=\"/2019/01/form-good-habits-and-become-their-slave/\"\u003eestablish new habits\u003c/a\u003e if they\u0026rsquo;re incorporated into a routine. I noticed this with my \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/duolingo/\"\u003eDuolingo lessons\u003c/a\u003e, the past few weeks I\u0026rsquo;ve always been doing them right after breakfast, still sitting at the table. I bring my iPad with me during breakfast for reading the news, so it\u0026rsquo;s easy to transition into the Duolingo app. Doing it a regular time and so early day makes it a lot less likely that I \u003ca href=\"/2019/01/broken-streaks/\"\u003ebreak the streak\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eit reduces the amount of decisions you need to make during the day, and can also reduce procrastination. For example, if I allocated certain hours of the day to be \u0026ldquo;productive hours\u0026rdquo; and some hours to be \u0026ldquo;gaming hours\u0026rdquo; and so on, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to make that decision during the day. And I can\u0026rsquo;t procrastinate on being productive, since I know the rest of my time is already allocated\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehaving a regular rhythm makes it easier to get through difficult days\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main downside of a routine like this is\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s boring! I dislike heavily regimented schedules that are predictably always the same. I mean, that may even be one of the reasons why I\u0026rsquo;m not working full-time anymore. I\u0026rsquo;ll need to think about this some more. A kind of hybrid approach where some time blocks are more flexible might be more feasible for me, or maybe a varying schedule depending on the day. We\u0026rsquo;ll see. But for sure I have to do something!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I haven\u0026rsquo;t done this in a while, taking my \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/daily-walks/\"\u003edaily walk\u003c/a\u003e in the early morning. I used to do it pretty regularly, except back then I confined myself to the inner roads of our subdivision, or doing loops around the covered court in the nearby seminary. Walking the same routes every morning and doing repetitive routes got boring after a while, and combined with my erratic sleep schedule the habit soon fell off the wayside. I resumed my walking habit when I took a break from work in 2016, but this time mostly doing it late in the afternoons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfternoons have been getting more difficult lately, with some busyness in the schedule and the sudden yet inevitable onset of the summer heat, so I decided to try shifting back to mornings again. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how long it lasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking during the early mornings, before the sun has even broken, has a completely different atmosphere than the afternoons or even the evenings. The streets glow a pale blue and are nearly empty, though traffic is already starting to build up at some of the busier intersections. There are few other people out on their feet (as opposed to in cars) this early, enough that I would involuntarily nod when I passed some other early morning walker. I\u0026rsquo;m surprised to find that a nearby Jollibee operated 24 hours, and that the nearby Starbucks didn\u0026rsquo;t. I assumed it was the other way around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pass by a student on her way to school, with a companion accompanying her as she flags down a jeep. I commiserate with how early students need to get up to go to school in this country. I remember my own childhood when my mom would pick me up and drag me over to the sink to splash my face with water to get me going at five in the morning. Class usually started at seven, but the school bus would pick us up around six or even earlier. Somehow, we may be teaching kids to hate mornings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not one of those \u0026ldquo;not a morning person\u0026rdquo; people. I don\u0026rsquo;t need coffee to get started in the mornings either. I enjoy sleeping in when I can, but I\u0026rsquo;m always willing and able to get up early if I needed to. Combined with my tendency to sleep late into the night, this has led to my terribly erratic sleep schedule. Even as I\u0026rsquo;m walking out on the streets before the break of dawn, I expect myself to be taking a second sleep after getting home and having breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun starts to break through the night as I near the end of my route, a couple of corners away from home. My walk this morning is a bit shorter than my usual target of steps. There are some areas I prefer not to traverse before the light of day, so my options are a bit limited. As I get used to walking in the early mornings again I\u0026rsquo;ll try a few different routes to see if I can increase my steps. In the meantime, I turn the corner and head back home, looking forward to the morning\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003epan de sal\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

They also have stats like how fast you type, or what mood your writing indicates and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was reminded of this service because I found the export files I got from them a while back. More than a year\u0026rsquo;s worth of daily posts, 365 entries apparently according to the site. I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about writing a python script to parse the export files and mass-import the posts into this blog (back filling 2011-2012 when I wasn\u0026rsquo;t blogging much), but there\u0026rsquo;s a few issues with that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003egenerally, the style of entries is more \u0026ldquo;what I was doing this day\u0026rdquo; than the kind of stuff I write now, which can be fine, as it still provides a good window into what was happening with me in the past\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esome entries may contain information I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t normally write in a public post. I may name names, talk about people I\u0026rsquo;m annoyed with, and so on\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eit was not uncommon back then for me to have a mental block and not knowing what to type that often led me to just typing words at random until I either hit the target goal or subconsciously hit upon a topic I\u0026rsquo;d like to talk about\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess the privacy is the real issue. The best option is probably to export them as Hugo drafts, then review each draft one by one before having them go live on the site. I\u0026rsquo;ll add this to the list of small side projects I may never get around to finding time to do (this list may be growing too quickly!)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t figured it out yet, I watch a \u003ca href=\"/tags/watching-lately/\"\u003elot of TV shows\u003c/a\u003e, rarely on TV itself though. I outgrew scheduled television maybe more than a decade ago. I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of this because I was going through some old disks and found burned episodes of stuff like \u003cem\u003eSmallville\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eHeroes\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe Simpsons\u003c/em\u003e, various anime, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose were from the days before streaming though. These days an abundance of content is available online via the streaming services, no need to store all those episodes yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI first tried out Netflix during my three-month London stint back in 2015 (which I now realized I never wrote about). Netflix wasn\u0026rsquo;t available in the PH yet, so I took the opportunity to take a free month trial which led to binge watching of shows like \u003cem\u003eHouse\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe Office\u003c/em\u003e when I had the opportunity to work from home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few months after I got back from the trip, Netflix became available in the PH, January 2016! I initially figured it might not be feasible at all given how terrible the internet here was, but it performed well enough even with our old 4Mbps BayanDSL. The content library was as expected, a lot smaller than the US one was, but it was a pretty good start. It meant a lot of the Netflix original content, including the Marvel shows, were available to me on demand so it was great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people like to use a VPN so they get access to a larger library, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried that. Honestly, there is already so much content in Netflix PH anyway, and if there\u0026rsquo;s any non Netflix content I wanted to watch, there are other ways rather than a VPN. (The old ways still worked of course.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, Netflix is a staple in our household, even my nontechie dad uses it a lot, thanks to the LG smart tv we bought a while back. And the kids section helps entertain the nieces and nephews whenever they\u0026rsquo;re over. For me personally, aside from the old movies and shows I\u0026rsquo;m happy with a lot of the standup content and original shows. I think even with the limited content library, Netflix PH is still pretty good value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot content with Netflix though, I also subbed to Amazon Prime around six months back. Well, back then my primary goal was to get Twitch Prime in order to get some \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/\"\u003eEternal\u003c/a\u003e loot (LOL), Amazon Prime was a nice bonus. I haven\u0026rsquo;t used it too much though. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen the new Jack Ryan series, it was \u003ca href=\"/2018/10/october-2018-watching-lately/\"\u003epretty good\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;ve also watched a few old movies there, and they have a bunch of comedy series I like such as Community, The Office, Parks, etc. I\u0026rsquo;m coming up on six months for my sub though, which means I\u0026rsquo;m about to lose the discounted new subscriber rate. I don\u0026rsquo;t use Amazon Prime nearly as often as I do Netflix, so I\u0026rsquo;m not yet sure whether I should keep it around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s definitely still a lot of holes in the streaming content available locally though - we don\u0026rsquo;t have Hulu for one thing. And the new services like DC Universe and Disney+ probably won\u0026rsquo;t be available here for a while. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping those companies choose to have Netflix distribute internationally in the meantime. For the regular network shows like the Arrowverse shows, I still have to use traditional less legal methods to keep up weekly. Hopefully we\u0026rsquo;re moving towards a future where international viewers have the same legal streaming options available as the Western world does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(I really should cut down on my TV shows though\u0026hellip;)\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "If you haven\u0026rsquo;t figured it out yet, I watch a lot of TV shows, rarely on TV itself though. I outgrew scheduled television maybe more than a decade ago. I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of this because I was going through some old disks and found burned episodes of stuff like Smallville, Heroes, The Simpsons, various anime, and so on.\nThose were from the days before streaming though. These days an abundance of content is available online via the streaming services, no need to store all those episodes yourself.",
