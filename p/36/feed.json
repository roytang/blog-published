Is he required to register as a business? (I assume no.) Is he deduced the 8% withholding tax or the regular income tax?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow is this different from the scenario where you are a consultant working as a contractor for a local (PH) client (say, as a graphic designer or software developer)? Is the consultant considered an employee? Is he required to register as a business?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, I\u0026rsquo;ve worked for a number of clients as a consultant under contract, and they always just withhold the 8% and when I ask if there\u0026rsquo;s anything else I need to do for tax purposes, they never advise me that I need a business permit. Should their accountant been telling them otherwise?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026gt;  Recurring like, you expect to engage in that particular kind of transaction for more than 1 time\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-\u0026gt; does that mean if you are only doing this once, it is not considered recurring? i.e. a client asks me to build an application for them and I receive a one-time payment from them upon delivery and afterwards we no longer have a relationship, in this scenario you do not have to register as a business?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorry for all the follow-ups, I just want to clearly understand the scenarios wherein I would or would not be required to register as a business, because honestly I would like to avoid the bureaucracy as much as possible, hence I prefer not to register as a business if it can be avoided. I understand our duty as citizens to pay the right taxes etc and I would like to make sure I comply with any requirements and I don\u0026rsquo;t mind the withholding tax being deducted from me. But I would prefer to know under what conditions I could structure freelance/consultant work without having to register as a business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBTW, I wanted to say I appreciate your answering these questions. I had been planning to look for an accountant to consult on related matters so this thread really helps.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "title": "Watching Lately: November 2019: Broly, Justice League, Arrowverse, Mandalorian",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eNothing in the cinema this month (going to the cinema is expensive!). I did watch a couple of animated movies this month:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDragonball Super: Broly. I have some vague recollection of watching the original Broly movie, and I believe this one is much better. DBS Broly is a slightly more nuanced character than just \u0026ldquo;random raging monster\u0026rdquo; from the previous non-canon movie. The animation was okay, you could tell the animators were having fun with some of the battle parts. Also, I watched the English dub, and I just realized Goku\u0026rsquo;s voice is super annoying, so I pity the Americans who had to grow up with that voice.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eJustice League vs the Fatal Five. I\u0026rsquo;m still a bit behind on the DC animated stuff. I liked this one because I think it handled Jessica Cruz fairly well, and it got me backreading Justice League Odyssey for more Cruz.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTV-wise, since I got a \u003ca href=\"/2019/11/new-video-card/\"\u003enew video card\u003c/a\u003e and have a second monitor again, side-watching is back on the menu, so I was able to catch up with some of the ongoing series: Modern Family (meh), Simpsons (meh), Rick and Morty (ok so far, only 3 eps in).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught Season 3 of The Toys That Made Us on Netflix. Not as fun as S2 for me since that one had Transformers, and I only have secondary interest at best in the toylines for S4, but some of the stories here were pretty interesting, like they say that the giant robot from Japanese Spider-Man was the one that inspired sentai robots! What! The TMNT ep was also pretty good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArrowverse is still going on (somehow), with their upcoming big-deal Crisis crossover kicking off in mid December. Surprisingly, Arrow itself has been pretty good this season (perhaps because no Felicity? lol), followed by Flash, with Supergirl dead last. I am not fond of Lena\u0026rsquo;s heel turn in Supergirl, I felt like it was a disservice to the character who when introduced was desperate to get out of her brother\u0026rsquo;s shadow. I haven\u0026rsquo;t been watching Batwoman, even though it\u0026rsquo;s part of the crossover, we\u0026rsquo;ll see what happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI managed to watch the first ep of Mandalorian, but haven\u0026rsquo;t had time yet for the most recent eps. It\u0026rsquo;s not the sort of thing I\u0026rsquo;d side-watch, so I have to dedicate time for it. I better do that before the spoilers catch up with me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext month I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCrisis on Infinite Earths\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStar Wars: Rise of the Skywalker\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI bought the Outer Worlds \u003ca href=\"/2019/11/b4op_a_h17a/\"\u003eearlier this month\u003c/a\u003e, mainly because I had been without both my graphics card and my PS4 for a bit and I kind of wanted to play a relatively new game. I got the PS4 version because I hadn\u0026rsquo;t yet replaced my video card at the time and besides, the game was not available on Steam. I guess minor spoilers follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummary: A reasonable Fallout-esque RPG from the makers of Fallout: New Vegas. It\u0026rsquo;s not as expansive or quite as nonlinear as their previous games, but it\u0026rsquo;s pretty serviceable and there\u0026rsquo;s a reasonable amount of stuff to do. A decent purchase, though I chafe at buying games at full $60 price these days lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy notes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esetting is a far future corporate dystopia in a remote human colony. Or at least, a caricature of a corporate dystopia. Your main enemies are evil corporations, which appeals to my recent disdain for capitalism. There are no intelligent alien races to interact with, but plently of wild animals\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe space map shows something like 6-7 inhabited planets in the cluster, but you really only interact with 3-4 of them so that\u0026rsquo;s disappointing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethere are some gorgeous environments on those planets though\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efeels a bit like Fallout, with the general aesthetic hewing closely to Fallout\u0026rsquo;s 40s/50s vibe. Even the loading screens and movie advertisements are throwbacks to monster flicks from that era.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ealso feels a bit like Mass Effect, mainly with you getting a ship and the shuffling between worlds and the companion system\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI would say the companions are not as fleshed out as the Mass Effect ones though. Some of them are a lot less fleshed out than others. One of them is basically just a cleaning robot that you stuck a gun to, and he has no further storyline. Also, tbere is no companion romance option, but completing companion questlines unlocks an extra perk for them (though this isn\u0026rsquo;t clearly indicated when it happens, you have to check their status screen)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePhineas Welles gives a strong Rick Sanchez vibe\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt isn\u0026rsquo;t a true open world, more like a forest of smaller open world areas\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere are a lot of quests to do, at least at the start, and they do a good job of putting the other quests in your path so that you naturally feel like you\u0026rsquo;re running into them. Towards the last third of the game, new quests seem to taper off though\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eActually, by the last third of the game, everything felt a bit same-y. I was definitely less enthused to play towards the end.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCombat especially doesn\u0026rsquo;t have much variation. Either enemies run at you with melee weapons or shoot at you from afar etc. I wish I used a more sniper-rifle style with scoped hunting rifles, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t. There is a version of VATS (which only you can use so somehow its a superpower), but it\u0026rsquo;s more like a bullet time effect to help you aim\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI like the voice acting, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty decent, although as always it\u0026rsquo;s noticeable when multiple NPCs have the same VA\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLoad time between areas can be a bit horrendous, sometimes as long as 1-2 minutes, or does it only feel that way?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt feels like you earn a lot of money, but there isn\u0026rsquo;t really anything to spend it on. There\u0026rsquo;s no reason to buy anything from shops, you\u0026rsquo;ll get more than you ever need just from looting and picking up stuff.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a respec machine on your ship, which is cool, since it means you can commit skill points without too much fear of screwing up. However, I never really felt the need to respec during my run. I did respec after finishing the game to do some achievements though.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLevel cap is 30. I did all the quests I could and I got to the cap before the point of no return, so that was annoying. I even went with nonviolent solutions a lot of the time, so if you were one of those guys who like to kill all the enemies instead, you\u0026rsquo;ll hit the level cap even earlier. You won\u0026rsquo;t be able to max a lot of skills. I like to be a \u0026ldquo;jack of all trades\u0026rdquo; kind of guy, so my skill distribution was fairly spread out and I was only able to max one skill.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFor some reason, the game has a plethora of consumable items. I suspect these are mainly to support the hardest difficulty (supernova), as on normal difficulty there was never any reason to use a consumable other than the standard \u0026ldquo;Heal X HP\u0026rdquo; item.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finished the game yesteday, on normal difficulty. I actually started out on hard, but then, surprise, I had a hard time at the start. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be too stressed so I downgraded to medium for the rest of the run. I got the \u0026ldquo;good ending\u0026rdquo;, that is to say, the one where you \u0026ldquo;defeat\u0026rdquo; the corporate master class, such as they are. Normal difficulty is relatively stress-free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI usually want to go for 100% achievement completion, but this game had one that requires finishing on the highest difficulty, so that\u0026rsquo;s another run altogether. Presumably the second run would be much faster since I don\u0026rsquo;t have to do everything any more. I might get around to it someday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScreenshots follow!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I bought the Outer Worlds earlier this month, mainly because I had been without both my graphics card and my PS4 for a bit and I kind of wanted to play a relatively new game. I got the PS4 version because I hadn\u0026rsquo;t yet replaced my video card at the time and besides, the game was not available on Steam. I guess minor spoilers follow.\nSummary: A reasonable Fallout-esque RPG from the makers of Fallout: New Vegas.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA quick follow-up to something I mentioned in \u003ca href=\"/2019/11/laws-not-men/\"\u003eyesterday\u0026rsquo;s post\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a cultural problem too. Even we the citizens have little respect for rules and laws and try to skip around them when we can. This is why we have fixers, and connections, and patronage. We trade on favors to get us out of trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if needed to be said, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t saying that literally every single person participates in fixing and patronage to get around the rules. Most probably only a minority ever do so. The majority try to just keep their heads down and live their lives, and in doing so, they tolerate those who do participate in such corruption of the rules. This is what I meant, that we as a culture, are too tolerant of such activities, even sometimes praising those who manage to circumvent rules or laws as \u0026ldquo;madiskarte\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTangential story time: Some time ago, I was visiting with people in another area, and the conversation turned to one of the people present who had run for public office (councilor) some years ago, and he was asked why he didn\u0026rsquo;t win. His answer: \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Wala e, mas malakas maglagay yung kalaban.\u0026quot;\u003c/em\u003e  (The opponent was better at bribing voters.) The response elicited laughter from those around. Whether the response was based on fact or merely a speculative joke, the way it is discussed so casually and even among people they barely knew (me) is reflective of how we have normalized corruption in our society. There is no shame associated with it, it is talked about openly as a fact of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to say, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t want to make a scene, I\u0026rsquo;ll just keep quiet and live my life, and I\u0026rsquo;ll be a good citizen and I won\u0026rsquo;t participate in corruption myself,\u0026rdquo; but even if you do so, systemic corruption still affects you. Even if you\u0026rsquo;re an informal worker who doesn\u0026rsquo;t pay taxes; the cost of corruption isn\u0026rsquo;t only in lost taxes, it\u0026rsquo;s in lost public services and opportunities lost to connections and patronage. Normalized corruption also means more rules need to be introduced to rein it in, and more rules means more people want to try to break those rules, leading to some kind of vicious cycle. The increased red tape brought about by corruption even feeds the beast and inconveniences the rest of us who just want to be good citizens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven our current leadership, I had been thinking recently about what an actual good administration would look like. In my view, the point of presidency shouldn\u0026rsquo;t just be to execute the laws, but to provide an example of leadership for the people, in that he/she inspires the people to be better. I don\u0026rsquo;t yet know how it can be done, but for any one president to be able to turn this country around, he needs to be able to inspire the citizenry to not just be good citizens, but to be better than that. A great president will need to understand that the success of his term doesn\u0026rsquo;t depend solely on him and his appointees, but rather on each citizen taking a stand against the normalized corruption in our culture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis might be a bit difficult for a president limited to a six year term, certainly a lot of political will is needed. And not the kind that you \u003ca href=\"/2016/11/10155101341788912/\"\u003esquander on political favors\u003c/a\u003e. A tall order, but we as a country should be better for the trying. Again, maybe someday.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
