            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAfter a much-maligned eighth and final season, HBO\u0026rsquo;s Game of Thrones is done. Unmarked spoilers follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eighth season was so notoriously bad, we got petitions asking for rewrites. Here\u0026rsquo;s how I explained it to a friend after the notorious episode 5:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s not about characters being killed, it\u0026rsquo;s about bad writing because they\u0026rsquo;re cramming. The writers were determined to finish the show in 2 smaller seasons so they\u0026rsquo;re skipping a lot of necessary character development and characters just do stupid things because the plot demands it. The most recent episode (spoilers follow, no apologies) has Dany do something really bad and out of character. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been so bad if they had spent maybe 5-6 episodes building up to it, but there\u0026rsquo;s nothing, she just decided out of nowhere, fuck it, let\u0026rsquo;s do this. The show was already very simplified compared to the books, which had a lot of plot threads and character arcs that never carried over to the show, which is understandable given the volume, and season 8 basically dumbs it down even more so they can hit their target number of episodes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final episode aired today, and I was mostly whelmed. A big meh. It\u0026rsquo;s always challenging to finish in a satisfying manner an epic story with many intersecting character arcs, especially something this popular. You are almost always not going to please everybody. Some endings made sense, some I could see that GRRM was probably planning for all along, some came out of nowhere (Arya the Explorer comes to mind). Like many things about season 8, so much of it feels crammed and unearned. The season might have been better received if they had stretched things out more. As it is, they had to do things like have Tyrion justify Dany\u0026rsquo;s madness in a speech to Jon after the fact, instead of building up to it organically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExperiencing the series as a book reader was interesting, since we knew what was going to happen for basically the first five seasons. I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;m not the only book reader who was excited to see how TV viewers would react to things like the execution of Ned Stark and the Red Wedding. Once the series overtook the books, we then fell into this weird position of having the show spoil the books. Not that we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t still read the books, but the show leaving out certain elements changes their importance in the books. For example, the absence of the Lady Stoneheart and Young Griff in the shows implied those plot threads were actually irrelevant to the show\u0026rsquo;s ultimate ending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I think the poor writing in season 8 makes me look forward to the books more, if only to see if and how GRRM is able to deliver a better and more satisfying ending. I think the ending for the Starks is probably what he had in mind all along (or very close to it); in his initial outline for the entire series, it was always about the Starks. Whether he sticks to that plan or pivots after seeing the reactions to the show, we shall see. I read a \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/dsilvermint/status/1125856091261136896?s=21\"\u003egreat thread on Twitter\u003c/a\u003e describing GRRM as a \u0026ldquo;pantser\u0026rdquo; kind of writer, i.e. he writes by the seat of his pants, letting the characters and events drive the story forward instead of strictly following an outline. It makes for good narrative, but is probably also why he\u0026rsquo;s taking forever to finish. And we hope he will finish! Maybe someday, when the books are done, we eventually get a better and more faithful remake series (cue the \u0026ldquo;Game of Thrones: Brotherhood\u0026rdquo; jokes).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall though, I think history will look kindly on the entire series of Game of Thrones for what it did. It brought epic fantasy to the forefront of pop culture. People talked excitedly about every episode as it came out and speculated about what would happen. Even my dad got into it, even though I often had to explain some bits to him, and he didn\u0026rsquo;t like watching the show without subtitles. They failed to stick the landing, so they don\u0026rsquo;t belong in the same conversation as series like \u003cem\u003eBreaking Bad\u003c/em\u003e, but there were a lot of epic moments and some very good television in those eight seasons, and the show ultimately deserves its places in the cultural zeitgeist. Because of this show, we are getting other epic fantasies as TV series moving forward. I\u0026rsquo;m most looking forward to Amazon\u0026rsquo;s upcoming \u003ca href=\"/2019/05/wheel-of-time-new-spring/\"\u003eWheel of Time\u003c/a\u003e series, hopefully they don\u0026rsquo;t screw it up. (That one would take maybe two decades to finish!)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Even during the time of PNoy, they would have various articles criticizing him. It is the nature of the press to highlight problems and scandals, since this acts as a check on power. I think also the admin supporters have some level of selective bias as well in that they only see or remember those articles critical of the administration. The top article on the \u003ca href=\"https://Rappler.com\"\u003eRappler.com\u003c/a\u003e frontpage right now is \u0026ldquo;Philippines recalls envoys after Canada misses deadline for garbage shipment\u0026rdquo; which is surely positive for the admin.

Oh of course like everybody, I got riled up about Estrada\u0026rsquo;s impeachment trial and \u003ca href=\"/2005/07/gloriagate-now-is-not-the-time/\"\u003eGloria\u0026rsquo;s election scandals\u003c/a\u003e, but back then I didn\u0026rsquo;t have much awareness on who the senators were, what party they were aligned with, who were the senate president or the speaker of the house, etc. Not in-depth as I\u0026rsquo;ve done during the more recent elections. Even back then there was a general sense of how dirty the elections and our politicians were, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t have much outrage in me then. Not yet at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I started \u003ca href=\"/2004/05/halalan-2004/\"\u003ecasting my vote in 2004\u003c/a\u003e, I certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t legal for the prior elections in \u0026lsquo;98 and I don\u0026rsquo;t remember voting in the midterms in \u0026lsquo;01. At first I was like \u0026ldquo;Okay, I cast my vote, that\u0026rsquo;s my civic duty, yay\u0026rdquo; and was done with it, but as time went by awareness started to grow. As the PH internet has matured, information about the candidates became more easily available, and with that came the eventual and repeated disappointment with who our electorate actually gave the victories to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCut to today, and the vicious cycle repeats. Disheartening results that make no rational sense whatsoever. As if elections were ever decided rationally. And so it goes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany are being down on those who express an intention to migrate because of their disappointment. I can\u0026rsquo;t blame those who feel this way. It would be better to stay and fight the good fight of course, but it\u0026rsquo;s never that easy. People can get tired of politics, and I know that\u0026rsquo;s what certain parties would want - to beat us into submission by bludgeoning us with these terrible politicians and their dirty ways - but let people be tired and let people express their frustrations, it\u0026rsquo;s healthier that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes I\u0026rsquo;m envious of those who chose to stay \u0026ldquo;unwoke\u0026rdquo;, that is, unconcerned with modern-day political issues, and just stick to living their daily lives. Like I said, times were simpler then. You only worried about your own problems. You shook your fist at the taxman and the shitty government service but at the end of the day did nothing about it. It\u0026rsquo;s selfish, but it can be understandable. Life is not always easy, and not all are accorded the privilege of worrying about things greater than themselves. All the more reason for us who have that privilege to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am tempted to just step back from it all, back to those simpler times. I\u0026rsquo;ve spent too much energy worrying about this country, let others take over now. I won\u0026rsquo;t be personally affected too much - I\u0026rsquo;m not likely to be killed in a drug bust, I\u0026rsquo;m not one of the poor that his cronies can bully around, I don\u0026rsquo;t lose anything if they let China take our islands, I can survive any economic fallout (probably), I have enough sources of real information even if they choke the press, I have the option of migrating if things get too bad, etc. There is a part of me that is just like \u0026ldquo;bahala na kayo diyan, just let me watch my movies and play my video games in peace!\u0026rdquo; But who am I kidding? The odds that I can stay out of it for long are low, but perhaps a short respite is in order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings were simpler before we were woke. Unfortunately, that\u0026rsquo;s a genie we can\u0026rsquo;t put back in the bottle. Being woke is exhausting. Rest, regroup, recover, and hopefully have the energy to come back and fight again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese rants were brought to you by the letters disappointment and frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "The results are disappointing, but that\u0026rsquo;s only because we expected better. Historically, those who have made it into the Senate did so mostly on name recognition. What does it matter if Diokno had the best resume of all the candidates, if many of the voters did not know who he was? How could he compete against someone who appeared on a hit primetime TV series right up until the start of the campaign period?",

I devoured Eye of the World much more quickly than I expected, finishing the book in less than 3 days.

Sounds familiar. Not only that, but you can even map the characters somewhat:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEmond Field kids -\u0026gt; Hobbits\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMoiraine -\u0026gt; Gandalf\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLan -\u0026gt; Aragorn\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThom -\u0026gt; Okay, LoTR didn\u0026rsquo;t have a bard, but he does take the role of sacrificing himself while the kids run\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s even a location called the Mountains of Dhoom, which is a riduclous name!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that\u0026rsquo;s fine. I remember back when I read this series the first time I didn\u0026rsquo;t have much patience for Jordan\u0026rsquo;s prose where he describes everything in so many words including the food being eaten, the clothes worn, the crowds, the buildings and so on; I was always hungry for the plot so I tended to skim a lot of the background noise. This time I made more of an effort to appreciate the prose and the settings, since I already knew most of the plot. It is not as boring as I feared it would be, and perhaps my imagination is more enriched because of it. The characters certainly look a bit different in my head now than they did before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, the book does take its time. After Shadar Logoth, the party gets split up and it takes them forever to be reunited. It isn\u0026rsquo;t until 85% through the book that everyone gets back together and Moiraine concludes that they have to go visit the titular Eye of the World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Nynaeve and Lan relationship wasn\u0026rsquo;t built up very well either I think. It seems they just were suddenly affectionate near the end, after barely anything more than longing looks and barely any conversations for most of the book. Also, I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to the WoT TV series if only to learn how to properly pronounce \u0026ldquo;Nynaeve\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book ends with a victory for the good guys. Not THE victory, as some of them think, but it is a victory. But it is also a strange place, as Rand discovers what he can do and decides to leave the group for a while. The next book takes them to Ilian for the Great Hunt I believe, and I seem to recall that it may be a long time before the Emond Fielders are together in the same place again. Onwards!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
