            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA post about making a guy \u003ca href=\"https://www.zachleat.com/web/own-my-tweets/\"\u003emaking an archive of his twitter data\u003c/a\u003e made the rounds lately, so I figured I should make my own post about my ongoing efforts in this regard. I mentioned in an \u003ca href=\"/2019/08/ephemeral-social-media/\"\u003eearlier post\u003c/a\u003e that I like being able to use social media to dig through my own history. But as the first link above says, these social media sites can go away since nothing lasts forever. In the spirit of the \u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/own_your_data\"\u003eIndieweb principle to own your data\u003c/a\u003e, for the past few months I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on archiving most of my social media content on my own site. I also intend to cut down on my social media accounts and activities, and having a backup of all the data on my own site helps with that effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRequirements and considerations:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI wanted my content from external sites to appear on this site, not necessarily as a post. I would create new content types as necessary\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePrivacy: I would only import content that I considered okay for public consumption. Actually almost all of my social media accounts are fully public, except for Facebook, where I restrict access because I use it to post pictures of family. More on this when I talk about importing from facebook.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eComments and reactions: Ideally I would be able to preserve comments and reactions to my content as well (tweet replies/likes, fb comments/reacts, quora comments, etc), but that kind of runs afoul of the privacy requirement, since technically those commenters did not consent to me publishing their comments on my own site. I decided to be more conservative with this regard. Also it would have required a massive effort, since most of the backup data exports did not include third party comments. Only selected comments from certain sources are included in this site.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSyndication links: As much as possible, I wanted to retain links to where an entry originally existed. Many of my older entries have been cross-posted across different social media platforms, so they will have multiple syndication links.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother question is if I were to import content from Twitter, Facebook, etc, how would they appear on the blog? Would they be imported as posts and it will all be one giant mess, etc? I decided to maintain my traditional blog posts as the primary focus of the site, and the content from social media would largely be confined to some new sections (these are meant to map to \u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/posts#Types_of_Posts\"\u003eIndiweb post types\u003c/a\u003e):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/notes/\"\u003enotes\u003c/a\u003e: microblog-like status updates\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/photos/\"\u003ephotos\u003c/a\u003e: photos, sketches, screenshots, and definitely memes. Basically anything with an image\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/links/\"\u003elinks\u003c/a\u003e: links and bookmarks shared from various places\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/replies/\"\u003ereplies\u003c/a\u003e: replies to content on other sites. This is mostly just twitter replies at the moment.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/reposts/\"\u003ereposts\u003c/a\u003e: reposts/shares of content on other sites. This would include twitter retweets and tumblr reblogs.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also wanted two types of home page: one is the more traditional homepage listing only the most recent posts, while another would be a firehose of all posts+the above content, currently \u003ca href=\"/stream/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. Unfortunately, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t (yet) figure out how to paginate this page with Hugo, as the pagination support is limited to the homepage and listing pages and not to custom pages. Maybe someday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically, I wrote a hodgepodge of different python scripts to import data from various social media sources into this hugo blog. It has been a huge effort, and frankly the sort of thing I only expect someone as insane as me would do. The scripts are \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/roytang/blog/tree/master/utils/importers\"\u003eavailable on this blog\u0026rsquo;s own repo\u003c/a\u003e, but they are not portable at all and highly specific to my use cases and require certain temp files I keep around on my local filesystem that are unavailable in the repo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome technical challenges I encountered:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLink rot. As much as possible I wanted to preserve the intent of the original items. This meant following and resolving link shorteners so that the original URL would be preserved in the archive here (instead of say, the t.co URL twitter uses or bit.ly that twitter used to use). But those shorteners didn\u0026rsquo;t always resolve to the same URL as they did before. Some sites have changed their structure so that the original URLs are no longer available and they just redirect to their homepage, etc. Some sites like imgur deleted old images from when they were starting out (they no longer delete any images as of now), so their links would resolve to something like \u0026ldquo;imgur.com/removed\u0026rdquo;. Some URL shortener services are no longer around (like ping.fm), so for those entries crossposted using ping.fm, the contexts are forever lost. Some reposts What is archived here now represents a \u0026ldquo;best effort\u0026rdquo; at trying to reconstruct the original content as it was.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePermalink scheme. Given the link rot issue above, I needed to make sure I chose a reasonable permalink solution for the new content types, since I would want to avoid changing the permalinks in the future.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDeduplication. Since I had a lost of content cross-posted across different social media sites, I had to do some amount of duplicate detection. i.e. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want the same content to be posted under two separate entries, one from twitter and one from tumblr. This involved some rudimentary matching based on content and date posted. The matching was challenging since the date posted wouldn\u0026rsquo;t always be consistent across platforms\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHugo performance and limitations. With all this data imported, the number of content pages shot up from around 1000+ to roughly 15,000+, pushing the Hugo static generation to its limits. Generation time shot up from \u0026lt; 10 seconds to \u0026lt; 2 minutes. For a while, it was even reaching as long as 5-10 minutes, forcing me to do some template optimization to keep the performance reasonable. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how much further I could optimize my templates; I tried switching to some other themes to see if they fared any better with this amount of content, but the generation times were generally in the same ballpark. Perhaps I will revisit this again in the future. I\u0026rsquo;m also starting to miss some features of dynamic sites, like the ability to create custom queries, something like \u0026ldquo;list all replies tagged #mtg\u0026rdquo;, which are proving difficult if not impossible to do with Hugo. There\u0026rsquo;s also that limitation on the homepage pagination I mentioned earlier. I do still like having the entire site be statically generated, perhaps in the future I will explore my options for more versatile lists and searches.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ll also discuss each import source a bit, and the particular challenges each one posed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/quora\"\u003eQuora\u003c/a\u003e: I had already been planning to stop using Quora since I spoke about it \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/quora/\"\u003ein a previous post\u003c/a\u003e. Since Quora has no concept of exporting a backup of your data, importing my Quora posts involved a little bit of JS console sorcery and a little bit of web scraping as well. I imported each answer I had as a post on this site. After this import, I expect to no longer be using Quora. I\u0026rsquo;ve also unsubscribed to all their summary emails. It\u0026rsquo;s too bad, there\u0026rsquo;s often some interesting content there, but more and more it feels like Experts Exchange.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/goodreads\"\u003eGoodreads\u003c/a\u003e: For a while I used to use Goodreads to track my reading and post book reviews. Although Goodreads did provide a data export, it was kind of barebones, and importing required a lot of manual work. Luckily, there weren\u0026rsquo;t that many entries to import. I imported all of the book reviews into this blog as posts, and any further reading I can just talk about on the blog directly. I do not expect to be using Goodreads again.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/plurk\"\u003ePlurk\u003c/a\u003e: Plurk is an old social media site that I used around 2010-2011, mainly because a certain friend group of mine was very active there. Looks like everyone stopped using it around 2012-2013ish though. Their data export was very good, and I was able to import all the plurk content (most of it crossposted from twitter via ping.fm) and I included the plurk comments too. (Those comments were all public anyway.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/tumblr\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e: I\u0026rsquo;ve had the \u003ca href=\"https://tumblr.roytang.net\"\u003etumblr blog\u003c/a\u003e since 2008! I enjoyed using the Tumblr account mainly because there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of memes there and there\u0026rsquo;s content I follow, but I realized a while back I could just follow them via RSS. All my tumblr blog content has been imported either as notes, links or reposts. I don\u0026rsquo;t expect to be using tumblr much moving forward, although I still like it as a syndication endpoint; I may eventually re-enable syndicating my content to tumblr. I also have a second (currently inactive) \u003ca href=\"https://ireadcomicbooks.tumblr.com/\"\u003etumblr blog focused on comics\u003c/a\u003e that I have not yet imported, as the content there is primarily comic book covers and excerpts. I may do so in the future.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/pocket\"\u003ePocket\u003c/a\u003e: I use Pocket mainly for link sharing, so all the stuff from Pocket gets imported as links. I still intend to use Pocket moving forward, and there is an active script that imports new links I\u0026rsquo;ve shared.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/ireadcomicbooks\"\u003eWordpress\u003c/a\u003e: My blog was previously running on Wordpress before migrating to Hugo of course, so no importing of the original posts was necessary. I did, however run a short-lived comic-book focused Wordpress blog (a predecessor of the Tumblr) from 2012-2013 on the ireadcomicbooks.com domain (no longer active). I imported the posts and comments from that old blog into this one.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/youtube\"\u003eYoutube\u003c/a\u003e: I imported a selection of videos uploaded to my Youtube channel, mostly game videos and sketch timelapses. That account also had some videos uploaded by my niece, but those are her content not mine, so they were not migrated into this blog. I expect to still occasionally use Youtube for video uploads (since it\u0026rsquo;s very convenient for general internet sharing), but very sporadically so I don\u0026rsquo;t have any automated migration set up.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/flickr\"\u003eFlickr\u003c/a\u003e: I don\u0026rsquo;t use this much anymore, but I did have a few photos uploaded here, so they are now merged into this site.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/roywantsmeat\"\u003eroywantsmeat\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"/source/royondjango\"\u003eroyondjango\u003c/a\u003e: roywantsmeat was the blogger incarnation of this blog. \u003ca href=\"http://roywantsmeat.blogspot.com/\"\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s still up!\u003c/a\u003e. I mostly did this import to get syndication links since presumably all the posts from that blog had been imported to Wordpress and then to this blog. But that was not true! Apparently there were some missed posts, so some content gets to live again. \u003ca href=\"http://royondjango.blogspot.com/\"\u003eRoy on Django\u003c/a\u003e was a second short-lived blogger blog I had, focused on Python/Django, now the posts from their contain syndication links back to blogger as well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/twitter\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e: Twitter is still my most actively used social media channel, so a whole bunch of tweets have been imported as notes, replies and reposts. A lot of the past content was cross-posted from other sites though. I have a script that actively imports new tweets as notes, replies and reposts. I also had a \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/roy_mtg/\"\u003esecond twitter account dedicated to mtg\u003c/a\u003e, tweets from that account have been imported as well. If you reply or like a tweet that points to one of my blog posts, they are also automatically imported as comments to that post. (This is not retroactive.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/instagram\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e: Instagram was challenging to import. This was actually the first import I attempted. There was a data export, but the problem was it did not provide any way to derive the original instagram URL. For a while I researched on how the instagram slug was derived, thinking maybe it could be algorithmically determined. Eventually I gave up and looked for other means. Since there is currently no public API access, I had to use a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/realsirjoe/instagram-scraper\"\u003escraper library\u003c/a\u003e to get the instagram URLs then used some matching algorithm to combine them with the data export, and voila I was able to import all the entries as photos. I still plan on using Instagram moving forward (primarily for sharing sketches), but currently there is no viable way to automatically import newer entries. I tried using \u003ca href=\"https://ownyourgram.com/\"\u003eOwnYourGram\u003c/a\u003e for a while, but that \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/aaronpk/OwnYourGram/issues/85\"\u003eran into some trouble\u003c/a\u003e after some Instagram changes broke their scraping algorithm, so we\u0026rsquo;re stuck.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/source/facebook\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e: Ah, this was the most challenging import of all. The challenges were (a) first, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want all of my FB content to be publicly available on this blog, so there was a lot of manual vetting/review that had to be done; and (b) Facebook\u0026rsquo;s data export (both JSON and HTML formats) did not make it easy to get the URL for any given post, I had to do some scraping to get the correct URLs; and (c) the data export wasn\u0026rsquo;t even very complete; among other things it didn\u0026rsquo;t include visibility settings (would have helped with the manual review) or the application used to post (would have helped with deduplication); and (d) the data model wasn\u0026rsquo;t straightforward, since a given URL could refer to a post, a photo album, a single photo, etc and some items wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even have a single canonical URL, multiple URLs could be pointing to the same thing. I actually ended up rewriting the import script completely (you can see in github I have an fb2.py) after I\u0026rsquo;d already imported some posts. While I will still be probably using FB moving forward (for sharing family photos mostly), I do not intend to import any further Facebook posts into this blog. (Any content which could be public will be cross-posted elsewhere instead)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you weren\u0026rsquo;t keeping track, moving forward I generally still intend to still be regularly using Twitter, Instagram, and sometimes Youtube, and somehow syndicate that content back to this site. In some future update, I will probably attempt to reverse this. That is, change it so that I post on this site, and the content automatically gets syndicated to Twitter/Instagram/etc as appropriate. This is \u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/POSSE\"\u003eIndieweb POSSE principle\u003c/a\u003e, which makes a lot of sense, assuming I am able to overcome the technological hurdles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now, the archive is available for your perusal.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "A post about making a guy making an archive of his twitter data made the rounds lately, so I figured I should make my own post about my ongoing efforts in this regard. I mentioned in an earlier post that I like being able to use social media to dig through my own history. But as the first link above says, these social media sites can go away since nothing lasts forever.",

Unfortunately, I never did end up using it for anything significant, and every couple of years they have to warn me they\u0026rsquo;re going to delete it, so I figured I\u0026rsquo;d just get the content off of it and let it die. If I ever wanted a wiki again, a markdown-based one powered by Hugo would be much more appropriate anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only significant piece of content I had there was a custom set design for a theoretical second set of Legends block. This was a riff on how Coldsnap was released supposedly the final set in the as-then uncompleted Ice Age block.

It\u0026rsquo;s not what would\u0026rsquo;ve been the best ending for the X-Men series which was really one of the pioneers of the superhero movie revolution (alongside Raimi\u0026rsquo;s Spider-Man), but that\u0026rsquo;s what we got. At least it ended with a big fiery bird explosion in the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also watched Part 7 of \u003cstrong\u003eThe Ranch\u003c/strong\u003e on Netflix. The Ranch is one of those weird family comedy/drama shows that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t normally seem to be in my spheres of interest, especially since the show is probably a lot more appealing to conservative/right-wing viewers. (It\u0026rsquo;s often punctuated by country music and the characters regularly criticize Hillary Clinton and mock the idea of climate change.) I will not admit that I got into it mostly because of Elisha Cuthbert. It is a moderately enjoyable show, the kind you don\u0026rsquo;t mind having run in the background while you\u0026rsquo;re doing something else, although it did lose a bit of its comedy punch with the firing/writing off of Danny Masterson (\u0026ldquo;Hyde\u0026rdquo; from the 70s show) last season due to #MeToo issues, and the guy they replaced him with hasn\u0026rsquo;t been super impressive thus far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlow month again this time. The lull should pick up in October once the fall US shows start off. And there\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of movies I want to watch too but some combination of laziness and lack of time always puts them off.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I\u0026rsquo;ve been having an issue where sometimes in some games, my displays (I have two monitors) will die (go completely black), but the game goes on running for a while (I can hear the audio), then after a couple of minutes or so the audio also stops so I can\u0026rsquo;t really do anything except do a hard reboot. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried VNCing into the PC to see what\u0026rsquo;s going on after this time, but it\u0026rsquo;s not accessible over the network so I assume it\u0026rsquo;s dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crashes happen most often while playing Magic Arena (says a lot about the game!), but I\u0026rsquo;ve also had it happen once or twice on Starcraft 2 and Borderlands 2. I don\u0026rsquo;t play very demanding games graphically. I can\u0026rsquo;t identify any specific action that causes the crashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome other things I\u0026rsquo;ve tried:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eattach my 2nd monitor to onboard graphics, keeping the main monitor connected to the vidcard. In this case when the crash happens, the main monitor goes black, while the 2nd monitor still has a display, but is frozen\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eremove my 2nd monitor (I thought I might be overtaxing the graphics card by having two of them??)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003echecking for memory (RAM) issues. I did have some RAM issues a couple of months ago, but that turned up to be due to a dirty connector, and it was causing crashes not just in games but in general Windows usage, so I think this is a different issue now\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003echecking for disk issues. I actually found some bad sectors on my secondary drive and ended up replacing it. But even if I ran everything from my primary (SSD) drive, the graphics crashes still occur\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ereinstalling/updating device drivers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eresetting Windows 10 (yup, I went that far)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all of these, I\u0026rsquo;m still encountering these crashes so I\u0026rsquo;m seriously considering replacing the graphics card now, but I\u0026rsquo;d like the be sure that it\u0026rsquo;s a graphics card issue and not something wonky with the motherboard, as my purchasing decisions will be different if the motherboard was the problem (I might as well get a new PC then).

            "title": "The Climate Strikes Back",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThis past weekend was supposedly some global climate strike, led by young activists. I don\u0026rsquo;t actually know if there was a local counterpart to these activities, as obviously I did not participate. Good for the young though. Between the climate activists and HK protesters, the modern youth still give me some hope for humanity. Anyway, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna step into the melee here and start rambling about things I may or may not be fully informed about, feel free to correct me or tell me I\u0026rsquo;m being an idiot or whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHope to be able to resolve climate change? Not so much. The science is irrefutable, and all signs indicate to us being well past the point of \u0026ldquo;can we stop it?\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;can we mitigate its effects?\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s not that I\u0026rsquo;m pessimistic, but the way the world works lately, it is difficult to be optimistic all of the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did read a couple of interesting twitter threads about it over the weekend. The \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/rcolvile/status/1174957970431496192\"\u003efirst thread\u003c/a\u003e discusses how the current climate activist movement, epitomized by 16-year old Greta Thunberg, is too extremist in their views. I was unable to verify, but one of the examples was that many of the activists reject technological solutions such as carbon recapture and economics/market incentive-based approaches. The perception of some commenters in the thread is even that the movement is a thinly-veiled cover to promote socialistic ideals. And indeed, some \u003ca href=\"https://globalclimateconvergence.org/climate-strike/\"\u003eclimate strike demands\u003c/a\u003e include universal healthcare and education, things largely perceived as socialist policies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second thread discusses why one might be against market-based approaches: there is a sentiment that the current crisis is brought about by markets and industries\u0026rsquo; overreach, so it feels weird to be relying on those very same markets and industries to bail us from our situation, because in a way that would make them \u0026ldquo;heroes\u0026rdquo; and let them \u0026ldquo;get away with\u0026rdquo; the vast damage they have done in the first place. (I wish I could find the link for this second thread, though it is an admittedly lesser point, I am surely not giving it justice.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously not every group has the same demands, and citation needed, etc etc, but the perception of these movements including demands that are ideologically extreme contribute to making it difficult to save the planet. The truth is that everybody, everywhere should be doing anything and everything they can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am largely in agreement that the current climate crisis is brought about by human excess, and can even partly be blamed on runaway capitalism and consumerism. In my head the analogy for this is something like a person who pushes and abuses his body to do all this fun stuff and then the doctor tells him he\u0026rsquo;s dying and he needs to change his lifestyle in order to become healthier, but he\u0026rsquo;s really set in his ways so that\u0026rsquo;s something really hard for him to do, so instead he grasps at straws and follows miracle cures or looks for technological solutions to avoid the lifestlye change.. And that\u0026rsquo;s where we are now, we pretty much abused and extracted as much as we can from the planet to feed our runaway growth and now we\u0026rsquo;re hitting the limits of the ecosystem and the ecosystem is starting to fight back against us like the parasites we are. And while the real solution requires a severe lifestyle change - we have to give up things like meat and airplanes and all that - that\u0026rsquo;s not something we are willing to do. So we grasp at straws and hope that somehow science or economics can save us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a self-proclaimed man of science, I still do think that our best hope of salvation lies in some sort of as-yet-foreseen innovation. But in the meantime, we can\u0026rsquo;t just twiddle our thumbs, we need that lifestyle change anyway, in light of our ever increasing population, if we are to continue to survive in this world. Something about our way of life has to give, in order for it to be sustainable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI say this, though many of the prescribed changes are quite difficult for me as well. I suspect my personal carbon footprint is below average, mainly because I don\u0026rsquo;t travel as much especially compared to the average Metro Manila denizen. I don\u0026rsquo;t drive, and I don\u0026rsquo;t take vehicles except maybe 2 or 3 times a week at most, and I use public transpo when I can and will often opt to walk whenever it\u0026rsquo;s feasible. (I do take plane rides like 2-4 times a year, but I also know people who fly a lot more often than me.) Where I fall short would be giving up meat (or even reducing intake). Since my diet is largely meat, this is mostly a nonstarter for me, so I implore people to eat less meat on my behalf lol. Or at least cows, cows are the worst, or so I heard. I\u0026rsquo;m also pretty bad at conserving power, given that I often leave my computing machines online and idle just for the convenience of not having to boot again. Such is life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes it can feel like my personal effort doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter, because people like me living in third-world countries aren\u0026rsquo;t the most egregious offenders in terms of damage to the climate. We can all do our small parts, but the larger effects can only come from the leading countries of the world, and is here that my doubts about their capability to bring about meaningful change come into play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, we can\u0026rsquo;t fight the planet. If we are living in excess, the planet will find a way to humble us for our excesses. The question is moving forward, how much of our modern lifestyle can survive this crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
