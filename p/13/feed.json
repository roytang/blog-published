I know that\u0026rsquo;s silly since the world won\u0026rsquo;t magically become better when the calendar flips over to January the first, but I think it helps our mental health to have this sort of \u0026ldquo;fresh start\u0026rdquo; mentality, even if it\u0026rsquo;s on an arbitrarily chosen date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe holiday season continues to be weird, thanks to the pandemic. My brothers and I have been trying to hash out how to have the usual holiday gift exchange among the four households. In theory nobody will be coming inside the house, just parking outside and dropping off and picking up gifts, but they need to coordinate since they also need to exchange gifts with each other. They\u0026rsquo;re trying to see if they can synchronize their visits so that the exchanges can happen, we\u0026rsquo;ll see if that works out. Meanwhile, the usual family and extended family reunions will probably happen on Zoom, like many of my friends\u0026rsquo; recent company Christmas parties. Hopefully they go smoothly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of the pandemic and the holiday, cases continue to rise locally. This trend will probably carry on into January as a result of holiday gatherings. In pandemic related government screwups recently:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003erequiring face shields everywhere in public, even for joggers or bikers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea pilot for face to face classes in January because the education secretary says they are more likely to get infected at home anyway\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eapparently we could have had vaccines as early as the first quarter of 2021, but the health secretary dropped the ball during negotiations with pfizer\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGaming\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI guess they were working with some sort of backlog due to the holiday sales, but my local gaming store took an entire week to ship me my copy of Fire Emblem Fates. It finally arrived last Friday so yay! I haven\u0026rsquo;t started playing yet, beyond opening the package and checking that the cartridge works.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInstead this week, I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing a bit of achievement hunting in Civilization VI, since a new patch with balance updates dropped last week. I also tried resuming my Wasteland 2 game. It took me a while to get my bearings, but the game just seems so fiddly, I have a hard time getting into it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMTG: Kaldheim previews started this week! We don\u0026rsquo;t get any more until January though. The metal-themed previews reminded me of \u003ca href=\"/2020/12/1339627168947601408/\"\u003esomething from 10 years ago\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatching Lately:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efinished The Big Bang Theory rewatch, I totally did not almost tear up at Sheldon\u0026rsquo;s speech in the finale. TBBT gets a lot of flak for being terrible, but I think it holds up reasonably well\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ecaught up with Mandalorian and Discovery. Discovery was so-so, but wow, the Mandalorian. What a fantastic season finale. I watched it around half a day after the episode dropped and I was very happy I wasn\u0026rsquo;t spoiled by the internet. The team behind the show are doing a great job with the Star Wars franchise. After the problematic sequel trilogy (which I still enjoyed), maybe the real future of the franchise is on episodic TV. Looking forward to all the new Star Wars content next year.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNew background binge watching: There\u0026rsquo;s new episodes of Jeopardy on Netflix! Not a lot, but more trivia is always fun.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than that, most of my time was again spent on digging through and sorting old files. Additionally, one of my old external hard drives had also started getting errors, so I ordered and got a new 1tb one, and spent some time trying to move old backup files across from the old drive to the new one. It was annoying because I couldn\u0026rsquo;t play any games that use a controller while this was happening, for fear of disturbing the long file transfers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m kind of looking forward to doing my year in review blog post for this strange and accursed year.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Though I was recently reminded of one particular incident that was a bit cringey for me personally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a bit more than 10 years ago I think. I was usually assigned to mentor new hires, which means fresh graduates who usually needed guidance with a Java (which was our primary programming language at that time) and with our in-house web framework, which could be a bit challenging to work with. That means a lot of my days are spent answering questions or guiding newbies through more complicated tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe incident I remember was with one particular newbie. After they completed a particular task, they asked me to check their work and everything was fine. I don\u0026rsquo;t have the actual wording of what I said but recall making an offhand in-jest remark congratulating them on getting an entire thing done with zero questions and no actual issues. I remember thinking almost immediately afterwards that it was a terrible thing to say since it implies that asking questions might be frowned upon. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of like the difference between just saying \u0026ldquo;Good job\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Good job, you didn\u0026rsquo;t screw this one up!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI might have been overthinking it a bit back then as I don\u0026rsquo;t remember any actual negative reaction to that particular remark. That\u0026rsquo;s not really a good metric though, especially when you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with newbies on their first job. There\u0026rsquo;s power dynamics to consider, so they may not think it appropriate to complain even if something makes them feel bad or uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a mentor, it\u0026rsquo;s important to actually encourage the mentees to ask questions when things are unclear or to raise conceerns when there are problems. It\u0026rsquo;s an essential communication skill that all developers (maybe arguably all people) should have. And it\u0026rsquo;s not enough to say \u0026ldquo;Hey, you can ask me questions any time\u0026rdquo;, but you also have to reflect that openness in your actions, your feedback, and your comments.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Sadly, it may be a while before vaccinations get widespread, especially here in the Philippines. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping things clear up by mid next year for us here, but I\u0026rsquo;m not optimistic about it. It would be really sad if the pandemic restrictions reach next year\u0026rsquo;s holiday season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that people here seem to realize there\u0026rsquo;s still a pandemic going on, if pictures coming out of Divisoria are any indication. I get that not everyone has access to online shopping, but are there no other options for holiday gift shopping than walking through such dense crowds? This may be one instance where our generous gift-giving culture is bad for us, since people are still out trying to buy gifts when the pandemic is a perfectly good excuse for scaling back on the shopping. Capitalism ho!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe saddest part of this pandemic for me has that my brothers and their families can\u0026rsquo;t come over to visit, which means my parents don\u0026rsquo;t get to see their grandkids (and I don\u0026rsquo;t get to see the pamangkins). Sometimes we push back a bit on that envelope, but it\u0026rsquo;ll be a while before we all really get to see each other and enjoy company in person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGaming\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI managed to finish Batman Arkham Knight! The main story at least. Achievement completion seems unlikely, given the multiplayer achievements, and even some of the single-player ones seem a bit too challenging. I was able to enjoy the game despite the graphical issues I encountered early on. Lowering the settings helped a lot I think, though things still weren\u0026rsquo;t 100% good. I really take to these style of games where there\u0026rsquo;s an open world and you have a lot of things to collect and such.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI ordered Fire Emblem Fates for the Switch yesterday! I was also considering Paper Mario Origami King, but that had some mixed reviews, so holding off for now.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatching Lately:\u003c/strong\u003e Currently doing a binge re-watch of The Big Bang Theory as my background watching, I\u0026rsquo;m up to season 7 at the moment. I think the show holds up better than some of its contemporaries such as How I Met Your Mother. I know the geek portrayals can be a bit exaggerated or patronizing, so a lot of geeks don\u0026rsquo;t like it, but for me it\u0026rsquo;s fine. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of doing a bad comic book movie marathon sometime this month, covering the ones I didn\u0026rsquo;t bother watching, stuff like Ben Affleck Daredevil, Michael B Jordan Fantastic Four, and the recently released New Mutants.

My niece\u0026rsquo;s birthday was last weekend, so we sent her gifts via Grab delivery instead of being able to get together. Most likely something similar\u0026rsquo;s going to happen for gift exchanges on Christmas. We\u0026rsquo;re still trying to figure out what we can do in the meantime. The extended family has proposed a zoom call on the day of, instead of our traditional annual get-together, I\u0026rsquo;ll let them manage the logistics of that, they have a lot of digital natives to figure it out I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe past couple of weeks I\u0026rsquo;ve made improvements to one of my side projects which is an app I use for personal data tracking. Improvements to that app\u0026rsquo;s feature set meant I could also take the time to do some digital housekeeping. That mostly means digging into a whole bunch old files to process their contents and possibly extract them the tracking app. Also regular maintenance things like backing up what needs backing up, deleting what can be deleted. It feels appropriate as a near-year-end activity to be going through junk from the past. (Although I should get started on going through actual physical junk as well.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGaming\u003c/strong\u003e: In the never-ending quest to defeat the  gaming backlog, I started working on Arkham Origins. I believe I\u0026rsquo;ve had  my Steam copy for years now, well before I finished Arkham Knight, and  never got around to it. It\u0026rsquo;s not a particularly new game, so I figured  my five-year old PC could handle it fine. However I\u0026rsquo;m experiencing graphical  slowdowns, especially when dealing with bug groups of enemies. I\u0026rsquo;ve  already tried turning the graphics down to minimum settings, but still  experiencing some issues. My suspicion is that it may have something to  do with me currently using an AMD graphics card (the game does say it\u0026rsquo;s  optimized for NVidia when starting up). So maybe I should have gotten  around to it before my old GeForce card started having trouble. It\u0026rsquo;s  still mostly tolerable, and I did manage to get through some of the  quick-time event sections despite framerate drops. I\u0026rsquo;ll stick with it a  bit to see if I can crawl my way to the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatching Lately:\u003c/strong\u003e Finished the binge watch of \u003ca href=\"/2020/12/perfect-strangers/\"\u003ePerfect Strangers\u003c/a\u003e, and have caught up with Mandalorian and Discovery. I also blazed through S4 of My Hero Academia. I\u0026rsquo;d read the manga already, so just skipped ahead through the boring parts. I kind of want them to catch up with the current manga arc, as I want to see some of the more recent fights animated, but I guess that\u0026rsquo;s going to take a while. I also started rewatching The Big Bang Theory as my background show of choice, it\u0026rsquo;s aged reasonably well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mentioned recently that I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to write more, and I did manage to churn out one blog post per day last week! Maybe I went overboard? And that says nothing about their quality of course. Still, writing more + going through the past should help me focus my thoughts to help me figure out what I want for the upcoming year (aside from the to-be-expected wish for the end of the pandemic of course.) I\u0026rsquo;m not committed to daily posting, but let\u0026rsquo;s see if I can keep up the writing pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eWhile digging through some old stuff recently I found a copy of the late 80s/early 90s US sitcom \u003cem\u003ePerfect Strangers\u003c/em\u003e and decided to binge through all 8 seasons of it (really more like 6 and a half, since seasons 1 and 8 were an abridged 6 episodes each).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grew up watching this series, on live tv even, before we had cable or Netflix or anything like that. During the binge-watch I remember a good number of the episodes from the first season all the way up to the end of season 7, which implies almost all of it was broadcast on local TV, kind of a rarity I think? Of course, given the primitive nature of broadcast tv (i.e. needing to be there at the time the show is on), a lot of the episodes were new to me too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar, the premise of the show is simple: Balki Bartokomous, an immigrant from the small Mediterannean island-nation of Mypos, comes to America to pursue his dreams and somehow convinces his distant-cousin-that-he-has-never-seen-before Larry Appleton, who himself has just moved to the windy city of Chicago, to take him in and let him live with him. The series largely relies on the contrast between the two leads for its humor: Balki is portrayed as a naive, unassuming foreigner, honest and open and prone to hugging strangers, while \u0026ldquo;Cousin Larry\u0026rdquo; sees himself as this street-wise, savvy guardian who must introduce Balki to the realities of modern American life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it turns out, Larry is actually terribly neurotic, deceptive and manipulative, even to his closest friends. He often gives Balki advice that gets both of them into trouble; he typically overreacts to the situations they find themselves in; he is prone to being taken over by his greed when the opportunity presents itself. And when he does get the two of them into some trouble, his first instinct to try to lie and cheat his way out of the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember enjoying the series a lot when I was young, and have a fond recollection especially of the theme song, which I consider one of the best TV show theme songs of all time:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"\u003e\n  \u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8vbnLYROCj8\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, the show isn\u0026rsquo;t particularly deep, as can easily be seen during a binge-watch. Most episodes will have a plot along the lines of:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBalki says/does something naive\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLarry says \u0026ldquo;Balki, Balki, Balki\u0026rdquo; and gives some advice or some other action that gets them into trouble\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ehijinks ensue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOptionally: Larry overreacts to the hijinks and lies or something getting them into even deeper trouble.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;d say Larry is at fault maybe 80% of the time, though he does have some good/redeeming moments too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe show\u0026rsquo;s overall story arc follow the two cousins as they grow both in terms of careers and relationships; they start out working as clerks in a used furniture store, and later move on to jobs at the presitigious Chicago Chronicle. Along the way, they form relationships with a pair of flight attendants (with decidedely 80s hair) who live in their apartment building, whom they eventually marry and have kids with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat last part is a bit problematic for me, as I feel like Larry\u0026rsquo;s fiancee and eventual wife Jennifer deserves much better; Larry constantly lies to her and have put their group in mortal danger more than once. Although, once they are married, Jennifer does exhibit many of the same neurotic behaviors Larry has, including trying to lie her way out of bad situations, so maybe they deserved each other. I would guess this character arc is largely a product of its time, a time when society (and thus TV shows) focused on values such as building a career and a stable relationship and eventually a family (as opposed to the Friends era, where the characters would often be jumping across relationships constantly.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing I did learn during this binge-watch run (and the accompanying Wikipedia check) is that \u003cem\u003ePerfect Strangers\u003c/em\u003e spawned a spin-off show, \u003cem\u003eFamily Matters\u003c/em\u003e, that went on to be one of the longest-running shows on US tv. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that show ever aired on local tv.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, it was a reasonable binge-watch, good enough for watching in the background while doing other stuff. My nostalgia is not damaged, I never assumed it was a deep show. The best part remains the theme song, which I still somehow feel compelled to sing out loud with each episode.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The plot is standard Mario fare; Bowser kidnaps Peach because he wants to marry her against her will (and apparently there\u0026rsquo;s nothing she can do about it?! You can say no girl!) You visit each kingdom in turn as you chase Bowser across the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach kingdom is a self-contained \u0026ldquo;open world\u0026rdquo; where there are many challenges you can complete to advance the story. Completing challenges earns you Power Moons (the analogue to 64/Galaxy\u0026rsquo;s stars and Sunshine\u0026rsquo;s shines) which ostensibly power your ship, the Odyssey. Examples of the Kingdoms are the Metro Kingdom featuring New Donk City, whose mayor is the girl you rescued from Donkey Kong so long ago; the Woodland Kingdom is populated by flower-growing robots; the residents of the Seaside Kingdom are slugs!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#0e296a63e8c5317e383ba1adf72d06a3-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2020/12/game-review-super-mario-odyssey/new-donk-city_hud58de80b5c48a33903c4e78adf89972c_330126_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"It\u0026#39;s so weird when you\u0026#39;re in this city, as every else has more human proportions\" title=\"It\u0026#39;s so weird when you\u0026#39;re in this city, as every else has more human proportions\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s so weird when you\u0026rsquo;re in this city, as every else has more human proportions (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"0e296a63e8c5317e383ba1adf72d06a3-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2020/12/game-review-super-mario-odyssey/new-donk-city.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s so weird when you\u0026#39;re in this city, as every else has more human proportions\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"2 Dec 2020 12:00am\"\u003e2 Dec 2020 12:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#e484a0deecbc15a71ffd6173d9c64579-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2020/12/game-review-super-mario-odyssey/woodland_hu39148852bfe8193ef55eed0344c3d387_349647_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"This is the woodland kingdom\" title=\"This is the woodland kingdom\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eThis is the woodland kingdom (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"e484a0deecbc15a71ffd6173d9c64579-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2020/12/game-review-super-mario-odyssey/woodland.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThis is the woodland kingdom\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"2 Dec 2020 12:00am\"\u003e2 Dec 2020 12:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#84526be5a48128edac1b70b29da91719-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2020/12/game-review-super-mario-odyssey/beach_hucc1160ff1649688cbfe46fb4ddd33ef0_299952_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Mario wearing a parka at the beach\" title=\"Mario wearing a parka at the beach\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eMario wearing a parka at the beach (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"84526be5a48128edac1b70b29da91719-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2020/12/game-review-super-mario-odyssey/beach.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eMario wearing a parka at the beach\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"2 Dec 2020 12:00am\"\u003e2 Dec 2020 12:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI actually finished the main story after around a week of play.

There are much more difficult platforming challenges involved, and some moons like the Koopa racing ones will require you to master advanced moves and jumps to beat them. There\u0026rsquo;s also a whole lot of minigames to complete, moons hidden using art-based clues, and a whole lot of collectibles (including hats and costumes for Mario) that you can purchase from stores using coins and regional currency that you collect. I played most of the game in handheld mode, but there are some moons that are easier to get using motion controls, which requires you detach the joycons, so that\u0026rsquo;s something I sometimes had to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#afa7f811401cc0b4aa2ed14482ff2296-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2020/12/game-review-super-mario-odyssey/clue_hu5c03d63d75cc02a67f36228a0ae744c9_163462_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"There\u0026#39;s a lot of these weird art clues that you can use to get bonus moons\" title=\"There\u0026#39;s a lot of these weird art clues that you can use to get bonus moons\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot of these weird art clues that you can use to get bonus moons (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"afa7f811401cc0b4aa2ed14482ff2296-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2020/12/game-review-super-mario-odyssey/clue.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#39;s a lot of these weird art clues that you can use to get bonus moons\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"2 Dec 2020 12:00am\"\u003e2 Dec 2020 12:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#8743a48562a1c5ef53ff66112e0af0d2-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2020/12/game-review-super-mario-odyssey/space-koopa_hu5a04ad347ee2589302cf1ada3c228395_130058_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Mario doesn\u0026#39;t need to wear a helmet on the moon, but this Koopa does\" title=\"Mario doesn\u0026#39;t need to wear a helmet on the moon, but this Koopa does\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eMario doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to wear a helmet on the moon, but this Koopa does (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"8743a48562a1c5ef53ff66112e0af0d2-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2020/12/game-review-super-mario-odyssey/space-koopa.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eMario doesn\u0026#39;t need to wear a helmet on the moon, but this Koopa does\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"2 Dec 2020 12:00am\"\u003e2 Dec 2020 12:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#cf3c150025add34858ebdc88dd0872a9-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2020/12/game-review-super-mario-odyssey/hats_hu0fc2897e727a2efd79695b17b87b2564_246730_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Maybe there\u0026#39;s a big Team Fortress fan on the team?\" title=\"Maybe there\u0026#39;s a big Team Fortress fan on the team?\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eMaybe there\u0026rsquo;s a big Team Fortress fan on the team?

Which given an epic fantasy series of this scope might have been a mistake, but watch me do it again for book five. No review meant while reading every so often I\u0026rsquo;d stop and be like \u0026ldquo;Who is this character again, and why is she here?\u0026rdquo; Which is to be expected for this kind of thing, probably if GRRM ever manages to bring out Winds of Winter that\u0026rsquo;ll be a thing again.

The \u003ca href=\"/2016/01/words-of-radiance/\"\u003ereview for the second book Words of Radiance\u003c/a\u003e tells me it took me three weeks to get through it, so I was kind of expecting I might take until 2021 with this one. It only took me a around eight days, with the last third of the book taking me a single read in one long night. So, that says a lot about how good the book is and how the pacing is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a really fun book actually, things are happening, and there\u0026rsquo;s character growth and everything, and I feel like this one touched a lot more on the cosmere stuff. Or maybe I was just notificing more things because no review meant I was reading the wiki more. (Don\u0026rsquo;t worry I managed not to spoil myself!). It\u0026rsquo;s great that Sanderson manages to just put in a lot of stuff and give all of the lead characters significant things to do and character arcs and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s some happenings near the end that turn around some things the characters thought they knew about their history; not as big as the one in Oathbringer, but that\u0026rsquo;s always fun. And some things happen where I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how the next book is going to handle it, so I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to that. (Trying not to be too spoilery here of course!) At Sanderson\u0026rsquo;s rate, it\u0026rsquo;s gonna be at least 3 years before book 5 comes out, and even after that, the series is expected to have a second 5-book arc, plus there\u0026rsquo;s some side books that I feel like I should read because they introduce some relevant characters (Edgedanger, etc) so there\u0026rsquo;s still a lot of Stormlight Archive to look forward to!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I am in general, averse to working during the Christmas season (that is to say, more so than during the entire year in general). Even back when I was working full-time, I\u0026rsquo;d prefer taking most of my leaves during December.

Not so much because of anything stressful or such, but more like there were a bunch of errands to be done. I also did a bunch of maintenance work for some of my smaller side projects (adding questions to the trivia bot, fixing some bugs in this site\u0026rsquo;s code, adding some minor features to some of my tracking stuff, etc.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven\u0026rsquo;t been writing much lately, other than these weeknotes. Lately, I\u0026rsquo;ve also found my thoughts wandering a lot and been having difficulty focusing on anything productive. I can\u0026rsquo;t help but feel these things are related, and that I should be writing more to help me focus and get back into the habit of thinking better.

A new drop in the Civ6 New Frontier pass was released a couple of weeks ago, so I played a few Civ6 games this week to try things out. The new leader/civ (Hammurabi of Babylon) was pretty fun, kind of a unique experience, and I like the Heroes and Legends mode. I actually want to try the other new game modes added by the NFP recently, it\u0026rsquo;s just that Civ games always take so long, so it\u0026rsquo;s hard to fit them in when I have other single-player games I want to play. Steam Autumn sale is currently ongoing, but so far I have taken no damage (though I did let myself get billed for November\u0026rsquo;s humble choice). I kind of wanted to buy a couple of additional Switch games, but I might just start something on my very extensive Steam backlog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBooks:\u003c/strong\u003e I finished \u003cem\u003eRhythm of War\u003c/em\u003e! Fun book, I may write a longer review, as I kind of regret not having a review for the previous book Oathbringer, as I had nothing to go back to as a bit of review before starting on Rhythm of War.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatching Lately:\u003c/strong\u003e I think I\u0026rsquo;ve only been watching more Perfect Strangers this week.

I have 7 moons remaining, and 5 of those are for minigames, and the last 2 are for the super frustrating Breakdown Road stage. All of these probably require a great deal more patience than I have available, so that might be it for me. Still, it was a great ride, and I\u0026rsquo;m proud I can even get this far given I don\u0026rsquo;t consider myself great at platformers nowadays. Still looking around for a new single-player game to dig into, not sure if I want to do another platformer or look for an RPG or such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMagic:\u003c/strong\u003e Still been drafting a bit of \u003ca href=\"/tags/mtgkld/\"\u003eKaladesh Remastered\u003c/a\u003e, although it seems the draft format doesn\u0026rsquo;t like me very much. I\u0026rsquo;ve gone a single 5-3 and three 0-3s, so it\u0026rsquo;s pretty bad! Still, I can keep doing at least one draft a week until Kaldheim comes out next year I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBooks:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cem\u003eRhythm of War\u003c/em\u003e, fourth book in Sanderson\u0026rsquo;s Stormlight Archive came out this past week! I got a Kindle copy off Amazon and have been reading a few chapters every night. I\u0026rsquo;m about a third of the way through I think. The problem with this book is I didn\u0026rsquo;t do a re-read of the previous books (they\u0026rsquo;re pretty long!) so every few chapters I\u0026rsquo;m like \u0026ldquo;Who is this person again and why is she here?\u0026rdquo;. This is a typical problem for epic fantasy series like this, so I\u0026rsquo;ll probably have this same problem if/when GRRM manages to get \u003cem\u003eWinds of Winter\u003c/em\u003e out. (I think these two are the only unfinished fantasy series I\u0026rsquo;m still following.) I will say that Sanderson still writes quite well, and I\u0026rsquo;m hoping this gets me back into the habit of reading regularly again!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatching Lately:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI caught up with the Mandalorian, pleasant surprise to see Katie Sackhoff around, apparently playing a character she voiced in Clone Wars (which I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen).

There\u0026rsquo;s also some family events coming up (my eldest niece\u0026rsquo;s birthday), but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to get excited about those since we can\u0026rsquo;t actually get together.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Howling winds and strong rains dominated for 2-3 days of the week due to typhoon Ulysses. This typhoon wasn\u0026rsquo;t as strong as Rolly a couple of weeks ago, but it seems that it brought a lot more rains, causing flooding and loss of power in a whole lot of places. Metro Manila was hit quite badly, even drawing comparisons to Ondoy back in 2009. Even up to today I\u0026rsquo;m still reading about a ton of people who need assistance, relief or rescue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fortunately got off relatively unscathed. The howling winds and pouring rain meant it was heard to sleep at some point, but we experienced no other bad effects and in fact were a bit more comfortable due to lower temps. Oh, and we still don\u0026rsquo;t have cable service until today, a minor inconvenience. A lot of my friends lost power and some in the more Northern provinces were subject to severe flooding as well. It also took us a couple of days to get in touch with some relatives on the southern side of Luzon, but it seems they are fine, power issues notwithstanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGaming:\u003c/strong\u003e Still playing Super Mario Odyssey, hopefully to completion. Although given how difficult some of these minigames are for me, I\u0026rsquo;m not optimistic. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how close I can get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMagic:\u003c/strong\u003e Kaladesh Remastered is out on Arena! I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten started on a sealed and a draft, you can follow along via the \u003ca href=\"/tags/mtgkld/\"\u003eMTGKLD tag\u003c/a\u003e, if you\u0026rsquo;d like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatching Lately:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe Boys S2: Surprisingly the Boys kind of got a \u0026ldquo;good ending\u0026rdquo; this time, although there are still threats lurking around. I went back and reread the first Omnibus of the comic book after finishing the season, and the differences are really stark, as in the comics Butcher is really portrayed as a bastard, maybe even as much as Homelander, while in the series they\u0026rsquo;re pretty tame by comparison. Somehow a lot of the issues raised in this season feel topical too.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStar Trek Discovery S3: Season isn\u0026rsquo;t done yet, but I went ahead and got this started. It\u0026rsquo;s quite a trip. Discovery is charting an unknown future now in the Star Trek timeline, and there are a lot of fun moments.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eQueen\u0026rsquo;s Gambit: This Netflix limited series has been getting a lot of buzz so I decided to give it a go. It\u0026rsquo;s fairly good, in a sports anime kind of way.  It\u0026rsquo;s a testament to how good and realistic the portrayal of the 1960s chess scene is that for a while I thought it was based on a real-life chess prodigy. Apparently, the show is based on a novel instead, a well-researched one.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMisc:\u003c/strong\u003e In the starting-yet-another-side-project department, I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing around with this library called the Dragonruby Game Toolkit, which I got from the itch.io Racial Justice bundle a while back. I tried building a simple platformer using a Kenney asset pack that I also got from the bundle. Here\u0026rsquo;s the WIP: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDRShB4psyU\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDRShB4psyU\u003c/a\u003e. I like that I can work with the framework using only my text editor (as compared to some big bulky IDE like Unity), and it\u0026rsquo;s fairly quick to start up, as it makes a lot of assumptions for you so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about things like screen resolution, screen coords, fps, etc. I don\u0026rsquo;t doubt that using Unity might have made the platforming physics a bit easier, but I did enjoy figuring things out on my own. Not sure if this is going anywhere, I\u0026rsquo;m mostly just dabbling with it at this point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTrivia:\u003c/strong\u003e we actually won an online quiz this past week!
