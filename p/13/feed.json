Customer support isn\u0026rsquo;t super responsive for local telcos: I called their support line the next day (support line is not even available 24/7!), got put on hold for 45 minutes TWICE before they agreed to send a repair crew over the next day (Friday). Friday morning I got a text that the technician visit was actually scheduled for SATURDAY morning. They arrive Saturday AFTERNOON, due to traffic apparently. And unluckily, they are out of spare modems for the replacement. They promise to come back first thing in the morning SUNDAY. They come back Sunday LUNCHTIME. And I finally have internet back. An annoying experience, and I\u0026rsquo;m also worried that my mobile plan might be charged for the two one-hour calls I had to do to their support line (hopefully I can clear that up), and I\u0026rsquo;m told I can also call them up to ask for a rebate for their days we had no service, but eh, I\u0026rsquo;d have to sit through another long on-hold period!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOne would think that being offline for half a week would lead to some kind of gigantic productivity boost, but no such luck. I still had my mobile internet for my doomscrolling after all.

So I spent a lot of the outage (including my time on hold with tech support) playing through hard mode, already about half-way through. Still not sure I\u0026rsquo;m going to do achievement completion, but we\u0026rsquo;ll see. Hard mode is actually an enjoyable challenge, nothing too insane.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDivinity OS2 inched along slightly as well\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewon my \u003ca href=\"/2020/06/1274581114628108289/\"\u003efirst Trivia Royale\u003c/a\u003e, I can quit now lol.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe internet outage coincided with the start of this week\u0026rsquo;s Steam Summer Sale. There\u0026rsquo;s some games/DLC I\u0026rsquo;m considering buying, but realistically in terms of backlog I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t lol. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if willpower holds out.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe new MTG core set also came out on Magic Arena during the outage.

I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve written about the show before. The whole Harley/Poison Ivy dynamic isn\u0026rsquo;t really for me, but I like the show\u0026rsquo;s take on Gotham and the wider DC universe and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of fun characters like King Shark and Clayface. Also, Riddler was recognizably voiced by Dean Pelton from Community, and that was fun lol.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also did a rewatch of Spider-Man Far From Home on Netflix, before the internet problems and all. Still a pretty good movie, and watching it made me eager to get back to the MCU.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also watched the Sonic the Hedgehog movie while things were offline. The best thing about this is Sonic being recognizably voiced by Ben Schwartz, who apparently \u003ca href=\"https://thesuperheroesnetwork.tumblr.com/post/622121477003739136/supernova-swirls-gothammite-he-really\"\u003evoices everyone blue\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAs soon as my internet came back, I started watching Ghost Fighter/Yu Yu Hakusho, which came out on Netflix (as you guessed it, during the outage)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also tried reading a book.

It doesn\u0026rsquo;t include a lot of content I would like backed up, including:\n comments on my posts (there have been some good conversations with friends over the years I would prefer to preserve) things I\u0026rsquo;ve reposted from other people content of certain groups I\u0026rsquo;m members of (again, mostly for some interesting discussions over the years) pictures posted by other people that I\u0026rsquo;ve been tagged in  For a while I looked around for scraper programs/scripts to this for me, but none really did what I wanted.",

I think I\u0026rsquo;m already in the final chapter.

The problem is the abundance of these dexterity-based minigames! I thought everything was fine when I did the squats thing, but then later there\u0026rsquo;s a harder pull-ups thing!

A \u003ca href=\"https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@ignaloidas\"\u003ehelpful person\u003c/a\u003e provided me one via Mastodon. It\u0026rsquo;s an interesting site, basically an invite-only reddit-like site, mostly focused on tech stuff, so in theory the discussion quality should be fairly high. The chain of invites is public too, each user\u0026rsquo;s profile shows you who invited him, so in that way it\u0026rsquo;s kind of similar to a certificate chain of trust? We\u0026rsquo;ll see if this scales up well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI enjoyed this \u003ca href=\"https://mxb.dev/blog/the-return-of-the-90s-web/\"\u003erecent article about the 90s web\u003c/a\u003e.

Nothing major, just a consult that had been put off due to all of this. Before letting us into the hospital, there were the usual temperature checks, but they also had us fill up a form with name, address and contact details, I assume for contact tracing purposes. We waited for a couple of hours in the doctor\u0026rsquo;s queue (my mom was only there to get a referral, which in itself only took like 5 minutes). The hospital was mostly empty, we didn\u0026rsquo;t see any actual sick patients in most of the waiting areas I think. Seating was limited - they had blocked off the seat rows such that only 2 out of every 4 seats was usable. I was super anxious about touching anything, and probably used hand sanitizer at least 5 times during the visit. Their canteen was open, I only went in to get some water while waiting.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWatched mass via Facebook again today.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGCQ in Metro Manila was supposedly only up to the 15th.

There are rumors going around that we may get sent back to ECQ. Some authorities are saying limited restaurant dine-in will be available this week. In spite of this, my mom already scheduled some tests at the hospital, a result of the referral consult I mentioned earlier.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAs of last night, we are at 25293 cases (+607 from the day before, +4052 from last week), 1074 deaths (+22 from the day before, +80 from last week), 5706 recoveries (+252 from the day before, +1265 last week).

The protestors spaced themselves out and everything.",
