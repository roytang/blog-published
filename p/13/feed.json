Having an open API allows me to cross-post from my site to Twitter every time I write a blog post, and also archive all my tweets from that platform back into my own site. FB API used to be a lot more open as well, but as they continued to flub their personal data management, their API got more and more closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe open API also means services like \u003ca href=\"http://rssbridge.chamallow.com/\"\u003eRSS Bridge\u003c/a\u003e can exist, allowing Twitter feeds to be followed via open formats like RSS/Atom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"twitter-moderation-is-less-evil-than-facebook-moderation\"\u003eTwitter moderation is less evil than Facebook moderation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of them are actually fairly terrible and inconsistent (surely a consequence of operating at that scale without corresponding scaling up of moderation efforts), but at least Twitter is not afraid to at least fact-check Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"twitter-has-better-public-content\"\u003eTwitter has better public content\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlright, this one might be totally subjective or anecdotal based on my own Twitter follows and setup, but I find that public discourse is generally better on Twitter compared to Facebook. It might be due to some of the factors above, and maybe some level of luck/privilege/good filtering on my part. I mean, you can find bad actors and low-quality discussions if you go looking for them, but why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not saying Twitter is perfect. There is certainly a lot of room for improvement, especially technically. But compared to Facebook, I think Twitter is much less of a garbage fire maybe because (a) I don\u0026rsquo;t feel constrained to follow mainly family and friends; Twitter feels more like it can be a window to part of the larger world; and (b) the existence of Tweetdeck and better filtering tools means I don\u0026rsquo;t have to suffer through ads or other such inanity every few posts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: It seems a bit weird to be publishing this right now when the world seems to be on fire. I follow a lot of Americans so a lot of the racism and police brutality-inspired chaos dominates my Twitter timelines at the moment (as can be seen in the Tweetdeck screenshot above). But I think this is also a good illustration of how useful Twitter\u0026rsquo;s filters and options are. If you chose to, (or needed to temporarily, for your sanity maybe?) you can probably block out these events from your timeline completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is certainly a lot of room for improvement especially from the technical side; \u003ca href=\"https://mastodon.technology\"\u003eMastodon\u003c/a\u003e comes to mind as a superior platform in this regard, but that platform doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the scale of Twitter yet, which limits the interesting interactions that can come up. I find a lot of smart and interesting interactions still happen on Twitter, so it\u0026rsquo;s not yet something I\u0026rsquo;m willing to give up.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

This is a fair question; after all, Twitter also makes its money off targetted advertising, can also get you addicted to engagement (likes/RTs), the Twitter app can also be dumb, and there can also be a lot of toxic people on this platform.\nSo here are my reasons for keeping Twitter, and you may also get some tips for improving your twitter experience:",

The tardy ones are the ones that were delayed by 4 or more days due to validation or some other reason.

Basically, many states are responding to protests against police brutality with\u0026hellip; police brutality. Bold move Cotton. I\u0026rsquo;m not an American, but this resonates with me a lot because to see this kind of thing happening in a country that purports to champion human rights, how much worse can it be in a country like ours or a dictatorship like China where they don\u0026rsquo;t even give lip service to the concept? (Spoiler: we already know police brutality and EJKs are a thing in my country.) I give my support to those protesting, and hope they achieve the reforms their country needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne would question why I (and maybe the world) focuses so much on what happens in the USA, given that violence and brutality happen in a lot of other countries too.

I\u0026rsquo;m going to quote a huge chunk of it here:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis follows perfectly from the second definition. The purpose of the law is to protect the rightful rulers, so the law can\u0026rsquo;t – by definition – punish them. And it is \u0026ldquo;mafia logic.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolbo was talking about Michael Gove – a UK Tory Minister – excusing his the Prime Minister\u0026rsquo;s advisor Dominick Cummings repeatedly breaking the quarantine rules that Cummings is responsible for creating and enforcing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it could apply equally well to Trump\u0026rsquo;s pardons for his crooked henchmen, or the legions of Karens who think the cops should come and bust some Black kid\u0026rsquo;s head for selling lemonade without a license, while ignoring their own anti-vax playground quarantine-breaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s pure Blue Lives Matter logic: the law should protect cops from Black people, but not Black people from cops. It should punish Black people who break the law, but protect cops who break the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a meaningful difference between reactionary and progressive, left and right. It\u0026rsquo;s the difference of property rights vs human rights – whether you exact the right to hoard while others starve, or the right not to starve while others hoard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s the difference between pluralism and elitism: whether you think some of us were born to be ruled over, or whether you think we should have a government selected by its people to serve those people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s the difference of equal protections and duties under the law, as opposed to impunity for the powerful and the legalized oppression of the powerless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis resonates with me a lot because \u0026ldquo;equal protections under the law\u0026rdquo; may be a pretty big ask in this country when individual citizens find it difficult to apply judgement equally to both those they support and those they don\u0026rsquo;t. Double standards abound, both for the government and many of the citizens. There are a lot of people in this country who support the people in power blindly because of some form of tribalism; they chose this person so they feel they have to support them no matter what, no matter how incompetent, no matter how blatant the abuses are, and so on. It\u0026rsquo;s a weird case of trying to justify a purchase after the fact, even if it turned out to be horrible, out of some sense of pride, maybe? People hate being wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m reminded of someone I used to know who was an avid supporter of a particular candidate during the 2016 elections. Whenever he would fail to convince us of the merits of his candidate (or be unable to answer our concerns about his human rights record, etc), he would simply say \u0026ldquo;you guys just don\u0026rsquo;t trust him\u0026rdquo;. Which is a really weird thing to say because why trust any politician based on anything other than his track record and what he says or does? It always felt like he had already decided to trust this candidate and that nothing else mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like so many people in this country are so used to our politicians taking advantage of them that they have become hostage to this form of \u0026ldquo;rule\u0026rdquo;: ordinary people are subject to the harshness of the law, while for those in power, the law must be \u0026ldquo;tempered with compassion\u0026rdquo;. Being progressive and believing in pluralism in this country requires that we challenge those norms wherever we can, that we hold the powerful to account, regardless of political affiliation. It can be challenging to get people to look beyond their tribalistic nature, but it\u0026rsquo;s something we need to figure out if we are to survive and evolve as a truly democratic \u0026ldquo;rule of law\u0026rdquo; society and not devolve into some kind of right-wing populist authoritarian \u0026ldquo;rule of men\u0026rdquo; wasteland (if we aren\u0026rsquo;t already there yet).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing back to the Doctorow quote (which I\u0026rsquo;ve already strayed from a bit\u0026hellip; the last few paragraphs turned out a little ranty about the state of the country, but I\u0026rsquo;ve actually already rewritten it a couple of times to be\u0026hellip; less ranty I guess?), this model of how \u0026ldquo;the right\u0026rdquo; thinks can be a useful tool when engaging in debate or discussion with others (something I am less inclined to do these days). The two sides of this model are mostly incompatible, thus when discussing with anyone you can ask yourself (or them directly) which side of that divide they lie on. (I don\u0026rsquo;t imagine anyone would say out loud they believe people in power deserve special treatment, because that sounds absurd. Or evil. But that might just be the leftist perspective in me.) Whether they agree with you or not, at the very least it gives you a model in which to frame further discussion, or even to decide whether further discussion would even be worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisclaimer 1: Doctorow is of course primarily left-leaning, hence his bias towards these definitions. It would be interesting to see what the equivalent definitions would be on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisclaimer 2: Every individual is slightly different. I use \u0026ldquo;the right\u0026rdquo; in quotes here to indicate that the generalizations are describing a significant subset of people who might consider themselves \u0026ldquo;right-wing\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;conservative\u0026rdquo; or whatnot. I use this label more for this particular way of thinking rather than a political alignment. (And I dislike labelling people anyway, as much as possible.)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

GMail was certainly revolutionary when it came out, and had a lot of benefits: it was fast, easily searchable and had a lot of free storage.

One such story came across the Hacker News front page a while back and I can only imagine the nightmare it would be for me to lose access to my Google account. Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve started a conscious effort to slowly but surely decouple myself from my dependencies on Google Services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat meant migrating my online accounts to use another email, primarily one I control. I already had this domain \u003ca href=\"https://roytang.net\"\u003eroytang.net\u003c/a\u003e, so there\u0026rsquo;s no reason to not use emails with that domain. The only risk to using an email on your own domain is that if you forgot to renew your domain, or otherwise lose control, you are screwed. So\u0026hellip; don\u0026rsquo;t let that happen I guess?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only question was what email service provider to use? I\u0026rsquo;m still on Webfaction hosting, and they do provide email accounts, but I\u0026rsquo;m planning to move away from them before the end of the year \u003ca href=\"/2019/03/rip-webfaction/\"\u003edue to the GoDaddy purchase\u003c/a\u003e, so probably best not to be reliant on their email service. If I wanted more control over the risks, I could of course run my own mail servers, but I\u0026rsquo;m not ready to go that far yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first one I tried was \u003ca href=\"https://protonmail.com/\"\u003eProtonMail\u003c/a\u003e because yay, end-to-end encryption! I used it for a couple of months first before paying for anything (using a custom domain email requires a paid plan). Unfortunately, I felt like the additional security wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth the trouble of not being super portable. Accessing via mobile required their app, can\u0026rsquo;t use any generic email client. I also wanted to be able to access via a desktop client like Thunderbird or Mail on the Macbook Air, but that required some sort of SMTP bridge, and it seemed like a bother. Every time I set up a new machine I\u0026rsquo;d need it? I\u0026rsquo;m not super security-conscious, so I decided to keep the protonmail account as a secondary account, in case I did come to a situation where e2e encryption was absolutely critical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI next tried \u003ca href=\"https://www.migadu.com\"\u003emigadu.com\u003c/a\u003e as an email provider, based on \u003ca href=\"https://cmpwn.com/@sir/102452352875414214\"\u003ethis recommendation thread\u003c/a\u003e by Drew Devault over on Mastodon. Their web settings aren\u0026rsquo;t super refined, but everything was relatively easy to setup. And their free tier includes support for custom domains and multiple mailboxes per domain, so that\u0026rsquo;s a big plus. I\u0026rsquo;ve been using them now for a few months and am generally happy with the service. (They did have a short bout of server access issues around the time the covid19 thing started getting around, but they resolved it pretty quickly.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter choosing an email service provider, the next step was setting up emails and shifting over all my online accounts. Migadu\u0026rsquo;s support for unlimited mailboxes meant I could have separate email addresses for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003econtact email for other online accounts\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epublicly accessible contact email on the website\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eprivate email for communication with friends\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eetc\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ended up updating over 50 online accounts to point to the new domain email. Not all in one go, as that\u0026rsquo;s terribly boring, but a few at a time over the course of the last few months. That covers social media services, gaming services, financial services, dev tools, and so on. The upside of all this effort is I got to do a kind of audit of all my online accounts, which ones could be deleted/deactivated, which ones needed new passwords, which ones have poor security measures, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheoretically, I only need to do this once. An advantage to using custom domain emails is that if you\u0026rsquo;re unhappy with your underlying email provider, you can switch to a different one while retaining the same email addresses, no need to update emails in all your other online accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, I had no intention of using webmail anymore, so I ended up installing Thunderbird (it\u0026rsquo;s been a while old friend) for accessing these accounts, and also set up the Mail app on the Macbook Air. For the phone, I installed K-9 mail, although I\u0026rsquo;m having an issue with that currently where it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be doing background syncing of mails. Not a super critical issue, as I mostly don\u0026rsquo;t want to be pinged real-time by email anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m still keeping the GMail account of course, a lot of people still know me by that email address, but now I have a largely reduced footprint and dependency on it. And as mentioned, I\u0026rsquo;m also keeping the ProtonMail account for any security-conscious communications. So I ended up having to manage a lot more email addresses, but hopefully everything will be a bit more organized, with every account having a specific purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA while back I got an export of my Foursquare/Swarm data. If you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar, these were a pair of apps that were used for \u0026ldquo;checking-in\u0026rdquo; to particular locations, with a sort of gamification system where if you checked in at a place often enough, you would earn points and eventually become \u0026ldquo;Mayor\u0026rdquo; of the venue. The idea being that owners of those venues might give some benefits to those who check-in often at those locations (AFAIK, this never really caught on in the Philippines). I wasn\u0026rsquo;t a super active user of Foursquare/Swarm, I had maybe 500ish check-ins from 2010-2017 when I stopped using it. Some people are still using it up to now and have thousands of check-ins, although as far as I can tell it\u0026rsquo;s no longer very popular in the Philippines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I thought having this data would be handy so I put it up as location data on this site. It also gave me an excuse to figure out how to render OpenStreetMap. (The location pages are one of the few pages that have JavaScript on this site.) The \u003ca href=\"/locations/\"\u003elocations page\u003c/a\u003e shows a map of all the visited locations and a listing of the locations grouped by country, and for the Philippines, by city (where available). You can click through to individual locations to see how often I\u0026rsquo;ve checked in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, one of the venues with the most number of check-ins for me is \u003ca href=\"/locations/4d27f36c8292236a41e814bb/\"\u003eBBQ Chicken\u003c/a\u003e, a now-closed Korean-themed BBQ chicken place in Ortigas near where I used to work. Another one with a lot of check-ins would be \u003ca href=\"/locations/4bbbfea5ed7776b032413f51/\"\u003eMurphy\u0026rsquo;s in Makati\u003c/a\u003e where we did a lot of quiz nights from 2011-2013. Obviously, the location data isn\u0026rsquo;t complete and doesn\u0026rsquo;t capture all my visits, since I didn\u0026rsquo;t use Foursquare/Swarm that religiously anyway. I\u0026rsquo;m certain I\u0026rsquo;ve eaten at BBQ Chicken more than the 18 times I checked in!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-about-privacy\"\u003eWhat about privacy?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually telling the internet where you are all the time might seem a bit anathema to the more privacy-conscious modern world, but I do like having a history of where I\u0026rsquo;ve been. I even have location tracking enabled on my phone via Google Maps so that I can have a timeline of where I am on a day-by-day basis. I\u0026rsquo;ve used it more than once to answer queries like \u0026ldquo;do you know if we went to \u003cplace\u003e in \u003cmonth\u003e of last year?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;When did you last go to \u003cstore\u003e ?\u0026rdquo; Obviously it\u0026rsquo;s not for everyone and I fully understand the privacy ramifications of Google having all my location data and feeding the mightly global surveillance capitalism machine, but for me right now it\u0026rsquo;s an acceptable tradeoff. As for the foursquare data, I was using foursquare back when I was less privacy-conscious that I am now, so I my attitude is like, that particular dataset has been out in the world for years, I can\u0026rsquo;t put the toothpaste back in the bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, I did scrub some old check-ins from this data (and the corresponding data on Swarm and on Twitter if it was cross-posted)) that was a bit too close to home. I know this data potentially allows bad guys or assassins or whatnot to figure out where I live, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d at least make it a tiny bit more difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-now\"\u003eWhat now?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is just a neat little thing that probably only I will care about, as it lets me see some of the places I\u0026rsquo;ve been to. And I probably won\u0026rsquo;t be using 4sq/Swarm again, so the dataset probably won\u0026rsquo;t be growing. That being said, I do want to add some future features like grouping the check-ins according to trips, so I can see all the particular places where I went to on particular trips. Many of my trips are missing data though; for example, my only check-in in France was in the airport, and not at any of the touristy places we went to. I may try to supplement this data with selected extracts from my Google Maps location history (hopefully it\u0026rsquo;s easy to figure out!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also don\u0026rsquo;t know where to put the locations page in the menus lol. I\u0026rsquo;ll figure it out sooner or later!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

This despite the NTC earlier promising they can operate provisionally while the franchise renewal is being processed, a change of heart apparently due to a legal opinion by the SolGen. Some thoughts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"bias\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;Bias\u0026rdquo;\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe speaker of the house \u003ca href=\"https://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2020/05/15/cayetano-slams-bias-at-abs-cbn/\"\u003esays\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you are one of the reasons why there are issues with your network. In the eyes of some, there is clear bias and meddling in the elections, which is against the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, IDK what this supposed election meddling is that he\u0026rsquo;s talking about (If they have really done such a thing that is illegal, they can be charged in court, but AFAIK there are no such cases?), but speaking on the issue of \u0026ldquo;bias\u0026rdquo;: we cannot require that a news entity be unbiased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRepeating for emphasis: \u003cstrong\u003ewe cannot require that a news entity be unbiased\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy, you say? It comes back to the nature of bias, and the nature of humans. Every individual human is biased towards certain things, as a result of their experiences growing up. No matter how well-read or well-traveled or well-learned you are, your individual human experience is but a fraction of a fraction of an infinitessimal fraction of the collective human experience. Therefore, you will exhibit bias naturally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrganizations are pretty much the same, since they are composed of biased humans. Any given organization can strive to be less biased by having members with diverse points of view and opinion. And in fact it would be better if our news entities were as unbiased as possible, this would be ideal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we (through the state) cannot require that such entities be unbiased, for the simple reason that determination of bias will itself be tainted by bias. There can be no absolute, objective standard for being unbiased, because who would make that judgement? Who would make the rules? Humans, who are also biased? Imposing such a vague restriction on news entities (\u0026ldquo;you must be unbiased\u0026rdquo;) is tantamount to imposing someone else\u0026rsquo;s will (and bias) upon the entity, and that encroaches upon the freedom of expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can impose specific restrictions on freedoms of expression and the press through law; examples are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edisallowing knowingly publishing falsehoods through libel laws (although this too is problematic, since truth is also not always measurable nor absolute)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edisallowing child pornography\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efalse fire alarms in a crowded theater\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eetc\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe important thing is that specific, measurable things can be disallowed, since presumably these can be evaluated fairly (or as fairly as possible). More dangerous are restrictions that depend upon the whims of those in power, such as commonly found in authoritarian countries like China.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t want to get into the nitty-gritty legalities of it, since I am not a lawyer. But my main point is that like it or not, we can\u0026rsquo;t require news entities to be unbiased. We want them to be as close to that as possible ideally, but we can\u0026rsquo;t require it, because that is not enforceable fairly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout ABS-CBN specifically, I don\u0026rsquo;t even see any bias; I mean, if anything, many of their news anchors and celebrities seem to be supportive of the administration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(You might disagree with me, but that\u0026rsquo;s just your bias, and that\u0026rsquo;s fine.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"press-freedom-access-to-information-and-other-concerns\"\u003ePress Freedom, Access to Information, and other concerns\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people have commented that press freedom still exists in the Philippines despite the ABS-CBN shutdown, citing reasons such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eexistence of other networks\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eABS-CBN still being able to broadcast over digital channels\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epeople still being able to criticize the government\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this is true, that the Philippines does still enjoy some press freedom, undoubtedly:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eany reduction in the diversity of news sources is harmful to democratic society since it reduces access to information\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003enot everyone has access to cable or internet channels through which ABS-CBN programs can still be accessed, thus depriving many people of a source of information (and in some cases the only source of information they had available)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe mere fact that the government, on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/168137-duterte-block-abs-cbn-franchise-renewal\"\u003epresident\u0026rsquo;s whim and vindictiveness\u003c/a\u003e (no one really believes the NTC and the SolGen and even the House are acting independently), has taken the biggest network off the air leads to what is called a \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect\"\u003echilling effect\u003c/a\u003e, basically sending a message to everybody else. If even the biggest network in the country can be taken down, what chance do smaller outfits or independent journalists have?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople have cited other reasons why ABS-CBN should have not been taken down, like the fact that X number of workers would lose their jobs. For me, that\u0026rsquo;s extraneous. Of course we don\u0026rsquo;t want anyone to lose their livelihoods, but that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be necessary to contemplate: on the basis of the harms to democracy and press freedom alone this should not have happened. And especially not during a pandemic, when getting information out to people can be crucial!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand the requirement for Congress to approve broadcast franchises, since broadcast frequencies are a limited resource. But if it were me: the grant of provisional franchise upon expiry would be automatic unless explicitly revoked by Congress with clear violations specified as the cause of revokation. And the grant of franchise should probably explicity specify the conditions upon which the franchise may not be renewed.
