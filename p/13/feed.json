            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to imagine this is already the 3rd week of September, it feels like the month is passing by quickly, although I haven\u0026rsquo;t been particularly busy recently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did do some paid work this past week; not a lot, just filling in to provide some emergency support/consultation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess the reason it feels like the week passed by quickly is that I started a new side project (like many programmers, I am afflicted by the curse of wanting to start too many side projects). This one will probably get finished: I\u0026rsquo;m writing a Django based server for this website. I am generally happy with the current Hugo workflow I use for publishing things here, but the build times have struggled with the sheer number of posts I have. This started back when I decided to \u003ca href=\"/2019/10/archive-of-my-own/\"\u003estart importing my social media activity to this site\u003c/a\u003e, which increased the post count from a couple of thousand to more than twenty thousand now. Even the automated builds take forever, and I can\u0026rsquo;t even run the local Hugo build on my laptop due to too many open files error on Mac. And Hugo is already one of the faster static site generators, so I have doubt that other SSGs would be able to solve this problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI briefly considered moving back to Wordpress, but that seems like a step back. I also briefly considered writing a new backend using a new programming language like Rust, giving me an opportunity to learn something new as well. But I kind of needed to get this done quickly, given that I have a pending server migration within the next couple of months; it\u0026rsquo;s not necessary, but it would be nice to have the new system up in place by the time I do that, so that all the migration happens in one go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am still generally happy with the workflow of writing using my local editor and pushing markdown files to git, so I plan to retain that. The Django webapp will have a database, but that will be a secondary data structure used mainly for indexing and searches. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be some kind of weird file system/database storage, we\u0026rsquo;ll see how that goes. Anyway, probably more details on all that when I am ready to deploy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuff I\u0026rsquo;ve been watching this past week: I finished both seasons of Cobra Kai. The series is decent. I\u0026rsquo;m here mostly for the Karate Kid nostalgia and the Lawrence/LaRusso rivalry. Season two had a lot of high school drama, which I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too interested in, so I liked the first season a lot more. Will still probably watch S3 when it comes out on Netflix. Now to figure out what to watch next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaming this past week:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eZendikar Rising is out on Magic Arena! I\u0026rsquo;ve already played a couple of drafts, but things didn\u0026rsquo;t go as well as I hoped, so now I am poor, will probably be able to draft again in a couple of days. Hopefully I get better at this format, as I\u0026rsquo;ve been planning to draft this set a lot; posts on these should be under \u003ca href=\"/tags/mtgznr/\"\u003ethe mtgznr tag\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edidn\u0026rsquo;t play much else this week other than the regular multiplayer games with the gaming groups SC2, Blood Rage, etc. I have yet to find a new game to knock off the backlog. I have also been considering trying out some of the smaller indie games in my collection, and maybe streaming some let\u0026rsquo;s play/reviews for them, as a bit of support for indie game devs.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethis week was the much awaited PS5 announcement, with pricing and release dates and everything! The $499 price tag is reasonable, but I probably won\u0026rsquo;t be getting one on launch, since there\u0026rsquo;s not a lot of games I want immediately. I will admit to getting a bit excited at the FF16 reveal, but that\u0026rsquo;s probably a ways off. I\u0026rsquo;m probably more likely to get a Switch first.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrivia team put up a new chaotic video of \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U52L9c2kB8M\"\u003eus playing some trivia\u003c/a\u003e. Check it out, like, subscribe, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig news from the other side of the pacific is that US SC Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has died. \u0026ldquo;No no no\u0026rdquo; was trending on Twitter for a little bit, and a lot of people on my timeline were swearing. I had a short discussion with some friends living on the west coast about it. Many of my US friends also have some level of anxiety/worry about what\u0026rsquo;s going to happen during/after their elections. It\u0026rsquo;s actually annoying how informed I am about US politics, although it doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect me directly. Like it or not though, the US further sliding into single-party autocracy will likely be bad for the rest of the world, so let\u0026rsquo;s all hope they get their shit together.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Not so much with work, though there was a bit of that due to a required emergency software change (aren\u0026rsquo;t they always emergencies?). I wasn\u0026rsquo;t doing the emergency work myself, more like consulting and advising how to approach it, so not much to tell there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did quite a bit of work on my personal data processes/backups/workflows. It involved streamlining my backups, dedepulication, going through old records and cleaning them up, and so on. Some combination of Python scripts and manual work was required. One specific thing I did was to get a whole bunch of my old photos out of Google Photos and onto disk backups, and also had to do some deduplication there. I was able to remove around 1300 duplicates from over 12000 photos, so around 10% ish duplication rate, not too bad. My original intent was to remove them from Google Photos, dedupe, then add them back, but now I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure I need to add them back. The main advantage of Google Photos has been that they make the photos more searchable, but I don\u0026rsquo;t seem to have an urgent need for that anyway, and probably there are other ways to do that? I guess I\u0026rsquo;ll look into it when the time comes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have also been browsing some old (physical) albums stored around the house. There\u0026rsquo;s another few thousand photos there, I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of eventually digitizing them, as a means of backup, but that\u0026rsquo;s a lot of work, so maybe in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaming was good again this week. I finished \u003ca href=\"/2020/09/uncharted4/\"\u003eUncharted 4\u003c/a\u003e! I guess any week where I manage to tick something off the backlog is a good week. Last weekend I mentioned I was near the end, that was so untrue lol. Turned out more than half the game was still to come. My SC2 buddies and I started to play this 3-player coop version of the Wings of Liberty campaign (avaiable as custom arcade things), that\u0026rsquo;s been fun. Then the usual stuff: Blood Rage with the Saturday group. Quiz nights/codenames with the trivia team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kind of want to get into SFV again, presumably there\u0026rsquo;s a flood of new players coming in recently since it was free on PS+ this past month, so hopefully it won\u0026rsquo;t be so hard to find matches this time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy desire for a Nintendo Switch is being tempered by two things at the moment:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003erumors of a new, upgraded Switch coming out next year. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the first time that I\u0026rsquo;ve purchased a console just before it\u0026rsquo;s successor came out though.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efrustration at the difficulty of the special stages in Super Mario 3D Land lol. It\u0026rsquo;s a stark reminder that I\u0026rsquo;m getting old and I\u0026rsquo;m not as good at these games as I used to be.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring this week, I binged four seasons of Superstore. It\u0026rsquo;s a reasonable enough ensemble comedy, though it\u0026rsquo;s no Brooklyn Nine Nine. A lot of the characters\u0026rsquo; problems are of their own making due to selfishness, that\u0026rsquo;s always annoying. But it\u0026rsquo;s good enough for side-watching while I\u0026rsquo;m doing other things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also started watching Cobra Kai, not even halfway through the first season yet. It\u0026rsquo;s slightly painful, since it casts Johnny Lawrence as the POV character/protagonist, and he\u0026rsquo;s kind of a loser asshole, but we\u0026rsquo;ll see how it goes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy desktop PC seems to be showing it\u0026rsquo;s age. It\u0026rsquo;s like recently I\u0026rsquo;ve been hitting 100% CPU and/or RAM much more often. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried uninstalling some unneeded software, hopefully that helps. I got this PC back in 2015, so it\u0026rsquo;s not unreasonable that I might need an upgrade soon, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I want to spend that money yet. I\u0026rsquo;m kind of hoping it can still hold on for a few years still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSame thoughts for the rest of the world, I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI finished Uncharted 4: A Thief\u0026rsquo;s End yesterday, and I felt like making a post about it, since I had a bunch of screenshots. Late game review because the game came out in 2016. I think I got it from PS+? Certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t pay for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI first played the original Uncharted trilogy back in 2010-2011, but I found out just now while writing this post that I never finished Uncharted 3 (started yes, apparently), so that explains why some story elements seemed unfamiliar in the 4th game. (I think I may have also gotten the trilogy remaster via PS+, so maybe I should play the 3rd game too? Maybe.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI actually have to thank the Uncharted series for getting my into this kind of single player adventure game in the first place. After Uncharted, I played some kinda similar games like Infamous, Tomb Raider etc, I was never that into the genre before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy main complaint with the series is the sheer suspension of disbelief it requires to imagine a person like Nathan Drake could exist: basically a human at peak physical ability, able to fearlessly leap off high cliffs and cling onto walls with unbelievable grip and upper body strength, barely ever getting tired, while at the same time good enough at gunplay to go up against armies of battle-hardened mercenaries and come out on top. Oh, and he has an intimate knowledge of archaeology and is also able to find ancient lost treasures and cities all the time apparently. And also he\u0026rsquo;s pretty good at sketching. It\u0026rsquo;s fine, after all what are video games but power fantasies right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncharted 4 gives us a deeper look at Nathan Drake\u0026rsquo;s background and how he grew up to be like this, and we find out that not only is he this human at the peak of physical ability, he also has a brother who, despite 15 years rotting away in some backwater prison, is also at peak physical ability and also has all the rest of Nathan\u0026rsquo;s abilities (except the sketching though). (Cue Star Wars prequel meme \u0026ldquo;This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!\u0026quot;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from that minor complaint, the games are pretty great though. If you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar, the games are highly linear and story-driven, consisting of set pieces and sequences that are either platforming/exploratory (figure out how to get from point A to point B) or combat/stealth vs the aforementioned armies of battle-hardened mercenaries. Oh, and there\u0026rsquo;s the occasional puzzle too. Uncharted 4 adds some new elements such as letting you drive a car (4 wheel drive) around in what seems like an open world (it really isn\u0026rsquo;t), but it\u0026rsquo;s still mostly the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not a big action game player, so I dislike the combat parts and I die a lot there. You can see in one of the screenshots later that my shooting accuracy rate was like 49%. For this reason, I\u0026rsquo;m not inclined to go for achievement completion on this one (or any of the Uncharted games for that matter), since there are many combat-related and difficulty-related trophies, and even one that requires me to finish the game with like a 70% accuracy rate. Good luck with that!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDying a lot isn\u0026rsquo;t a problem, as the game is very forgiving. There are a generous number of checkpoints, and there\u0026rsquo;s really no penalty for dying too much. (Again, you can see in the stats screenshot that I failed checkpoints 105 times.) It\u0026rsquo;s kind of unavoidable with on-rails games like these - there are plenty of spots where if you don\u0026rsquo;t climb or run or jump in just the exact way the game wants, you\u0026rsquo;ll die and fail the checkpoint. It\u0026rsquo;s not super frustrating since you never really have to repeat too much, but it\u0026rsquo;s that kind of game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, I guess Nathan Drake is famous now, because people know about his discoveries from the first 3 games, but I feel like he should be richer than he is portrayed. Not that he\u0026rsquo;s poor, but surely he got away with a few valuable trinkets here and there during his adventures right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStory-wise it feels like they planned this to be Nathan Drake\u0026rsquo;s final run, given the epilogue, but who knows? I mean in their universe, Sully is pretty old but he still also does ridiculous stunts with the rest of the gang. And they did introduce some new characters, so it\u0026rsquo;s not far-fetched there\u0026rsquo;ll be another Uncharted game later on, possibly with someone else as the lead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, game is pretty good, play it if you can, happy to have ticked it off the backlog! Have some screenshots:\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The last six months were a blur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s considered \u0026ldquo;Christmas season\u0026rdquo; over here already I guess. The local memes are that once the clock hits midnight between Aug 31 and Sep 1, your neighbor\u0026rsquo;s Christmas lights are magically up. Also of course the famous Jose Mari Chan gets famous starting September, since malls and stores love to play his Christmas songs during this time. IDK what to expect for Christmas season this year though, since we are still in a pandemic. I keep telling my mom not to get her hopes up that we (i.e. my brothers and their families) will all be able to get together as tradition dictates. It\u0026rsquo;s possible, but I\u0026rsquo;m not optimistic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy week was kinda busy. Not really in terms of work, but in terms of\u0026hellip; high school stuff, I guess? My high school batch hosted our 25th year alumni homecoming this past weekend. Since we were unlucky enough to have it in the middle of the pandemic, it was an online-only affair, with presentations and raffles and whatnot. And a quiz night! A lot of my batchmates did a lot more work, my participation was mostly limited to some tech stuff, since I had access to the database of registrants for the raffle, and also representing the batch at the Pisay Quiz Night held online. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t the only PQN team member, I was just the one assigned to join the zoom and show the whiteboard; I was drafted against my will due to my past quiz night experience. My other batchmates were supporting me from a Discord, I basically streamed the Zoom call to them via Discord (which is really troublesome, always has tech issues) and they fed me possible answers etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI actually wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting my PQN participation to take too much time, but there was like a tech rehearsal and a dry run before the event proper, to make sure everything worked well and that all the team got it, plus my team also got together a couple of times for \u0026ldquo;practice.\u0026rdquo; I didn\u0026rsquo;t really want to take it seriously, as with all online quiz nights I\u0026rsquo;m mostly there for the fun since it\u0026rsquo;s super likely for at least some people on some teams to be googling their answers lol. The PQN is super competitive though, I suppose that\u0026rsquo;s to be expected given the nature of Pisay. We didn\u0026rsquo;t win, and I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen the final scores yet, but I guess that we finished around middle of the pack among the 22 teams, but we had a good time (more or less!) and it was fun hanging out with the batchmates virtually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaming this week was pretty good!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI started \u003ca href=\"/2020/09/1301222471568297984/\"\u003eand finished Disco Elysium\u003c/a\u003e during the first half of the week. Fantastic game, and I was probably unhealthily engrossed in it for like 2-3 days. I was so into the whole mystery thing, when the game warned me that I was at a critical point and that proceeding further would end other sidequests, I just created a save and pushed to the finish anyway. I went back later to load and finish the other side stuff. It\u0026rsquo;s the kind of game you\u0026rsquo;d enjoy if you like getting your Speech skill to 100 in Fallout. It\u0026rsquo;s very well-written and had some really great/shocking moments. Since it has very little actual \u0026ldquo;action\u0026rdquo; aside from delving inside the MC\u0026rsquo;s thoughts, I understand that it\u0026rsquo;s not for everybody, but it\u0026rsquo;s certainly a worthwhile experience. I thought about writing a full review post, but maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll save that for when/if I manage full achievement completion (looks tough!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eafter getting distracted by Disco Elysium, I went ahead and resumed my Uncharted 4 game. I think I\u0026rsquo;m close to the end on this one, should finish it this coming week.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ealready half way through the Super Mario 3D Land special worlds. Speaking of Mario, Nintendo announced a bunch of new Mario releases for the Switch this past week, which significantly increases my want for a Switch.

One of them is Google Takeout. The last one was back in April, and that last export was 27 chunks (they split it into 2GB or less chunks). The new one is 44 chunks! I suspect the huge increase is because I\u0026rsquo;ve been streaming on Twitch and exporting them to Youtube, so they\u0026rsquo;re probably part of this current export. I didn\u0026rsquo;t even export everything this time, since I don\u0026rsquo;t need to re-export data from those services I\u0026rsquo;m no longer using. One of my ongoing projects is reducing my Google footprint, so I need to figure out how to get the size of this export down.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThis post is just quite a few thoughts on mobile apps and mobile app development, all mishmashed together. I don\u0026rsquo;t claim to be a mobile app specialist, at best I\u0026rsquo;ve \u003cem\u003edabbled\u003c/em\u003e in them, but enough to form some opinions I guess?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"a-bit-of-history\"\u003eA Bit of History\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first exposure to mobile app development when I got pulled to help my then-company\u0026rsquo;s then-fledgling mobile team with cleaning up the codebase for their iOS app. This was back in maybe 2011? It was one of those projects where some devs built a quick proof-of-concept demo using new technology, then management liked it and asked for new features and they kept adding new features haphazardly until there was just this huge unmaintainable mess of code. This isn\u0026rsquo;t a knock against Objective-C or iOS development specifically or the dev team; the fact is they were new to the stack and were learning as they went while still trying to meet deadlines. I also spent some time reviewing the corresponding Android team\u0026rsquo;s code as well. This was the bulk of my exposure to native mobile dev on iOS/Android. (This was before Swift, so I never got to experience that. Language looks neat though.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComing from a web dev background, I\u0026rsquo;ve always found the fragmentation of platforms annoying. Basically your effort gets multiplied by the number of platforms you have to support, and what would work well on iOS may not work well on Android and vice versa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater on, this concern was alleviated a bit with the rise of common frameworks that could publish to both iOS and Android. The first one I tried of these was React Native. I tried it for a small mobile project I did around 3-ish years ago. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t tremendously happy with the experience. My mistake was probably diving head-first into React Native, when this was my first experience with React and front-end frameworks in general (something new to someone with \u003ca href=\"/2020/02/old-web/\"\u003emy jQuery background\u003c/a\u003e!), so a lot of concepts were new to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo make matters worse, the React Native docs at that time seemed to assume some familiarity already with React, or at least similar frameworks like Angular. I had a bit of confusion with whether I should be using Expo or not, and how to eject, and it resulted in having to restart the project a couple of times. It was also my first encounter with NPM\u0026rsquo;s dependency management, and that annoyed me a lot. A lot of the third-party dependencies I used back then were still immature too, so I often had problems with things like accessing the camera roll and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, it was experience, and the ability to publish cross-platform to iOS and Android was invaluable. I went on to use React Native as my go-to mobile framework I would recommend for other projects afterwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecently, I had to do a UI revamp for that small mobile app I wrote three years ago, and I hadn\u0026rsquo;t touched it for a while so I had some trouble with NPM trying to get it to run. In frustration, I gave up on it and decided to rewrite it in Flutter, of which I\u0026rsquo;ve heard good things. Flutter turned out to be great, and it took me just a little over two weeks, part-time to rewrite the app, probably slightly less effort than it took me to write it in the first place. I don\u0026rsquo;t have enough experience yet to have a detailed review of Flutter, but I was generally much happier with the experience compared to React. Part of that may be I\u0026rsquo;m much more familiar with the mobile landscape now and have a better idea of what I\u0026rsquo;m doing, but I really did encounter much fewer points of friction and Flutter seems to have much better documentation. I believe it will be my first choice of frameworks moving forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"not-everything-needs-to-be-a-native-app\"\u003eNot Everything Needs to Be a Native App\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the things that annoys me about mobile apps is that people/companies unnecessarily want things to be native mobile apps when they would work perfectly fine as web apps. I can understand applications such as Uber may need numerous native functionality (GPS, timely notifications, offline functionality), so that\u0026rsquo;s fine (although many of those things are available using modern browser APIs as well!). Things like online newspapers, forums like Reddit, and so on, are perfectly fine as normal web apps, and should stop prompting me to install their native apps when they detect I am on mobile. Granted that you may get a much better UX experience with a native app, but you also have to install it locally and grant it more access than what the browser\u0026rsquo;s sandbox provides, and that feels like a tradeoff decision that the user needs to make, and not something to nag the user about constantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess part of it is that I grew up with the open web and have a significant bias towards it. In general, if I can just access an app via web, I will prefer that, unless the native app experience is vastly superior or otherwise necessary. And this focus on native apps can be bad for the web. This is apparent in apps like Instagram, which don\u0026rsquo;t allow you to use their primary function - uploading images - on a desktop browser. I also had a similar discussion with a freelance client a few years ago, when they wanted to make a mobile app, but not a corresponding web platform, when all of the app\u0026rsquo;s functionality was simple stuff that web could do easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"different-platforms\"\u003eDifferent Platforms\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe differences in iOS and Android are particularly annoying to me as a developer, especially since I\u0026rsquo;m used to web development. With web, everything is open and standards-based, so you generally write everything using a single stack, and any reasonably standards-compliant web browser will work with the web app in a reasonably consistent way. (Granted, there will be browser-specific issues, but nowadays those aren\u0026rsquo;t too common.) With iOS and Android, you have to test on both platforms extensively, and the build processes and distribution methods are different for each. Frameworks like React Native and Flutter lighten this load considerably, but you still really have to devote more time and resources to testing on the different platforms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"backward-compatibility\"\u003eBackward Compatibility\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, this one may be an unfounded concern of mine since I don\u0026rsquo;t have much experience in the matter, but I have this worry that native mobile apps tend to \u003cem\u003erot\u003c/em\u003e more easily, and by \u003cem\u003erot\u003c/em\u003e I mean, get worse with time, as the mobile OSes upgrade themselves very rapidly. Unlike, say, Windows, which gets a new major version every few years, iOS and Android are constantly getting new versions and more importantly, deprecating APIs and adding new ones! Hence my worry that unmaintained, a perfectly functional app may become unworkable a few years down the line and no longer work on the latest mobile OSes. It\u0026rsquo;s my totally unfounded belief that this is a significant reason why \u003ca href=\"/2020/07/itunes-purchases/\"\u003emore than 50% of my lifetime App Store purchases are no longer listed on the App Store\u003c/a\u003e. (And also why I\u0026rsquo;ve pretty much disavowed making mobile purchases again.) Say what you will about Windows, but at least they have a pretty good record of backward compatibility when software I\u0026rsquo;ve written for Windows in the early 2000s is still very likely to run on Windows today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"closed-platforms\"\u003eClosed Platforms\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother issue I have with native apps is that I have been used to working on open platforms. Windows, for all its faults, is still an open platform, and anyone can write software for it and distribute it using whatever method they desire. And the web is even more open and standards-based (for now at least). For mobile, Android is mostly open, but iOS is mostly a closed platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApple\u0026rsquo;s tight control over the iOS platform has been in the tech news recently. First was \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation\"\u003ethe kerfuffle with hey.com\u003c/a\u003e a few months ago, and more recently, \u003ca href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/\"\u003etheir removal of Fortnite and battle with Epic\u003c/a\u003e due to Epic\u0026rsquo;s objection to Apple taking a cut of all purchases on iOS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a mobile developer, the most annoying things about Apple\u0026rsquo;s tight control over iOS apps are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethat $100 annual fee for an Apple Developer account. If you\u0026rsquo;re a 1st world developer, that cost isn\u0026rsquo;t much, but if you\u0026rsquo;re a young hobbyist developer in a poorer country who just wants to try making an app, it can be a significant hurdle. Google also charges you some token amount for Play Store access, but at least it\u0026rsquo;s just a one-time fee.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe fact that you need to use a Mac to publish apps to the App Store. This is another significant hurdle for hobbyist developers; Macs are typically very expensive computers. Granted Android development requires a beefy setup too, but at least you get a choice of platform for Android development.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eApp store review can be unpredictable; sometimes things that were perfectly fine during a previous release are now flagged in the next review. It feels like you need to get lucky with the reviewer you get. And if the reviewer is unfair to your app, you may be out of luck unless you\u0026rsquo;re a big company like Epic or \u003ca href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/wordpress-developers-says-apple-wants-30-percent-of-its-profits-from-app-store/\"\u003eWordpress that can raise a stink about it\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of the issues that could be levied against Apple for their monopoly over the App Store could be largely addressed if the platform allowed users to install apps via alternative methods, the same way Android does. I fully understand that Apple\u0026rsquo;s tight controls enable a safer environment for naive end users (presumably, assuming they don\u0026rsquo;t screw up), and I actually approve some of their controls like their iOS14 plans to restrict targetted advertising. But more advanced users should be given the option to use alternative methods if they so choose. They can still flag apps installed via alternative methods as \u0026ldquo;potentially unsafe\u0026rdquo; and add hurdles to prevent less capable users from being easily tricked by malicious actors, (Android does this, I believe).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"in-conclusion\"\u003eIn conclusion\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t really have a point here. Maybe I just want everything to be open? I like open platforms lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

A very relaxed and chill week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again a tiny bit of work done this past week, some fixes, including to side projects. I also spent some time preparing for some events next weekend. Although I wasn\u0026rsquo;t productive this week, I did outline a bit of a roadmap of new features for one of my side projects, hopefully I can get into that in the coming weeks!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are still in a pandemic! But I did have my first dine-in meal at a restaurant last Monday. It was because I went to get blood drawn for routine medical reasons, and I had needed to skip breakfast for the test (spoiler: my blood sugar levels were very, very normal). So after getting the blood drawn I was super hungry and decided to have breakfast at the nearby Pancake House. I was the only customer since it was super early (and you know, pandemic), although a second guy came in after I had given my order. I almost subconsciously picked up the glass of water to sip from it as soon as it was served, luckily I remembered I was wearing a face mask and a face shield. I decided to hold off on removing the gear until the actual pancakes were served, to minimize the exposure time. The next day I also decided to have a snack at a Starbucks after running some errands, mainly because I had a free coffee from Globe Rewards. It was afternoon so there were a few other customers there. The cashier said it was ok to dine in, but for a maximum of one hour only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a longish post I was writing, but it felt too raw to publish and might break it up into smaller posts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe actually managed to win an online quiz night this week! It\u0026rsquo;s been a while, good job trivia team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt feels great to no longer be following the covid19 stats regularly, even though they are still fairly terrible. UP experts are projecting that we get the reproduction rate to below 1 in like a month though, so that\u0026rsquo;s some good news, though we may still be a ways away from getting this under control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are the things I\u0026rsquo;ve been watching and playing the past week:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStill playing a lot of SC2 Coop, trying to unlock the new prestiges. Levelling the commanders again can be a pain, but at least they managed to provide new goals/objectives for the players, breathing back a bunch of life into this game mode.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStill drafting Amonkhet Remastered, although the last few drafts haven\u0026rsquo;t gone well. Need to save up gems, so I\u0026rsquo;ll do one last one draft once I get enough gold.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHuh, I guess I kind of paused Uncharted 4 for most of the week, not sure why. I should get back to it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI started re-playing Super Mario 3D Land (on the 3DS) lately, mostly to stave off my desire to get a Nintendo Switch (prices are still inflated here due to supply issues!). I had forgotten a lot about this game, so even when I finished the first 8 worlds and rescued Princess Peach, I was pleasantly surprised to find there were another 8 \u0026ldquo;special\u0026rdquo; worlds to play!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewatched the video game history documentary \u003cstrong\u003eHigh Score\u003c/strong\u003e on Netflix. Pretty good, although there\u0026rsquo;s some Dragon Quest erasure going on in the RPG episode!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewatched \u003cstrong\u003eBill and Ted Face the Music\u003c/strong\u003e, this was a most excellent sequel. I found the start a bit clunky (I always find it awkward watching characters be awkward), but the rest of it was a fun and sweet adventure that echoed elements of both of the first two movies. A lot of the time travel stuff didn\u0026rsquo;t make any sense if you sat down and thought about it, but I was smiling through a lot of it. Little Billie and Theda are great!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ealso watched \u003cstrong\u003eSuperman: Man of Tomorrow\u003c/strong\u003e, the first entry in the new DC animated universe (following the reboot at the end of Justice League Dark: Apokolips). Yet another Superman origin story here. Not too happy with this one. Not fond of the animated style, and the writing and plot seemed weird at many points. I felt like there could have been a better way to resolve the whole situation with the big bad that felt more \u0026ldquo;Superman\u0026rdquo;-like, and the movie doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to earn the monicker \u0026ldquo;Man of Tomorrow\u0026rdquo; for the hero.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efor one reason or another, I also ended up watching a few standup specials on Amazon Prime. A couple from Craig Ferguson, and one from Jimmy Yang.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCobra Kai is now on Netflix! Yet another thing to add to the ever-increasing backlog.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome tech stuff:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI have about three months left on my Webfaction hosting, which I\u0026rsquo;ve \u003ca href=\"/2019/03/rip-webfaction/\"\u003ebeen planning to migrate away from\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;m currently leaning towards getting a cheap $5/mo VPS from Linode, although I\u0026rsquo;m still willing to accept any recommendations. Switching to a VPS means more effort (since it won\u0026rsquo;t be a managed service anymore), but that should provide some learning opportunities. It\u0026rsquo;s just as well anyway, my apps have been pushing the memory limits on the current hosting, and even the cheapest Linode VPS provides more RAM.  I\u0026rsquo;ll probably start looking into the migration in September.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI wrote before about \u003ca href=\"/2020/05/gmail-migration/\"\u003emigrating away from GMail\u003c/a\u003e, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Migadu.com\u0026rsquo;s free tier for about half a year now. This past week, they wrote that they are sunsetting the free tier. Totally understandable, given the economy. They are also introducing a new Micro tier at $20 a year, with slightly better limits than the old free tier, so I may migrate to that near the end of September (when the free tier runs out). In theory, I could just try to run a mail server on whatever VPS I set up (see above bullet), but that\u0026rsquo;s a big hassle. This cost + the $5/mo for the VPS is still less than what I was paying for at Webfaction, so I don\u0026rsquo;t mind paying for this for a while.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI was notified by a local bank that their old web platform is being sunsetted and I needed to migrate to the new system, so I did that. But whenever I tried the migration steps, the process never completed, it just kept telling me it was processing. I finally had to message someone I knew on the dev team lol. Hopefully it can getr resolved next week.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",
