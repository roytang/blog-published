I\u0026rsquo;m still actively posting bite-sized snippets of my brain on \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/roytang\"\u003etwitter\u003c/a\u003e and I even added a new outlet for random internet nonsense on my tumblr account \u003ca href=\"http://tumblr.roytang.net\"\u003eEasily Distracted\u003c/a\u003e but I\u0026rsquo;ve been lazily avoiding the elaborate writing of long prose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to find excuses not to write; for the longest time I was considering switching this blog back to WordPress (I\u0026rsquo;m currently running a custom Django-based blog engine of my own creation) and changing the theme, et cetera \u0026ndash; the sort of busy work one gets into when avoiding something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave I been avoiding writing? Maybe I\u0026rsquo;d fallen into the trap a lot of people fall into \u0026ndash; thinking that I have nothing useful to say, so I better not just say anything. There\u0026rsquo;s something about staring at a blank text box that you need to fill up that triggers a primitive part of our brains that thinks we should avoid pushing out our thoughts or opinions into the world for fear of being questioned or ridiculed. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a holdover from the days that elementary school English teachers would force us to write reaction papers and essays with a required number of words or pages. (Few teachers ask for an N-page paper, they know students will just cheat by using double-space or large fonts.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve also been worried about the sort of things that I write; like a lot of bloggers I somehow fell into the mindset that I should limit myself to a specific set of topics such as software development or Philippine politics or whatever. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit ridiculous, this isn\u0026rsquo;t a topical blog, it\u0026rsquo;s a personal website and I can (and should) write about whatever I damn well please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSidebar: If you\u0026rsquo;re wondering \u0026ldquo;Why write a blog at all?\u0026rdquo;, try reading \u003ca href=\"http://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;You should write blogs\u0026rdquo; by Steve Yegge.\u003c/a\u003e. Looking over his reasons why not to blog, I don\u0026rsquo;t even have the luxury of claiming I don\u0026rsquo;t have enough time, not since I quit my job. (Hmm, I should probably write about that in a future post\u0026hellip; )\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo anyway, let\u0026rsquo;s put this ramble to an end. I\u0026rsquo;ll be writing regularly again for now, probably five times a week. Wish me luck!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
