I think getting more paper books helps \u0026ndash; most of my reading the past few years has been mostly e-books but having at least one paper book around that I can pick up without worrying about a charger or something is also good.

A lot of the backlog is due to me randomly picking up Humble Bundles which increase the count significantly. Hopefully I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to have a much smaller backlog in 2014 \u0026ndash; but there are already a number of release I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to, not to mention the possibility of picking up a PS4 early next year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",
