            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eTraveling by land sucks compared to traveling by plane. So for our weekend trip to Albay to visit our new sister-in-law\u0026rsquo;s family, I booked 3 two-way Cebu Pacific tickets for my brothers and myself. Our parents would take the bus since it was slightly cheaper and they didn\u0026rsquo;t mind sleeping on the road. The other reason was that my two brothers had never ridden a plane before \u0026ndash; this would be their first time. First domestic flight for me as well. As expected, they were excited like giddy shoolboys, taking pictures on the way up the plane and leaning towards the window and all that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suppose it was to be expected, but the airport in Legazpi was a far cry from the Manila one. Practically a strip of road labeled as the runway and a small building labeled a terminal. The flight itself was fine but obviously budget. I have been spoiled by PAL. And of course the view of Legazpi City was a lot more green than Metro Manila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, there was Mayon, visible as soon as we descended from the clouds. Unfortunately the peak stayed hidden from us for the entire weekend, maybe another time. Still, Sunday morning we climbed Lignon Hill, which is a lot smaller than Mayon. We were hoping that by the time we finish the 30-minute walk to the top the peak would show itself. No such luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walk upwards was\u0026hellip; invigorating in a way. I have a newfound respect for slopes. The road we were walking on our way to the peak can\u0026rsquo;t have been more than 30 degrees at its most difficult, yet my leg muscles felt dead tired before we were halfway up. Just shows how out of shape I was. The trip down was much faster of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the stay was mostly eating and shopping for \u003cem\u003epasalubong.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, I suck at buying gifts for people so I\u0026rsquo;m glad I had a DS while everyone else was walking around the informal \u003cem\u003etiangge\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur parents dropped us off at the airport in time for the return flight. We checked in and sat down to wait. The rain outside started getting worse, and eventually there was a message that our flight is canceled. Boo! After asking around, I was told I\u0026rsquo;d get a full refund for the round trip flight. (So we got to fly to Albay for free) I called up my parents and asked them to get us bus tickets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I mentioned at the start, traveling by land sucks. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to sleep, and I\u0026rsquo;m prone to motion-sickness on extended bus trips. Still, we made it back to Manila alive and well. I had a bit of a headache and some of the aforementioned nausea and hardly any sleep, as I expected\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It\u0026rsquo;s just the sort of game I enjoy: challenging enough not to bore me but not so difficult that I give up in frustration and has enough extras to keep me coming back. A bit of a learning curve though, and probably not for casual gamers. I beat the normal campaign last week (just barely \u0026ndash; winning on Day 28 of a 28-day target), and I\u0026rsquo;m hoping I can finish the hard campaign before the release of \u003ca href=\"http://www.advancewars.com\"\u003eAdvance Wars: Days of Ruin\u003c/a\u003e next week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, I was getting bored with my desktop wallpaper so I decided to look for some AW:DS wallpaper, but the official site (linked above) had apparently shoved them off somewhere in favor of Advance Wars: Days of Ruin stuff. Instead, I called up the wayback machine to get the official wallpapers. I might as well offer them here, since wallpapers for the game are hard to find: \u003ca href=\"http://roytang.net/awds\"\u003eAdvance Wars: Dual Strike official wallpapers\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ended up not using them after all though.

            "summary": "Despite it\u0026rsquo;s age, I\u0026rsquo;ve only recently gotten around to loving Advance Wars: Dual Strike on the DS. It\u0026rsquo;s just the sort of game I enjoy: challenging enough not to bore me but not so difficult that I give up in frustration and has enough extras to keep me coming back. A bit of a learning curve though, and probably not for casual gamers. I beat the normal campaign last week (just barely \u0026ndash; winning on Day 28 of a 28-day target), and I\u0026rsquo;m hoping I can finish the hard campaign before the release of Advance Wars: Days of Ruin next week.",

Terrible way to start the year. My own fault for bringing an outdated version of Mannequin to the tournament without even any testing. The meta is heavily Faeries and Elves it seems, and I think the Faerie matchup is bad, as I\u0026rsquo;ve never won a round against it (or my build is too inefficient). Elves matchup should be managable since they don\u0026rsquo;t have tempo on me, but I was playing so badly I even lost to BG Tarmorack which I used to consider a good matchup. BGW Doran is strong \u0026ndash; I played 3 more games with him after I lost the first 2, I think he got the elf/birds into Doran start 4 out of 5 games.

I also need more Pithing Needles as I keep randomly losing to manlands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo Magic for me for the next two weeks though, due to personal matters.

Of course the argument can be made that it makes it easier to lend out to people, but truth be told there are a lot of people I know who already have such copies so my keeping backups is just redundant.

Heck, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to think of a way to have everything be searchable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m considering buying something like a 250 GB external and just using that as a backup.

I\u0026rsquo;ve played in a few Limited tourneys before that, but I guess I took them with a different DCI number as they don\u0026rsquo;t reflect on my ratings history. In particular I remember placing 2nd at a Team Sealed event at BCI Makati back during the Invasion block era. And I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I went 4-0 at an Onslaught prerelease, as I have the shirt to prove it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs can be seen in the stats page though, this was the year I started taking it seriously. I devoted more time to Magic, studying my own technical play for faults and missteps, struggling to learn from every mistake. I read more articles online and tried to practice on Magic Online more to improve my game.  I joined more tournaments (31 this year versus 18 the previous year), and got 9 top 8\u0026rsquo;s this year as opposed to 2 last year. (Granted, some of those were for Prereleases :p) I managed a GPT top 8 and a PTQ top 8 this year, my first ones ever!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I have a long way to go towards improving. I was disappointed to find out my match win percentage was under 60% (although I have no idea how much higher the match win percentage of top players would be.) For next year I hope I can push that win percentage even more, make fewer misplays and get more PTQ top 8s (although I doubt I will be able to play in the extended season\u0026hellip; maybe Block Constructed). My goal is to stabilize my rating in the top 75 of the Philippines so that I can play in Nationals without having to go through those horrendous qualifiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWish me luck 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA couple of weeks ago, just before the last PTQ of the season, I was thinking of quitting Magic. Not because I\u0026rsquo;m tired of it or anything, but because I\u0026rsquo;ve run out of people to play with. Unlike last year where we had enough players in the office to occasionally have an 8-man draft, this year most of the Magic players have either switched to WoW or moved to a different company/country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are only two of us seriously playing now, so our card pool has become so much smaller. That also means less preparation for constructed formats as it\u0026rsquo;s harder to get serious playtesting done. Having a team and a shared card pool makes a huge difference. You can see this easily because so many of the players that repeatedly hit top 8 in the local tourneys are known members of a team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not  sure how I\u0026rsquo;ll proceed next year, but I\u0026rsquo;m not quitting. I love to play the game and will make do with what I have if I need to. I\u0026rsquo;m even contemplating playing in the Extended PTQs, although how I can gather the needed cards for that is still a mystery!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "A couple of weeks ago, just before the last PTQ of the season, I was thinking of quitting Magic. Not because I\u0026rsquo;m tired of it or anything, but because I\u0026rsquo;ve run out of people to play with. Unlike last year where we had enough players in the office to occasionally have an 8-man draft, this year most of the Magic players have either switched to WoW or moved to a different company/country.",

makes me sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first round matchup is against one of the more veteran players. He\u0026rsquo;s playing some R-B-W combination, fast aggro stuff. I\u0026rsquo;m faster in game 1 and manage to play Colfenor\u0026rsquo;s Plans, attracting some onlookers who told me it was a deathtrap. I had read about some pros liking it and wanted to try it out. The logic being, if you\u0026rsquo;re out of cards anyway, and you can only play one spell per turn anyway (the one you topdeck), and you can win with just a bit more push, might as well grab the next seven cards immediately. As one of the judges pointed out, I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to play the plans, it was plain greedy, since my opponent was at six and I had a flier and two Tar Pitchers out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame 2, I hit Footbottom Feast targetting Spiderwig Boggart then I put the Boggart in my hand then said, \u0026ldquo;draw a card from feast\u0026rdquo;. I looked at the top card before my opponent could stop me. Oops, of course the Boggart was already the draw from the feast, so I got a warning for looking at extra cards and the judge shuffles my deck. I\u0026rsquo;m glad it\u0026rsquo;s not a game loss, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter as I lose to an aggressive Blades of Velis Vel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame 3, I mull to five and am unable to recover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1: 1-2 loss. Yes, not a good start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond round is\u0026hellip; some guy. Don\u0026rsquo;t recall what he was playing. I win in 2 games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2: 2-0 win\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird round is a guy I\u0026rsquo;ve been up against a few times before. His deck is black-green but light on removal. I power out Giants, he stacks Treefolk on his side to keep me from attacking, dragging out the game. (I hate fighting Black Poplars!) but eventually I take it in 2 games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3: 2-0 win\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFourth round is against one of the better limited players around, he plays fast so somehow I\u0026rsquo;m forced to match his pace. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember his deck, though it must have had blue because I remember getting countered. We trade the first two games, and I draw no gas for game three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: 1-2 loss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I am X-2 once again. Sigh, it has not been a good limited PTQ season for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5 was fun. He\u0026rsquo;s white-green. Game 1 I\u0026rsquo;m losing badly to his early creatures, but then I hit Spiderwig giving Axegrinder fear (six damage), sac the Spiderwig to Fodder Launch one of his guys (+5 damage). End of his turn I footbottom the Spiderwig to give the Axegrinder fear again, dealing 17 damage in two turns to win from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame 2 I get hit by the early aggro rush again and am unable to recover. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember game 3, but my notes tell me hit was pretty bad for him as I took no damage at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5: 2-1 win\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6, my opponent is a merfolk deck with Springleaf Drum, Falloysage and Veteran of the Depths, which gets annoying quick. I hold on for a long time in game 1 before succumbing to School tokens. Game 2 I keep a hand with Adder-Staff, 2 Lash Outs and another creature. I play the Adder-Staff and Lash Out his first two creatures, which I soon regret as his third play is a Veteran that goes all the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6: 0-2 loss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSigh, I\u0026rsquo;m not even getting prizes anymore. I tick \u0026ldquo;Drop\u0026rdquo; on the result slip, then change my mind and cross it out. I want to play the last round to at least get some practice\u0026hellip; hopefully my play skill can improve just a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 7: 0-2 loss. Bleah. I think my play was tight, but he just drew better cards. I remember he had an Epic Proportions that stopped my Lash Outs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA 3-4 finish, how terrible. Before this season I had actually envisioned myself as a decent limited player. Obviously, Lorwyn limited is hard, I need to do so much to improve my deck construction and technical play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext: Morningtide Release Events?

I hate rough-backed sleeves, my hands are not very good with them. For some reason, I was also stupid enough to come in my sandals, wearing no socks. I know from experience that this is stupid, as my feet will get sweaty and I\u0026rsquo;ll be uncomfortable all day.

Impulsiveness made me throw away this game and I vow it will never EVER happen again. It was game one, I was dead to his next swing, but 3 of my guys were fliers and I drew into Final Revels. I quickly went for +2/+0 thinking I had enough damage to win the game. As he considered his options I realize the miscount and that he would live with 1 life, killing me the next turn with two Kithkin guys with no blockers. Oh man, what an idiot. I just saw the Final Revels topdeck and played it without thinking. NEVER AGAIN.

I break the Pickles combo in both of the next two games, but sadly due to bad attacks and blocks on my part I still manage to lose to Teferi and an army of Factory Workers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1-2 loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6: Mannequin Mirror match here, but his build is new, as he shows me Ponder on the first turn. I lose game one to Profane Command. In game 2, 3 of the lands I draw are Faerie Conclaves\u0026hellip; coincidentally he draws 3 Riftwing Cloudskates. I was behind on creatures and mana all day. Obviously, I need to figure out the mirror match\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e0-2 loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrash and burn after a good start, as usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 7: U/W control. It\u0026rsquo;s my turn to be insane with the Riftwing Cloudskates here, grabbing lots of tempo off my opponent while bashing with Ironfoots. I take it in 3.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2-1 win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne more win gets me into top eight\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 8: R/G Big Mana. 90% of the deck is really easy for me to beat, after all it\u0026rsquo;s creatures and burn, I\u0026rsquo;m removal and card advantage. I take the first game easily, but fumble on sideboarding \u0026ndash; I certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware of this matchup going in, so I had no idea. Bottle Gnomes? Extirpate? I just bring in 3 Vesuvan Shapeshifters to handle his Red Akroma and Hellkites. Game two, he shows me the other 10% of his deck that would give me fits: Chandra Nalar. My entire offense literally stops after Chandra takes down one creature and Incinerate knocks out my last one. I lose to the card disadvantage and proceed to search my board for answers to Chandra. I had none (I don\u0026rsquo;t own any Pithing Needles sir), so I just sucked it up and decided to try for a fast aggro kill. I had a good hand too \u0026ndash; Faerie Conclave into suspended Cloudskate. But midgame he shows me another aspect of his deck \u0026ndash; land destruction. I get hit by Avalanche Riders and Mwonvuli Acid-Moss and he even shows me his sideboarded card: Rootgrapple! I have mana problems up to the end, and he even gets Chandra out again. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get in a single point of damage for this game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1-2 loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal record: 5-3, finishing 17. Not so bad I guess, considering I finished 25th the week before and 37th the week before that.  At this rate, I figure next week I\u0026rsquo;ll be 8th or 9th. 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext: PTQ KL #3\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Same deck as the last time , except I removed the 2 grim harvests from the board and put in +2 sudden death (to improve the pickles matchup)\nRound 1: My opponent had a BUw Mannequin deck, splashing for O-Ring and Blink. He obviously put the deck together at the last minute though.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eTournament was on Saturday, November 10. Format was Standard. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any good deck ideas this time around (some would argue I never do!), so I played a netdeck. I played the Mannequin deck that originally appeared in US States, as reported by BDM \u003ca href=\"http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/bd304\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.

The tournament report follows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI register for the tourney, and on the spot I name the deck \u0026ldquo;Manny\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLorywn Inaugurals Tournament Report\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 1 : vs Black/Green Tarmorack\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis matchup is heavily in Manny\u0026rsquo;s favor due to the card advantage. He has a not so good draw and I win game one easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI board +4 Nameless Inversion, -2 Grim Harvest and -2 random guys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two, he attacks third turn with a Treetop Village, I hit it with a nameless inversion and he\u0026rsquo;s down a land. On my turn I play the Shadowmage Infiltrator and it\u0026rsquo;s all uphill from there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2-0 win. Good start!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 2: vs Monoblack\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deck is not monoblack aggro, more of disruption + midsize creatures (Shriekmaw, Crovax the black, Korlash). The matchup seems bad for Manny since I have 8 dead cards (Shadowmage Infiltrator and Shriekmaw) I lose game one to Crovax the black, I didn\u0026rsquo;t even notice that my Epochrasite was dead on arrival. (I pretended that I did that on purpose to suspend it)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI board -4 Shadowmage Infiltrator -4 Shriekmaw -1 Grim Harvest +4 Nameless Inversion +2 Damnation +3 Vesuvan Shapeshifter (to kill Korlash and Crovax)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two goes my way, as he has no creature drops at all for the first six turns or so. He has a warhammer, so any creature that comes out I immediately hit with removal. My offense consists almost entirely of two epochrasites and a faerie conclave. An interesting board position came during this game:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy side: Faerie Conclave, Epochrasite, other lands. No removal in hand, and I\u0026rsquo;m at 17 life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis side: Warhammer, no creatures. Urza\u0026rsquo;s Factory, Mouth of Ronom + 6-7 other lands. He\u0026rsquo;s at five life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swing with Faerie Conclave and Epochrasite, then immediately realize the mistake. I had assumed he would just Ronom the Faerie, but if instead he makes a Factory worker and blocks the Epochrasite I\u0026rsquo;m screwed since I have no removal and he can equip the warhammer next turn to climb back in life. Luckily, he assumes that I do have removal and does not risk taking the two damage from the faerie. I win game 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame 3, we had less than ten minutes left, so I play quickly. However, since I had boarded in removal, my side was now control. He had sided back in most of his creatures so he got the aggro draw. We trade hits for a while, but eventually he gets out a 9/6 Korlash with lifelink (warhammer) and there\u0026rsquo;s no way I can catch up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1-2 loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 3 \u0026ndash; B/R Goblins\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorry to my opponent but this matchup was really easy. Manny\u0026rsquo;s removal and card advantage is more than enough to keep the Goblins in check, and Phyrexian Ironfoot + Epochrasite is really bad for their deck. 2-0 win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 4 \u0026ndash; UGw Shifters\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUG shifters. With the Shapeshifter, Thelonite Hermit and all, + white for blink. I win game 1, he seems to have a bad draw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bring in Shapeshifters of my own to take advantage of his hermits. I lose game two to a Mystic Snake that was blinked 4 times (including flashback).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame three I take a midgame advantage, he has 2 morphs down but is obviously waiting for a second forest to turn the hermit face up. He plays a Birds of Paradise. And I pass my turn without doing anything to it. (Mistake no. 1)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course I attempt to bounce it during his turn (Mistake no. 2). He of course flips the hermit, creates saprolings etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stall off the saps coz I have a lot of ironfoot blockers. I swing with a Shriekmaw. (Mistake no. 3) He of course turns the other morph face up, revealing shapeshifter, copying one of the ironfoot guys. :(\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lost obviously, with those kinds of mistakes it\u0026rsquo;s a wonder I held out so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1-2 loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo 2-2 now. But it\u0026rsquo;s an 8-round tourney, so \u003cstrong\u003emaybe\u003c/strong\u003e I can still make top 8. I fight on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 5 \u0026ndash; B/G Tarmorack\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWooh! Lucky, a good matchup. I take it again in two games with massive card advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2-0 win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 6 \u0026ndash; R/G aggro\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame one was not too difficult, given the massive card advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two, he managed to bring down my life early with three Ascetics before I could play the Damnation. I lost to Barbs (he also had a Wisent but that\u0026rsquo;s a blank against me)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame three he gets the Barbs down while we\u0026rsquo;re still at a high enough life. I play Venser to send it back, going down to 4, and on my turn I drop 3 creatures to discourage him from playing it again. It works, he instead drops creatures of his own. I play Profane Command for the win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2-1 win\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 7 \u0026ndash; U/W control\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seems to be permission light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame one, I bring him down to 14 and he plays Akroma off charge lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the first hit (down to 14 life).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy turn I play Infiltrator and Epochrasite comes out of suspend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the next hit (down to 8 life)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swing with Infiltrator, then play two ironfoots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the next hit (down to 2 life)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy turn, Profane Command for 5, opponent loses 5 and all my guys get fear. Nice game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI board in Shapeshifters to deal with Crovax the White and Akroma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two he got out an early Crovax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI play Shapeshifter to kill Crovax. He plays Akroma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI play Mannequin on Shapeshifter. (Opponent: \u0026ldquo;Ano ba yan!\u0026quot;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get out fear guys. He gets out Triskelavus, we start racing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI play Mannequin again, targetting shapeshifter, copying Triskelavus (a Shapeshifter with 3 +1/+1 counters is pretty good)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe plays Disenchant on the Shapeshifter! (Opponent: \u0026ldquo;Ang squatter naman\u0026rdquo;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eventually manage to bounce his triskelavus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe race some more, I win with 3 life remaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2-0 win\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, one more win and possibily top 8! But I look at the standings and I\u0026rsquo;m last among the 5-2s :( Boo! 21th place, too far away. If I win the last round I make top 16 and win three packs. Lose, and I probably still get one pack. Then, it\u0026rsquo;s practically \u0026ldquo;no bearning\u0026rdquo; for me now, I get at least one pack either way. (Yes, this story does not end in a top eight finish, I apologize.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I slack off in round 8. In a matchup where I need to slack off the least \u0026ndash; pickles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 8 \u0026ndash; UB pickles\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0026rsquo;s playing pickles with black instead of the usual white for momentary blink. He has an aggro mode with Ironfoots and Shadowmages, Cryptic Command for permission, Ancestral Visions for card draw. This is the first round I\u0026rsquo;m playing the pickles combo, so I\u0026rsquo;m sorta still stupid (or slacking off, as I said.) What I understand about the pickles matchup is that you have to be careful not to tap out if your opponent has 10-11 mana already \u0026ndash; since he can lock you down at any time (even less for the white version which has blink).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame one I lost to pickles lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI side in +4 Nameless Inversion (Mistake\u0026hellip; should have also brought in +3 Extirpate)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two I lost to pickles lock. Okay, a bit longer story. I lost to pickles lock after making the misplay of bouncing the Brine Elemental so he could delay me one more turn. He had Liliana Vess out \u0026ndash; he was going to get the other half of the combo no matter what. If I had an Extirpate then the bounce was the correct play, as there was already a Brine Elemental in the yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I finish 5-3 with the Mannequin deck, a crappy 32nd place, winning a single booster! In fairness, I got an Auntie\u0026rsquo;s Hovel from that booster, so it\u0026rsquo;s all good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the tournament some people were asking me whether it was difficult to play. I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. Two of the losses I attribute to bad plays on my part, and the monoblack matchup was just bad. After boarding it was probably 50-50 or 60-40 at best. The weakness I can see is the lack of instant speed removal (unless you have a Shriekmaw in the graveyard), so Treetop Villages cause problems. I always board in the Nameless Inversions for decks with Treetops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManabarbs is also very bad for the deck, as you have no permission to stop it, only bounce. At the minimum you will take 4 damage (or 2 damage and wait 3 turns) to bounce the Barbs, then have one turn to try to get back in the game before they cast it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, the Mannequin tricks are awesome and will lead to some devastating draws and plays. But every so often you draw something like 3 Mannequins and a Grim Harvest, with your only creatures being Epochrasite, Phyrexian Ironfoot or Shadowmage, all of which are not that good with the reanimation. Next time I will probably cut 2 Grim Harvest entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext: PTQ KL #2.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Of course, I forgot  that I could still activate the Horde of Notions ability to recast Consuming Bonfire on the opposing Mirror Entity. (Yes, I was losing to a mirror entity again.) Instead, I did something really stupid: He had three creatures on the board, I had a 1/1 merfolk, a 1/1 changeling that can give other creatures changeling, and a Thundercloud Shaman in my hand. I figured I could wipe all his creatures if I Thundercloud for 3, so I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etap the changeling to turn my merfolk into a giant and cast the Giant.

I lose game 1 to 1/1s and 2/2s, all I had was the Stonybrook Angler.  Game 2 I mulligan to six and he keeps, but he misses the 3rd land drop. I have a Cloudgrown Oak carrying a Runed Stalactite, a five-turn clock. He gets the third land and tries to play Eyeblight\u0026rsquo;s Ending on it and I shake my head. \u0026ldquo;Elf.\u0026rdquo; He gets out a few blockers at 8 and trades two for one with the Oak. I cast the Treefolk Harbinger for Changeling Titan. When the Titan attacks, he tries the Eyeblight\u0026rsquo;s Ending again, and I shake my head again. Right, he scoops and we go to game three. Game three I mulligan to six again, only it\u0026rsquo;s a proper mana screw this time. I barely put up a fight and lose to random dorks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo 2-3 and drop. Quite disappointing, as it seems I\u0026rsquo;m not improving my limited game at all. I still made a suboptimal sealed deck build (was siding in the same six cards every round) and made several play mistakes. I would blame lack of sleep, but obviously I didn\u0026rsquo;t have my A-game this time around. Hopefully, the next few PTQs are better for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "The format is Lorwyn Sealed. Note here that I they had a shortage of boosters and had to split tournament packs into 3 boosters to be able to accomodate all the players.\nDecklist/Card pool later, I\u0026rsquo;m too lazy to type it up. Unfortunately, I failed to learn from the previous mistakes as I got blinded by the shiny again, thinking I could actually cast Horde of Notions, so I went with an almost-five color build, major red-blue-and-green.",

            "title": "How to Solve Technical Problems",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eOne of the qualities that I think make a really good software developer is the ability to solve difficult technical problems. Unless you\u0026rsquo;re the sort of software developer who just sells the same piece of software over and over again, at some point in time you\u0026rsquo;ll to need to find out how to implement some feature you\u0026rsquo;ve never tried before. Or you\u0026rsquo;ll hit a problem that\u0026rsquo;s not documented in any official docs and you need that critical functionality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypically, there are two approaches: Research and Experimentation. Today I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about Research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResearch means the internet of course, but what part of it exactly? At first of course you should search for the information yourself, using Google usually. But often if the technology is new or the problem is esoteric enough, you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to find what you need (or you would need very precise keywords). The second step is to ask for expert help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an example, some recent postings of mine on a Microsoft-related forum (I was trying to figure out how to do an addin for Microsoft Office) elicited a mail from someone with the subject \u0026ldquo;Hello, I need ur help\u0026rdquo;. I was feeling a bit helpful, so I gave him a reply. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it was smarmy or anything, but I also gave him some additional advice, and I quote:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Also I have some additional free advice for you:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour email looks like SPAM. I was about to mark it as spam when I happened to spot the phrase \u0026ldquo;MSWord Addins\u0026rdquo; in the body. Learn to write better email subjects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSending personal emails to people asking for help isn\u0026rsquo;t a very good way to solve technical issues. Most people are likely to ignore such requests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou might want to read this: \u003ca href=\"http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html%22\"\u003ehttp://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html\u0026quot;\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not trying to deride him or anything, god knows I\u0026rsquo;ve sent my own share of personal email requests for help before. And it\u0026rsquo;s correct that they are often ignored, so it\u0026rsquo;s not very effective. I think the most effective way, as mentioned in the ESR link above, is to use forums. Specifically, don\u0026rsquo;t look for forums where newbies like us ask questions; use forums where experts congregate. By forum, I\u0026rsquo;m not strictly referring to bulletin boards, it also includes mailing-lists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow to find the best forums? It depends on what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best thing is if your subject matter of choice has an active community of developers interested or passionate about the product. Google about the subject matter and see what forums or mailing lists are popular. An example would be \u003ca href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/\"\u003eAdobe Flex\u003c/a\u003e, which I started reading up on a while back for a work-related issue. Finding help on Adobe Flex is really easy. There\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/flexcoders/\"\u003ea very active mailing-list\u003c/a\u003e, where you can even expect replies from some of the guys who actually made Flex. If you visit some of the active blogs about Flex (there are a lot), many of them will reference the flexcoders mailing list so you know you can get a lot of good help there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNon-official forums are better because people are more likely to be passionate than paid reps. One problem I often encounter when researching is Microsoft. Whenever I search for Microsoft-related stuff inevitably sources dry up \u0026ndash; there are literally hundreds of unofficial forums where many newbies ask questions. Now, what to recognize about Microsoft is that they have hundreds (maybe thousands?) of experts called MVPs in every different Microsoft technology. These MVPs are recognized by Microsoft for providing unofficial support to the community. So, the trick is to figure out where you can post such that a good number of MVPs will see your question and possibly respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what the best place would be, but the one that I have gotten the most results from would be \u003ca href=\"http://groups.google.com/\"\u003eGoogle Groups\u003c/a\u003e. Any of the microsoft.public.* ones. I guess Google Groups would be pretty good for non-MS topics as well, but I find that inevitably my MS searches lead me here. For Office-related questions at least there are often one or two MVPs who reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother resource I have used on occasion: the forums at \u003ca href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/\"\u003eJoel on Software\u003c/a\u003e. A lot of very good developers frequent those forums, so even if no one can answer your questions, they might be able to point you in the right direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond forums, well good luck. At this point you might need to resort to personal emails, although I have personally never gotten any success from such a method. Or you probably have to resort to detailed experimentation or even \u0026ndash; god forbid \u0026ndash; giving up.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "One of the qualities that I think make a really good software developer is the ability to solve difficult technical problems. Unless you\u0026rsquo;re the sort of software developer who just sells the same piece of software over and over again, at some point in time you\u0026rsquo;ll to need to find out how to implement some feature you\u0026rsquo;ve never tried before. Or you\u0026rsquo;ll hit a problem that\u0026rsquo;s not documented in any official docs and you need that critical functionality.",
