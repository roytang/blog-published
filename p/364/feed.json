Everywhere you go in UP, people would be asking you if you were coming to the big rally on EDSA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday?

Right now, people just don\u0026rsquo;t care. At least not the people that matter, not the average middle-class joe too busy earning a living, yet not poor enough to be part of a hakot crowd. The current crisis has apparently not yet reached it\u0026rsquo;s breaking point, despite the calls from different sectors for Gloria\u0026rsquo;s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy not impeachment, which is a legal avenue made available by the 1986 constitution specifically for such situations? The opposition argues that it is an administration trap, that her allies would merely squelch the investigation. This is madness. The administration would not dare do such a thing, as they know full well the trigger of Erap\u0026rsquo;s downfall was the second envelope fiasco, and any similar attempt at whitewash would be too much of a risk. One of the reasons why not many people aren\u0026rsquo;t too enthusiastic about extraconstitutional methods \u0026ndash; they haven\u0026rsquo;t even tried the legal remedies yet. When those remedies fail, then maybe, just maybe, people might start caring about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want to read more opinions?

When I first heard they were making a Fantastic Four movie, my first reaction was, \u0026ldquo;Uh\u0026hellip; that can\u0026rsquo;t be good.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plot is barely servicable\u0026hellip; the thing that really made me think \u0026ldquo;suxxor\u0026rdquo; was how Victor von Doom\u0026rsquo;s role was handled. I mean, in the comics, Doom was a monarch, ruler of Latveria. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t a madman bent on revenge. He was a madman bent on world domination!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the comics, Dr. Doom is like a machiavellian villain, craving for power, but never exposing himself directly to harm. He\u0026rsquo;d always get his minions to do dirty work for him, and just when the Fantastic Four thought they had him — damn, it was a Doombot all along! Curse you, Doom, you got away again! In the movie, Dr. Doom is like, \u0026ldquo;Holy crap, I\u0026rsquo;m bankrupt and Richards stole my girlfriend! I\u0026rsquo;ll use these newly-acquired non-canon cosmic powers to kick his ass! And maybe get into a punching contest with the Thing, or see if I survive a supernova.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother thing, the FF hardly do anything \u0026ldquo;heroic\u0026rdquo; here. The only time they really do a public service (the scene at the bridge) would have been avoided if the Thing wasn\u0026rsquo;t who he was. Yet, despite this, the people of New York (hm\u0026hellip; was it New York? Well, the Baxter Building was there, so\u0026hellip; ) easily accept them as heroes. This is ridiculous. Movie Spiderman did a whole lot of good deeds, but he received also a whole lot of crap before people started to realize he was a hero. And he\u0026rsquo;s just wearing a mask. What makes people think the people would so easily accept someone like the Thing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Thing is of course, the most tragic member of the FF, and a good part of the movie focuses on the problems caused by his transformation and his desire to find a cure. To compensate, he gets all the funny scenes, such as they are. There\u0026rsquo;s one that reminds me an old Simpsons joke: \u0026ldquo;Your fingers are too fat for this phone\u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best thing about this movie? The Fantastic Four are represented quite accurately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Edit 11-Jul-2005: Actually, the best parts were those involving the Thing and the Torch. Reed was pretty much what I expected, but Sue\u0026rsquo;s character was quite weak, and at some points Jessica Alba seemed uncomfortable with it. It can\u0026rsquo;t be helped though, as before Franklin was born, Sue Storm-Richards had the weakest character development in the comics, and her lacking role in the movie simply reflects that.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worst thing about this movie? Doctor Doom and the people of New York are not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best line in the movie?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s clobbering time.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

That way, I can at least say I\u0026rsquo;m basing my opinions on known facts unlike roughly 90% of the rest of the participants in this debacle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went through it in about thirty minutes, skimming most and picking out only the parts that seemed most interesting, and skipping anything that was too vague or that I didn\u0026rsquo;t strictly understand the mechanics of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe primary question about this transcript is of course, did Gloria conspire with Garcillano to cheat?

The observant reader should note that (a) GMA did not ask the man Gary to do anything. However, Gary implied doing something illegal which she should have spoken against; and (b) Any manipulation at this point does not seem aimed at stealing a victory, but rather making the victory appear to be a decisive victory\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConversation between Gary and an unidentified woman believed to be PGMA on 02 22:29 hotel June\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col start=\"4\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: Hello, ma’am.

If they avoid, can get rid of, explain away or otherwise cancel out these two excerpts, GMA can easily avoid culpability from the rest of the transcript. For all we know, there could be some wacky explanation that has a small probability of being true. (\u0026ldquo;One million votes? No, we were talking about one million man-minutes spent counting the ballots!\u0026rdquo; — Okay, so I\u0026rsquo;m not very creative right now.

The Batman here is nowhere near Joel Schumacher\u0026rsquo;s colorful crusader, or Adam West\u0026rsquo;s *Biff*Pow*Sock* type of action. This Batman is a true dark knight, striking from the shadows, unseen, terrifying.

As I suspected\u0026hellip; Yahoo compensates for the unwrappable words by expanding the grid cell, breaking the layout. This was a problem I encountered before in the webapps at workand I still don\u0026rsquo;t have a solution that would work in all browsers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m also interested in how popular webapps handle timestamping, so I try this out as well. For the uninformed, timestamping means handling the case where two people both try to edit the same record at roughly the same time. If there\u0026rsquo;s no handling, the person who updates first usually has his changes lost, without any notification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI try it out first with Yahoo Address Book and Notepad. Both experiments fail\u0026hellip; there\u0026rsquo;s no timestamping. I tested it by opening a record (Address Book entry/Notepad note) for updating in two separate Firefox tabs. I update one tab and save, then update the second tab and save. Changes made in the first tab are lost.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWell, I guess that\u0026rsquo;s okay, since technically, only one person at a time is expected to access these webapps. So I do something else. I create \u003ca href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/roytang/\"\u003ea Yahoo Group\u003c/a\u003e . I get two moderators, me and a dummy email account. I login with both accounts, using Firefox for one and IE for the other. I try to update the group description with one account, then the other. Bam! First guy\u0026rsquo;s changes are lost, without notification! If this were some sort of mission-critical webapp, that would be a dangerous bug.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m sleepy. More later.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Some comments on the Yahoo webapps.\n The next/previous links on top of Yahoo mail messages are confusing. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if they take me up or down the mail-list. Gmail is better, since it explicitly says \u0026ldquo;older\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;newer\u0026rdquo;; With Yahoo, I\u0026rsquo;m always wrong when I guess. After some experimenting, I figure it out. \u0026ldquo;Next\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Previous\u0026rdquo; are based on the sort order in the list of messages. Since the default is sorted by date descending (newest first), \u0026ldquo;Next\u0026rdquo; corresponds to Yahoo\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;older\u0026rdquo; by default.",

Unlike most other guy kids, I preferred the Transformers to G.I. Joe. I guess I preferred high-tech fantasy over soliders back then, with the war of the heroic Autobots and the Evil Decepticons appealing more to my young mind than soldiers trying to fight terrorists. I watched the show, I read the comics (the first comic series I really collected), I had a lunch box, and I even bought and ate the unhealthy cheap knock-off Transformers-branded chips they sold near the St. Joseph parish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTransformers: the Movie was the pinnacle of my childhood experience with the Transformers cartoon, since the seasons following the movie were never broadcast on Philippine TV. I watched it yesterday, hoping I would still find the old charm which enthralled me as a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was not disappointed. Well, not much anyway. As an adult I\u0026rsquo;ve grown more critical of things in general, quick to spot and point out minute flaws. Some notes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe year is 2005 in Transformers the Movie, some 19 years after the movie\u0026rsquo;s actual release. At least they didn\u0026rsquo;t predict flying cars like Back to the Future, but how come we don\u0026rsquo;t yet have cars that look like Hot Rod? The \u0026ldquo;futuristic\u0026rdquo; look of the six new Autobots introduced in the movie (Ultra Magnus, Hot Rod, Kup, Blurr, Springer and Arcee) give you an indication of how the people of 80s perceived future transportation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, Transformers can use lightsabers, er\u0026hellip; Laser Swords! Megatron pulls one out during his fatal battle with Optimus Prime, and later in the movie one of the Autobots does too. (I think it was Hot Rod, I forget.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmazingly, while the Autobots and Decepticons never actually hit each other with their weapons in the TV series, their appearance in a movie suddenly made Starscream\u0026rsquo;s use of the Megatron-gun a lot more efficient, accurate and lethal. Ironhide, Prowl, Brawn and Ratchet go down with a single shot each in the first few minutes of the movie. More Autobots died in the first twenty minutes than in the entire run of the series prior to the movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be much of a problem if the Autobots actually had the same numbers they had in the series. It\u0026rsquo;s a well-known fact that the Autobots greatly outnumbered the Decepticons almost all the time, since there are far more types of cars than there are jets and guns and other stuff. But in the movie, there are apprently less than twenty Autobots still in active service. What happened to the rest? We\u0026rsquo;re limited to Optimus Prime, the more popular first-batch Autobots, the Dinobots and the new guys. The Decepticons get a slightly better deal. They get both the first and second batch of jets, the Constructicons, Insecticons, and even the triple-changers Blitzwing and Astrotrain. Also, I think Blaster\u0026rsquo;s cassette-bots make their first cartoon appearance here. Conspiciously absent are the second set of ‘combiner\u0026rsquo; teams\u0026hellip; the Protectobots, Aerialbots, Combaticons and Stunticons. Some of the fights might have gone better had the Autobots thought to bring around Omega Supreme or Skyfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dinobots are apparently stupider than I remember. I guess my memories preferred the comic-book Dinobots, where Grimlock actually managed to become Autobot leader. Here Blurr has trouble convincing them to board a ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s too bad the Autobots didn\u0026rsquo;t think of bringing Optimus Prime to the planet of junk, where apprently an Autobot can still live after being blown into some twenty-thousand pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ultra Magnus character was created solely to have someone fail to be a leader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrangely enough, when the Autobots crash through Unicron\u0026rsquo;s eye, we don\u0026rsquo;t see any sort of optic sensors on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the movie went pretty much as I remembered it. With a lot of forgettable 80s-style music running in the background. Amazingly, at the end, Rodimus Prime declares an end to the Cybertronian wars, and a new era of peace. I don\u0026rsquo;t recall any peace being negotiated with the Decepticons, who looked like they outnumbered the Autobots fifteen-million to one during Unicron\u0026rsquo;s attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m quite relieved, as watching the movie failed to change my nostalgic childhood memories of the Transformers, although I still vastly prefer the comic book series. Not at all bad for a series made to sell toys.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
