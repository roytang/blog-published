            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA couple of years ago, two friends and I were being tourists in Barcelona. With its wide, spacious streets and strangely uniform city blocks, we walked around a lot. During one of our tourist days, we decided to eat some \u003cem\u003epaella\u003c/em\u003e on the way back to our AirBNB. Who comes to Barcelona and doesn\u0026rsquo;t eat \u003cem\u003epaella\u003c/em\u003e right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ended up walking for quite a while. Every time we came upon a new restaurant that served \u003cem\u003epaella\u003c/em\u003e we would consider the price and the restaurant and would think, hey maybe we can find somewhere better or cheaper further along the way. At one point a Pinoy working in a nearby restaurant even overheard us talking about it in Tagalog and he called after us as we walked away. \u0026ldquo;Dito, mura lang!\u0026rdquo;, but we paid him no heed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could we know which restaurant was the best one until we walked all the way and saw all the options? But walking all the way back to the AirBNB to see all the options meant we would go for a longer time tired and hungry, so that was obviously no good. Even worse, we may find at the end of the walk that the best choice was too far back and we end up with a suboptimal \u003cem\u003epaella\u003c/em\u003e. At some point, we would have to decide that \u0026ldquo;Okay, the \u003cem\u003epaella\u003c/em\u003e here looks good enough, let\u0026rsquo;s eat here.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought it was kind of a metaphor for life and choices and such. You can\u0026rsquo;t know ahead of time whether the options presented to you now are the best you\u0026rsquo;ll ever get. But at some point you have to stop browsing and overthinking and decide to settle for something that is \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo;. Sometimes it turns out great, sometimes it ends poorly, but it\u0026rsquo;s almost always a gamble. Life decisions are only hard if we make them hard. But as long as you made the best decision with your limited information, I think you can always choose to live without regret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ended up eating at this small diner near our AirBNB. It was run by an Asian dude and his family, though it seemed they spoke better Spanish than they did Chinese or whatever. I had the Valencian \u003cem\u003epaella\u003c/em\u003e which had meat instead of seafood or whatever (no surprise for anyone who knows my dietary habits.) I don\u0026rsquo;t know whether it was the best or the cheapest \u003cem\u003epaella\u003c/em\u003e we could have eaten that day, but I could tell you it was pretty damn good anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

They\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be on a road trip to get Noctis married, but things happen along the way and eventually they have to figure out how to liberate their homeland from The Evil Empire. That\u0026rsquo;s the backstory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story as presented in the game has a few problems. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of significant back story and goings-on that happen off-camera:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s both a feature-length movie (Kingsglaive) and a six-episode anime (Brotherhood) that expounds on the four main characters\u0026rsquo; backgrounds and how the current political situation got to where it is\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s supposedly a whole effort by minor characters like Cor to organize a resistance against the Empire, but we\u0026rsquo;re never really exposed to it\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThen there\u0026rsquo;s Lunafreya, Noctis\u0026rsquo; betrothed, who goes off and does her own stuff to try to undermine the Empire and supposedly help Noctis, but for most of the game it\u0026rsquo;s never really explained what exactly she\u0026rsquo;s doing or how it\u0026rsquo;s relevant\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOne of your friends, Gladio, goes off on a short sidequest of his own and vanishes for a while, and it\u0026rsquo;s never explained WTH that was about. Presumably it will be covered in a future DLC.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother problem is that Noctis and the gang spend most of the game sort of lollygagging around enjoying their road trip without much sense of urgency. Understandably they wanted to present an open world this time (since much of the criticism of FFXIII was for its linearity), but the problem is that the open world is filled with a lot of frivolous things that don\u0026rsquo;t seem particularly urgent given the fate of the world being at stake. I mean, the party spends a lot of time camping out, cooking food, fishing, taking pictures, driving around looking for auto parts, and so on. The sense of urgency is not apparent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suppose the lack of urgency is an acceptable trade-off for the open world, but even for the supposed main story quests in the earlier chapters, it\u0026rsquo;s not immediately clear how they serve to help you overcome the Empire. I feel like there should have been more story quests related to helping establish a resistance and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe later chapters narrow down the open world significantly, and the second half of the game takes place outside the main continent where there is significantly less freedom to explore. It feels a bit like they spent a lot of their design budget on the open world half and so just restricted the second half to the meaty story parts. Reminds me a bit of Xenogears disc 2!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the chapters near the end was also executed very poorly. To establish a sense of tension, most of the systems you had been relying on throughout the game are taken away from you. While this would have been okay for a short segment, the chapter goes on a bit too long and ends up being far too tedious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did find myself surprised by events leading up to the final chapter, although I felt like it was another wasted opportunity. The final chapter gives us a glimpse at a different version of the open world but never really let us see most of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ending itself was bittersweet (and easily trolled haha), but I found it an acceptable ending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharacters\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#789f63e586a9f7d449e790cce4b79cef-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2017/03/review-final-fantasy-xv/RTcRL3u_hu255f50146e4af4e11739e93a6fe4223b_226845_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"789f63e586a9f7d449e790cce4b79cef-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2017/03/review-final-fantasy-xv/RTcRL3u.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"18 Mar 2017 1:30am\"\u003e18 Mar 2017 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I found the main cast of Noctis, Ignis, Gladio and Prompto to have engaging personalities, they don\u0026rsquo;t really have much backstory in-game (most of the character backstories are in Brotherhood). In fact, later on, a startling revelation is made about one of them and none of them really bat an eye at all. It was in the sense of \u0026ldquo;hey, we don\u0026rsquo;t care about that, we\u0026rsquo;re your friends,\u0026rdquo; but it still felt like something that should have been explored further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interaction among the group is great though. They regularly banter and tease each other even during combat. It really felt like they were a group of long-time friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**Combat **\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m an old-school FF fan, so I\u0026rsquo;ll be the first to admit I miss ye olde active time battle. FFXV\u0026rsquo;s battles take place entirely in real-time, with the player controlling Noctis and the other characters controlled by AI. The AI control goes about as well as you could expect, they do fine against weak enemies but against tougher battles you find yourself constantly having to help them with potions or other items. You can command them to do special attacks when available, and they will participate in combo attacks when possible, but for the most part it\u0026rsquo;s just Noctis warping and striking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#d82d2b78eee302311886bbe6f8f6f938-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2017/03/review-final-fantasy-xv/iEmsTOE_hu255f50146e4af4e11739e93a6fe4223b_259480_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"d82d2b78eee302311886bbe6f8f6f938-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2017/03/review-final-fantasy-xv/iEmsTOE.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"18 Mar 2017 1:30am\"\u003e18 Mar 2017 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCombat is fluid and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of movement and jumping around and looking for opportunities to strike from behind. Early on you are discouraged from wandering around at night as the enemies might be too high level, but the combat system is set up such that most tough battles can be overcome simply by having enough recovery items around. I only got a game over once, early in the game when didn\u0026rsquo;t know what I was doing and I tried wandering at night and promptly got squashed by an iron giant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Open World\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe open world gives the party a lot to do. There\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;hunts\u0026rdquo; dished out by people in diners (basically quests to go kill a specific bunch of monsters) and other side quests given out by various characters. There\u0026rsquo;s a fishing minigame, because apparently it\u0026rsquo;s a hobby of Noctis. The fishing minigame is okay, except I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the patience to try to get the most difficult fish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there\u0026rsquo;s the photos and the food porn. A lot of pandering to the modern-day youths here, I\u0026rsquo;m surprised instagram hasn\u0026rsquo;t been invented in their world. Cooking is Ignis\u0026rsquo; specialty, and the game renders each dish really well, sometimes enough to make you hungry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the photos are the specialty of Prompto. It\u0026rsquo;s one of those things that feels really frivolous in the game. Every time you camp you can browse pictures that Prompto has taken so you can save them for later viewing. A later patch provided a photo mode that you can control directly. There\u0026rsquo;s an entire reddit thread about how players have snapped more pics for this game than for their own vacations!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I\u0026rsquo;m no exception. Exporting a lot of photos is a pain though, as there is no batch export option in-game.

I got the Platinum trophy, but I felt like it was a bit too easy, as there was still a lot of things to do in the game outside of the achievements. I don\u0026rsquo;t want annoying grindy achievements, but I don\u0026rsquo;t want them to be too easy and \u0026ldquo;no challenge\u0026rdquo; either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther stuff\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had this weird Chocobo carnival DLC that somehow takes place in another timeline or something LOL.

Classic FF beasties like the Malboro still make an appearance (and are still a pain to fight!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weirdest thing overall has to be the Cup Noodles thing! They had some sort of tie-up with Nissin and Cup Noodles is one of the meals your party can have in the game and Gladio is obsessed with them. Later on you even get a quest to try to find a way to improve on Cup Noodles and it ends with the characters saying there\u0026rsquo;s really no beating the original since it has a perfect mix of ingredients already.

Nowadays for an RPG that\u0026rsquo;s very quick for me, an indication of how much I liked the game. There\u0026rsquo;s a bunch more content planned for it, including DLC story packs for each of the other main characters, and high-end boss fights and what not. Not sure if I\u0026rsquo;d still play those since there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more RPGs on the horizon (2017 is a good year for RPG gamers.)
