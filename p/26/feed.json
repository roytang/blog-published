            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve basically been using GMail as my main email account since I first got access in 2006ish. \u0026ldquo;Main email account\u0026rdquo; means I use it as the primary access point for all my other online accounts. GMail was certainly revolutionary when it came out, and had a lot of benefits: it was fast, easily searchable and had a lot of free storage. But in the modern day, there are significant disadvantages to using GMail:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eyou don\u0026rsquo;t control your account; it\u0026rsquo;s rare, but anecdotally people have lost access to their GMail accounts for some perceived infraction, and when that happens you have no way of recovery or appeal\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eyou\u0026rsquo;re fueling a surveillance capitalism machine\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eit can \u003ca href=\"/2020/05/1263160405737607170/\"\u003elook unprofessional\u003c/a\u003e to be using free email, especially for official or business correspondence\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first bullet point is the biggie for me. One such story came across the Hacker News front page a while back and I can only imagine the nightmare it would be for me to lose access to my Google account. Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve started a conscious effort to slowly but surely decouple myself from my dependencies on Google Services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat meant migrating my online accounts to use another email, primarily one I control. I already had this domain \u003ca href=\"https://roytang.net\"\u003eroytang.net\u003c/a\u003e, so there\u0026rsquo;s no reason to not use emails with that domain. The only risk to using an email on your own domain is that if you forgot to renew your domain, or otherwise lose control, you are screwed. So\u0026hellip; don\u0026rsquo;t let that happen I guess?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only question was what email service provider to use? I\u0026rsquo;m still on Webfaction hosting, and they do provide email accounts, but I\u0026rsquo;m planning to move away from them before the end of the year \u003ca href=\"/2019/03/rip-webfaction/\"\u003edue to the GoDaddy purchase\u003c/a\u003e, so probably best not to be reliant on their email service. If I wanted more control over the risks, I could of course run my own mail servers, but I\u0026rsquo;m not ready to go that far yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first one I tried was \u003ca href=\"https://protonmail.com/\"\u003eProtonMail\u003c/a\u003e because yay, end-to-end encryption! I used it for a couple of months first before paying for anything (using a custom domain email requires a paid plan). Unfortunately, I felt like the additional security wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth the trouble of not being super portable. Accessing via mobile required their app, can\u0026rsquo;t use any generic email client. I also wanted to be able to access via a desktop client like Thunderbird or Mail on the Macbook Air, but that required some sort of SMTP bridge, and it seemed like a bother. Every time I set up a new machine I\u0026rsquo;d need it? I\u0026rsquo;m not super security-conscious, so I decided to keep the protonmail account as a secondary account, in case I did come to a situation where e2e encryption was absolutely critical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI next tried \u003ca href=\"https://www.migadu.com\"\u003emigadu.com\u003c/a\u003e as an email provider, based on \u003ca href=\"https://cmpwn.com/@sir/102452352875414214\"\u003ethis recommendation thread\u003c/a\u003e by Drew Devault over on Mastodon. Their web settings aren\u0026rsquo;t super refined, but everything was relatively easy to setup. And their free tier includes support for custom domains and multiple mailboxes per domain, so that\u0026rsquo;s a big plus. I\u0026rsquo;ve been using them now for a few months and am generally happy with the service. (They did have a short bout of server access issues around the time the covid19 thing started getting around, but they resolved it pretty quickly.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter choosing an email service provider, the next step was setting up emails and shifting over all my online accounts. Migadu\u0026rsquo;s support for unlimited mailboxes meant I could have separate email addresses for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003econtact email for other online accounts\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epublicly accessible contact email on the website\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eprivate email for communication with friends\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eetc\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ended up updating over 50 online accounts to point to the new domain email. Not all in one go, as that\u0026rsquo;s terribly boring, but a few at a time over the course of the last few months. That covers social media services, gaming services, financial services, dev tools, and so on. The upside of all this effort is I got to do a kind of audit of all my online accounts, which ones could be deleted/deactivated, which ones needed new passwords, which ones have poor security measures, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheoretically, I only need to do this once. An advantage to using custom domain emails is that if you\u0026rsquo;re unhappy with your underlying email provider, you can switch to a different one while retaining the same email addresses, no need to update emails in all your other online accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, I had no intention of using webmail anymore, so I ended up installing Thunderbird (it\u0026rsquo;s been a while old friend) for accessing these accounts, and also set up the Mail app on the Macbook Air. For the phone, I installed K-9 mail, although I\u0026rsquo;m having an issue with that currently where it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be doing background syncing of mails. Not a super critical issue, as I mostly don\u0026rsquo;t want to be pinged real-time by email anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m still keeping the GMail account of course, a lot of people still know me by that email address, but now I have a largely reduced footprint and dependency on it. And as mentioned, I\u0026rsquo;m also keeping the ProtonMail account for any security-conscious communications. So I ended up having to manage a lot more email addresses, but hopefully everything will be a bit more organized, with every account having a specific purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA while back I got an export of my Foursquare/Swarm data. If you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar, these were a pair of apps that were used for \u0026ldquo;checking-in\u0026rdquo; to particular locations, with a sort of gamification system where if you checked in at a place often enough, you would earn points and eventually become \u0026ldquo;Mayor\u0026rdquo; of the venue. The idea being that owners of those venues might give some benefits to those who check-in often at those locations (AFAIK, this never really caught on in the Philippines). I wasn\u0026rsquo;t a super active user of Foursquare/Swarm, I had maybe 500ish check-ins from 2010-2017 when I stopped using it. Some people are still using it up to now and have thousands of check-ins, although as far as I can tell it\u0026rsquo;s no longer very popular in the Philippines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I thought having this data would be handy so I put it up as location data on this site. It also gave me an excuse to figure out how to render OpenStreetMap. (The location pages are one of the few pages that have JavaScript on this site.) The \u003ca href=\"/locations/\"\u003elocations page\u003c/a\u003e shows a map of all the visited locations and a listing of the locations grouped by country, and for the Philippines, by city (where available). You can click through to individual locations to see how often I\u0026rsquo;ve checked in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, one of the venues with the most number of check-ins for me is \u003ca href=\"/locations/4d27f36c8292236a41e814bb/\"\u003eBBQ Chicken\u003c/a\u003e, a now-closed Korean-themed BBQ chicken place in Ortigas near where I used to work. Another one with a lot of check-ins would be \u003ca href=\"/locations/4bbbfea5ed7776b032413f51/\"\u003eMurphy\u0026rsquo;s in Makati\u003c/a\u003e where we did a lot of quiz nights from 2011-2013. Obviously, the location data isn\u0026rsquo;t complete and doesn\u0026rsquo;t capture all my visits, since I didn\u0026rsquo;t use Foursquare/Swarm that religiously anyway. I\u0026rsquo;m certain I\u0026rsquo;ve eaten at BBQ Chicken more than the 18 times I checked in!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-about-privacy\"\u003eWhat about privacy?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually telling the internet where you are all the time might seem a bit anathema to the more privacy-conscious modern world, but I do like having a history of where I\u0026rsquo;ve been. I even have location tracking enabled on my phone via Google Maps so that I can have a timeline of where I am on a day-by-day basis. I\u0026rsquo;ve used it more than once to answer queries like \u0026ldquo;do you know if we went to \u003cplace\u003e in \u003cmonth\u003e of last year?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;When did you last go to \u003cstore\u003e ?\u0026rdquo; Obviously it\u0026rsquo;s not for everyone and I fully understand the privacy ramifications of Google having all my location data and feeding the mightly global surveillance capitalism machine, but for me right now it\u0026rsquo;s an acceptable tradeoff. As for the foursquare data, I was using foursquare back when I was less privacy-conscious that I am now, so I my attitude is like, that particular dataset has been out in the world for years, I can\u0026rsquo;t put the toothpaste back in the bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, I did scrub some old check-ins from this data (and the corresponding data on Swarm and on Twitter if it was cross-posted)) that was a bit too close to home. I know this data potentially allows bad guys or assassins or whatnot to figure out where I live, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d at least make it a tiny bit more difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-now\"\u003eWhat now?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is just a neat little thing that probably only I will care about, as it lets me see some of the places I\u0026rsquo;ve been to. And I probably won\u0026rsquo;t be using 4sq/Swarm again, so the dataset probably won\u0026rsquo;t be growing. That being said, I do want to add some future features like grouping the check-ins according to trips, so I can see all the particular places where I went to on particular trips. Many of my trips are missing data though; for example, my only check-in in France was in the airport, and not at any of the touristy places we went to. I may try to supplement this data with selected extracts from my Google Maps location history (hopefully it\u0026rsquo;s easy to figure out!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also don\u0026rsquo;t know where to put the locations page in the menus lol. I\u0026rsquo;ll figure it out sooner or later!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "A while back I got an export of my Foursquare/Swarm data. If you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar, these were a pair of apps that were used for \u0026ldquo;checking-in\u0026rdquo; to particular locations, with a sort of gamification system where if you checked in at a place often enough, you would earn points and eventually become \u0026ldquo;Mayor\u0026rdquo; of the venue. The idea being that owners of those venues might give some benefits to those who check-in often at those locations (AFAIK, this never really caught on in the Philippines).",

This despite the NTC earlier promising they can operate provisionally while the franchise renewal is being processed, a change of heart apparently due to a legal opinion by the SolGen. Some thoughts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"bias\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;Bias\u0026rdquo;\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe speaker of the house \u003ca href=\"https://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2020/05/15/cayetano-slams-bias-at-abs-cbn/\"\u003esays\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you are one of the reasons why there are issues with your network. In the eyes of some, there is clear bias and meddling in the elections, which is against the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, IDK what this supposed election meddling is that he\u0026rsquo;s talking about (If they have really done such a thing that is illegal, they can be charged in court, but AFAIK there are no such cases?), but speaking on the issue of \u0026ldquo;bias\u0026rdquo;: we cannot require that a news entity be unbiased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRepeating for emphasis: \u003cstrong\u003ewe cannot require that a news entity be unbiased\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy, you say? It comes back to the nature of bias, and the nature of humans. Every individual human is biased towards certain things, as a result of their experiences growing up. No matter how well-read or well-traveled or well-learned you are, your individual human experience is but a fraction of a fraction of an infinitessimal fraction of the collective human experience. Therefore, you will exhibit bias naturally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrganizations are pretty much the same, since they are composed of biased humans. Any given organization can strive to be less biased by having members with diverse points of view and opinion. And in fact it would be better if our news entities were as unbiased as possible, this would be ideal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we (through the state) cannot require that such entities be unbiased, for the simple reason that determination of bias will itself be tainted by bias. There can be no absolute, objective standard for being unbiased, because who would make that judgement? Who would make the rules? Humans, who are also biased? Imposing such a vague restriction on news entities (\u0026ldquo;you must be unbiased\u0026rdquo;) is tantamount to imposing someone else\u0026rsquo;s will (and bias) upon the entity, and that encroaches upon the freedom of expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can impose specific restrictions on freedoms of expression and the press through law; examples are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edisallowing knowingly publishing falsehoods through libel laws (although this too is problematic, since truth is also not always measurable nor absolute)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edisallowing child pornography\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efalse fire alarms in a crowded theater\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eetc\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe important thing is that specific, measurable things can be disallowed, since presumably these can be evaluated fairly (or as fairly as possible). More dangerous are restrictions that depend upon the whims of those in power, such as commonly found in authoritarian countries like China.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t want to get into the nitty-gritty legalities of it, since I am not a lawyer. But my main point is that like it or not, we can\u0026rsquo;t require news entities to be unbiased. We want them to be as close to that as possible ideally, but we can\u0026rsquo;t require it, because that is not enforceable fairly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout ABS-CBN specifically, I don\u0026rsquo;t even see any bias; I mean, if anything, many of their news anchors and celebrities seem to be supportive of the administration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(You might disagree with me, but that\u0026rsquo;s just your bias, and that\u0026rsquo;s fine.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"press-freedom-access-to-information-and-other-concerns\"\u003ePress Freedom, Access to Information, and other concerns\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people have commented that press freedom still exists in the Philippines despite the ABS-CBN shutdown, citing reasons such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eexistence of other networks\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eABS-CBN still being able to broadcast over digital channels\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epeople still being able to criticize the government\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this is true, that the Philippines does still enjoy some press freedom, undoubtedly:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eany reduction in the diversity of news sources is harmful to democratic society since it reduces access to information\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003enot everyone has access to cable or internet channels through which ABS-CBN programs can still be accessed, thus depriving many people of a source of information (and in some cases the only source of information they had available)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe mere fact that the government, on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/168137-duterte-block-abs-cbn-franchise-renewal\"\u003epresident\u0026rsquo;s whim and vindictiveness\u003c/a\u003e (no one really believes the NTC and the SolGen and even the House are acting independently), has taken the biggest network off the air leads to what is called a \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect\"\u003echilling effect\u003c/a\u003e, basically sending a message to everybody else. If even the biggest network in the country can be taken down, what chance do smaller outfits or independent journalists have?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople have cited other reasons why ABS-CBN should have not been taken down, like the fact that X number of workers would lose their jobs. For me, that\u0026rsquo;s extraneous. Of course we don\u0026rsquo;t want anyone to lose their livelihoods, but that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be necessary to contemplate: on the basis of the harms to democracy and press freedom alone this should not have happened. And especially not during a pandemic, when getting information out to people can be crucial!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand the requirement for Congress to approve broadcast franchises, since broadcast frequencies are a limited resource. But if it were me: the grant of provisional franchise upon expiry would be automatic unless explicitly revoked by Congress with clear violations specified as the cause of revokation. And the grant of franchise should probably explicity specify the conditions upon which the franchise may not be renewed. The grant or renewal of broadcast franchises should be as free of politics as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"how-to-police-bad-news-entities\"\u003eHow to police \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; news entities?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we can\u0026rsquo;t impose unbiasedness, and shutting them down violates press freedom, how do we control wayward news entities? Since humans are biased, we have no universal definition of \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo;, but there are still some controls that society can impose, not necssarily through law:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethrough law, specific restrictions as described above\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIdeally, it should be the market and news consumers themselves who are able to control the biases of the news entities, by not patronizing news entities that tend to be editorialized. (Although this probably requires a more educated populace, see: Fox News). ABS-CBN itself is still super popular, in spite of everything.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"etc\"\u003eEtc\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chilling effect on free expression has a slippery slope. Already the government has started going after critics allegedly for social media posts. If we are not careful, we might be on the road to becoming like China. (Which might be what Duterte and his cult following want, but certainly won\u0026rsquo;t be good for a democratic Philippines).\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Sadly, we didn\u0026rsquo;t too well in this week\u0026rsquo;s quizzes. I did win the Geekfight one last Wednesday, but the other two were a wash. As if that weren\u0026rsquo;t enough, we also decided to do internal trivia team quizzes, with the intent of putting them up on our \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCptXvNbp4ETVttb_k-1oOww\"\u003erelatively-new Youtube channel\u003c/a\u003e (Subscribe, etc).

This reminds me of a convo I had with a friend a couple of years back when he saw one of my blog posts. He was getting into content creation himself via a Youtube channel and he asked me what kind of traffic or how many visitors I see on my blog, and I was like \u0026ldquo;You know what, I have no idea!\u0026rdquo; because I never really got into that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to have Google Analytics on the site back when I first migrated to Hugo, because the initial theme I used supported it and why not right? But I got rid of it when I did the redesign because I didn\u0026rsquo;t really use it and didn\u0026rsquo;t care for the additional JavaScript and tracking and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I do have are server-side stats via AWStats, which I do look at maybe once every couple or years or so. For the purposes of this post I decided to pull the server-side stats into a \u003ca href=\"/page/stats/awstats/\"\u003epage on this site\u003c/a\u003e. So if you check that page, I had 29292 unique visitors for the entirety of 2019. That\u0026rsquo;s around 80 visitors per day. The peak was in 2017, when I had around 135 visitors per day. These are pretty weak numbers I guess? I don\u0026rsquo;t really know, but obviously I haven\u0026rsquo;t gone viral or gotten on the frontpage of HN/reddit or anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0026rsquo;s fine! Traffic isn\u0026rsquo;t why I write, and any visitors above 0 are kind of a bonus, since I write mostly for myself! I feel like optimizing for traffic or SEO or whatever would be a bit like selling your soul. I think the whole point of the original post was a nostalgia for the old-style blogs that were writing for the sake of writing, and not to cater to the whims of the search engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do like engagement though, mostly in the form of comments, which is something I have \u003ca href=\"/page/stats/site/\"\u003ebeen tracking before\u003c/a\u003e. (Other than the comments, you can see that most of the stats that I track are \u003cem\u003emy\u003c/em\u003e stats, i.e. how much I post and so on.) Again, it\u0026rsquo;s not a whole lot, but it\u0026rsquo;s enough to feel a bit rewarding every time a new comment comes in. I recently disabled the comment form for the site (been getting too much spam), but this site can still get new comments via webmention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is nice to know that there are actually people out there reading my words. I do know some friends of mine follow the blog somehow (or maybe they just pick up the posts when I syndicate to Twitter), but it\u0026rsquo;s actually more fun when a stranger leaves a good comment!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"on-self-censorship\"\u003eOn Self-Censorship\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone on HN mentioned:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, this is why I don’t have a blog. I have a lot of strong opinions that might be interesting to some people, but I don’t want to miss opportunities because some HR person googled my name and found a post they disagreed with. Or, in the future, not a real person but an algorithm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess this is a result of the current climate, where people can get \u0026ldquo;cancelled\u0026rdquo; for things they\u0026rsquo;ve said in the past etc. And I guess that\u0026rsquo;s a valid concern, if you want to live your life that way. But really, how strong are your opinions if you can\u0026rsquo;t stand for them in public?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I write something, on this blog or elsewhere on the internet, it\u0026rsquo;s because I believe it to be true, at that time. (Or I may also be shitposting, but it should be obvious when I\u0026rsquo;m shitposting.) I\u0026rsquo;ve written some political stuff on the blog and elsewhere on the internet before, and I often criticize my country\u0026rsquo;s government when the opportunity arises. This might become problematic recently, as Duterte\u0026rsquo;s administration has started harassing critics by filing charges against them and so on. But even if it comes to that, I like to think that I would be willing to stand by what I write.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like to think it\u0026rsquo;s because I tend to be right all the time (LOL), but also if I\u0026rsquo;ve said or done or posted something before that would later turn out to be inaccurate or offensive or whatnot, I have no concerns about walking that back and saying \u0026ldquo;Hey, I made a mistake!\u0026rdquo;. That\u0026rsquo;s another advantage running your own blog has over something like Twitter. On Twitter you can only delete your past mistakes. Here I can preserve them, but add a note saying something like \u0026ldquo;My opinion on this has changed\u0026rdquo; or such. I have not yet had a reason to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(I think it helps that I largely hold non-controversial opinions and generally try to avoid being an asshole to people, but that\u0026rsquo;s probably the topic of another post entirely.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s also the idea that you may want to write things that you don\u0026rsquo;t want associated with you IRL. I can understand that. For those kinds of things, you can make one-off posts using throwaway accounts I guess? For me, from the very beginning of my internet presence, I haven\u0026rsquo;t considered anonymizing or protecting my content. My geocities URL had my full name in it for example (and so does this domain!). But I have made some throwaway posts that aren\u0026rsquo;t tied to me, for example when talking about sensitive information or such. But I think for a large majority of the content a regular person would post, this isn\u0026rsquo;t really necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"on-originality\"\u003eOn Originality\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI often notice when I start writing on a particular topic, I learn more about my thoughts and opinions of it and realize my thoughts are wrong or not really novel. Halfway in I give up since I feel like, \u0026ldquo;oh, this actually isn\u0026rsquo;t really adding anything new to the conversation\u0026rdquo;. Then I leave with a new humbleness about my beliefs but also a sense of \u0026ldquo;when am I actually going to know enough to warrant writing about it?\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in a blogging lull around 2010-2015 (as seen on \u003ca href=\"/page/stats/site/\"\u003ethe stats page\u003c/a\u003e!) and thinking of getting back into it and writing more software-related content, but I mentioned to a friend that I was worried that the internet was already oversaturated with such writers/bloggers and I would not have anything original to contribute. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember his exact words, but it was one of the best pieces of writing advice I had ever gotten, something along the lines of: \u0026ldquo;No one else is going to be writing with your perspective and your point of view, so no matter what, you are bringing something to the table.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"on-discoverability\"\u003eOn Discoverability\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people on the HN thread said that Google no longer surfaces older blog content. I anecdotally know this to be not true, because a Google search for the terms \u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en\u0026amp;q=killer%20killer\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;killer-killer\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en\u0026amp;q=pasmado\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;pasmado\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e still shows posts from my blog from 2008 on the first page. I suspect this is because my blog has been continuously updated since 2002, hence my posts never fall \u0026ldquo;out of rotation\u0026rdquo;? Is that a thing? Who knows! SEO, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe original post was correct however in that it is difficult to find old-school blog content if you are searching specifically for that kind of thing. I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned \u003ca href=\"/2020/04/fe45adb8c24e654605b9906dea2df749/\"\u003ebefore\u003c/a\u003e that I want some kind of indieweb federated search focused on searching content from \u0026ldquo;indie\u0026rdquo; blogs (for lack of a better term. We need a better term?). Maybe someday I\u0026rsquo;d write down how I imagine that would work. And implement it maybe? IDK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil then, there are still a lot of blogs around, if you know where to look. One of my favorite avenues is Kicks Condors\u0026rsquo; \u003ca href=\"https://www.kickscondor.com/hrefhunt/\"\u003emonthly HrefHunt updates\u003c/a\u003e. And I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned before, but whenever anyone posts anything remotely nostalgic about old-school blogging on Hacker News, the comments are always full of links to blogs. There\u0026rsquo;s specialized subreddits like \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SpartanWeb/\"\u003er/SpartanWeb\u003c/a\u003e (not many users!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you run a blog, you can help by having a page where you list other blogs you like! Some kind of roll call, but for blogs. Like\u0026hellip; a \u003ca href=\"/page/blogroll/\"\u003eblogroll\u003c/a\u003e? And if they make a post you like, share it on your blog, and maybe on other social media channels too! Us indie and old-school bloggers need to have each other backs!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"more-to-come\"\u003eMore To Come\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am 99.9999% sure this is not the last time I\u0026rsquo;m going to blog about blogging.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Apparently it\u0026rsquo;s the last one for the DC AMU, or this particular timeline at least. Quiz: We are now up to 3 locally produced online quiz nights per week, which seems like a lot because we only used to attend 2-3 live events per month.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI mean, that\u0026rsquo;s true in general of course. But it certainly seems much more true in these \u003ca href=\"/2020/03/covid19/\"\u003epandemic times\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore all of this \u003cem\u003ewaves hands arounds frantically\u003c/em\u003e, people had a general sense of routine and predictability about their daily lives. It varied person by person of course, but many people had regular things like a steady job that kept them occupied for most of the week, a school where their kids could go off to most days, maybe a favorite bar or restaurant they visit every week or so, church on Sundays, friends you saw every other weekend or so, malls or stores they would pass by regularly, and so on and so forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though I had a generally looser schedule than most, I was still often able to plot out my coming days with relative accuracy. Oh, I have a client meeting on this day. Then the next day I have to run these errands. Then meeting up with friends (maybe for a quiz night) the evening after. On the weekend a visit with my brothers and the nieces. That kind of thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I would have had some fairly safe medium-term predictions too. If you had asked me at the \u003ca href=\"/2020/01/new-years-checklist/\"\u003estart of the year\u003c/a\u003e, I would have thought I\u0026rsquo;d have seen the Black Widow movies by now, played Final Fantasy VII Remake, and got together with the family in April to celebrate birthdays. But none of those came to pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNowadays, that kind of reasonable prediction seems like a distant memory. Weeks come and go and all the days seem to blend in together, each one indistinguishable from the last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve thought about writing something about what to expect down the road, or the \u0026ldquo;new normal\u0026rdquo; or what not, but (a) so many people (many of whom I\u0026rsquo;m sure are better qualified) are already writing things like that; and (b) I think a lot of it is largely pointless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have all these models and graphs and projections coming out, with varying degrees of reliability. They tell us things like, there will be M cases and N deaths by so-and-so date unless we do this or that. Each model is slightly different, depending on many factors like the country being studied or the data being analyzed and such. And maybe they\u0026rsquo;re right. Surely at least some of them are, right? But all of these are, to make a software development analogy, estimates. Some are certainly more accurate than others - it falls to our individual discernment whether we choose to believe experts and scientists or populist politicians or whatever - but in the end, all of them are still just estimates. Trend-spotting based on data that is probably largely incomplete (certainly so in the case of my own country). And just like estimates, there\u0026rsquo;s no way to know for certain which will turn out to be correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of all the models and trends and predictions, the future remains incredibly hazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many cases will we end up with? How many deaths? All as of yet unknown, but almost certainly far too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill we have a vaccine this year? Next year? In 2022? No one knows for sure. There are many vaccines and treatments in development, but we won\u0026rsquo;t know for a while which ones will turn out effective, if any. There may never be a permanent vaccine, the same way we don\u0026rsquo;t have one for the common cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill there be a second wave? Seems likely. Will it be under control? Who knows. Even countries we previously thought to be doing well are in danger of a possible resurgence, so what then? How much more countries like us that have done far worse in controlling the spread?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill the ECQ in Metro Manila be lifted after the 15th? Nobody knows, even up to now, a mere 5 days before the deadline. And if it is lifted, what happens then? There are people counting down to the ECQ lifting as if it would be \u0026ldquo;back to normal\u0026rdquo;, I can\u0026rsquo;t say it will be, but it almost certainly shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be. Maybe there will be an explosion of people, tired of being cooped up in their houses, and a corresponding explosion of cases, and we are forced to go back to a stricter lockdown. That\u0026rsquo;s my guess, but again, nothing is certain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen will people be able to go back to work? When will your favorite restaurant be open again? When will you get to meet up with friends again? When can I travel to other countries again? All of these, nobody knows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI joke with my parents and brothers that the next time we\u0026rsquo;ll be seeing each other in person again would probably be in August during my birthday month, but something that far off might not come to pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd people are talking about what the \u0026ldquo;new normal\u0026rdquo; is going to be like. That we might have to live with social distancing precautions in the medium-to-long term moving forward. We may be looking at months or maybe even years of social distancing measures. Or cycles of lockdown and loosening, until there is a widespread vaccine, or maybe forever? All distinct possibilities, but again, there\u0026rsquo;s no certainty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there are people that say humanity is going to learn our lesson from this crisis and realize that so many things we previously accepted in our daily life are BS that we can do without. Short list: overpopulation, inequality, low pay for essential workers, work commutes, dress codes, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies will see that work from home is effective, so it will be more common moving forward! The anecdotal reports of companies implementing draconian surveillance schemes to monitor their remote workers makes me doubt that one actually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t buy that this crisis will change society for the better (though I am more than willing to be surprised). Many humans are too set in their ways and can\u0026rsquo;t even be bothered to endure minor inconveniences like wearing a mask to costco or whatever. And there are many who can\u0026rsquo;t wait to be right back there sucking at the fresh teat of capitalism, instead of maybe looking for alternatives that promote and protect the commons instead of exploiting the vulnerable. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong - there are many positive and hopeful stories coming out of this pandemic, of people helping other people get by - that heighten my faith in humanity. My faith in humanity\u0026rsquo;s leadership and elite, however, is probably at an all-time low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the models and projections and predictions for the new normal, these things are useful at the policymaking levels. But for those of us just living our every day lives, it is difficult to look so far ahead. Right now, we are roiling about in a sea of uncertainty, unsure of what the future brings. All we can worry about will be what the next day looks like. Maybe the best we can do right now is just to take it one step at a time, and hope that we are making the right decisions to build towards a new normal that will actually be better than the last one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis post turned out more ranty than I thought it would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Should be enough to last us for 2 weeksish. The grocery actually seemed less chaotic than usual.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEarly this morning (after the mass) I took a walk outside for the first time since the lockdown started. Previously I had only gone out for groceries and meds. Only for less than 30 mins, and only in our subdivision, walking up and down the street. It\u0026rsquo;s good to be walking again, although this short and limited route is quite boring and full of neighbor\u0026rsquo;s dogs barking at me, so I\u0026rsquo;m not too fond of it, but it\u0026rsquo;s better to get the habit started again since I\u0026rsquo;ve been feeling the fatness piling on due to the quarantine and the lack of exercise.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStill no word on what happens to Metro Manila after the ECQ \u0026ldquo;ends\u0026rdquo; on the 15th. The mayors gave a bunch of options to the IATF that basically amounted to \u0026ldquo;whatever, we can\u0026rsquo;t decide\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethere\u0026rsquo;s this great site showing the progress of different countries in battling the pandemic: \u003ca href=\"https://www.endcoronavirus.org/countries\"\u003eEnd Coronavirus .org\u003c/a\u003e. While some of our leadership are claiming we have already flattened the curve, comparing our data to other countries shows we still clearly need improvement.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe government is already preparing guidelines for when we shift to GCQ like only 150 passengers per MRT train (good luck with that!) and so on. This implies that they are leaning towards shifting from ECQ to the more lenient GCQ already.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe really have no data to indicate that the pandemic is under control in NCR, so lifting the ECQ would probably be dangerous, if not outright foolish. That being said, another question is how much longer people can take being under ECQ at all.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSocial distancing in some barangays in QC \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/PhilstarNews/status/1259388201950568449\"\u003ewent out the window today\u003c/a\u003e, as it\u0026rsquo;s the last day for distributing the social assistance funds to those in need. The QC government has had a lot of trouble distributing aid to their residents, which might be explained away by the sheer size of the city (and the fact that administrative support for a population does not scale linearly). I wonder what the statistics are re: number of government employees vs number of citizens per city in Metro Manila? In any case, large-scale logistics has never been the strong point of the Philippine government, at any level. This kind of chaos really holds us back as a society.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWord has it that there were a lot of cars outside today, presumably people buying food to celebrate Mother\u0026rsquo;s Day? For us, we just held a zoom call with the grandkids as usual.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAs of today, we are at 10793 cases (+184 from yesterday), 719 deaths (+15 from yesterday), 1924 recoveries (+82 from yesterday). We\u0026rsquo;re still gaining more than 1,500 active cases a week, although a lot of those are now in the provinces. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if there\u0026rsquo;s a data source I can use that shows the trends for NCR only? \u003ca href=\"https://covid19ph.com/\"\u003eReference.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorldwide, we are at 4 million cases and 280,000 deaths. A full 1/3rd of all worldwide cases and 2/7ths of all deaths are in the US, which is still raring to reopen for the sake of the economy.
