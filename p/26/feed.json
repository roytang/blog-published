            "title": "MTG Arena: Thoughts on Historic",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eMagic Arena\u0026rsquo;s community was in an uproar this past weekend over the latest \u003ca href=\"https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-beta-august-29-2019\"\u003estate of the beta\u003c/a\u003e, mostly over the announced plans for Arena\u0026rsquo;s eternal Historic format that will become relevant with the coming rotation. It\u0026rsquo;s likely that Wizards will backpedal in some way in response to the community, but here are my thoughts for now:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"historic-cards-to-cost-double-wildcards-to-craft\"\u003eHistoric cards to cost double wildcards to craft\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the universally-reviled bit and has been the target of much outrage, accursing Wizards of being greedy etc. On this point I am in agreement with the community that yes, this sucks. On the other hand, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned not to be outraged by ridiculous DLC/microstransaction pricing. If something is too unaffordable, I simply won\u0026rsquo;t indulge it. If I can\u0026rsquo;t afford to craft a historic deck, I won\u0026rsquo;t play the format, until I can. More on this later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWotC\u0026rsquo;s plans for Historic looks to me like they are trying to replicate the \u0026ldquo;scarcity\u0026rdquo; inherent to paper eternal formats like Modern and Legacy. Arena is actually a bit more generous that either MTGO or HS, since both of those don\u0026rsquo;t sell boosters from older sets in their stores. WotC still plans to have Historic sets available, though only in 45-pack bundles (I don\u0026rsquo;t care about this either, as I rarely purchase packs anyway, but some people also dislike this change). The 2-for-1 crafting cost is still uniquely Arena and thus their own bad decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, digital games have to have slightly different business models than IRL counterparts. Arena is unique in this regard since it\u0026rsquo;s the only modern digital CCG that has a strong paper analogue. Trying to replicate the scarcity of paper Magic may have made sense for MTGO, since that platform allows trading and thus cashing out, but for Arena it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost likely the goal is to ensure that Standard is the main gameplay mode especially for newer players, as Standard generall drives sales. But increasing the crafting cost is unnecessary. The barrier to entry for Historic will already be pretty high for a new player anyway, even if the crafting cost was 1-to-1, since a new player will have more sets to catch up with. There is no sensible reason for doing this, as it is only setting Historic up for failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"curated-cards-to-be-periodically-added-to-historic\"\u003eCurated cards to be periodically added to Historic\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this one, the community is more split. There are those like me who consider this a good idea, as long as they are conservative with the power level of the curated cards added to historic. My personal preference is that they release cards that were pretty good in standard during their time, but haven\u0026rsquo;t really found a good place in Modern, so that they have a chance to shine. Clouding the issue is a \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/MTG_Arena/status/1167184191215165440\"\u003erecent tweet by the official twitter\u003c/a\u003e where they suggest that examples of curated cards could be Brainstorm, Firebolt, Wurmcoil Engine, and Dark Confidant, all of which are at least Modern power level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose who dislike this change seem to be mainly because they don\u0026rsquo;t want Historic to be Modern or Legacy. I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest, I would love it if I could play Modern on Arena. But technically, it\u0026rsquo;s not likely that the historic format will ever be the same as Modern (or Legacy), unless WotC goes crazy. It\u0026rsquo;s highly unlikely that they would add the Tron lands or Storm cards or Dredge cards into Historic for example. It would take a lot of cards for historic to even come close to Modern. But I understand the concern \u0026ndash; there are a lot of broken cards in Modern and Legacy, and WotC is made up of humans, so there is a nontrivial risk that they will screw up and add something ridiculous into Historic, breaking the format. The Brainstorm inclusion in the tweet linked above certainly doesn\u0026rsquo;t help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand the appeal of having an eternal format that is Arena sets only, moving forward. Some also want the previous Arena-implemented sets (Shadows over Innistrad, Kaladesh, and Amonkhet) to be included as well. Some prefer that Arena start adding sets one by one working backwards and stopping at Magic Origins. In general, these are all in the same vein. The idea generally is that more recent sets are more \u0026ldquo;balanced\u0026rdquo; in terms of power level, especially since Play Design is now a thing, thus the format will probably be healthier in generally than Modern which is a turn 4 format.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s also a secondary concern that adding curated cards so often (the initial plan is quarterly) will shake up the metagame more often and make Historic even more expensive as a format to get into, as you need to be getting new cards every so often. The assumption is that the curated cards will be high power level staples which would be necessary to participate in the format. Again, such concern could be mitigated by careful curation. If the curation is done well, each batch of new cards could introduce new strategies and make small changes to the metagame without necessarily invalidating entire decks. And again, there is a nontrivial risk of screw-ups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo assuage these concerns in general, what I would do if were WotC would be to introduce two eternal formats instead. One is just Arena eternal - all Arena sets (maybe including Amonkhet, but people don\u0026rsquo;t seem to like Kaladesh very much \u003ca href=\"https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=417766\"\u003efor some reason\u003c/a\u003e), and a second one which is basically just what they\u0026rsquo;re already planning for Historic. More options is always better (although it might \u0026ldquo;confuse the new players\u0026rdquo;, whatever that means).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"managing-your-own-expectations\"\u003eManaging your own expectations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCircling back to my point earlier. If Historic is too cost prohibitive, I won\u0026rsquo;t play it, until I can. In many ways, it\u0026rsquo;s a case of managing your own expectations for an online game. I like playing Magic, and Arena lets me do that at a manageable cost (i.e. free and conveniently). The addition of the Historic format doesn\u0026rsquo;t change that. I can still play Standard regardless of whether I can afford Historic or not. Until this state of the beta, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t even thinking about what happens to my cards that are rotating out, whether I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to use them again or not. For most of those cards, I drafted them, I played with them, I used them with standard decks and I generally enjoyed my time playing Arena (Nexus of Fate notwithstanding). It helps that I am a f2p player, as all I invested was my time, and since I enjoyed my time, it was not wasted time for me no matter what happens to those cards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess it\u0026rsquo;s a different matter if you\u0026rsquo;ve been paying for the cards? IDK, I have a friend who\u0026rsquo;s bought at least a bundle every time a new set comes in, I haven\u0026rsquo;t heard any complaints from him. If you\u0026rsquo;ve invested more into this game, I get that it\u0026rsquo;s a feel bad if you can\u0026rsquo;t make the most of the game by participating in all the available modes because of cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a bit like Wild in Hearthstone. I played Hearthstone for a while before rotation became a thing, so I had a lot of cards that are now only playable in Wild. I don\u0026rsquo;t really play HS anymore, but in the short time when I was active and Wild was available, I probably played only a handful of games. And I never disenchanted all those cards, even if I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to play them much. I don\u0026rsquo;t care that they\u0026rsquo;re just sitting there not doing anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"in-conclusion\"\u003eIn conclusion\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to how WotC responds to the outrage.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Magic Arena\u0026rsquo;s community was in an uproar this past weekend over the latest state of the beta, mostly over the announced plans for Arena\u0026rsquo;s eternal Historic format that will become relevant with the coming rotation. It\u0026rsquo;s likely that Wizards will backpedal in some way in response to the community, but here are my thoughts for now:\nHistoric cards to cost double wildcards to craft This is the universally-reviled bit and has been the target of much outrage, accursing Wizards of being greedy etc.",

We saw \u003cstrong\u003eOne Cut of the Dead\u003c/strong\u003e a comedy zombie film. It was great and it was hilarious, although you must make sure not to lose patience with the first thirty minutes. I went in blind not knowing anything about it other than \u0026ldquo;Japanese comedy zombie movie\u0026rdquo;, so you should too! Easily one of the funniest movies I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in recent years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"young-justice\"\u003eYoung Justice\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack half of Young Justice Outsiders finished this week. I\u0026rsquo;ve honestly been a bit whelmed for this half of the season as I feel like they\u0026rsquo;re all over the place and there\u0026rsquo;s too many plot threads going on at once. Still an enjoyable watch especially for DC fans of course. The thing about having such a large cast is that it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to focus on any one of them too long, but this season was all about Halo, Geoforce and Cyborg so the arc endings pretty much revolved around those three. It feels like so many status quo changes happened in the last episode though, felt a bit crammed. Also, some spoilers:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails class=\"spoiler\"\u003e\n    \u003csummary\u003e(Spoilers)\u003c/summary\u003e\n    \u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI feel like the Light declaring at the end that their gains were sufficient vs Luthor\u0026rsquo;s original plans seemed ridiculous (i.e. controlling Markovia vs controlling and registering all superhumans). They already had one puppet nation under their control (Queen Bee is right there!) and they\u0026rsquo;re literally planning to go against Darkseid, how does controlling Markovia help? Feels like a very post-facto justification.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI did like that they chose not to complete their Judas Contract re-telling in a similar manner and we get a \u0026ldquo;redeemed\u0026rdquo; Tara to contrast with the \u0026ldquo;fallen\u0026rdquo; Geoforce\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\u003cp /\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"fleabag\"\u003eFleabag\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t know anything about this Amazon Prime series going in either, only that it was a comedy and it was well-reviewed. I did enjoy watching it, although it\u0026rsquo;s more of a tragic comedy than anything else. Basically about how people deal with absurdly difficult situations in their daily life. The story is well-told, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I get all the hype.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-boys\"\u003eThe Boys\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother Amazon Prime series. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t read the source material, and I was a bit turned off by the first episode, but I powered through. I knew it would be dark going in, and possibly gratuitous in terms of the sex and violence at some points, so not many surprises there. The plot seems in my head to be \u0026ldquo;What if superheroes were driven by a greedy corporation\u0026rdquo;, which certainly doesn\u0026rsquo;t help address my \u003ca href=\"/2018/10/capitalism/\"\u003emisgivings about capitalism\u003c/a\u003e. The plot also reminds me of Sanderson\u0026rsquo;s book Reckoners, which was also a story about a resistance trying to oppose a superhuman regime led by a Superman-like figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking over the Wikipedia entry for the comic book series, it seems the TV show had some significant divergences, which is understandable, so I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ll be seeking out the comic books. The series was enjoyable enough to binge over a few days, although some parts are a bit predictable. I did like the treatment given to Hugh and Annie/Starlight. The cast is pretty good too, I almost didn\u0026rsquo;t recognize Simon Pegg (because it was such a serious role) and Elisabeth Shue (because\u0026hellip;I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen her in anything in a while?). Oh and Gus Fring is also here!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I ended up enjoying the season overall, as it tackles a lot of issues I relate with. I will probably be watching Season 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"rockos-modern-life-static-cling\"\u003eRocko\u0026rsquo;s Modern Life: Static Cling\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNetflix tried to bring Rocko into the modern era, although strangely none of the characters have aged at all. Although they are cartoon characters so I guess that makes sense? The special is about as ridiculous as the old cartoon was, unsurprisingly, although it does try to convey a message about how change is an inevitable part of life. I did like that they had a reference to my favorite episode, R-E-C-Y-C-L-E Recycle~\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore next month! Maybe!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eBack when I was still learning Python in 2008, one of the first \u0026ldquo;fun\u0026rdquo; scripts I wrote was a text generator using \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain\"\u003eMarkov chains\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;d run it against all the chat logs I had with people at work and serve the results from a webserver on my computer. THe results were often amusing and sometimes hilarious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I\u0026rsquo;ve been going through my old scripts lately, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d update that script to Python 3 (read: add parentheses around print params and use \u003ca href=\"/2019/08/devnotes-python-pathlib/\"\u003epathlib\u003c/a\u003e) and run it against all the posts on this here site.

THe results were often amusing and sometimes hilarious.\nSince I\u0026rsquo;ve been going through my old scripts lately, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d update that script to Python 3 (read: add parentheses around print params and use pathlib) and run it against all the posts on this here site.",

If the seller knew full well the actual value of what he\u0026rsquo;s selling and he still sells at that price, then I will gladly buy it cheap with no concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"this-is-why-im-not-a-salesman\"\u003eThis is why I\u0026rsquo;m not a salesman\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn such a case, the way to assuage my ethical concerns would be to bring up the possible imbalance. Something along the lines of \u0026ldquo;I think you\u0026rsquo;re selling this for much less than what it\u0026rsquo;s worth!\u0026rdquo;, and if he nods and still wants to sell at that price anyway, then both of you complete the transaction happily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriend O commented:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think people have a kind of \u0026ldquo;code of ethics\u0026rdquo; that applies to marketplaces\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat\u0026rsquo;s a bit different from everyday ethics\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust like how doctors/lawyers/priests have a code of ethics specific to their contexts\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe idea is that participants in the marketplace should assume that everyone else is doing their due dilligence when it comes to price/quality research\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I guess I can satisfy my concerns as well by telling myself that \u0026ldquo;Caveat Emptor\u0026rdquo; applies in the opposite direction as well, so \u0026ldquo;Caveat Venditor\u0026rdquo;?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"hold-yourself-to-a-higher-standard\"\u003eHold yourself to a higher standard\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am only presenting an ethical dilemma here as it applies to myself when I am the buyer in the above scenario, or otherwise the one with information advantage in the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have been on the receiving end of bad trades before of course, numerous times. Such often happens when I foolishly decide to participate in a transaction without doing the necessary research, so I guess Caveat Venditor is accurate. I don\u0026rsquo;t lay blame on the other party for taking advantage of my ignorance either; after a bad trade I will most likely blame myself. Therefore, I don\u0026rsquo;t expect other people I am transacting with to treat me as fairly as I want to treat other people should I have the advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriend J pointed out that holding myself to a higher standard like this can be considered a bit elitist since it\u0026rsquo;s like considering yourself \u0026ldquo;better\u0026rdquo; than others. I think of it more like managing expectations of other people. Other people don\u0026rsquo;t have the same life experiences and values as I do, so some things are more important for me than for them. I would of course love it if everyone was conditioned to treat everyone else fairly in this manner - society would be much the better for it, but I understand the reality of human wants and needs enough to know that\u0026rsquo;s a pipe dream at best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"all-in-theory\"\u003eAll in theory\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, all of this is untested, because I haven\u0026rsquo;t been lucky enough to find a deal like I originally described. Maybe when I\u0026rsquo;m there at that point in time all my ethical questions give way to impulse or greed and I\u0026rsquo;m already at home gleefully counting my winnings before the dilemma comes to mind. But I like to think thought experiments like these help to flesh out one\u0026rsquo;s thought processes so that when the time comes, one is more likely to behave appropriately.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I brought up among one of my friend groups this Reddit thread where the poster says they were able to buy hundreds of dollars worth of Magic cards from a garage sale for around $70. (Not gonna link to the original thread because it might seem like I\u0026rsquo;m shaming the OP.)\nNot that there\u0026rsquo;s anything bad with such \u0026ldquo;garage sale finds\u0026rdquo;, as it were. These things are posted every so often on subreddits especially those dedicated to some sort of collectible.",
