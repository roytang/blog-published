It plays mostly like a single-player MMO, with party members that act on their own and most skills on a cooldown. There\u0026rsquo;s a ridiculous number of quests and items to grind for, I\u0026rsquo;m even tempted to still continue with the post-game content (if only I didn\u0026rsquo;t have FFXV waiting for me!), as I\u0026rsquo;m only at around 70% completion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story was okay, at many points well-told and hitting a lot of emotional highs (although some of the characters felt a bit over-acted). The ending was\u0026hellip;  well, kind of sequel-baiting. A mixture of disappointment and confusion and hope haha. I don\u0026rsquo;t imagine that they\u0026rsquo;ll have a sequel set in the same universe/timeline, so it felt a bit like they made up a ridiculous explanation that would attempt to explain some of the nonsense that happens in the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s an imgur album with some stuff I screen-grabbed along the way:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/CEbsI\"\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n    \u003ca href=\"//imgur.com/CEbsI\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e",

Because of the unstable nature of the project, there was always a lot of duplication, unused/unnecessary/obsolete classes/functions/files and so on. Unnecessarily large CSS files where most of the selectors were no longer really needed or JS libraries that weren\u0026rsquo;t actually used. That kind of thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s one of those things that you\u0026rsquo;ll never get official approval from management to do, so you have to somehow sneak it in during your daily tasks. But it\u0026rsquo;s important for a couple of reasons:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHaving too much cluttered code makes your system a lot harder to grok. That means new developers will have a much higher learning curve, and existing developers will find it difficult to be assigned tasks in modules and functions they\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with. Lower understanding means more bugs, lower quality and so on.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHaving a lot of unused files, classes, functions, etc. bloats the build process (making build times longer, extending development cycles) and makes build files bigger (extending deployment times)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of developers prefer not to throw away old code, for fear that \u0026ldquo;we might need it later\u0026rdquo;. They would prefer to just comment them out in large blocks (making the code a lot more unreadable) or just leaving dangling functions/classes unused. The reason is hogwash of course, since you should be using source control, and source control means never being afraid to delete old code. (Of course, you should make sure what you\u0026rsquo;re deleting is really no longer in use!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "In one of my most recent projects, a large system that had gone through a relatively long and unstable period of many, many changes due to sales demonstrations, different clients and whatnot, one of the \u0026ldquo;fun buffer tasks\u0026rdquo; I always kept around for devs was code cleanup. Because of the unstable nature of the project, there was always a lot of duplication, unused/unnecessary/obsolete classes/functions/files and so on. Unnecessarily large CSS files where most of the selectors were no longer really needed or JS libraries that weren\u0026rsquo;t actually used.",

One would assume that having more time meant I would be better able to organize my stuff and all that, but one would be wrong. My room still has stacks of books, toys, Magic cards and other stuff in random places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe I just have too much OCD that I want everything to be neat and organized, but I\u0026rsquo;m not industrious enough to make it happen. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are people a lot more cluttered than me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTowards the start of the year, I told myself I should throw out/get rid of/dispose of at least one thing a day. It\u0026rsquo;s one of those relatively easy things to do I haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to maintain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do we keep around all this old stuff we don\u0026rsquo;t need?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of it may be from a mentality of scarcity \u0026ndash; we don\u0026rsquo;t want to throw away stuff for fear of finding out that we may need it later. But reasonably, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t used a thing in years, maybe you\u0026rsquo;ll never use it and even if you had need of one, how difficult would it be to find one again? Some kind of pack rat mentality. I know a few of my friends who would be very familiar with this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther things we keep around for some sort of nostalgia or as keepsakes of other people and faraway places. That\u0026rsquo;s fine I suppose, but maybe one shouldn\u0026rsquo;t put too much value in things that don\u0026rsquo;t actually have them. Case in point: I have a bunch of rocks here from different countries I visited in Europe, haha. Pictures, letters, and other personal keepsakes one might consider digitizing and storing in the cloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving a cluttered space has a cost, one that\u0026rsquo;s difficult to ascertain or quantify. Not only do things look messy, but things are harder to find when you need them most. There\u0026rsquo;s also a strange satisfaction that comes from achieving a fine, organized space (before it all falls back into chaos of course.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",

One would assume that having more time meant I would be better able to organize my stuff and all that, but one would be wrong. My room still has stacks of books, toys, Magic cards and other stuff in random places.\nOr maybe I just have too much OCD that I want everything to be neat and organized, but I\u0026rsquo;m not industrious enough to make it happen.",
