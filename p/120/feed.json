            "title": "Feedback Loops",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA feedback loop happens in a system when you are able to use an output of that system to influence the inputs, which in turn influences the outputs and repeats the cycle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Ideal_feedback_model.svg/2000px-Ideal_feedback_model.svg.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"824\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn engineering, feedback loops are useful to generate steady-state outputs. We had an entire subject dedicated to feedback loop controllers back in college. I enjoyed the topic so much I took the subject twice! An example of the use of feedback loops would be a thermostat that has a sensor to detect the current temperature. Once it senses the current temperature, it compares that with the target temperature and uses the difference in values to adjust the thermostat input. In this way, the temperature eventually reaches the target value\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumans are also machines subject to feedback loops. We enjoy receiving positive feedback. The more feedback we receive about how well we are performing, the happier we are and the more we are able to perform well. This is part of why we enjoy getting paid a salary regularly \u0026ndash; some part of our brain treats money as a way to \u0026ldquo;keep score\u0026rdquo; and as feedback that hey, you\u0026rsquo;re not doing so bad, here\u0026rsquo;s some cash to keep you going!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeedback can be negative too, but the effect can vary based on the person\u0026rsquo;s attitude. If you accept feedback and criticism of your work and use it to learn and move forward, then you can use even negative feedback as positive reinforcement. If you refuse to acknowledge legitimate negative feedback and instead take it personally or criticize the one giving feedback, then you are failing to learn from the feedback and it either becomes useless or in the worst case can even reinforce negative behavior\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuicker feedback loops allow humans to iterate faster and determine which behavior is best to achieve his goals. My favorite example of feedback loops is in games. Computer and video games are very good at providing near-instant feedback. Run into an enemy? Okay that means you take damage, so that\u0026rsquo;s not good. Finish a task? Ah, you gained some experience points, so it looks like that\u0026rsquo;s good. And games will even tell you immediately how far you are from achieving your goal! How many experience points until I unlock a new ability? How much more damage can I take before I die?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople enjoy this sort of instant feedback loops, so more and more systems are using some form of \u0026ldquo;gamification\u0026rdquo; to improve adoption and usage. Websites like stackoverflow grant you points for answering questions. Fitness trackers give you immediate feedback on how many calories you\u0026rsquo;ve lost. And so it goes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe downside of this instant feedback culture is that it becomes more difficult for us to appreciate things that have long feedback loops. And they are already difficult in the first place, since the feedback takes a long time to get back to you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy favorite example of this is dieting. Dieting is hard mainly because you suffer regularly (due to having to eat food you don\u0026rsquo;t like) but the effect isn\u0026rsquo;t measurable immediately. It takes a while to notice any changes, so it takes more discipline to maintain the diet in the absence of that feedback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is why people have systems like calorie counting \u0026ndash; it provides an intermediate feedback to substitute for the feedback you don\u0026rsquo;t have yet on how much weight you\u0026rsquo;ve lost or gained. But it\u0026rsquo;s still an abstract concept and doesn\u0026rsquo;t translate too easily into weight gained or lost. And also it can be difficult to track precisely since not everything you eat will have a calorie count available. I reckon that once we have an app where you just take pictures of the food you just ate it tells you how many pounds you gained or lost, a lot of people will be better at keeping to their diets\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like to look at the activities I pursue regularly and see if there is anything I can measure to help provide feedback loops for self-improvement. This is why I enjoy daily habits that track streaks \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s simple, instant feedback that tells me I accomplished something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, humans are not machines that need to have perfect systems and be slaves to their feedback loops. So it\u0026rsquo;s also okay to break your daily habits every so often or to cheat on your diet once a week or such, it is one of the privileges of being human. And breaking your patterns also provides some feedback which you can use later\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",

Eliciting information also helps to find any differences in understanding which may be affecting the estimate. If the estimate is still unsatisfactory after clarification, the manager can ask the dev to study it further or get a second opinion as needed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if the dev is unable to give an estimate immediately, the manager should avoid pressuring him to do so, instead giving him some time to study the problem more thoroughly. \u0026ldquo;Can you get back to me with something rough, say by tomorrow morning?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstandably, clients and managers have this pressure of trying to fit all the work within a chosen schedule.

To name a few: I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing \u003ca href=\"/2016/03/sketching-daily/\"\u003edaily sketches\u003c/a\u003e, I\u0026rsquo;ve been going on a daily walking routine, learning Spanish on \u003ca href=\"https://www.duolingo.com/\"\u003eDuolingo\u003c/a\u003e, I have a quick stretching/exercise routine I do in the mornings, etc. (I\u0026rsquo;m also supposed to be writing daily, but this has proven more difficult to keep doing consistently\u0026hellip; )\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like those daily habits that can be easily tracked with technology. Duolingo tracks my Spanish learning streak (currently on a 147-day streak). \u003ca href=\"http://reddit.com/r/sketchdaily\"\u003er/sketchdaily\u003c/a\u003e tracks my drawing streaks. I have an app on my phone that tracks how often I meet my daily walking target (usually the only problem is if it rains)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a productivity tip \u003ca href=\"http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret\"\u003esupposedly advocated by Jerry Seinfeld\u003c/a\u003e called \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t Break the Chain\u0026rdquo;. It recognizes the power of tracking your streaks. The longer your streak gets, the more it motivates (or pressures?) you to maintain the streak and keep it going. It also helps you realize that doing things repeatedly on a daily basis leads to small, incremental improvements that can quickly compound into big improvements\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaily habits can be difficult sometimes unless you live a totally boring life. Most people will have differing circumstances from day-to-day that may cause you to miss your daily habits every so often. Maybe you have an out-of-town trip that makes your daily gym habit impossible, or maybe you needed to go overtime all week so you needed to skip your extra learnings, and so on. That\u0026rsquo;s kind of fine \u0026ndash; as long as you understand the tradeoffs you\u0026rsquo;re making (it is your life to live and prioritize after all)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even when you\u0026rsquo;re short on time, you can still look for ways to keep your streak going. With Duolingo, I usually do it in the mornings on my desktop pc, but if I\u0026rsquo;m busy all day I can do a quick Duolingo session on my mobile. For sketches, if I don\u0026rsquo;t have much time I can pick up a small post-it and do a quick and small doodle. If it\u0026rsquo;s raining too hard for me to go out and take my walk, I can go to the nearest mall and just do a walkabout there, maybe even running some errands at the same time. I\u0026rsquo;m also supposed to be reading books daily \u0026ndash; one of the daily habits I\u0026rsquo;m not consistent at \u0026ndash; but if I don\u0026rsquo;t have time, maybe I can just read a few paragraphs or pages right before I sleep\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDepending on your personality, trying to maintain a streak can seem to be a burden sometimes. You feel like you\u0026rsquo;re becoming a slave to the habit. But as the book \u0026ldquo;The Greatest Salesman in the World\u0026rdquo; implies, humans by nature are slaves to habit, and if we must be slaves to habit we might as well be slaves to good habits of our own choosing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",

Composition provides greater flexibility, modularity, and extensibility in large software systems as compared to inheritance, especially for statically typed languages like Java that don\u0026rsquo;t support multiple inheritance\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most common examples of the problems caused by too much inheritance involved generic object such as the game objects example in the wikipedia page linked above. I want to cite a more enterprise-y example I\u0026rsquo;ve encountered in past projects\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s say in your system, you have a base class \u0026ldquo;ScreenController\u0026rdquo;, which contains all the common behaviors for screens in your system. Behaviors could include startup behaviors, variables the screen needs to track, how to handle the actions when the user clicks buttons, that sort of thing. Then each dev working on a different screen in your system will just extend this base class for their own screen, and you have a type hierarchy that looks something like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#a109000a307795168baef2407dff3731-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2016/10/favor-composition-over-inheritance/fcoi1_hu5063ea40c17cf94a80cdee0a586538d3_2291_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"a109000a307795168baef2407dff3731-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2016/10/favor-composition-over-inheritance/fcoi1.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"20 Oct 2016 1:30am\"\u003e20 Oct 2016 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlright, that\u0026rsquo;s fine, a perfectly acceptable use of inheritance. But then as your system grows larger, you notice some of the screens share some other behaviors could be refactored so that they aren\u0026rsquo;t repeated. For example, some of the screens might be Search screens that have similar behavior. Or maintenance (CRUD) screens that share common action handlers. Using inheritance, you might extend ScreenController and add additional hierarchy levels to handle those common behaviors, and you end up with something like:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#b5a8c09d457a03e304c6ee837280cd2d-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2016/10/favor-composition-over-inheritance/fcoi2_hu699a9916ee78ee379523237b64a11c96_3364_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"b5a8c09d457a03e304c6ee837280cd2d-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2016/10/favor-composition-over-inheritance/fcoi2.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"20 Oct 2016 1:30am\"\u003e20 Oct 2016 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit more complicated now, but it\u0026rsquo;s probably still manageable right? But then one of the devs realizes that your project needs some modal screens too, which have some additional behavior as well. An example would be a modal screen that allows the user to select some parameters (a \u0026ldquo;selection screen\u0026rdquo;). Some modal screens also need to be search screens or maintenance screens too. If you insist on using inheritance, you need to mix and match all the possible combinations and might start seeing a hierarchy similar to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#82fc786689351abe46a83ab04d206eaf-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2016/10/favor-composition-over-inheritance/fcoi3_hu0e4bbf13becc4fca1db2e98566cd9442_5127_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"82fc786689351abe46a83ab04d206eaf-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2016/10/favor-composition-over-inheritance/fcoi3.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"20 Oct 2016 1:30am\"\u003e20 Oct 2016 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, things are starting to get really unwieldy now, but hopefully there aren\u0026rsquo;t any further complications right? Then your team starts to implement multiple subsystems with different domains, and some of the different domains have common behavior that they want to have in base classes too. So for example, the finance domain wants to have a FinanceScreen parent class they can use. But what about the existing hierarchy above? Should you duplicate it for each domain and up with ridiculous things like FinanceModalSearchScreen? I\u0026rsquo;m not even going to bother making an example of such a type hierarchy!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, you look at this mess and wonder how could it have been done better? Well, (as if the spoilers in the post title didn\u0026rsquo;t make this obvious), one alternative would have been to use composition. Composition means creating objects to encapsulate behavior and attaching them to other objects as necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn our example, if you still had the flat hierarchy from the start, you could have a base ScreenBehavior class, and the ScreenController could have an addBehavior() method. Your class hierarchy would end up similar to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#be3ac8f5bbee25c24657157bdff63f7f-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2016/10/favor-composition-over-inheritance/fcoi4_hu8e68067d65af1d0481837d8ef9bc12c0_5144_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"be3ac8f5bbee25c24657157bdff63f7f-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2016/10/favor-composition-over-inheritance/fcoi4.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"20 Oct 2016 1:30am\"\u003e20 Oct 2016 1:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd each screen will just have to add the specific behaviors it needs like so:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-java\" data-lang=\"java\"\u003e    \u003cspan style=\"color:#66d9ef\"\u003epublic\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan style=\"color:#a6e22e\"\u003eScreenA\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#f92672\"\u003e()\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan style=\"color:#f92672\"\u003e{\u003c/span\u003e\n    \t\taddBehavior\u003cspan style=\"color:#f92672\"\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#66d9ef\"\u003enew\u003c/span\u003e SearchScreenBehavior\u003cspan style=\"color:#f92672\"\u003e());\u003c/span\u003e\n    \t\taddBehavior\u003cspan style=\"color:#f92672\"\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#66d9ef\"\u003enew\u003c/span\u003e ModalScreenBehavior\u003cspan style=\"color:#f92672\"\u003e());\u003c/span\u003e\n    \t\taddBehavior\u003cspan style=\"color:#f92672\"\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#66d9ef\"\u003enew\u003c/span\u003e FinanceScreenBehavior\u003cspan style=\"color:#f92672\"\u003e());\u003c/span\u003e\n    \t\u003cspan style=\"color:#f92672\"\u003e}\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis setup is a lot more flexible and easily extensible, since you don\u0026rsquo;t have to uproot entire type hierarchies when some new common behavior needs to be added. Such robust design is especially important for larger projects and systems that may have hundreds of screens. The only downside is that you have to implement support for this approach early in the project \u0026ndash; the longer you wait, the more complicated it becomes to adjust the existing code to the new paradigm.

            "summary": "\u0026ldquo;Composition over inheritance\u0026rdquo; is an object-oriented programming principle that I\u0026rsquo;m sad to say many devs I\u0026rsquo;ve encountered aren\u0026rsquo;t too familiar with. Composition provides greater flexibility, modularity, and extensibility in large software systems as compared to inheritance, especially for statically typed languages like Java that don\u0026rsquo;t support multiple inheritance\nThe most common examples of the problems caused by too much inheritance involved generic object such as the game objects example in the wikipedia page linked above.",
