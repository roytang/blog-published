Since I was young I've dreamed of accomplishing something great. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI think everybody has a dreamer inside them, especially when they're young. But as we grow older and face the different trials and tribulations of life, they start to chip away slowly at our dreams. Everyday we make some simple decision that trades a part of those dreams for something pragmatic. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWe tell ourselves we'd just be working for a year or so, until we figure out what direction I wanted my life to take. We have so many options in this day and age; never has the barrier for entry into freelancing, entrepreneurship or innovation been so low. One year passes, then another and then yet another. But we still don't know where we want to go.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWe say to ourselves; it's okay, I can work on my dreams in my spare time. I'll write a chapter a day. I'll code a few portions of my revolutionary web service after I get home. I'll do design work on my game on weekends. I'll brainstorm business ideas on the way to work. But when we come home from our daily grind, we're dead tired and just want to relax, or surf the web, or play games on our consoles. \u003cem\u003eI'll start tomorrow\u003c/em\u003e, a familiar mantra. And days turn into weeks and turn into months and into years.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cem\u003eI need to get some experience first. I just need to save up some more money. I'm already doing pretty well, why ruin it? I'm pretty lucky to have a well-paying job in this economy, I'd be foolish to take risks now. I don't think I can maintain my lifestyle without my job. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThese are the lies we tell ourselves when we find ourselves wondering what happened to our dreams, when we wake up to find ourselves trapped in the loop of ordinary life.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn the end, we tell ourselves more lies. \u003cem\u003eI could've been great.

Just another statistic in human history, just another cog in the great wheel of destiny. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFor some people, this ordinary life may be enough, and that's great for them. They will live out their ordinary lives with their ordinary ending and grow old and raise their kids and enjoy the company of their grandchildren and they'll be completely happy and satisfied with that.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThat isn't my story. I don't want that to be my story. I'm greedy, I want more out of life. I don't want my dreams to die.\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I think I more or less still agree with the sentiment expressed above and recognize it within myself, I think the past six years have also added to my perspective in certain ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one thing, at one point in the intervening years I suffered what I consider to be true burnout (I will write about it in more detail someday). That experience created a part of me that\u0026rsquo;s just weary of the world in general and just wants to rest and chill and enjoy life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving worked in a startup recently, I can see how much hard work it takes to try to reach for your dreams and build something for yourself. After having experienced burnout, I am not sure I am willing to put myself through the same level of stress I used to tolerate in the past, much less the additional stress involved with managing my own business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor sure part of me still has that same ambition and fire from six years ago, that still hopes I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to figure out something clever and build something great and make a name for myself. But now there\u0026rsquo;s another part too, and that part just tells me that I\u0026rsquo;ve already worked hard enough, that I don\u0026rsquo;t need to prove anything to anyone, that I\u0026rsquo;ve earned a break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know that this isn\u0026rsquo;t an option for anyone and I realize that I am quite privileged financially \u0026ndash; having significant savings contributes to the fact that I can even consider taking a rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this isn\u0026rsquo;t about financial security. This is more about two conflicting philosophies. The first is that you should work hard to get the most out of life (ambition). The second is that happiness should not be dependent on success (contentment). Ambition pushes us to keep reaching for ever-increasing heights; but too much ambition means we may never find contentment since we keep searching for something greater beyond the horizon. It\u0026rsquo;s a kind of delicate balance we need to walk. We need the fire of ambition to keep us moving forward, but we also need the wisdom of contentment to appreciate where we currently are.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThis is a story from the early days of the internet. Circa 2001-2004ish. A time of Geocities and AIM and and ICQ and from before Gmail even launched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that time, I was a big Final Fantasy fan (okay, I still am, more or less). My first real experience with online fan communities was a Yahoo Groups mailing list called the \u0026ldquo;Final Fantasy Forum\u0026rdquo;. It was a fun, tight-knit group that loved to discuss the FF series and other JRPGs of that era. The group was small, maybe 20-30 active members at peak, but it was also very active; it was not uncommon to have dozens of messages in a day, or even an hour. This was back in the days of dial-up internet here in the PH, so it was a bit challenging to keep up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I did keep up, and was quite active with the group, and eventually even became a moderator. I got to know some of the other active list members quite well, such that I considered them friends (in as much as people you\u0026rsquo;ve never met IRL can be friends in those days, at least). But as you all know, all good things must come to an end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bane of all good discussion groups is drama. First, the original list creator and owner came back from hibernation. Most of us mods had been second generation list members, we never really knew the original creator since he had gone inactive. At first we were all like \u0026ldquo;Hey, welcome back!\u0026rdquo; but then we quickly got into disagreements over how the group should be run. Over a tumultuous few days, he started kicking out and banning people who disagreed with him. I asked him for a dialogue and promptly got kicked out as well. Such was the fate of the FFF.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the next couple of months, the old mods and members tried to re-establish the same community elsewhere. First, they set up an alternative Yahoo Groups list called \u0026ldquo;The AntiFFF\u0026rdquo; (I told them this was a terrible name), which appears to be the \u003ca href=\"https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Final-Fantasy-Forum/info\"\u003ecurrently listed \u0026ldquo;Final Fantasy Forum\u0026rdquo; on Yahoo Groups\u003c/a\u003e. It had a burst of activity for a month or two, and I was there for a short while as well, but there was some disagreement on who should or should not be allowed into the new group, and there was no strong moderation so at some point there was a long debate about religion (another bane of discussion groups) which caused a lot of members to leave and group petered out shortly after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the other ex-FFF mods who was made unwelcome at the AntiFFF messaged me and proposed we create a new group with a more general RPG topic, and we did get the old mod team together and did that, but that group didn\u0026rsquo;t last very long either before activity petered out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround that time, Yahoo Groups itself started to wane in popular usage and everyone kind of drifted apart. I seem to have unsubbed from the last group about a year after it was formed. I only recently started looking into all of this again when I dug up some old emails that referenced the FFF. I don\u0026rsquo;t even have copies of old emails from either the original group or the successor groups. Most of my recollection of events comes from what I remember and the fact that I can still go through the archives of the AntiFFF at the YG site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was struck with a wave of nostalgia when I remembered all of this, and a little bit of regret that I didn\u0026rsquo;t keep in touch with these folks that I interacted with regularly for the better part of 4-5 years. I tried to see if I could track down some of the members I could remember, but back then most of the list members went by aliases which are now defunct. I did manage to find Twitter accounts for a couple of the old members, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t track down the old mod team that I worked closely with. For the rest, all I could find were now-defunct websites and domains and emails and handles for chat networks that aren\u0026rsquo;t even around anymore. It was a completely different internet back then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt feels kind of weird to miss those guys, since I never really knew them in person. These days virtually all of the people I interact with online are people I know IRL. (\u0026ldquo;Virtually all\u0026rdquo; because I do have some Twitter mutuals that I\u0026rsquo;ve never met in person but interact with regularly enough that we are aware of each other.) After the FFF and the derivative groups, I was never again actively a member of a community of \u0026ldquo;strangers on the internet\u0026rdquo; as it were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was all of fifteen-ish years ago, so I can only imagine that many of those peeps have vastly different lives now. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;re no longer active online. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;ve outgrown video games. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;re teaching their own kids now about Final Fantasy. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;re all in different places now with different jobs and different hobbies, and none of them even remember the little mail group we had all that time ago. Or maybe someday some of them might stumble upon this post and say \u0026ldquo;Hey the Final Fantasy Forum! I remember that group! Good times\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

When I first became technical lead on projects, I got some evaluations from junior developers saying I can be \u0026ldquo;intimidating\u0026rdquo;. I think it comes from the fact that I have a natural tendency towards being snarky and being annoyed at bad code. It\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;m trying to improve, and while I\u0026rsquo;ll never be cuddly, I think I\u0026rsquo;ve made some great strides in being approachable and in advice-giving.

It\u0026rsquo;s a fantastic read for anyone who grew up playing PC games during the 80s and 90s. It gives us a birds-eye view of what the burgeoning gaming industry was like back then, not just with the technical and business aspects, but a lot of the human aspects as well: there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of drama, conflict, and betrayal to go around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book\u0026rsquo;s narrative does a good job of contrasting the Two Johns: Carmack was a programmer, a technical wizard who pushed the boundaries of game programming where no one else dared go. He was interested purely in the programming and in the creation of virtual worlds and preferred a smaller, leaner, ruthlessly efficient company focused on making the most of his technology. Romero was a gamer first, and an ambitious and competitive one. He was the number one competitor on their own deathmatch games and dreamt of building a gaming empire, living the life of a rock start among the gaming community as the front man of id software. Together their complimentary skill set would take them through a dizzying rise to fame and fortune in the game development world as they blazed new trails, defined new genres, and inspired a new generation of competitors. At the same time, their differences would ultimately cause them to go down different paths \u0026ndash; knowing full well in advance how the story ended for their partnership made me turn the pages quicker as I dreaded the inevitable split.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a gamer since the late eighties, and though I never considered myself particularly good at first-person shooters, I did play most of the games that comprised id software\u0026rsquo;s wonder years \u0026ndash; Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Doom II, Quake and Quake II. I will freely confess I mostly used the build-in cheat codes to just fool around in most of these games, although I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I finished Quake II\u0026rsquo;s single-player campaign legitimately. We didn\u0026rsquo;t have good internet back then, so the only opportunity I ever had to play Deathmatch back then was split-screen on a console at a friend\u0026rsquo;s house, even then it was helluva fun. Post-Quake II, I never played FPSes much again, though I did enjoy reading about John Romero and Ion Storm and was looking forward to their promised RPG Anachronox and only later heard about what a failure Daikatana turned out to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still have this lingering dream of breaking into game development somehow. Though I\u0026rsquo;m not envious of the death march crunch mode periods typically described in the book, I am a bit envious of what a huge advantage it was for geniuses like Carnack and Romero to have been at the right place and time for the nascent games industry to turn them into legends. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;d have had the technical chops to compete with them if I had the same opportunities, but I surely would have given it a go. I consider myself closer in temperament to Carnack than Romero \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;m more interested in the technical side and could probably use some help in the promotion and game design and level design stuff. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;ll ever actually get there, but I take solace in this quote from the penultimate chapter of the book:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n    Carmack disdained talk of highfalutin things like legacies but when pressed would allow at least one thought on his own. \"In the information age, the barriers just aren’t there,\" he said. \"The barriers are self-imposed. If you want to set off and go develop some grand new thing, you don’t need millions of dollars of capitalization. You need enough pizza and Diet Coke to stick in your refrigerator, a cheap PC to work on, and the dedication to go through with it. We slept on floors. We waded across rivers.\" \u003cbr /\u003e\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e",

The combat system is basically Pokemon. So yes, it\u0026rsquo;s Ghibli+Pokemon. Pokemon in this game are called \u0026ldquo;familiars\u0026rdquo; and each party member can have up to 3 familiars ready to fight in battle. The party members can fight directly as well, but most of the time it\u0026rsquo;s a better idea to let your familiars go at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can imagine, the grindiest part of the post-game was collecting all the familiars. Ok, not all of them, the achievement only required 250 different species captured, but that\u0026rsquo;s a helluva lot. During the normal main game run, I only captured a bit less than 100 different species. It was made more grindy by the fact that there\u0026rsquo;s no mechanism for trying to capture the familiars (i.e. pokeballs), you basically just have to beat them in battle and whenever you beat one, there\u0026rsquo;s like a 2-8% chance that you will get an opportunity to recruit it. Thankfully, you can shortcut the grind a bit by collecting the lower level ones and using metamorphoses (basically pokemon evolutions) to get the higher level ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story feels like it\u0026rsquo;s targeted towards children, so it has a kind of fairy tale feel, and the world is very bright and cheerful (mostly) and there\u0026rsquo;s things like a kingdom where the king is a giant cat, and so on. Not that the plot is simple mind you \u0026ndash; there\u0026rsquo;s quite a bit or parallel worlds, a tiny bit of time travel, and a few plot twists thrown in (although you might have seen them coming).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy favorite part of the game has to be all the puns. Many of the familiars have some sort of pun involved in their name, like there\u0026rsquo;s a dog familiar called \u0026ldquo;Ruffian\u0026rdquo;; there\u0026rsquo;s an egg-shaped familiar with a pharoah mask called \u0026ldquo;Eggyptian\u0026rdquo;. There\u0026rsquo;s a cat thief familiar called \u0026ldquo;Purrloiner\u0026rdquo;, who evolves into a \u0026ldquo;Cutpurrse\u0026rdquo;, and can then evolve into another form which you can fight on the seas called a \u0026ldquo;Puss in Boats\u0026rdquo;. There\u0026rsquo;s a sheep familiar called \u0026ldquo;Baatender\u0026rdquo; who can evolve into a \u0026ldquo;Baabarian\u0026rdquo;. There\u0026rsquo;s a familiar that wears a turban and he\u0026rsquo;s called a \u0026ldquo;Turbandit\u0026rdquo;, and he has higher forms called \u0026ldquo;Turban Myth\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Turban Legend\u0026rdquo;. Okay, I\u0026rsquo;ll stop before I enumerate them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a few other systems familiar to JRPG players \u0026ndash; crafting, a casino, farming enemies for drops, bounty hunts, errand boards and so on on. Oh and some nonsense about fixing people\u0026rsquo;s hearts by finding people willing to contribute attributes like confidence and kindness and whatnot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all a very fun game and something I\u0026rsquo;m glad to have gotten off my backlog! Not sure if I\u0026rsquo;ll have time to play the second game though, maybe in another five years?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e__\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I was especially fond of how cleverly all three movies tied together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStar Wars\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#875308872ffa50d886359ed09811a51c-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/10/my-top-10-favorite-movies-of-all-time/13124658_10154577028233912_132731298121342553_n1_hu5cad911239373995ab8d84b28b83ed34_103940_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Han looks terrible in this drawing.

Coming from someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t have much experience in marketing and sales, I think the book gives a decent overview of this space.

I\u0026rsquo;m not especially fond of people aggressively push-marketing to me via cold calls or pushing flyers in my face. To the book\u0026rsquo;s credit, it points out that such blind-shotgun techniques are wildly ineffective. And while it doesn\u0026rsquo;t go into too much detail about each particular area, I think having a more solid understanding of modern marketing techniques and mentalities will help me \u0026ldquo;understand the enemy\u0026rdquo; better, so to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs to the 1-page marketing plan itself: I don\u0026rsquo;t have enough marketing knowledge to say whether it\u0026rsquo;s really an innovation in implementation as the author claims, but it seems like a reasonable checklist for a business to consider when planning out their marketing activities. If I ever manage to talk myself into starting a business, the overview given by this book would certainly be useful. The book itself isn\u0026rsquo;t very expensive, so I think it\u0026rsquo;s a reasonable buy for someone new to the marketing space.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Prospects have ranged from my own software consulting firm to a food stall in an MRT station. None of these ideas never push through. Aside from general risk-aversion and not being confident in the ideas, there\u0026rsquo;s a few factors that in my mind are significant obstacles towards starting a new business for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGovernment red tape and paperwork\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a friend who manages a small business for his family, as he\u0026rsquo;s often ranting about the situation here in the Philippines, about how there\u0026rsquo;s always a lot of filing requirements, many of which don\u0026rsquo;t make sense and are seemingly designed to make it easier for unscrupulous employees to bilk you for money. A direct quote: \u0026ldquo;It is literally easier to cheat on taxes and filing requirements via connections/bribery than it is to make a good faith effort to follow regulations.\u0026rdquo; This is not something I would want to deal with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHiring other people\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA while back I was discussing with someone the prospect of setting up a food stall franchise somewhere. They offered an affordable package and assistance, but I balked at the idea that I would have to find and hire someone to man the stall myself. I have enough trouble delegating my work to other people when I\u0026rsquo;m in a team of competent engineers. I find the idea of entrusting an entire store or stall in which I invested hard-earned money unnerving. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I\u0026rsquo;d be able to properly identify someone trustworthy enough that I can leave them alone to handle such things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarketing and Sales\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith my background as an engineer, I\u0026rsquo;m not too fond of marketing and sales. However, I have spent the last couple of years working with a small startup, where I had a lot more visibility into the overall business process, so I guess I have a slightly better appreciation of marketing and sales now. These skills are largely focused on manipulating humans, whereas my own skillset is largely focused on manipulating computers. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that a lot of marketing techniques and sales methods feel very \u0026ldquo;scummy\u0026rdquo; to me, like clickbait ads and so on. I know these can be done well and in ways that conform with my own personal code of honour, but still, in my head these skills constitute \u0026ldquo;black arts\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;necessary evils.\u0026rdquo; \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of these are hurdles I\u0026rsquo;d have to overcome if I ever really want to start a business. That, or I\u0026rsquo;d have to find business partners willing to handle all this drudge work for me so that I can focus on the parts I enjoy \u0026ndash; engineering and problem solving and implementation. Until then, I\u0026rsquo;ll have to content myself with working as an independent consultant.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
