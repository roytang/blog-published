            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIn fourth year HS, we had an Economics subject, and back then I was fascinated with the idea of free market capitalism \u0026ndash; the free market, the invisible hand, the law of supply and demand, and the idea that through competition we are forced to adapt and become better and more efficient in order to survive. Capitalism mirrored the law of nature: the strong will survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days, I am much less enamored with the idea of capitalism. Not that I disbelieve that it makes us more efficient, but that ruthless efficiency has a cost. Like the law of nature that it mirrors, capitalism ensures that the strong survive, but the corollary is also true: the weak will die and be consumed by the strong. Humans are a societal species, which means we are supposed to be stronger together. But capitalism, optimized towards the pursuit of profit, often times can force us to sacrifice the greater good in favor of individual interests. Corporations especially, will often act as soulless entities whose mandate is above all to pursue profits in the name of the stockholders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of the societal ills in the world today can be directly traced to the ruthless efficiency in pursuit of profit, the prime example being environmental issues like climate change and pollution: governments don\u0026rsquo;t want to enact stronger controls because it will cut into corporations\u0026rsquo; bottom lines, and politicians don\u0026rsquo;t want to piss off corporations that they rely on for donations. Capitalism\u0026rsquo;s ruthless efficiency has brought us to a world of wage inequality, banks too large to fail, and large monolithic companies that are virtual monopolies due to network effect. It\u0026rsquo;s a system that reinforces the rich and powerful (the strong survive) while the masses suffer in silence (the weak will die)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe emergence of large monolithic corporations wielding monopoly powers is especially challenging, and is a natural consequence of \u0026ldquo;the strong survive\u0026rdquo;. As the rich get richer, they can use the accumulated power and money to defeat any further competition that dares to challenge them. Thus they are able to resist becoming more efficient in favor of simply using their leadership status as a blunt instrument. You can see this in the tech industry with virtual monopolies such as Google (search), Facebook (social networking), Amazon (sales, cloud hosting); realistically they can only be challenged by companies of similar scale, there is no space for smaller guys to move into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still think capitalism can be a force for good, and that efficiency is still something to strive for. But I also now believe that this efficiency should be tempered by a corresponding collectivism, whether enforced by states  (through regulation or subsidies or welfare programs) or by some other mechanism. The idea of something like universal basic income is promising, but under a purely free market system, I don\u0026rsquo;t see how it could work. It is hopefully not too late for us to find a way to navigate our society to a post-scarcity Star Trek-like future, where humans are able to dedicate themselves to scientific and artistic pursuits without worrying about survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(If this sounds like a rant with no proposed answers, it is. This post and others like are just me sounding off on how my thinking and philosophical leanings have changed throughout the years, so that I may consider where it can lead me to. Feel free to debate me in the comments.)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

There was some kind of event going on in the main plaza for the Department of Agriculture; Secretary Pinol was there giving a speech. I walked a couple of rounds around the park so I could meet my daily steps target. The sun was coming down and I\u0026rsquo;m not the best photographer but I thought it looked good on the Quezon Memorial Shrine so I took the above shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have fond memories of the QCMC. When we were young our extended family used to have Saturday picnics there. We\u0026rsquo;d roll up this colorful rattan mat and get into our uncle\u0026rsquo;s car and hang out there playing around and riding bikes and eating sandwiches. I also have this vague recollection of my dad bringing me up the tower that is the Quezon Memorial Shrine. (I don\u0026rsquo;t know how that works. Are there stairs inside? Seems tiring to climb.) I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve ever been in the museum at the base of the shrine though, I should try it some day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese days I still pass by the QCMC every so often. (A single pass around the park adds a good 1500-2000 steps to my daily walks). There\u0026rsquo;s a lot more stuff there now than when I was a kid \u0026ndash; there\u0026rsquo;s playground sets for kids, some kind of exercise machines, there\u0026rsquo;s now restaurants inside, and a whole lot of small vendor stalls. I remember a while back I saw like a zipline and some kind of small duck boat thing, not sure if they\u0026rsquo;re still there, I don\u0026rsquo;t recall seeing them during my last visit. There\u0026rsquo;s a peace bell from the UN that was inaugurated in 1995. And a lot more weird statues than there used to be. (I regret not taking a picture of this weird gold statue I saw with three boys doing something I have no idea what.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe park doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel super well-maintained; the asphalt roads have definitely seen better days. But somehow I still like it, there\u0026rsquo;s this kind of homely atmosphere, and even on weekday afternoons there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of people hanging out in the park. For me, the QCMC is more \u0026ldquo;iconic\u0026rdquo; than say, Rizal Park in Manila, maybe because I\u0026rsquo;ve lived in QC all my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a few years, there will be an MRT station inside the Circle. I hope it leads to more economic activity in the park in general and doesn\u0026rsquo;t lead to any sort of degradation. I hope to be visiting the park for years and decades to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eFor the past few weeks or so, many in the country were consumed by a sort of lotto fever. The PCSO 6/58 Ultra Lotto had gotten up to a record high jackpot prize of more than 1 billion PHP (roughly 20M USD \u0026ndash; I know some lotteries in the US have prizes way higher than that, but hey, we\u0026rsquo;re not the US.) Many people who normally don\u0026rsquo;t play the Lotto were participating due to the sheer size of the pot. I must confess that even I bought a few tickets during the latter part of the run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor reference, the Ultra Lotto draw has 6 numbers from a pool of 1-58 (hence \u0026ldquo;6/58\u0026rdquo;) drawn three times a week. Using the power of Math (TM), that gives us roughly 40 million possible combinations. By comparison, the Avengers only had a 1 in 14 million chance of surviving the events of \u003cem\u003eInfinity War\u003c/em\u003e, so that\u0026rsquo;s way worse odds and you don\u0026rsquo;t even have a time stone! The price of an individual ticket is 24 PHP, and 24 * ~40 million is ~960 million, so once the jackpot exceeded 1 billion PHP, the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value\"\u003eEV\u003c/a\u003e of a single lotto ticket was already a net positive. If only I had the 960 million and change to bet on every single combination!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had actually started betting on the lotto sporadically since last year, mostly for fun. The first time you make a bet it\u0026rsquo;s kind of exciting. Suddenly you went from zero chance of being instantly rich to a nonzero chance! A ridiculously small, highly unlikely chance, but still a chance!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/ToMjGpKniGqRNLGBrhu/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/jim-carrey-dumb-and-dumber-so-youre-telling-me-theres-a-chance-ToMjGpKniGqRNLGBrhu\"\u003evia GIPHY\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve bet a few times though, the novelty kind of fades away after a while and you kinda feel silly, like you\u0026rsquo;re paying a tax for not understanding the probabilities right. (To be fair, I totally did understand the probabilities, I just chose to hope! How can it be wrong to choose hope!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy last bet was the Friday before the jackpot was actually won, and the jackpot was already past 1 billion at that time. To be honest, it caused me a little bit of anxiety. Obviously winning all that money would be good, but in the Philippines suddenly becoming rich had it\u0026rsquo;s own share of risks, including security risks from less-than-honorable people finding out and targeting you for crimes. There was even \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/9mvg95/what_are_the_possible_risks_in_winning_the_lotto/\"\u003ea Reddit thread\u003c/a\u003e about it. (Yes, reading that thread didn\u0026rsquo;t help with the anxiety.) Luckily (what?) I didn\u0026rsquo;t end up winning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jackpot was eventually won last Sunday, Oct 14, split by two winners, bring the the dreams of a nation to an end. Almost immediately I read some conspiracy theories about how the whole thing was a setup and that the powers-that-be had purposely allowed the jackpot to get so high so more people would bet and then at the last minute they faked one of the winners so they could get the money and use it for the upcoming elections. Or something to that effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must say however, that I don\u0026rsquo;t actually recommend regularly betting on the lotto. It\u0026rsquo;s popular in this country, even when the jackpot isn\u0026rsquo;t that high, I\u0026rsquo;m sure my dad has been regularly betting for decades now. Life is tough in this country and for many people the ridiculously low odds are about the same odds they face in daily life anyway so why not? But if you\u0026rsquo;re going to play the lotto, don\u0026rsquo;t delude yourself into thinking that you\u0026rsquo;re actually going to win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/jim-carrey-dumb-and-dumber-so-youre-telling-me-theres-a-chance-ToMjGpKniGqRNLGBrhu\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

To win the bet, one would have to be named person of the year by a major international publication such as Time or Newsweek.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI'm still a dreamer, I always have been. Since I was young I've dreamed of accomplishing something great. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI think everybody has a dreamer inside them, especially when they're young. But as we grow older and face the different trials and tribulations of life, they start to chip away slowly at our dreams. Everyday we make some simple decision that trades a part of those dreams for something pragmatic. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWe tell ourselves we'd just be working for a year or so, until we figure out what direction I wanted my life to take. We have so many options in this day and age; never has the barrier for entry into freelancing, entrepreneurship or innovation been so low. One year passes, then another and then yet another. But we still don't know where we want to go.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWe say to ourselves; it's okay, I can work on my dreams in my spare time. I'll write a chapter a day. I'll code a few portions of my revolutionary web service after I get home. I'll do design work on my game on weekends. I'll brainstorm business ideas on the way to work. But when we come home from our daily grind, we're dead tired and just want to relax, or surf the web, or play games on our consoles. \u003cem\u003eI'll start tomorrow\u003c/em\u003e, a familiar mantra. And days turn into weeks and turn into months and into years.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cem\u003eI need to get some experience first. I just need to save up some more money. I'm already doing pretty well, why ruin it? I'm pretty lucky to have a well-paying job in this economy, I'd be foolish to take risks now. I don't think I can maintain my lifestyle without my job. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThese are the lies we tell ourselves when we find ourselves wondering what happened to our dreams, when we wake up to find ourselves trapped in the loop of ordinary life.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn the end, we tell ourselves more lies. \u003cem\u003eI could've been great. I never had any opportunities. If only I had gotten a break. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd we end our days, humble and simple, having lived an ordinary life. Just another statistic in human history, just another cog in the great wheel of destiny. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFor some people, this ordinary life may be enough, and that's great for them. They will live out their ordinary lives with their ordinary ending and grow old and raise their kids and enjoy the company of their grandchildren and they'll be completely happy and satisfied with that.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThat isn't my story. I don't want that to be my story. I'm greedy, I want more out of life. I don't want my dreams to die.\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I think I more or less still agree with the sentiment expressed above and recognize it within myself, I think the past six years have also added to my perspective in certain ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one thing, at one point in the intervening years I suffered what I consider to be true burnout (I will write about it in more detail someday). That experience created a part of me that\u0026rsquo;s just weary of the world in general and just wants to rest and chill and enjoy life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving worked in a startup recently, I can see how much hard work it takes to try to reach for your dreams and build something for yourself. After having experienced burnout, I am not sure I am willing to put myself through the same level of stress I used to tolerate in the past, much less the additional stress involved with managing my own business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor sure part of me still has that same ambition and fire from six years ago, that still hopes I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to figure out something clever and build something great and make a name for myself. But now there\u0026rsquo;s another part too, and that part just tells me that I\u0026rsquo;ve already worked hard enough, that I don\u0026rsquo;t need to prove anything to anyone, that I\u0026rsquo;ve earned a break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know that this isn\u0026rsquo;t an option for anyone and I realize that I am quite privileged financially \u0026ndash; having significant savings contributes to the fact that I can even consider taking a rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this isn\u0026rsquo;t about financial security. This is more about two conflicting philosophies. The first is that you should work hard to get the most out of life (ambition). The second is that happiness should not be dependent on success (contentment). Ambition pushes us to keep reaching for ever-increasing heights; but too much ambition means we may never find contentment since we keep searching for something greater beyond the horizon. It\u0026rsquo;s a kind of delicate balance we need to walk. We need the fire of ambition to keep us moving forward, but we also need the wisdom of contentment to appreciate where we currently are.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThis is a story from the early days of the internet. Circa 2001-2004ish. A time of Geocities and AIM and and ICQ and from before Gmail even launched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that time, I was a big Final Fantasy fan (okay, I still am, more or less). My first real experience with online fan communities was a Yahoo Groups mailing list called the \u0026ldquo;Final Fantasy Forum\u0026rdquo;. It was a fun, tight-knit group that loved to discuss the FF series and other JRPGs of that era. The group was small, maybe 20-30 active members at peak, but it was also very active; it was not uncommon to have dozens of messages in a day, or even an hour. This was back in the days of dial-up internet here in the PH, so it was a bit challenging to keep up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I did keep up, and was quite active with the group, and eventually even became a moderator. I got to know some of the other active list members quite well, such that I considered them friends (in as much as people you\u0026rsquo;ve never met IRL can be friends in those days, at least). But as you all know, all good things must come to an end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bane of all good discussion groups is drama. First, the original list creator and owner came back from hibernation. Most of us mods had been second generation list members, we never really knew the original creator since he had gone inactive. At first we were all like \u0026ldquo;Hey, welcome back!\u0026rdquo; but then we quickly got into disagreements over how the group should be run. Over a tumultuous few days, he started kicking out and banning people who disagreed with him. I asked him for a dialogue and promptly got kicked out as well. Such was the fate of the FFF.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the next couple of months, the old mods and members tried to re-establish the same community elsewhere. First, they set up an alternative Yahoo Groups list called \u0026ldquo;The AntiFFF\u0026rdquo; (I told them this was a terrible name), which appears to be the \u003ca href=\"https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Final-Fantasy-Forum/info\"\u003ecurrently listed \u0026ldquo;Final Fantasy Forum\u0026rdquo; on Yahoo Groups\u003c/a\u003e. It had a burst of activity for a month or two, and I was there for a short while as well, but there was some disagreement on who should or should not be allowed into the new group, and there was no strong moderation so at some point there was a long debate about religion (another bane of discussion groups) which caused a lot of members to leave and group petered out shortly after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the other ex-FFF mods who was made unwelcome at the AntiFFF messaged me and proposed we create a new group with a more general RPG topic, and we did get the old mod team together and did that, but that group didn\u0026rsquo;t last very long either before activity petered out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround that time, Yahoo Groups itself started to wane in popular usage and everyone kind of drifted apart. I seem to have unsubbed from the last group about a year after it was formed. I only recently started looking into all of this again when I dug up some old emails that referenced the FFF. I don\u0026rsquo;t even have copies of old emails from either the original group or the successor groups. Most of my recollection of events comes from what I remember and the fact that I can still go through the archives of the AntiFFF at the YG site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was struck with a wave of nostalgia when I remembered all of this, and a little bit of regret that I didn\u0026rsquo;t keep in touch with these folks that I interacted with regularly for the better part of 4-5 years. I tried to see if I could track down some of the members I could remember, but back then most of the list members went by aliases which are now defunct. I did manage to find Twitter accounts for a couple of the old members, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t track down the old mod team that I worked closely with. For the rest, all I could find were now-defunct websites and domains and emails and handles for chat networks that aren\u0026rsquo;t even around anymore. It was a completely different internet back then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt feels kind of weird to miss those guys, since I never really knew them in person. These days virtually all of the people I interact with online are people I know IRL. (\u0026ldquo;Virtually all\u0026rdquo; because I do have some Twitter mutuals that I\u0026rsquo;ve never met in person but interact with regularly enough that we are aware of each other.) After the FFF and the derivative groups, I was never again actively a member of a community of \u0026ldquo;strangers on the internet\u0026rdquo; as it were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was all of fifteen-ish years ago, so I can only imagine that many of those peeps have vastly different lives now. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;re no longer active online. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;ve outgrown video games. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;re teaching their own kids now about Final Fantasy. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;re all in different places now with different jobs and different hobbies, and none of them even remember the little mail group we had all that time ago. Or maybe someday some of them might stumble upon this post and say \u0026ldquo;Hey the Final Fantasy Forum! I remember that group! Good times\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

This usually involves reviewing other people\u0026rsquo;s code, helping them with tough technical issues, and even giving career advice. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure how good I am when it comes to mentoring other software developers. When I first became technical lead on projects, I got some evaluations from junior developers saying I can be \u0026ldquo;intimidating\u0026rdquo;. I think it comes from the fact that I have a natural tendency towards being snarky and being annoyed at bad code. It\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;m trying to improve, and while I\u0026rsquo;ll never be cuddly, I think I\u0026rsquo;ve made some great strides in being approachable and in advice-giving. I do try to be accommodating and I\u0026rsquo;m always willing to help anyone who asks for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo that end, a while back I tweeted the following (it\u0026rsquo;s currently my pinned tweet):\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n    On \n    \u003ca href=\"/2017/09/905431727681572865/\"\u003e\u003ctime datetime=\"2017-09-06 14:05:20\"\u003e6 Sep 2017 2:05pm\u003c/time\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n    I wrote:\n    \u003cblockquote\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eWhy not?

What if people ask me questions I\u0026rsquo;m not good enough to answer? What if I give terrible advice? Even worse, what if I give *wrong* advice?!? Still, it seemed worth a shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0026rsquo;t actually expecting to get many questions, since I didn\u0026rsquo;t have too many followers on Twitter. But the above tweet got me put on at least 2 twitter mentor lists (\u003ca href=\"https://ishansharma.github.io/twitter-mentors/\"\u003ehttps://ishansharma.github.io/twitter-mentors/\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://mentorlist.herokuapp.com\"\u003ehttps://mentorlist.herokuapp.com\u003c/a\u003e), so I did end up getting a few. Here are some samples of the discussions I ended up having:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA C/Java developer with 2 years experience looking for advice on how to write good code. I ended up recommending some books to read\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA student looking for some help with a group assignment involving JSP and Servlets \u0026ndash; he wasn\u0026rsquo;t too well-versed with the technology yet or web programming in general, and I ended up having to explain some of the more basic concepts (apparently their teacher wasn\u0026rsquo;t doing a very good job)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA Java developer with 7 years experience looking for advice on how to keep up with advancing technologies and how to interview for senior positions\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA developer asking for feedback on a technical blog post he wrote \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA developer asking for feedback on a small project she had uploaded to Github\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the responses so far have been from internet strangers \u0026ndash; not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s because most of the devs I know IRL aren\u0026rsquo;t on Twitter. Well, that and any devs I know IRL who want advice have better channels to contact me by. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt has been an interesting experience. So far everyone seems to have been receptive to my advice and my impostor syndrome concerns haven\u0026rsquo;t been realised (maybe they\u0026rsquo;ve just being polite lol). I\u0026rsquo;m also not sure if I should follow-up with them after some time to see how things worked out or if that\u0026rsquo;s weird. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to more queries in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It\u0026rsquo;s a fantastic read for anyone who grew up playing PC games during the 80s and 90s. It gives us a birds-eye view of what the burgeoning gaming industry was like back then, not just with the technical and business aspects, but a lot of the human aspects as well: there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of drama, conflict, and betrayal to go around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book\u0026rsquo;s narrative does a good job of contrasting the Two Johns: Carmack was a programmer, a technical wizard who pushed the boundaries of game programming where no one else dared go. He was interested purely in the programming and in the creation of virtual worlds and preferred a smaller, leaner, ruthlessly efficient company focused on making the most of his technology. Romero was a gamer first, and an ambitious and competitive one. He was the number one competitor on their own deathmatch games and dreamt of building a gaming empire, living the life of a rock start among the gaming community as the front man of id software. Together their complimentary skill set would take them through a dizzying rise to fame and fortune in the game development world as they blazed new trails, defined new genres, and inspired a new generation of competitors. At the same time, their differences would ultimately cause them to go down different paths \u0026ndash; knowing full well in advance how the story ended for their partnership made me turn the pages quicker as I dreaded the inevitable split.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a gamer since the late eighties, and though I never considered myself particularly good at first-person shooters, I did play most of the games that comprised id software\u0026rsquo;s wonder years \u0026ndash; Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Doom II, Quake and Quake II. I will freely confess I mostly used the build-in cheat codes to just fool around in most of these games, although I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I finished Quake II\u0026rsquo;s single-player campaign legitimately. We didn\u0026rsquo;t have good internet back then, so the only opportunity I ever had to play Deathmatch back then was split-screen on a console at a friend\u0026rsquo;s house, even then it was helluva fun. Post-Quake II, I never played FPSes much again, though I did enjoy reading about John Romero and Ion Storm and was looking forward to their promised RPG Anachronox and only later heard about what a failure Daikatana turned out to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still have this lingering dream of breaking into game development somehow. Though I\u0026rsquo;m not envious of the death march crunch mode periods typically described in the book, I am a bit envious of what a huge advantage it was for geniuses like Carnack and Romero to have been at the right place and time for the nascent games industry to turn them into legends. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;d have had the technical chops to compete with them if I had the same opportunities, but I surely would have given it a go. I consider myself closer in temperament to Carnack than Romero \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;m more interested in the technical side and could probably use some help in the promotion and game design and level design stuff. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;ll ever actually get there, but I take solace in this quote from the penultimate chapter of the book:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n    Carmack disdained talk of highfalutin things like legacies but when pressed would allow at least one thought on his own. \"In the information age, the barriers just aren’t there,\" he said. \"The barriers are self-imposed. If you want to set off and go develop some grand new thing, you don’t need millions of dollars of capitalization. You need enough pizza and Diet Coke to stick in your refrigerator, a cheap PC to work on, and the dedication to go through with it. We slept on floors. We waded across rivers.\" \u003cbr /\u003e\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e",

The party members can fight directly as well, but most of the time it\u0026rsquo;s a better idea to let your familiars go at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can imagine, the grindiest part of the post-game was collecting all the familiars. Ok, not all of them, the achievement only required 250 different species captured, but that\u0026rsquo;s a helluva lot. During the normal main game run, I only captured a bit less than 100 different species. It was made more grindy by the fact that there\u0026rsquo;s no mechanism for trying to capture the familiars (i.e. pokeballs), you basically just have to beat them in battle and whenever you beat one, there\u0026rsquo;s like a 2-8% chance that you will get an opportunity to recruit it. Thankfully, you can shortcut the grind a bit by collecting the lower level ones and using metamorphoses (basically pokemon evolutions) to get the higher level ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story feels like it\u0026rsquo;s targeted towards children, so it has a kind of fairy tale feel, and the world is very bright and cheerful (mostly) and there\u0026rsquo;s things like a kingdom where the king is a giant cat, and so on. Not that the plot is simple mind you \u0026ndash; there\u0026rsquo;s quite a bit or parallel worlds, a tiny bit of time travel, and a few plot twists thrown in (although you might have seen them coming).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy favorite part of the game has to be all the puns. Many of the familiars have some sort of pun involved in their name, like there\u0026rsquo;s a dog familiar called \u0026ldquo;Ruffian\u0026rdquo;; there\u0026rsquo;s an egg-shaped familiar with a pharoah mask called \u0026ldquo;Eggyptian\u0026rdquo;. There\u0026rsquo;s a cat thief familiar called \u0026ldquo;Purrloiner\u0026rdquo;, who evolves into a \u0026ldquo;Cutpurrse\u0026rdquo;, and can then evolve into another form which you can fight on the seas called a \u0026ldquo;Puss in Boats\u0026rdquo;. There\u0026rsquo;s a sheep familiar called \u0026ldquo;Baatender\u0026rdquo; who can evolve into a \u0026ldquo;Baabarian\u0026rdquo;. There\u0026rsquo;s a familiar that wears a turban and he\u0026rsquo;s called a \u0026ldquo;Turbandit\u0026rdquo;, and he has higher forms called \u0026ldquo;Turban Myth\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Turban Legend\u0026rdquo;. Okay, I\u0026rsquo;ll stop before I enumerate them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a few other systems familiar to JRPG players \u0026ndash; crafting, a casino, farming enemies for drops, bounty hunts, errand boards and so on on. Oh and some nonsense about fixing people\u0026rsquo;s hearts by finding people willing to contribute attributes like confidence and kindness and whatnot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all a very fun game and something I\u0026rsquo;m glad to have gotten off my backlog! Not sure if I\u0026rsquo;ll have time to play the second game though, maybe in another five years?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e__\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "(\u0026ldquo;Late Game Review\u0026rdquo; because I\u0026rsquo;m trying to play through games on my ridiculously old backlog, so these games are pretty old)\nI got my digital PS3 copy of Ni No Kuni during some kind of PSN sale a while back for like $10 and seeing as how the sequel came out recently, I figured I\u0026rsquo;d better finish the first game before my rarely-used PS3 decides to die on me.\nAnyway, the game was great and I enjoyed it enough to go for the platinum (post-game was a bit grindy though):",
