I say \u0026ldquo;well-known\u0026rdquo; but I\u0026rsquo;ll be the first to admit that my culturally-ignorant self had not heard of him before, but he\u0026rsquo;s kind of a big deal in Barcelona with many souvenir shops sporting some thing reminiscent of his works. My travelling companions seemed to know what they were doing, so I generally deferred to them when we planned out the day during breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe park was some 4 to 5 kilometers north of our hostel by foot, though as usual we took a more leisurely pace. One of the interesting things we saw along the way was a park-like area near a major thoroughfare where we found a number of old men (and one young man apparently playing hooky on what should be a school day) playing some sort of game which involved tossing metal balls around in a sand-covered lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#86aca36476bc98e652de788d7b72d1ee-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/petanque_hu344958b007412dda4fbc23c0a6f109bb_451985_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Googling \u0026#34;barcelona street game where old men throw metal balls\u0026#34; tells us this is called Petanque. -- Photo credit: Ryan Liwanag\" title=\"Googling \u0026#34;barcelona street game where old men throw metal balls\u0026#34; tells us this is called Petanque. -- Photo credit: Ryan Liwanag\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eGoogling \u0026ldquo;barcelona street game where old men throw metal balls\u0026rdquo; tells us this is called Petanque. \u0026ndash; Photo credit: Ryan Liwanag (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"86aca36476bc98e652de788d7b72d1ee-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/petanque.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eGoogling \u0026#34;barcelona street game where old men throw metal balls\u0026#34; tells us this is called Petanque. -- Photo credit: Ryan Liwanag\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"12 Apr 2015 2:33am\"\u003e12 Apr 2015 2:33am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eThere were benches nearby so we sat there for a while observing the game and trying to figure out the rules. As far as we could tell, first they toss a smaller ball that then acts as a target, and they have to lob the larger metal balls as close as possible to the target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter watching the games for a while, we decided to continue our trek. From this point on the path we were following (provided by Google Maps) started to tread uphill and I started to get a bit tired. Eventually while my two companions were taking a break and looking at something I vanished for a while as soon as I saw a supermercats so that I could buy a bottle of water and recharge a bit. Supermercats are something like a combination of a small grocery store and a convenience store (they\u0026rsquo;re everywhere, and they don\u0026rsquo;t have 7-11s), and they seem to be often run by people of South Asian or Arabic descent. Whenever I see a supermercat, the name makes me visualize some combination of a cat superman who is also half-fish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe continued along the uphill route, through winding paths and eventually up three flights of stone steps at a 45 degree incline, by which time I was pretty tired and was complaining a lot. I was told we were close, so we trucked on and eventually we turned a corner and found a series of outdoor escalators that would have saved us a lot of effort with those stone steps. I glared at the person guiding our route before we all laughed out loud. The entrance to the park area lay just ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe climbed up a hilly area that afforded a good view of the city of Barcelona before eventually coming upon a tourist area overlooking a sealed-off area that was actually the roof of the columned area of the park. The park was the first tourist attraction we would pay for, and though my stingy self balked a bit at paying 8 euro for the entrance, it would turn out to be one of the cheapest tourist spots we would enter anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have not much to say about the Park itself, given my lack of architectural and artistic vocabulary. There\u0026rsquo;s a large columned area where the roof is lined with what I could describe as shattered plates, an impression which would turn out to be typical of Gaudi\u0026rsquo;s work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#ff2b87fc016a51d5c56a96e57400792d-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/park-guell-roof_hud73151781bff8be7b9fc5ac46dfcdf8d_417669_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"The roof of the columned area looks like shattered plates -- Photo Credit: Ryan Liwanag\" title=\"The roof of the columned area looks like shattered plates -- Photo Credit: Ryan Liwanag\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eThe roof of the columned area looks like shattered plates \u0026ndash; Photo Credit: Ryan Liwanag (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"ff2b87fc016a51d5c56a96e57400792d-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/park-guell-roof.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eThe roof of the columned area looks like shattered plates -- Photo Credit: Ryan Liwanag\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"12 Apr 2015 2:33am\"\u003e12 Apr 2015 2:33am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe columned area is surrounded by a gardens area on one side and on the other side an overhang held up by a series of earthy stone columns one of which is carved in the shape of a washer-woman (which took us a few minutes to find).

However as our first lesson of how European restaurants actually work, we found out that we were too early as the place would only open at 7:30 pm. This would turn out to be typical in Europe \u0026ndash; most restaurant type places would only be open a few hours during lunch time and again a few hours during dinner time, which was bad news for us since we tended to skip some meals and eat at irregular hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUndaunted, we walked around a bit for an alternative before settling on a small bar that advertised paella at less than 10 euros each.

Paella is a Valencian dish although it\u0026rsquo;s also common in Catalonia, so I went with Paella Valenciana (okay, it\u0026rsquo;s also because I eat meat and not seafood)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#057bc24a336b89785497170bcd880dc4-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/paella_hu2c7c8c667a769ae4786f1acd7613fcac_1612166_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Yummy paella!\" title=\"Yummy paella!\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eYummy paella!

This meant a leisurely walk along the Diagonal road, one of the major thoroughfares running across Barcelona. It\u0026rsquo;s called the Diagonal because it cuts diagonally across what is otherwise Barcelona\u0026rsquo;s orderly-structured regular square street blocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sagrada Familia itself is a church designed by Gaudi, a large somewhat out-of-place structure occupying one of these city blocks. One of the hostel people had told us its\u0026rsquo; history, about how it was started back in the 1800s and that construction was still ongoing up to now. There\u0026rsquo;s a fee for going inside the church, with the funds contributing to the construction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#00f54d7ae5a8bf211408e3fedc7b071e-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/sagrada1_hu222b5c5d84c9eb1683826d3fba3444f5_412117_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Sagrada Familia -- Under Construction\" title=\"Sagrada Familia -- Under Construction\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eSagrada Familia \u0026ndash; Under Construction (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"00f54d7ae5a8bf211408e3fedc7b071e-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/sagrada1.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eSagrada Familia -- Under Construction\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"12 Apr 2015 2:33am\"\u003e12 Apr 2015 2:33am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eWe opt not to go inside, as the facade of the church already offers a lot to see. There seemed to be three different facades and numerous spires, each lined with decorations and statues of a different theme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#999a009d91645a4256378d39e831f64e-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/sagrada2_hu2ebb03cb8323d95159feb0b77ed22b1c_1547832_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"South facade of the Sagrada Familia -- it looks like some sort of Nativity scene\" title=\"South facade of the Sagrada Familia -- it looks like some sort of Nativity scene\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eSouth facade of the Sagrada Familia \u0026ndash; it looks like some sort of Nativity scene (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"999a009d91645a4256378d39e831f64e-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/sagrada2.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eSouth facade of the Sagrada Familia -- it looks like some sort of Nativity scene\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"12 Apr 2015 2:33am\"\u003e12 Apr 2015 2:33am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eWe spent some time admiring the structure, and even a few minutes in an FC Barcelona exhibit right across the street.

This sort of graffiti would turn out to be common not only here but in Paris and Rome as well (though not as much)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the station our hostel would be a short walk, but first we hunted around the Sants station for a place to eat. We looked at some signs for the McDonald\u0026rsquo;s inside the station before deciding we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be having any American fast food for the duration of our trip. We ate at the adjacent restaurant instead, taking in an assortment of breakfast foods on some sort of combo plates. We didn\u0026rsquo;t have too much language trouble even though the staff spoke no English. Although the local language is Catalan, most of the locals will speak or understand Spanish, and we spoke and understood a bit of Spanish ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stepped out of the station to a crisp windy afternoon, with the temperature a bit under 10 degrees. I was worried that my hoodie might not be able to handle the expected cold Europe weather but I held up fine so far. We walked around a bit a midst crowds of skateboarding, rollerblading and scooter-riding youths before figuring out where we were supposed to go for the fifteen minute walk to our hostel. We walked through what a quaint area with a wide open space in the middle of the road for pedestrians \u0026ndash; such a thing seemed impossible back in crowded Metro Manila. Many of the storefronts were closed, probably for the weekend, with their metal security grills lined with the same style of colorfully-lettered graffiti I saw from the train.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this leg we would be staying at \u003ca href=\"http://www.freehostelsbarcelona.com/\"\u003eFree Hostels Barcelona\u003c/a\u003e. The lady at the reception was very friendly and her English was quite good. She answered most of our questions and handed us a few tourist friendly maps that highlighted many of the places we could visit in the city before showing us our rooms. It was a dormitory-type room with four beds and storage units, a bathroom and not much else. One of the beds was already occupied, she said, so the three of us would be sharing a room with a stranger that night. (Spoiler: we did not get murdered in our sleep)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter resting up for a bit, we went out to spend the afternoon taking in a bit more of the city. We made our way towards the nearby Plaza España; the friendly hostel reception lady told us the mall there would give us a good view of the city from the top floor.

Breakfast was cold cuts of ham and sausage, slices of cheese, bread and croissants with various spreads and some juice. Nothing too fancy (i.e. no bacon), but there was lots of food for us to enjoy. The spread would be the same every morning, and it meant we could load up on breakfast so that we don\u0026rsquo;t have to spend too much on lunch and dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Sunday and as a Catholic I was planning to hear English mass.

There weren\u0026rsquo;t too many attendees, maybe around 50 people at best, which is less than I would have thought given the large Catholic population in Spain, though I guess most of them hear mass in the local languages. Most of the attendees seemed to be locals instead of expats; for some reason I was expecting a larger Asian/Filipino presence, maybe based on when I heard mass in Hong Kong or Singapore. The priest was very friendly and would greet each mass-goer as they left after the service. He even gave me a \u0026ldquo;good job!\u0026rdquo; with thumbs up as I went out, not sure why 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriends know I \u003ca href=\"/2013/03/scenes-from-a-quiz-night/\"\u003eenjoy a good quiz night\u003c/a\u003e, and my travelling companions were no different. So for Sunday night, we planned to attend an English pub quiz at the Black Horse Pub, roughly an hour\u0026rsquo;s walk from our hostel. We met up again late into the afternoon and headed out on foot (we liked walking, apparently). Along the way we enjoyed the fancy-looking buildings that lined the major roads. There are apparently no skyscrapers in Barcelona, most of the buildings we saw were maybe five or six stories high at most, with most of them being old-timey buildings lined with fancy ornate facades and some with random minarets or towers at the top. Any time we passed by an obviously modern-style building it looked hilariously out of place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe decided to walk along the Via Laietana, a thoroughfare famous for buildings with different kinds of fancy architecture (I am too ignorant to name them). Aside from the buildings and their architecture which I am surely unqualified to describe, the street itself had a wide middle island for pedestrians, the island lined with trees that looked like they were groomed to look similar in branch structure, recovering from winter. The middle island held a number of outdoor seating areas for the nearby restaurants, a common thing in Barcelona. We debated having some paella right there, since that\u0026rsquo;s the famous dish in the region, but the menus here were a bit pricy so I suggested in Tagalog that we look for some cheaper alternatives later near our hostel. As chance would have it, one of the restaurant staff we passed by overheard us and I heard him say behind us we walked away \u0026ldquo;Mura dito!\u0026rdquo;, leading me to comment about the innate ability of Pinoys to find one another when in a foreign land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was night time by the time we found the pub among a maze of side streets, and the friendly British proprietor welcomed us for their quiz night. The questions were recited out loud in both Spanish and English (leading to one of my companions translating the Spanish instead of paying attention to the English one!). We took an early lead since we used our joker early, but fell behind when it came to the music-related categories (not an uncommon result for our quiz nights!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"#d129dc452927a8be7a61d54d74f16850-lightbox\"\u003e\n                \u003cfigure\u003e\n                  \u003cimg src=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/quiz-night_hu3391d40cbbafc24ad913803c77f7f59e_2275406_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"Our quiz night results -- who knows what place we finished\" title=\"Our quiz night results -- who knows what place we finished\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n                  \u003cfigcaption\u003eOur quiz night results \u0026ndash; who knows what place we finished (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                \u003c/figure\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n            \u003cdiv  class=\"lightbox\" id=\"d129dc452927a8be7a61d54d74f16850-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n              \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n                \u003cimg src=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/quiz-night.jpg\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eOur quiz night results -- who knows what place we finished\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"9 Apr 2015 5:43am\"\u003e9 Apr 2015 5:43am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2015/04/europe-trip/\"\u003eView post\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e            \n        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the pub quiz, we decided to take a cab home since it was late.

            "summary": "My previous post only skimmed my trip to Europe. I did not want to write too much, partly because I was uncertain at how many would be interested to hear the sordid details and partly because while I was writing the post, the words did not flow as freely as I would have wanted. Despite this, I have received good feedback and more than one person had asked for more details.",
