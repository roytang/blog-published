So I took a taxi, just outside Megamall. The driver had to ask me where I was going, and luckily my choice of destination was favorable to him. Now, to be honest, I really hate taxi drivers who choose passengers based on where they\u0026rsquo;re going. Not only is it illegal, it\u0026rsquo;s annoying. So I didn\u0026rsquo;t really like it when he turned out to be a chatty driver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn our way down East Avenue, near the LTO offices, he told me how he had spent the whole day there yesterday to get his taximeter calibrated. Now, the government recently declared an increase in taxi fares, so taxis have been lined up in droves along East Avenue for days now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason, I found myself interested. He told me about how he was there since 5 in the AM, sleeping in his taxi (apprently a new one, or so he said) He told me about how the chairman (of what exactly, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure) didn\u0026rsquo;t know anything about cars and had to call a senior citizen employee to help her sort it out. She didn\u0026rsquo;t know much, he said, but she had guts. She stuck to it all day, stopping only to eat, making sure everything was in order, enduring the verbal abuse of the taxi drivers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said he was impressed with her, a diminutive woman in her late thirties, a bit attractive, apparently single. She hunched when she sat down, but when she walked, she stood tall \u0026ndash; she knew how to carry herself. She was new to the office, he said, but she was eager to learn and she meant well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a good storyteller, relishing the details of his story, I wish I could do it justice. I came away impressed, and not a bit ashamed. I was ready to dismiss him as another nobody, someone who couldn\u0026rsquo;t learn anything in life but how to drive a car. But the way he spoke, the words he used, they spoke of a subtle intelligence, a stoic understanding of events around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should chat with taxi drivers more often.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

You start to notice this certain person. You find her sweet and friendly. You like the way she looks, the way she talks, the way she smiles. She\u0026rsquo;s pretty cute, she\u0026rsquo;s smart, and her smile is enough to melt your heart. You hang out with her every so often. You find something about her that turns you on. Pretty soon you find yourself thinking about her more than usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is it about her that has your interest? You\u0026rsquo;re not sure. You don\u0026rsquo;t even know her that well. She\u0026rsquo;s not the type of person you always thought you\u0026rsquo;d fall for. She\u0026rsquo;s not a super-beautiful hot babe. She doesn\u0026rsquo;t give any special indication that she\u0026rsquo;s even remotely interested. But your heart doesn\u0026rsquo;t give a damn, you love her anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou start to worry about how you\u0026rsquo;re feeling. You wonder whether you should try to get close. Or maybe you should be upfront and tell her how you feel. You agonize for weeks; all the words left unsaid, swimming around in your head, yearning for release. You want to be careful. But you want to shout your love from the rooftops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. In a moment of weakness, it comes out. Your first mistake. You tell her how you feel. Verbally, by SMS, by email, by chat, by hand-written note, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. It all starts coming out. Like a fool, you pour your heart out, believing that your love for her is enough; enough for her to give you a chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo such luck. She won\u0026rsquo;t even consider it. She can only be your friend she says. You walk away, sad, shattered, dejected, not knowing what to do. It rips away your heart, the fact that you love her so much, you feel so strongly for her, yet she cannot return even a fraction of the intensity of your emotion. You feel so helpless, so powerless over this situation that means the world to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou ask yourself what went wrong. Did you say something stupid, did you do anything wrong, did you blow it? No, she says, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with you, it\u0026rsquo;s me. Bullshit, you say to yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou try to keep on hanging out with her, to be her friend, as she says. But you can\u0026rsquo;t . Every moment you spend with her is infinity of torture. You want to speak out, tell her how you feel, remind her that there\u0026rsquo;s someone loving her. Seeing her is pure agony. In yet another moment of weakness, you make your second mistake. You tell her you still love her, you tell her you\u0026rsquo;re still there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe refuses to talk about it; she says she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to feel the guilt. Damnit! You blame yourself, asking why you always say the wrong things at the wrong time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon, things become awkward between the two of you, and you drift apart. You see her everyday, but you barely talk. You still feel the same way, but you can\u0026rsquo;t even comfortably spend time with her anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou tell yourself that you should just try to be her friend. You bottle up your feelings, try to set them aside. They eat away at your heart, tear apart your soul. Running into her becomes a double-edged sword; you\u0026rsquo;re glad to see the smile on her face, but you\u0026rsquo;re saddened by the awkward silence that exists between you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou start to question yourself. You start to ask God what you did to deserve this sort of pain. Are you really so unattractive, so unremarkable, that the girl of your dreams won\u0026rsquo;t even consider you? Was it really too much to hope that this girl could at least look beyond your outer shell and try to get to know the real you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou start to doubt the girl you fell in love with. Maybe she wasn\u0026rsquo;t as nice as you once thought? Maybe she\u0026rsquo;s an evil, heartless bitch? Maybe she\u0026rsquo;s no more special than you are, maybe you\u0026rsquo;ve put her up on a pedestal, and maybe you\u0026rsquo;d just be disappointed if the reality did not match your expectations? Is she really worth all this pain?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou start to think about how you feel. Are you really in love with her? Or do you just want her because you can\u0026rsquo;t have her? Are you in love with the real her, not just some made-up idea of her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;This is madness!\u0026rdquo; you finally conclude. \u0026ldquo;There has to be more to life than this\u0026hellip;  Why should I waste so much of my time and energy pining over this woman, a woman who will probably never even consider me, a woman whom I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure why I\u0026rsquo;m attracted to?\u0026rdquo; You come to a decision. You will get rid of these feelings, these emotions; push them away to some dark corner of your soul and leave them to rot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you do it. It pains your heart to do so, but you start to avoid her. You don\u0026rsquo;t talk to her unless you need to. Whenever you think of her, you throw yourself into your work, your hobbies, your friends, anything to rid your mind of her lingering presence. You do what it takes. You pull out that part of your heart that remembers her smile, and you bury it inside, deep inside, so that you may never feel those painful emotions again. You kill that part of your soul that knows how to love and how to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is living pain and torture, but eventually you manage to do it. You manage to regain control of your mind, heart and soul. You\u0026rsquo;re finally at peace. All is right with the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then you see her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe greets you, talks to you, compliments you, smiles at you. And suddenly all your hard work fades away. Your world is no longer your own. You\u0026rsquo;re falling in love, all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou recognize it, and you accept it. You are able to survive, because somehow, through all those moments of pain, heartbreak and despair, a light shines through. Every so often, you manage to get some time to sit with her, talk to her, see her smile. And those moments, while very rare, are also very precious. Those moments are pure, unadulterated bliss, and you wish there was a way to make them last forever. They are no more than fleeting instants between oceans of pain, but somehow, those few moments are enough to make all of the loneliness worthwhile\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the cruel, vicious cycle repeats itself\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Like all other exams I take, I finished it unhumanly early. If I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any kind of shame, I would have submiited the AM exam a whole hour-and-a-half early just so I could get some sleep before the PM part. (Some people noticed I was dozing off anyway :P)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t get the big deal though. For objective-type, multiple-choice exams, there\u0026rsquo;s really no reason to linger over the questions. Read the question once or twice, and you realize that either (a) you already know the answer, (b) you will never know the answer or (c) you think you know the answer, but you\u0026rsquo;ll need time to remember it. For most questions, it should be either (a) or (b), because you should be aware of the scope of what you have studied. For (c), well, I guess I\u0026rsquo;m unique here, because instead of taking time to actually think about what the right answer would be, I just go with my gut and pick a likely answer!

A tip to anyone who might want to take it: Don\u0026rsquo;t bother with those five thick reviewer books they give you.

Like all other exams I take, I finished it unhumanly early. If I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any kind of shame, I would have submiited the AM exam a whole hour-and-a-half early just so I could get some sleep before the PM part. (Some people noticed I was dozing off anyway :P)\nI don\u0026rsquo;t get the big deal though.",

I don\u0026rsquo;t talk about these things that often, but hey, what use is a blog if you can\u0026rsquo;t use it as an outlet, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m in love. Yup, I am. Whereas I previously considered myself as someone strong enough to be emotionally independent from other people, I find myself now thinking about a certain person constantly, worried about how she is, having my mood depend on how she interacts with me, and generally acting quite nervously around her. I won\u0026rsquo;t mention her name, but I will say I\u0026rsquo;ve known her for a bit of time now, and it took me a while to reconcile the desires of my heart and the objections of my mind; but today I am sure: I love her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis sort of thing is really not my style, I normally don\u0026rsquo;t like to speak of romantic ideals or anything, so I\u0026rsquo;ll cut to the chase. She knows, I told her. And her response? Well, it was less than what I wanted, but more than I expected. In her own words: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not closing any doors on you, but I\u0026rsquo;m not leaving any windows open either.\u0026rdquo; She wants us to be friends, she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want me to court her, she says if she feels something for me somewhere along the way, then that\u0026rsquo;s it; if not, then too bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I\u0026rsquo;m generally stupid about this sort of thing myself, so to be honest, I have no idea how to proceed. I want to pursue something with her, but for now, I really have no choice but to settle for building a friendship and hope that fate gives me a chance some day. (It seems I have a tendency to rely on fate for such things\u0026hellip; )\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess the main reason I\u0026rsquo;m blogging this is that I realize it\u0026rsquo;s brought about a change in my life\u0026hellip; and I want to remember it. I want to remember that this is the time I changed, and that she was the reason why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did I change? For one thing, I seem to have gotten back a whole lot friendlier, and also a whole lot moodier. She brought out my gloomy side again \u0026ndash; the side of me that\u0026rsquo;s logical and analytical. He seldom needs to come out because I can usually rely on my normal self to handle things. But this whole issue with her â€” I have no idea how to handle it, so gloomy side comes out. Except he has no idea what to do either. It isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly a problem well-suited to logical analysis, and it frustrates me so much that something I feel so strongly about could be so out of my control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo things have happened as a result of this, basically: one, I\u0026rsquo;m more open to people now; and two, I spent some time thinking about love and life, and my life in general, where I want to go and what I want to do. I think I learned a lot about myself; maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll write about it one of these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now, I just want to remember that she is the reason I\u0026rsquo;m feeling this way\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It was set by Filipino troops fleeing Iraq.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven more embarassing, I would think, was the overreaction of local leftist/militant groups,Â \u003ca href=\"http://www.inq7.net/brk/2004/jul/17/brkpol_4-1.htm\"\u003edemanding an apology from Leno\u003c/a\u003e, accusing him of being a \u0026ldquo;swashbuckling apologist\u0026rdquo; for George W. Bush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevermind the fact that Leno, Letterman, O\u0026rsquo;Brien and other late night talk show hosts continually rail on Dubya and their other â€˜respectable\u0026rsquo; politicians whenever they find an opportunity to do so; these guys don\u0026rsquo;t even apologize to George W. Bush, the supposed \u0026ldquo;most powerful man in the world\u0026rdquo;; why would they even consider apologizing to a bunch of whiners who don\u0026rsquo;t even realize the irony of what they\u0026rsquo;re saying?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you know what? It is cowardice. It\u0026rsquo;s spineless and shameful. Our government once again shows how weak it is by turning tail at the first sign of trouble. Whatever ridicule we get from international media, whatever spite we get from our \u0026ldquo;allies\u0026rdquo;, I can\u0026rsquo;t deny we deserve it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong; of course I wish Angelo dela Cruz gets out of this mess safely, I wish him no harm. But it isn\u0026rsquo;t a simple open-and-shut case of trading our troop positions for the life of one man. By giving in, we surrender our principles, we say to the world: Just abduct a Filipino and you have an entire nation at your command! This is my beef, my gripe, I don\u0026rsquo;t really care about the politics of the situation, whether RP is being a US lapdog or whatnot; All I know is that it\u0026rsquo;s suddenly becomes very profitable for terrorists to kidnap Filipinos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter what \u0026ldquo;War on Terrorism\u0026rdquo; rhetoric you spout, or whether you are against \u0026ldquo;US imperialism\u0026rdquo; or not, it should be obvious that terrorism threatens our way of life. You may think that it\u0026rsquo;s not a big deal; our troop commitments in Iraq are pratically insignificant anyway, it\u0026rsquo;s a small price to pay; But what if the next time fanatics decide to abduct a Filipino, they demand more than just a troop pullout? What if they demand that we trade one life for another? What if they demand the complete surrender to the Muslim separatists? Would we give in then? To save the life of one man?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranted, having to weigh the life of one man against the interests of a nation is a terrible burden to bear, a decision I would not want to take upon myself, so I can understand why the government chooses to capitualte. I can only hope that if, God forbid, I am ever placed in a similar situation where an entire nation would have to throw away principles just to save my life, I would be willing to defiantly announce that I should be sacrificed for the greater good. I\u0026rsquo;m not judging Angelo dela Cruz; I don\u0026rsquo;t know much about the man aside from the fact that he\u0026rsquo;s a truck driver in Iraq and that he\u0026rsquo;ll likely receive a heroes\u0026rsquo; welcome for simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a terrible blow to us as a nation, as a people. And Angelo dela Cruz, should his life be saved, had damn better well live a good and fruitful life, because we have a paid a high price for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

If you\u0026rsquo;re not aware of Naruto, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much like Dragonball Z, except with better animation, actual reasons for fighting, and ninjas instead of aliens. It tells the story of a young boy in the Hidden Village of Konoha, cursed with being the living incarnation of a feared nine-tailed demon fox spirit. Simple enough eh?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game itself is cool; it\u0026rsquo;s one-on-one fighting featuring characters from the anime/manga. Not fighting like Street Fighter fighting mind you, but fighting in an interactive environment, with items to be picked up, things to be destroyed, support characters to be called upon, and mighty cinematic ougis do be performed. If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen the Powerstone game in the arcades, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit similar, and this is how I imagine Super Smash Bros. Melee would be like. The graphics are okay; not the best cel-shading I\u0026rsquo;ve seen, but definitely good for the material. You\u0026rsquo;re restricted to 2d movement, but each stage has two layers, and each layer has various ropes, balconies, trees or whatnot that act as platforms. Most of the moves are available to all characters: punches, kicks, button-mashing combos, launchers, knockdowns, jutsus, counters (using the \u0026ldquo;transform into a log\u0026rdquo; technique), shurikens, kunai, surprise attacks from your allies, etc. Each character has three levels of ougi moves; when you connect with an ougi move, the view shifts to a cutscene-style depiction of the character doing their ougi on the hapless opponent. The opponent isn\u0026rsquo;t helpless however; both players are given a sequence of button commands to push. If the attacker does it right and finishes before the opponent, he gets to do more damage and proceeds to the next part of the ougi. Since the ougis deal a huge (usually decisive) amount of damage, the defender usually wanys to do finish his sequence faster to greatly lessen the damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only problem with this game is the lack of characters: Six are available at the start (Naruto, Sakura, Sasuke, Kakashi, Shikamaru and Rock Lee), and six more can be unlocked (Neji, Hinata, Haku, Zabuza, Gaara and Orochimaru); most of the other characters appear in ougis, as support characters or simply as stage backgrounds (you can hit them when you see them on the screen!) There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of other things to unlock though: BGMs, voices, pictures, action figures, songs, video clips of each ougi, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;d recommend it for anyone who\u0026rsquo;s a fan of videogames and the Naruto series.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAs I\u0026rsquo;ve mentionedÂ \u003ca href=\"/2004/04/roy-goes-to-hk/\"\u003ebefore\u003c/a\u003e, I was sent to HK a couple of weeks back, for the rollout of a project I\u0026rsquo;ve been involved with for about a year and a half. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s right for me to be talking about the project here, so I won\u0026rsquo;t delve into any specifics. I will however, bore you all with stories from my first trip anywhere remotely far from home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, the plane trip. Economy class (excuse me, fiesta class) on a PAL Airbus from NAIA2 to HK International on Thursday night. Food was okay, I\u0026rsquo;ve had worse, not really enough to turn me off airline food. The PAL flight attendants, as I later discussed with a male coworker, were quite not-young and, well, not-hot. Heh, probably unfair but you get a certain expectation from media, you know? The flight was short (less than two hours) and uneventful, no dizziness or pukathons for me, thanks, unlike when I take the eight-hour bus ride to Bicol. This may seem boring to seasoned fliers, but I liked that little map that told me at what location we were currently flying over. Neat!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an engineering type, I also took notice of the plane itself. Is it normal that airplanes routinely jiggle and vibrate as the plane taxis? I understand that it\u0026rsquo;s unavoidable as things like cars and trains do the same; but shouldn\u0026rsquo;t things be a bit tighter on a plane? Still, didn\u0026rsquo;t really bother me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon landing, I got a glimpse of HK International Airport. I had heard it was huge, but didn\u0026rsquo;t get to look around much as I was greeted at the boarding gate by two of the HK staff. Nice people, one of them bought me dinner at McDonald\u0026rsquo;s although I told them I had already had the airline food. Afterwards, they took mo to The Peak, apparently a famous spot for tourists in Hong Kong. It\u0026rsquo;s a mall-type thing on top of a rather high mountain. From the observation deck, you could see most of Hong Kong. From there I could see that Hong Kong was a very urbanized area, a lot more than Metro Manila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter spending some time there, they drive me to the Staff Quarters near the HK office, where one of our RP staff has been staying for a month. The RP guy greets me, shows me upstairs, shows me the ropes, and I get some sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe office building is right next to the block where the staff quarters was, barely a five-minute walk. I spent most of my time in HK between the office and the staff quarters. Truth be told, the trip wasn\u0026rsquo;t really very exciting, as there was a lot of work to be done and not much time to goof around. I\u0026rsquo;ll just note some things particularly interesting about being in a foreign country:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePeople speaking in an unintelligible language all the time\u003c/em\u003e. Probably the biggest hurdle to anything, it took surprisingly little getting used to the fact that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t communicate perfectly with anyone, and with some people, not at all. On some occasions, I had to buy food or drinks through pointing and using hand signs to find out how much stuff was. When walking on the street, I\u0026rsquo;d turn my head whenever I hear someone speaking English, because it was quite unusual. Also, when dining out with the HK staff, I\u0026rsquo;d have to rely on them to order for me, since I can\u0026rsquo;t read the menus. Which brings me to\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eForeign food\u003c/em\u003e. Anyone who knows me knows I\u0026rsquo;m quite a picky eater. I don\u0026rsquo;t take to new foods very easily. But it\u0026rsquo;s hard to refuse when you\u0026rsquo;re a guest, so I got to taste more new stuff in my five and a half days in HK than I have for maybe the past three years. It\u0026rsquo;s ok, I don\u0026rsquo;t mind, even the veggies. The biggest problem was the fact that I have no idea how to use chopsticks, and almost every meal needs the use of chopsticks. At one point, I had to badger my co-RP staff to help me get food using the serving chopsticks. While I was there, I had some Taiwanese, Thai food, and of course, Chinese. Lots of Chinese. Oh, and an interesting side note: apparently foreign McDonald\u0026rsquo;s have no McSpaghetti.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eReligious issues.\u003c/em\u003e I was unable to hear Mass on Sunday. We had to work most of the day, but I got off around 4PM. I asked one of the HK guys for directions to a Church (we were in Kowloon, I believe), but when I explained that I was Catholic, he didn\u0026rsquo;t know what the term meant. (This is of course ridiculous to a Filipino; everbody knows what aÂ \u003cem\u003eKatoliko\u003c/em\u003e is!) After saying that my faith is similar to another RP staff who he had also met before, he gave me some instructions on where to find a Church. I walked around a bit, following his directions. Which eventually lead me to a Mosque. Ooookay. So I walked around some more (quite a bit actually, went up and down the same road couple of times), I found a place called \u0026ldquo;St Andrews Church\u0026rdquo;, I guessed this was the place he was talking about. I walked in and asked around, found out they had a Mass around 6PM. So I waited for a bit. Around 5:45 I picked up a flier and noticed that it was in fact an Anglican Church (Is it a Protestant thing? Or something else? I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sure), and I it\u0026rsquo;s not the same so I went out looking again. I saw another Church, this time it was Lutheran. Around 6:30PM, I gave up, bought some dinner at McDonald\u0026rsquo;s and took a taxi home. The next day one of the HK staff who said he was Christian told me there was a Catholic Church beside the Mosque\u0026hellip; apparently it was a small one so I failed to notice it. From our discussion, I think there\u0026rsquo;s quite a distinction here between \u0026ldquo;Christians\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Catholics\u0026rdquo;; which is weird since I\u0026rsquo;m fairly sure Catholics are Christian. Anyway, I was wondering why it was so hard to find a Church in a place where\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThere are so many Filipinos.\u003c/em\u003e You can see \u0026lsquo;em everywhere, as you walk along the main streets. Mostly tourists and domestic helpers, I believe. I could hear Tagalog being spoken on the street more often than English. Of course, maybe I should\u0026rsquo;ve asked one of them where I could go to Church\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTaxis are discplined.\u003c/em\u003e This is of course, shocking to any Filipino! A sticker on the inside of every taxi tells you the rules: They can\u0026rsquo;t turn down fares, they have to issue a receipt when asked, they must follow seatbelt laws, etc. Every taxi is equipped with a receipt machine, and every one of \u0026lsquo;em is bright red so they\u0026rsquo;re easy to spot. Overall, while I still experienced traffic jams over there, their traffic situation is still hella lot better than ours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat else can I say? As I said, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have much free time. They were kind enough to give me half the day off on Tuesday afternoon (my flight home was Tuesday evening), and they recommended some places I could go visit. So I went to Quarry Bay, about 2 MTR stations away from the office. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what I was looking for, though, so I ended up mostly wandering aimlessly, not buying anything â€˜cept for some food and drinks. I actually managed to walk all the way back to the office, and just decided to buy some chocolates from a supermarket to bring home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the flight home, PAL switched me to a much smaller plane, which sucked. :( I got to see more of HK Airport, and let me say\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s frickin\u0026rsquo; huge. I told the guys who brought me to the airport that NAIA2 is like a fourth of HK airport, but now I think it\u0026rsquo;s more like a sixth. I\u0026rsquo;m told they even have some sort of moving platform thing for people whose gates are so frickin\u0026rsquo; far. It took 30 minutes for our plane to taxi, that should say something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, got home around 11:30, bought some more goodies at the duty-free shop. Took a taxi home, arrived safe and sound. Told stories for an hour or so, then \u0026hellip;  zzzzzz.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

If you need to know where you\u0026rsquo;re voting, \u003ca href=\"http://www.findprecinct.com\"\u003efindprecinct.com\u003c/a\u003e is the place to start. Need help deciding? I used the \u003ca href=\"http://www.eleksyon2004.com/display.php?fld=sampleballot\u0026amp;art=index.php\"\u003esample ballot at the Eleksyon 2004 website\u003c/a\u003e to help me fill up those slots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding my choices, the Concilors are all allied with Lakas-CMD, hence they are part of Sonny Belmonte\u0026rsquo;s ticket, who really deserves not only another term but a term with people he\u0026rsquo;s chosen to ally himself with. For president, I chose Roco, â€˜coz hell, if by some miracle he wins I don\u0026rsquo;t wanna miss my chance to gloat that I voted for the candidate who was right in every possible way. For the party-list rep, last time around I voted for Bayan Muna, but I don\u0026rsquo;t really like how they\u0026rsquo;re soft on the NPA, whether or not the military allegations are true. Akbayan, while still left-leaning (to balance the center-to-right preferences of most mainstream politicians), at least recognizes that the NPA Permit-to-Campaign fees are downright extortion and should be criminalized. For the Senators, the only unusual choice is Doc Hussin (more Muslim representation), but the rest should be obvious. I actually had only 11 senators listed before deciding on Hussin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what will happen to the country now? Who knows, for a while I was thinking of voting for FPJ just to see what kind of new crap our country can go through\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "summary": "Seeing as how Cheese (the machine I bought in March) broke down for the umpteenth time, I finally decided to buy a second computer, and went out and bought a new machine (code-name: Barbecue) the day before Christmas. Spent less than I had expected, but the machine is pretty decent, except my video card is a measly 64Mb GeForce2. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably post the specs later. Finished Final Fantasy X-2, at 67% story completion (Yeah I suck\u0026hellip;) Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll post a review of it later.",
