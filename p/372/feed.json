Any nontrivial software system should have some sort of journalling scheme involved, as printlogging is usually part and parcel of the development process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, I would wish that life too had a journalling system, one more reliable and less arcane than that gift humans call memory. I sometimes have trouble remembering what I had for breakfast this morning. Okay, that\u0026rsquo;s a lie, I seldom forget about meals less than a week old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I do have a tendency to forget other things. Tasks to do, people I\u0026rsquo;ve met, appointments I\u0026rsquo;ve set. A Saturday or so (I forget when), I had set a training meeting at 10am. Of course, my job does not require me to be in the office before noon on Saturdays, so I conveniently forgot about the meeting while playing \u003ca href=\"http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/\"\u003eWorld of Warcraft\u003c/a\u003e, recalling such appointment only while taking a bath at 10:30am. (Luckily they didn\u0026rsquo;t mide me re-scheding to 11:30)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, frail as our memories are, we resort to other things to keep us on track. Paper, notebooks, to-do-lists, organizers, calendars, cellphones, PDAs, sticky notes and every so often, the proverbial rubber-band-around-the-finger. (Yes, I have done that, and yes I did forget what the rubber band stood for.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlogging, is of course, one of those outlets, one of those forms of introspection so commonplace on the web nowadays. I started quite some time ago, on another server, and have kept up, a bit sporadically if I might add. I\u0026rsquo;ve never been entirely too sure of my own reasons for blogging. Some parts ego, some parts experimentation, some parts therapy, perhaps some part exhibitionism? In any case, though I have considered several times to abandon this practice, especially when I have been too lazy to pursue it for months on end, I find myself giving it another go eventually. Because life should have an audit trail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShall I offer some excuse of why I have been so long without an entry? Some vague representations of WoW addiction, business at work or general laziness? I just did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, our story continues\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It\u0026rsquo;s Gaiman\u0026rsquo;s writing that stands out though; his flowery prose and florid descriptions brings the fantasy world of London Below to life, presenting a striking contrast to the protagonist\u0026rsquo;s boring life in London Above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, a good read.

If there\u0026rsquo;s any better way or better place to look for the info than the way I describe here, tell me about it. 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, to find out what are the available phones and their features, I check the website of one of the major providers to see what handsets they list, since supposedly this tells me what models are available locally. FYI, I chose to use \u003ca href=\"http://www.smart.com.ph/SMART/Catalog/Handsets/\"\u003eSmart\u0026rsquo;s website\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, this helps me find phones which have features I like. But the Smart website only gives me prices offered by Smart when the phone is tied to one of their plans. Let\u0026rsquo;s assume I want a bit more flexibility and don\u0026rsquo;t want to be tied to the plan. I have no idea where to check the prices though, so I hit two auction sites instead: \u003ca href=\"http://ebili.com\"\u003eebili\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://bidshot.com\"\u003ebidshot\u003c/a\u003e, so I can get some idea what people are willing to pay for these models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEasy enough right? Check the features, cross-check the prices, choose a phone. Some notes on these websites:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmart: Why the hell is the list of phones not sorted in any logical order? None that I can see anyway. When I see a cheap, er, reasonably-priced phone on the auction sites, I want to check the features of that phone on the Smart website but it takes me a while to find it. Some sort of search feature would have been nice. (Or maybe there is one and I missed it?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEbili/Bidshot: Why the hell is the search result list not sortable in any way? If you have a grid of search results, I don\u0026rsquo;t see how difficult it is to implement sortable columns; every single webapp I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on has this feature! I was almost tempted to send them an email offering my services as a freelancer to implement reasonable searching features such as sorting and filtering. These are NOT difficult things to implement, I don\u0026rsquo;t know why we don\u0026rsquo;t see them in all websites; I can understand the performance concern if you\u0026rsquo;re potentially returning millions of hits (i.e. Google), but these searches have hits ranging in dozens, sorting performance hit should be minimal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is all, just wanted to rant.

You get to interact with other players, challenge them, fight alongside them, raid whole cities with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve tried a few other MMOs before, and none really struck me so hard as WoW\u0026hellip; other games get you hopelessly stuck in the levelling \u0026ldquo;grind\u0026rdquo;, but WoW throws so much stuff to do at you that it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to forget about that level bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recommend the game to any serious gamer, even to those who primarily like single-player RPGs. Because honestly, you can play WoW just like a single-player RPG with a vast multitude of quests (except that you occasionally get some other characters helping you out randomly). I\u0026rsquo;ll play again in a short while :p\u003c/p\u003e\n",

And lo, I was lucky enough to find a copy of the fifth book of Stephen King\u0026rsquo;s epic western fantasy, The Dark Tower. It was a huge book, larger than my copies of the first four, but with the same cover style and by the same publisher, so it was the copy I wanted. I spent less than a hundred pesos on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so it was that I once again journeyed into the world/s of the Dark Tower, following the path of Roland of Gilead and his ka-tet of gunslingers along the path of the Beam, heading inexporably towards the Dark Tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark Tower series has always been a weird sort of hybrid. Primarily a western, set in a fantasy multiverse which intersects with multiple versions of our own reality, Roland and his posse find themselves facing robots, bears, wizards, psychotic trains, undead and such. This time they face \u0026ldquo;Wolves\u0026rdquo;, an unknown new enemy who plague a farming community along the path of the Beam. Like any good RPG-party, the gunslingers decide to offer aid to the people of the Calla, though not all would accept their help. In exchange, they are granted the power to travel back to New York, the nexus of all New Yorks, where they must protect the Rose, an incarnation or manifestation of the Dark Tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one thing I did not like about this copy: It had illustrations. Normally, that would be a good thing, but I find I did not really want to know what Roland of Gilead looked like, even to another person, as it spoiled my own vision of what the book tells me. That\u0026rsquo;s how good the series is — it\u0026rsquo;s the type of series where you form your own version of it in your head and you are completely drawn into its saga.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs always, the book is dark and compelling. Despite the hectic work schedule last week, I finish the thick book in less than four days, and the volume ends in cliffhanger, as the ka-tet is broken. Two more books to go before the end of their quest; I can only hope the last two come out in my preferred format soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The current crisis has apparently not yet reached it\u0026rsquo;s breaking point, despite the calls from different sectors for Gloria\u0026rsquo;s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy not impeachment, which is a legal avenue made available by the 1986 constitution specifically for such situations? The opposition argues that it is an administration trap, that her allies would merely squelch the investigation. This is madness. The administration would not dare do such a thing, as they know full well the trigger of Erap\u0026rsquo;s downfall was the second envelope fiasco, and any similar attempt at whitewash would be too much of a risk. One of the reasons why not many people aren\u0026rsquo;t too enthusiastic about extraconstitutional methods \u0026ndash; they haven\u0026rsquo;t even tried the legal remedies yet. When those remedies fail, then maybe, just maybe, people might start caring about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want to read more opinions? Try my brother \u003ca href=\"http://misterchow.blogspot.com/2005/07/haaay-pilipinas.html\"\u003eAlvin\u003c/a\u003e. Or maybe his friend \u003ca href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/reypinmoko/14559.html\"\u003eRey\u003c/a\u003e, who seems to be a rather angry young man, yet somehow still comes off as more rational than some of the other participants in this debacle whoa re at least 30 years his senior.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I remember the atmosphere at UP around the time of the infamous second evelope at Erap\u0026rsquo;s trial. Even the normally apathetic Engineering students were being woken out of their political stupor by outrage at the turn of events by the Estrada-friendly senators. Everywhere you go in UP, people would be asking you if you were coming to the big rally on EDSA.\nToday?
