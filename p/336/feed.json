And lo, I was lucky enough to find a copy of the fifth book of Stephen King\u0026rsquo;s epic western fantasy, The Dark Tower. It was a huge book, larger than my copies of the first four, but with the same cover style and by the same publisher, so it was the copy I wanted. I spent less than a hundred pesos on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so it was that I once again journeyed into the world/s of the Dark Tower, following the path of Roland of Gilead and his ka-tet of gunslingers along the path of the Beam, heading inexporably towards the Dark Tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark Tower series has always been a weird sort of hybrid. Primarily a western, set in a fantasy multiverse which intersects with multiple versions of our own reality, Roland and his posse find themselves facing robots, bears, wizards, psychotic trains, undead and such. This time they face \u0026ldquo;Wolves\u0026rdquo;, an unknown new enemy who plague a farming community along the path of the Beam. Like any good RPG-party, the gunslingers decide to offer aid to the people of the Calla, though not all would accept their help. In exchange, they are granted the power to travel back to New York, the nexus of all New Yorks, where they must protect the Rose, an incarnation or manifestation of the Dark Tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one thing I did not like about this copy: It had illustrations. Normally, that would be a good thing, but I find I did not really want to know what Roland of Gilead looked like, even to another person, as it spoiled my own vision of what the book tells me. That\u0026rsquo;s how good the series is â€” it\u0026rsquo;s the type of series where you form your own version of it in your head and you are completely drawn into its saga.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs always, the book is dark and compelling. Despite the hectic work schedule last week, I finish the thick book in less than four days, and the volume ends in cliffhanger, as the ka-tet is broken. Two more books to go before the end of their quest; I can only hope the last two come out in my preferred format soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

When I first heard they were making a Fantastic Four movie, my first reaction was, \u0026ldquo;Uh\u0026hellip; that can\u0026rsquo;t be good.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plot is barely servicable\u0026hellip; the thing that really made me think \u0026ldquo;suxxor\u0026rdquo; was how Victor von Doom\u0026rsquo;s role was handled. I mean, in the comics, Doom was a monarch, ruler of Latveria. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t a madman bent on revenge. He was a madman bent on world domination!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the comics, Dr. Doom is like a machiavellian villain, craving for power, but never exposing himself directly to harm. He\u0026rsquo;d always get his minions to do dirty work for him, and just when the Fantastic Four thought they had him â€” damn, it was a Doombot all along! Curse you, Doom, you got away again! In the movie, Dr. Doom is like, \u0026ldquo;Holy crap, I\u0026rsquo;m bankrupt and Richards stole my girlfriend! I\u0026rsquo;ll use these newly-acquired non-canon cosmic powers to kick his ass! And maybe get into a punching contest with the Thing, or see if I survive a supernova.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother thing, the FF hardly do anything \u0026ldquo;heroic\u0026rdquo; here. The only time they really do a public service (the scene at the bridge) would have been avoided if the Thing wasn\u0026rsquo;t who he was. Yet, despite this, the people of New York (hm\u0026hellip; was it New York? Well, the Baxter Building was there, so\u0026hellip; ) easily accept them as heroes. This is ridiculous. Movie Spiderman did a whole lot of good deeds, but he received also a whole lot of crap before people started to realize he was a hero. And he\u0026rsquo;s just wearing a mask. What makes people think the people would so easily accept someone like the Thing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Thing is of course, the most tragic member of the FF, and a good part of the movie focuses on the problems caused by his transformation and his desire to find a cure. To compensate, he gets all the funny scenes, such as they are. There\u0026rsquo;s one that reminds me an old Simpsons joke: \u0026ldquo;Your fingers are too fat for this phone\u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best thing about this movie? The Fantastic Four are represented quite accurately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Edit 11-Jul-2005: Actually, the best parts were those involving the Thing and the Torch. Reed was pretty much what I expected, but Sue\u0026rsquo;s character was quite weak, and at some points Jessica Alba seemed uncomfortable with it. It can\u0026rsquo;t be helped though, as before Franklin was born, Sue Storm-Richards had the weakest character development in the comics, and her lacking role in the movie simply reflects that.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worst thing about this movie?

Regarding this, we can only focus on those conversations which imply the President speaking directly to the man on the other end of the phone. With this in mind, I present the following excerpts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConversation between man and a woman on 29 09:43 hotel 2004\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: Hello\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: Hello, maâ€™am, good morning. Ok maâ€™am, mas mataas ho siya pero mag-compensate po sa\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLanao yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: So I will still lead by more than one M., overall?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: More or less, itâ€™s the advantage maâ€™am. Parang ganun din ang lalabas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: It cannot be less than one M.?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: Pipilitin maâ€™am natin yan. Pero as of the other day, 982.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: Kaya nga eh\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: And then if we can get more in Lanao..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: Hindi pa ba tapos?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: Hindi pa ho, meron pa hong darating na seven municipalities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: Ah ok, ok.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe damning words in this excerpt come from the man named Gary: \u0026ldquo;Pipilitin ma\u0026rsquo;am natin yan.\u0026rdquo; (Liberal translation: We will try to make it happen) It implies that Gary was telling GMA that he would do something to manipulate the results to create a 1 million margin of votes. The observant reader should note that (a) GMA did not ask the man Gary to do anything. However, Gary implied doing something illegal which she should have spoken against; and (b) Any manipulation at this point does not seem aimed at stealing a victory, but rather making the victory appear to be a decisive victory\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConversation between Gary and an unidentified woman believed to be PGMA on 02 22:29 hotel June\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col start=\"4\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: Hello, maâ€™am. Good evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: Hello, dun sa Lanao del Sur at Basilan, di raw nagmamatch ang SOV sa COC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: Ang sinasabi nya, nawawala na naman ho?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: Hindi na nag-match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: Hindi na nag-mamatch? May posibilidad na hindi magmatch kung hindi nila sinunod yung individual SOV ng mga munisipyo. Pero aywan ko lang ho kung sa atin pabor o hindi. Dun naman sa Basilan at Lanao Sur, ito ho yung ginawa nilang magpataas sa inyo, maayos naman ang paggawa eh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: So nag-mamatch?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: Oho, sa Basilan, alam nyo naman ang mga military dun eh, hindi masyadong marunong kasi silang gumawa eh. Katulad ho dun sa Sulu, sa General Habatan. Pero hindi naman ho, kinausap ko na yung Chairman ng Board sa Sulu, ang akin, patataguin ko muna ang EO ng Pagundaran na para hindi sila maka-testigo ho. Na-explain na ho yung sa Camarines Norte. Tomorrow we will present official communication dun po sa Senate. Dun ho sa sinasabing wala hong laman yung ballot box. Na-receive\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eho nila lahat eh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: Oo, oo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: Tumawag ho kayo kanina maâ€™am?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGMA: Yeah, about that Lanao del Sur at Basilan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary: Iaano ko na lang ho, nagusap na kami ni Abdullah dun sa kwan kanina. About this, iaano ko ho, wag ho kayong masyadong mabahala. Anyway, we will take care of this. Kakausapin ko rin si Atty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacalintal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, the damning words come from the man named Gary: \u0026ldquo;Dun naman sa Basilan at Lanao Sur, ito ho yung ginawa nilang magpataas sa inyo, maayos naman ang paggawa eh.\u0026rdquo; (Literal-and-not-too-gramatically-correct translation: In Basilan and Lanao Sur, the increases they did for you, they were done well.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese two excerpts are the most important because, as far as I can tell, these are the only ones that imply the President\u0026rsquo;s direct knowledge of cheating done on her behalf. If they avoid, can get rid of, explain away or otherwise cancel out these two excerpts, GMA can easily avoid culpability from the rest of the transcript. For all we know, there could be some wacky explanation that has a small probability of being true. (\u0026ldquo;One million votes? No, we were talking about one million man-minutes spent counting the ballots!\u0026rdquo; â€” Okay, so I\u0026rsquo;m not very creative right now. Submit your own wacky explanation!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs she guilty of electoral fraud? Maybe. This tape at best constitutes what I believe to be called prima facie evidence. As we all should know by now however, wiretapped conversations are not admissible in any court of law in the Philippines. Not even in an impeachment trial, which is not really a court of law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome other notes on the tape:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere are two other known entities on the tape who can be convicted of electoral fraud. One is of course, the man known as Gary. The other is Robert Barbers. These are the most important people that need to come out and speak their side.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe man named Gary is obviously Comelec Commissioner Garcilliano, as he is explicitly named several times.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe phone being tapped was obviously Garcilliano\u0026rsquo;s, as his side is the participant in all conversations.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s all on this matter for now. I will raise more of my own opinions in a later post.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

The movie is less about Batman\u0026rsquo;s crimefighting adventures and more about Bruce Wayne\u0026rsquo;s journey from being a angry, confused rich orphan to the billionaire playboy/costumed vigilante popularized by the earlier films.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe movie captures the essence of Batman\u0026rsquo;s character perfectly. It\u0026rsquo;s all about fear â€” Bruce overcoming his fear of bats and eventually turning that fear into a symbol to strike terror into the hearts of criminals. The Batman here is nowhere near Joel Schumacher\u0026rsquo;s colorful crusader, or Adam West\u0026rsquo;s *Biff*Pow*Sock* type of action. This Batman is a true dark knight, striking from the shadows, unseen, terrifying. I can just imagine the rumors rippling through the underworld during the movie: the Batman is a terrifying monster; he can fly; he can command bats; he is darkness incarnate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two villains that appear in the movie \u0026ndash; Ra\u0026rsquo;s Al Ghul and Scarecrow \u0026ndash; complement the general fear and deception theme of the movie. Jim Gordon\u0026rsquo;s character is great, although it\u0026rsquo;s a bit weird for me to see Gary Oldman in the role. As for Katie Holmes, well, her character didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to have an important enough role from my point of view. Michael Kaine is a worthy Alfred Pennyworth, and this Alfred seems a bit more smartass than those that appeared in the earlier movies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, worth the watch. The tantalizing hint at the end of the movie suggests a sequel, but the question is, who will play the Joker?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, we watched in the new cinemas at SM North. Nice, everything seems a lot roomier and the seats were comfy. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to see what the comfort rooms were like as the movie had me glued to my seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

After some experimenting, I figure it out. \u0026ldquo;Next\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Previous\u0026rdquo; are based on the sort order in the list of messages. Since the default is sorted by date descending (newest first), \u0026ldquo;Next\u0026rdquo; corresponds to Yahoo\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;older\u0026rdquo; by default.

As I suspected\u0026hellip; Yahoo compensates for the unwrappable words by expanding the grid cell, breaking the layout. This was a problem I encountered before in the webapps at workand I still don\u0026rsquo;t have a solution that would work in all browsers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m also interested in how popular webapps handle timestamping, so I try this out as well. For the uninformed, timestamping means handling the case where two people both try to edit the same record at roughly the same time. If there\u0026rsquo;s no handling, the person who updates first usually has his changes lost, without any notification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI try it out first with Yahoo Address Book and Notepad. Both experiments fail\u0026hellip; there\u0026rsquo;s no timestamping. I tested it by opening a record (Address Book entry/Notepad note) for updating in two separate Firefox tabs. I update one tab and save, then update the second tab and save. Changes made in the first tab are lost.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWell, I guess that\u0026rsquo;s okay, since technically, only one person at a time is expected to access these webapps. So I do something else. I create \u003ca href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/roytang/\"\u003ea Yahoo Group\u003c/a\u003e . I get two moderators, me and a dummy email account. I login with both accounts, using Firefox for one and IE for the other. I try to update the group description with one account, then the other. Bam! First guy\u0026rsquo;s changes are lost, without notification! If this were some sort of mission-critical webapp, that would be a dangerous bug.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m sleepy.

Is this still true today, with the advent of digital audio editing? Would people who edit conversations be able to create fake voices that accurately mimic the voiceprint of other people?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould there be a way to check if the recordings really have been altered? I don\u0026rsquo;t know if the mobile service providers routinely keep logs of phone calls\u0026hellip; but if they do, it should be easy enough to check the recordings against any originals logged by the phone company. Although I guess it would be optimistic to assume that even if they did keep recordings, they would be able keep all their tapes since June of last year. That would consume an awful lot of space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess that means this is really a wiretap. Of course, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to imagine how the term applies since mobile phones don\u0026rsquo;t have wires. I\u0026rsquo;m not really aware how one \u0026ldquo;taps\u0026rdquo; wireless technology. Does it involve some sort of interception of the communications? I would think such communications would be encrypted such that only the authorized recipients would be able to receive and decrypt them. But maybe that\u0026rsquo;s too much to expect\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI should\u0026rsquo;ve thought of this as soon as I got DSL: I went ahead and downloaded Transformers the Movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTransformers was of course, the epitome of my youth. Unlike most other guy kids, I preferred the Transformers to G.I. Joe. I guess I preferred high-tech fantasy over soliders back then, with the war of the heroic Autobots and the Evil Decepticons appealing more to my young mind than soldiers trying to fight terrorists. I watched the show, I read the comics (the first comic series I really collected), I had a lunch box, and I even bought and ate the unhealthy cheap knock-off Transformers-branded chips they sold near the St. Joseph parish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTransformers: the Movie was the pinnacle of my childhood experience with the Transformers cartoon, since the seasons following the movie were never broadcast on Philippine TV. I watched it yesterday, hoping I would still find the old charm which enthralled me as a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was not disappointed. Well, not much anyway. As an adult I\u0026rsquo;ve grown more critical of things in general, quick to spot and point out minute flaws. Some notes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe year is 2005 in Transformers the Movie, some 19 years after the movie\u0026rsquo;s actual release. At least they didn\u0026rsquo;t predict flying cars like Back to the Future, but how come we don\u0026rsquo;t yet have cars that look like Hot Rod? The \u0026ldquo;futuristic\u0026rdquo; look of the six new Autobots introduced in the movie (Ultra Magnus, Hot Rod, Kup, Blurr, Springer and Arcee) give you an indication of how the people of 80s perceived future transportation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, Transformers can use lightsabers, er\u0026hellip; Laser Swords! Megatron pulls one out during his fatal battle with Optimus Prime, and later in the movie one of the Autobots does too. (I think it was Hot Rod, I forget.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmazingly, while the Autobots and Decepticons never actually hit each other with their weapons in the TV series, their appearance in a movie suddenly made Starscream\u0026rsquo;s use of the Megatron-gun a lot more efficient, accurate and lethal. Ironhide, Prowl, Brawn and Ratchet go down with a single shot each in the first few minutes of the movie. More Autobots died in the first twenty minutes than in the entire run of the series prior to the movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be much of a problem if the Autobots actually had the same numbers they had in the series. It\u0026rsquo;s a well-known fact that the Autobots greatly outnumbered the Decepticons almost all the time, since there are far more types of cars than there are jets and guns and other stuff. But in the movie, there are apprently less than twenty Autobots still in active service. What happened to the rest? We\u0026rsquo;re limited to Optimus Prime, the more popular first-batch Autobots, the Dinobots and the new guys. The Decepticons get a slightly better deal. They get both the first and second batch of jets, the Constructicons, Insecticons, and even the triple-changers Blitzwing and Astrotrain. Also, I think Blaster\u0026rsquo;s cassette-bots make their first cartoon appearance here. Conspiciously absent are the second set of â€˜combiner\u0026rsquo; teams\u0026hellip; the Protectobots, Aerialbots, Combaticons and Stunticons. Some of the fights might have gone better had the Autobots thought to bring around Omega Supreme or Skyfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dinobots are apparently stupider than I remember. I guess my memories preferred the comic-book Dinobots, where Grimlock actually managed to become Autobot leader. Here Blurr has trouble convincing them to board a ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s too bad the Autobots didn\u0026rsquo;t think of bringing Optimus Prime to the planet of junk, where apprently an Autobot can still live after being blown into some twenty-thousand pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ultra Magnus character was created solely to have someone fail to be a leader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrangely enough, when the Autobots crash through Unicron\u0026rsquo;s eye, we don\u0026rsquo;t see any sort of optic sensors on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the movie went pretty much as I remembered it. With a lot of forgettable 80s-style music running in the background. Amazingly, at the end, Rodimus Prime declares an end to the Cybertronian wars, and a new era of peace. I don\u0026rsquo;t recall any peace being negotiated with the Decepticons, who looked like they outnumbered the Autobots fifteen-million to one during Unicron\u0026rsquo;s attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m quite relieved, as watching the movie failed to change my nostalgic childhood memories of the Transformers, although I still vastly prefer the comic book series. Not at all bad for a series made to sell toys.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I should\u0026rsquo;ve thought of this as soon as I got DSL: I went ahead and downloaded Transformers the Movie.\nTransformers was of course, the epitome of my youth. Unlike most other guy kids, I preferred the Transformers to G.I. Joe. I guess I preferred high-tech fantasy over soliders back then, with the war of the heroic Autobots and the Evil Decepticons appealing more to my young mind than soldiers trying to fight terrorists.",

Oprah\u0026rsquo;s job is nice too. She finds some poor little girl whose dream is to meet a B-list Hollywood celebrity. Wow, how hard was it for her to fulfill that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeriously, I\u0026rsquo;m sure it\u0026rsquo;s great, it\u0026rsquo;s sweet that Oprah\u0026rsquo;s doing this for the kid, who has some sort of vision-related medical problem. Helping out handicapped kids one at a time is a noble cause, to be sure. But I don\u0026rsquo;t know, it just smacks me as a bit superficial that you would choose the ones with relatively shallow dreams (and conveniently easy for you to accomplish.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have nothing against Ashton Kutcher by the way. He is occasionally funny. And he plays that idiot on That 70s Show really well.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
