True Rune attaching itself to your hero? Check. Only thing we need now is a permanent HQ. I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine living on a boat would be very enticing for me in real life. On a side note, this is the first Suikoden where I\u0026rsquo;m actively using an FAQ to avoid missing Stars of Destiny. It was ok not to use an FAQ before, as I always had time to make a second pass to complete the 108 stars after the first play-through. But again, I\u0026rsquo;m a busy man. (On a side note to this side note, the closest I came to completing the 108 stars without using an FAQ was Suiko4 \u0026ndash; I got 107!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBG2:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePros: Wide, open-ended gameplay options.

Gee, won\u0026rsquo;t Imoen be worried that I\u0026rsquo;ve left her in captivity for more than a month now? As mentioned, beholders and mind flayers are a pain, but Yoshino\u0026rsquo;s traps and summoned skellies help a lot. On a side note, I always play a female pally in D\u0026amp;D; games. This one is no different, except that I made the mistake of choosing the Cavalier kit which prevents me from using ranged weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs always, the strength of console RPGs lies in their story focus.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e(My previous practice was never to post an entry about a game until I\u0026rsquo;d finished it. This was a good idea during those days that I had a lot of free time and could finish the average RPG in a week. I haven\u0026rsquo;t been in that state for four years.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brother warned me that according to reviews, the first eight hours or so of Suikoden V were quite draggy. When I thought about it, that should be expected. I\u0026rsquo;ve played Suikoden 1-4 of course, and in all those games, a largish part of the beginning involved the setup where your young hero (or heroes as in Suikoden 3) would be thrust in the middle of a conflict that would eventually result in a quest to gather 108 Stars of Destiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m about 5 hours into Suikoden V, and I have to say: It\u0026rsquo;s draggier than usual. I think it\u0026rsquo;s because most of the first five hours are heavily scripted, mostly scenes with minor interactions designed to lay out all the backstory and history and political intrigue and whatnot. It\u0026rsquo;s been five hours, and I still have no idea what the main conflict is gonna be\u0026hellip; granted it looks like there\u0026rsquo;s gonna be some civil unrest at some point, but we have no idea yet who\u0026rsquo;s going to be on which side, etc. In Suikoden I, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure you were appointed the head of the Liberation Army long before the five-hour point! In Suikoden II, you were kicked out of your homes within two hours. In Suikoden V, it feels like five hours and four weeks of game time later, you\u0026rsquo;re still running errands to ensure your sister\u0026rsquo;s engagement to a scheming noble goes through. Hopefully it starts to pick up soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the things I noticed this time around: I don\u0026rsquo;t like that thing in console RPGs where you have to wander around town until you run into the exact area where a scene will move the story forward. It was fine in Dragon Quest VIII (the last console RPG I played), but here it\u0026rsquo;s ridiculous\u0026hellip; mostly because the cities here seem huge! Granted, I\u0026rsquo;ve only seen Sol-Falena and Stormfist, but both of those cities were large, multi-area maps. There were some sequences where you literally had to systematically traverse the whole town to find the next scene that triggers the story. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m just spoiled because I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing Baldur\u0026rsquo;s Gate 2 lately. That game has a huge city too, but you couldn\u0026rsquo;t walk half a screen through the city without some quest or event thrown at you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, yeah. They need to get to the \u0026ldquo;Okay, I got an HQ and I\u0026rsquo;m gonna collect 108 stars\u0026rdquo; point faster, that\u0026rsquo;s where all the gameplay is anyway. I think the start of the game suffers from the fact there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of back story to cover: the discord between factions in the Senate, the struggle for the throne two generations prior, the invasion from Armes eight years ago, the wrath of Arshtat two years ago, how a barbarian managed to win the Sacred Games and thus marry into the royal family, etc. I suppose that all this back story is needed *before* the meat of the game gets underway, otherwise they could have just sprinkled it in liberally through the game\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Why do people keep paying you for something they could get free?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBallmer: One, people value their time. Our stuff does more, and they like that. Two, people value their time, and those [free] things tend to be clunky. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you think you can save $50. And then you go and waste three hours. You tell me how quick that payback is. Y\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAwesome example, especially from a third-world POV. Let\u0026rsquo;s try a practical example: Microsoft Office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, after being tossed around in a haphazard manner by the Microsoft Office website, I\u0026rsquo;ve determined that the box price of Microsoft Office 2003 Standard Edition is around $400.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s say we have a guy in the US who wants to buy an Office suite. A typical middle-class white-collar guy, who needs it to write stalker-type fan-mail, balance his budget, whatever. This typical middle-class guy (let\u0026rsquo;s call him Joe) makes about $200 a day. (Okay, that might be on the low-end for US salaries, I don\u0026rsquo;t really know; but bear with me here, I don\u0026rsquo;t want have to do any more actual research\u0026hellip; ). So he compares the cost of MS Office 2003 Standard Edition, which he uses at work (yes, this unscientific thought experiment considers MS lock-in!), with that of this alternative thingy he heard of, OpenOffice. Why, the difference is a whopping $400! That\u0026rsquo;s four days work!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, Joe reasons: If I go for OpenOffice, I save two days\u0026rsquo; salary\u0026rsquo;s worth in buying price\u0026hellip; but I have to download it, familiarize myself with it, convert all my old documents\u0026hellip; and I don\u0026rsquo;t even know if it will do everything I want! MS Office is convenient, and for Joe, it\u0026rsquo;s just two days\u0026rsquo; salary anyway. It might very well be worth it for Joe to just buy MS Office and not have to bother with all this open source business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, say we have another user, this time from the Philippines: Juan is a typical Filipino office worker. He\u0026rsquo;s earning around P500 a day. (Okay, I\u0026rsquo;m sure this here is a fairly good number) He looks at the price of MS Office and\u0026hellip; why, the price is a whopping $400! That\u0026rsquo;s P20,000! That translates to about a 1.33 month\u0026rsquo;s worth of Juan\u0026rsquo;s salary! Juan finds out there\u0026rsquo;s a free alternative: OpenOffice. He\u0026rsquo;s not familiar with it, but Juan is a pretty smart guy, and he figures in a month or so, he can be just as good with OpenOffice as with MS Office. After all, it didn\u0026rsquo;t take him one month to figure out MS Office right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis points us to the awesome conclusion: Open source becomes more attractive as people earn less. What an interesting (non-scientific) thought experiment! Even more interesting, if we remove the MS lock-in factor, Joe has even less incentive to buy MS Office\u0026hellip; since he has to familiarize himself with whatever software he gets anyway. So, what does this mean for Microsoft? It means, the best way for traditional software companies to conquer developing markets is to increase the per capita income in those countries! Microsoft should make us richer!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink about that: more than a month of Juan\u0026rsquo;s hard-earned salary is needed to buy this software! No wonder the software pirates are so rampant in developing countries!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Sadly, the usual bunch of people who I\u0026rsquo;ve played Magic with since college were not available to ride with me into battle; my companions that day were some people from work instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was my first-ever GP, and it was an awesome experience, to say the least. Compared to the usual local events I\u0026rsquo;ve attended before, the atmosphere is much more formal; it really feels like you\u0026rsquo;re playing on a completely different level of Magic. I also played in a GPT the day before, which turned out to be a good idea as I suddenly got nervous playing against the Japanese guy who took me down in the second-round of the single-elimination trial. A good thing, because I was better prepared mentally the next day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blazed through the first five rounds with a 4-1 record, my sealed deck an all-attacking, no-thinking affair, battles mostly won on the back of a \u003ca\u003eSilhanna Ledgewalker \u003c/a\u003ebearing a \u003ca\u003eMoldervine Cloak \u003c/a\u003eor a \u003ca\u003eShadow Lance\u003c/a\u003e. My one loss was against an officemate who got me on bad draws\u0026hellip;  After he won our match 2-1, I proceeded to win every other practice game against him :(\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless, I was feeling pretty confident, even though my sealed deck had not been very exciting \u0026ndash; not many bombs \u0026ndash; it was doing fairly well, and I was winning matches fairly quickly, each best-of-three affair over in less than twenty minutes. I wanted that sort of deck, the type that wins fast, as I knew from history that long, drawn-out matches gave me a headache. I felt pretty good going into the 6th round, knowing that a win and a draw in the next two rounds meant I was sure to qualify for the second day. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t fought any foreign pros yet, but with my win record I was fairly sure I was heading into that territory\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I went to check the 6th round pairings, and sure enough my next opponent was 2005 Invitational Winner \u003ca href=\"http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/arcana/826\"\u003eTerry Soh\u003c/a\u003e. Whoo! I had been hoping I would get a chance to take on either Terry Soh or world champion Hori, both of whom were participating; what an upset it would have been for a local amateur with a sub-1600 rating to take down one of these guys!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, long story short, I didn\u0026rsquo;t win. :p He took the first game after some trading of blows; I gave him a beating in the second game via \u003ca\u003eSkeletal Vampire \u003c/a\u003eand won unopposed. Third game, we were trading blows again, but he had a \u003ca\u003eHammerfist Giant \u003c/a\u003ethat cleared the board, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any creatures to followup. He won shortly after. So much for that!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7th round. I needed to win this one to have a shot at the second day (not even a very good shot at that\u0026hellip; I think only 20% of 5-2\u0026rsquo;s would have advanced, but my tie-break points were pretty good since 3 of my 4 wins were 2-0\u0026hellip; ). I took game 1 fast, lost game 2 to a sudden surge of fatties, then lost game 3 with my opponent \u003cstrong\u003eat one life\u003c/strong\u003e! Sigh\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s just as well that I didn\u0026rsquo;t make it to the second day though\u0026hellip; I thought I was just getting a headache from playing Magic all day, but I found out later I was already coming down with a fever and some colds. Even if I did make it to day 2, I would have just rare-drafted. :p\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that\u0026rsquo;s my small part of the GP Manila story. Eventually, local amateur JT Porter won the grand prize, netting almost four thousand US dollars. Sigh\u0026hellip; that coulda been me :p I hope the guys at Neutral Grounds can manage to arrange another big event like this in the Philippines soon\u0026hellip; while we aren\u0026rsquo;t the biggest Magic community in the world, we got a whole lotta heart. ^_^\u003c/p\u003e\n",

A bit old, but I know from Code Complete that Steve McConnell really hits in the mark with regard to software best practices. This book is aimed mainly at technical leads — coincidentally, that was my role at the time.

I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure each of the animals in the book represents some sector of society and its\u0026rsquo; faults, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m currently smart enough to identify them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eStainless Longganisa\u003c/em\u003e by Bob Ong \u0026ndash; I picked up this and the previous book on a whim at National Bookstore, because we were sorely in need of new bathroom reading material. (I\u0026rsquo;m not kidding, and bathroom reading material should be a treasured position among authors.) As usual, Bob Ong starts off with some hilarious real-life tales, before heading into some serious stuff about life in the Philippines. The main thrust of this book is to explain how and why he became a writer, giving the reader some insights into what aspiring writers in the Philippines can look forward to (or avoid.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEqual Rites\u003c/em\u003e by Terry Pratchett \u0026ndash; I think this is the third Discworld book, but it\u0026rsquo;s only the first one I finished. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure, it seems like the Discworld books make relatively quick and painless reading. It\u0026rsquo;s light fantasy of course, much the same way that Douglas Adams is light sci-fi; not the sort of thing you should seriously form a whole range of theories about, but fascinating nonetheless. I believe I will try to read more of these books.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eWooo!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure how to begin; my brothers and I have been wrestling fans for almost twenty years now, and as far as I can remember this was the only time that the WWE ever came to the Philippines. The last time was a long time ago, and although I wanted to see it, there was no way I could convince my parents then that the largish amount of cash needed to go was worth it. This time, I was determined to go, and I bought tickets for my brother Alvin and our _pamangkin _Gelo (so I spent for three tickets total.) We only got Upper Box B tickets at the Araneta Colliseum, but that was enough. Some people were telling me it was a waste of money to see the show, but after the experience of last night, I have to say it was really worth it! In fact, I can only imagine that the \u0026ldquo;main\u0026rdquo; Monday Night RAW shows are probably even better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not going to discuss the ins and outs of Wrestling here, I\u0026rsquo;ve had my share of getting people to understand why I follow it. (Of course it\u0026rsquo;s scripted! So are 80% of other TV shows!) But the most important thing to understand is that it\u0026rsquo;s a show. Not only that, it\u0026rsquo;s a hell of a show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey really know how to hold a live-audience show, everything they do is designed to pull in the crowd, get them to participate. They encourage the chanting, and they ad lib some of the responses to roll with how the crowd is going. It\u0026rsquo;s all about the crowd, the Wrestler\u0026rsquo;s job is to control the crowd, and every Wrestler plays his role well. And watching it live is a lot better than watching it on TV, because you\u0026rsquo;re there, and you\u0026rsquo;re part of the show, and you pay attention even to the matches that would\u0026rsquo;ve been boring on TV. You even respond and boo Tyson Tomko and Gene Snitsky, even if odds are you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t care about them if you were watching it on TV. And you appreciate every single performance. Even the heels are clapped for on their way out; I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s the same with the US-side RAW episodes since the loser departures are almost never shown on-air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe matches held were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEugene vs Snitsky \u0026ndash; huge pop for Eugene, the crowd is really into him, especially the teenage girls (I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why I saw so many teenage girls in the crowd, I have no idea what Wrestling\u0026rsquo;s true demographic is). Eugene had a toy stuffed bear with him and the crowd tore Snitsky apart with boos when he destroyed the thing. Eugene wins via Rock Bottom! Funniest bit: Someone in the crowd tried to pull off a ghost fighter reference by trying to start a \u0026ldquo;Tapusin na yan!\u0026rdquo; chant, too bad the crowd didn\u0026rsquo;t follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorie and Lita vs. Trish and Maria with Val Venis as special guest referee \u0026ndash; huge pop for each one of the divas. We all know these are beautiful women, but too bad we were too far up to really appreciate it. I will say that from where I was seated Trish Stratus\u0026rsquo; cleavage was more visible than her face. :p Now, diva matches aren\u0026rsquo;t usually the most entertaining wrestling-wise, as the crowd is usually into it because they like to see beautiful women jumping at each other. After a few exchanges, the crowd got a little antsy and started the \u0026ldquo;We want puppies!\u0026rdquo; chant. (One of my companions was a 12-year old. I think he thought the puppies referred to Torie Wilson\u0026rsquo;s pet dog.) Anyway, Torie and Lita win via some form of cheating. Funniest bit: There was this sequence where three of the divas were rolling over each other and knocked down Val Venis and started rolling over him. Val Venis got up smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob Van Dam vs Tyson Tomko \u0026ndash; the crowd was really into RVD, and Tyson Tomko got a lot of heat. People were a bit bored with the grappling parts, everyone expecting RVD to get in some high-flying kicks. An \u0026ldquo;ECW\u0026rdquo; chant kept going for a while. RVD hit with the spinning heel kick, then followed-up with the Rolling Thunder (awesome to see live!), and finished with the Five-Star Frog Splash (he had to turn a bit in mid-air ‘coz Tomko was at a somewhat wrong angle) Funniest bit: After chanting \u0026ldquo;RVD!\u0026rdquo; a while, the crowd eventually changed the chant to \u0026ldquo;DVD!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMick Foley vs Carlito \u0026ndash; Carlito got a huge pop during his entrance, and started off on the mic saying \u0026ldquo;This place is great!\u0026rdquo; (huge pop) then followed up with \u0026ldquo;Just kidding!\u0026rdquo;, then he proceeds to his heel routine, eventually making fun of local women by comparing them to Manny Pacquiao. Whoa, that was a LOT of heat right there. Mick Foley music interrupted his speech and the Hardcore Legend came in and the crowd went nuts, getting on their feet and cheering as Mick Foley walked around the ring. Mick Foley gets the cheap pop (\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s great to be here in Manila, Philippines!\u0026quot;), and they go at it. Carlito grapples with Foley for a while, and some hair-pulling goes on. Carlito keeps chickening out, but Mick Foley finally grabs him as he\u0026rsquo;s trying to head up the exit ramp. Foley pulls him back into the ring and does the Cactus Jack routine, hitting with the double-arm DDT. He looks around at the crowd and pulls out the sock and the crowd goes wild again! Carlito grabs an apple to chew on, but he turns around spits out apple chunks as the Mandible Claw and Mr. Socko knock him down to the canvas! Mick Foley wins! Funniest bit: Middle of the match, Carlito keeps trying to escape, and Foley eventually does the clucking-chicken gesture, and the crowd starts chanting \u0026ldquo;Chicken!\u0026rdquo; at Carlito (in that unique Filipino pronunciation of the word), eventually prompting Carlito to get a mic and exclaim \u0026ldquo;Carlito is not a chicken!\u0026rdquo; Foley says something to the announcer and it is announced, \u0026ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen, it has been confirmed that Carlito is indeed a chicken!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntercontinental \u0026ndash; Shelton Benjamin vs Viscera. Shelton gets the inevitable \u0026ldquo;Mama\u0026rsquo; boy\u0026rdquo; chants, and Vis gets the huge pops. Shelton whines about we\u0026rsquo;re all just jealous of his momma, and Viscera is huge. Shelton does some stuff, but finished without a T-bone Suplex. Funniest bit: That I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to explain to a 12-year old boy what Viscera was doing to Shelton with that move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Masters and HHH vs Big Show and Ric Flair \u0026ndash; Masters\u0026rsquo; entrance got some pops, but not very impressive without the pyros. Triple H\u0026rsquo;s music hits and the crowd is on their feet, hands in the air! They\u0026rsquo;re all cheering for the most dastardly man in the business today! HHH is the next champion! Big Show and Ric Flair come in next, and the cheers for them are roughly as loud as was for the Game. Anyway, they get it on. Lockups, the usual tag team stuff, ganging up, Big Show doing gorilla presses on everybody, etc. The crowd is really into Flair, every move he makes gets a \u0026ldquo;Wooo!\u0026rdquo; from the crowd. Alvin and I want to see the Pedigree, and finally, HHH manages to grab Flair and go for it! But Show interrupts, and chokeslams the game, then Flair locks the figure four onto Masters and it\u0026rsquo;s over! (Boo, we wanted to see the Pedigree!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Show stops Flair from leaving the ring, and they have a surprise for him! Trish and Maria come out carrying a cake, along with RVD, Eugene and Viscera. It\u0026rsquo;s Ric Flair and Maria\u0026rsquo;s birthday! Triple H comes out and breaks kayfabe, shaking Flair\u0026rsquo;s hand before walking out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWWE championship \u0026ndash; John Cena vs Edge. Main event time! The Steel cage is lowered to the ring; it\u0026rsquo;s a lot lower than it looks on TV, especially from where we were sitting. Edge comes in to some cheers (and jeers), but the next entrance is guaranteed to get the crowd on its\u0026rsquo; feet. John Cena\u0026rsquo;s music hits and the crowd goes ABSOLUTELY INSANE! The champ is here, and there\u0026rsquo;s lotsa chain gang members in the Philippines! Apparently a lot of them were little kids too! Cena and Edge start slamming each other into the cage, Edge tries to get out a couple of times, but Cena is just fast enough to catch him. Edge is knocked down, and the crowd spells it out: \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t see me!\u0026rdquo; The five-knuckle shuffle only gets a two count, and more action ensues. Eventually, the ref gets knocked out. Lita low-blows the ref on the outside as Cena tries to get out the door, then slams the door in Cena\u0026rsquo;s face. Edge hits the spear and the two of them gang up on Cena. Lita gets on the ropes as Edge holds up Cena, setting up for the hurricanrana, but Cena ducks out of the way and Lita\u0026rsquo;s mighty legs toss Edge into the cage! Cena capitalizes, hitting the FU on Lita, then on Edge, then makes the pin for the win! Cena climbs to the top of the cage and holds the championship belt up high and the crowd goes wild! Funniest bit: That the crowd still erupts in cheers when Cena manages to get out of a two-count, despite knowing that there\u0026rsquo;s no way the title would change hands that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, awesome, awesome show. Although Araneta Colliseum, specifically the inside part leading to the Upper Box entrances, was cramped! Helluva lot of people, they probably oversold, seeing as how people filled every nook and cranny of Upper Box B despite supposedly being guaranteed seating. I would post pics, but we were so far, most of our pics were crappy! Terrific experience, I\u0026rsquo;m glad we went to see the show. 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n",
