On one hand, Islam dictates that any such depiction of the prophet Mohammed are considered as blasphemy; on the other hand, Western media views it as a free speech issue; since every other religion in the world tolerates media lampooning, why shouldn\u0026rsquo;t Islam? Arguably, other faiths also have a certain threshold of tolerance for religious mockery beyond which they would mercilessly tear down whatever publication dared to print it. The only difference is that the threshold for Islam is a lot easier to break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople are dying now, from riots against Danish embassies in protest of the actions of the Denmark papers. Western-cultured individuals would question why any intelligent human being would rail against a government for the actions of its\u0026rsquo; media outlets. But these radicals are the sort that don\u0026rsquo;t understand the virtues of the free press. The sheer number of Muslims reacting violently is a testament as to how many of the freedoms that we in the Western-oriented world take for granted can be considered as unimaginable in some cultures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe frightening thing is that with all the tension between the Western world and Islam right now, these small things are the sort that could be used as an excuse to trigger a third world war.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eYeah, I haven\u0026rsquo;t been posting lately. I still have a lot of thoughts running around my head, and often throughout the day I find myself thinking, \u0026ldquo;I should post an entry about this.\u0026rdquo; But at the end of the day, I\u0026rsquo;m tired and I\u0026rsquo;m exhausted from thinking about two hundred different issues and juggling twenty different priorities, so I don\u0026rsquo;t post about it. I note it somewhere and sooner or later it becomes irrelevant and I forget why I wanted to post it in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remarked to one of my coworkers that I often find myself remembering dozens of things in my head simultaneously and he of course reminded me of the popular notion that human beings can only remember seven things at any one time. It\u0026rsquo;s the concept of limitation in humans\u0026rsquo; short-term memory or RAM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is probably mostly true, but as I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten more and more used to this multitasking mode of mine, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that the seven most important things stay on top, but the rest don\u0026rsquo;t really disappear. They fall away for a while, swallowed into your subconscious, only to rear their ugly head again later once you have some free RAM again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy current role at work forces me to be locked in this mode for most of the day. As one of the senior technical guys, I typically field dozens of technical questions from junior developers during a single day and when somebody\u0026rsquo;s problem can\u0026rsquo;t be solved quickly I physically get up from my desk and go walk them through it. And that\u0026rsquo;s just the queries regarding concerns outside my own project. Aside from that I often have to worry about scheduling, technical risks, physical designs and of course the occasional invitation to go down and buy some food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeveloper multitasking is generally looked-down upon in the tech world I know; people are encouraged to work directly on one task at a time to give them focus. Maybe most people have some short period of time at the start of the day to reply to emails and address issues raised by other people. I wish I could have that sort of luxury, but it seems to me that every issue or problem raised to me needs to be resolved five minutes ago. People can\u0026rsquo;t continue coding unless I help them. Schedules can\u0026rsquo;t be finalized until I give my input. Developers can\u0026rsquo;t write program specifications until I hand in the database design. I literally have dozens of dependencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, how do I cope? Simple, I cope the only way I know how. By instinct. This would be a terrifying revelation to anyone I actually work with, but during working hours I\u0026rsquo;m typically buried under so many issues, my only recourse is to dismiss as many as I can as quickly as possible, and that requires a whole lot of working from my gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, my gut has gotten really good at this. But I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure all the people who are incredibly organized and have moleskin notebooks and stuff would tear their hair at such an unorganized method (or is it madness?). And I know, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to get organized, I really am. I have to-do lists, a couple of dozen that tell me what I should be doing. I have log files that theoretically tell me what I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing all day. I try to turn off my email client sometimes, even though I will inevitably have people coming up to me and asking if I\u0026rsquo;d seen the mail they just sent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I can\u0026rsquo;t help it. That\u0026rsquo;s the role I play. People expect me to help them, to provide them guidance. I\u0026rsquo;ve projected myself as being open to consultations, and the company and all of my coworkers appreciate that. And even then I still have my own tasks to perform. I\u0026rsquo;m considering suggesting to the company that I never be considered working on a project for more than a 50% allocation. The other 50% should be allocated to my on-the-fly firefighting tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the day, especially during the past couple of weeks, I\u0026rsquo;ve found myself mentally exhausted. I have a very easy time separating work from personal life, because by the time I step into the elevator after logging out I\u0026rsquo;m already too tired to even think about work issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that I have a bad job, mind you. It\u0026rsquo;s awesome. But I guess sometimes I toss myself into it a bit too much. When my personal load is light, I can easily handle everything tossed at me and people go \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re awesome!\u0026rdquo; and I nod and address the next crisis. But when my load is heavy, well, then things really get exciting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forgot what my point was now, as I unconsciously launched into a narrative of how my typical day goes.

Any serious gamer worth his salt knows about it \u0026ndash; whether he plays turn-based strategy games or not. And the fourth installment was eagerly awaited in our home \u0026ndash; two out of four brothers were eager to play the latest update.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Civ4 is in many ways the same game all over again. The basic premise is still there \u0026ndash; explore, build cities, research technologies, kick other civivlizations while they\u0026rsquo;re down, race to space, etc. But several other new features have kicked in, many of them adding a new layer of management complexity to the already complex strategy game. Great Persons, National Wonders, cultural expansion, luxury resources\u0026hellip; well, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if some of these are new since Civ3 \u0026ndash; I didn\u0026rsquo;t play that one much. The most important change has to be the streamlining of the interface such that it becomes easy to tell at a glance what a city is building and how long it takes for it to grow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, as expected, the game is still incredibly engrossing. I sat down yesterday morning to \u0026ldquo;just give it a try\u0026rdquo;, and after what seemed like a few short turns found myself contemplating whether to nuke the Arabians in the early 17th century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo yeah, awesome Civ4 gameplay, as expected. I finished two games in short order, one took me 4 hours because the silly Germans and Spanish kept trying to declare war on me, and I had to be satisfied with a Time Victory. The second took less than two hours \u0026ndash; full peace/diplomacy, science/culture all the way, never entered a state of war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I\u0026rsquo;m not playing it again. Why? Because the game\u0026rsquo;s performance is crap-tastic! You can play smoothly found maybe 5-10 minutes before the game starts slowing to a crawl. Going to the lowest possible settings and quitting all running programs doesn\u0026rsquo;t help at all. Apparently I\u0026rsquo;m not alone, as I\u0026rsquo;ve seen numerous message board posts lambasting Firaxis for the terrible performance of the game regardlesss of the system running it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a testament to both the addictiveness of the gameplay and how much patience I\u0026rsquo;ve gained recently that I was able to finish two games at all. But as it is, I\u0026rsquo;m not playing it again until some radical performance improvment happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I can still find a copy of Civ3\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Radioactive Sago\u0026rsquo;s Alcohol is hilarious, and I like the way Orange and Lemons mixed a little bit of Julie Tearjerky and Tikman in Huwag Kang Matakot. I also think I actually like Cueshé\u0026rsquo;s version of Hard To Believe better than the original. My least favorite track on the album is Kitchie Nadal\u0026rsquo;s Ligaya, (cute laugh on the \u0026ldquo;inaahit\u0026rdquo; bit notwithstanding) as I really prefer the more upbeat original.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish more bands had contributed to the effort though, as the ‘heads probably deserve it. According to my brother, the participating artists were all from the same recording studio (I don\u0026rsquo;t really pay attention to studios, so yeah I\u0026rsquo;ll just agree here.) Still, it would\u0026rsquo;ve been nice to hear some renditions from ‘heads contemporaries like Rivermaya and Parokya ni Edgar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, awesome album.

I\u0026rsquo;m in a pretty good place right now I guess, compared to a majority of people in this country. I\u0026rsquo;ve got a good job with a more than decent salary that lets me consume the mythical three-square-meals-a-day and pile on a bit of luxury on top of that.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut sometimes you stop and think to yourself, is this all there is to life? Slaving away as some company\u0026rsquo;s employee, getting promotions and raises, then retiring to watch your kids grow up? Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, I love my job and the company I work for is great, very responsive to its employees. And I\u0026rsquo;m sure retiring and raising kids is a worthy goal for some people. But I highly doubt I\u0026rsquo;m that sort of person.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI get antsy sometimes, I often tell some people at work that I think of resigning at least once a week. The thing is, I don\u0026rsquo;t really know where to go or what to do if I resigned. All I know is at some point I would like to be doing something else with my life, something other than a regular nine-to-five (well in my case more of eight-to-seven) job, something that leaves a mark on the world. \u003cspan style=\"font-style:italic;\"\u003eStand tall and shake the heavens\u003c/span\u003e, I always like to say to myself.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMy biggest problem right now is fear - fear of burning bridges. There was this awesome article somewhere by this shareware guy about how to start your own indie business (I\u0026rsquo;ll credit him sometime when I remember), and I remember one of the things he said that struck me the most: Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to burn bridges.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut I am afraid, and with good reason. Like I said, I\u0026rsquo;ve got a good job, it\u0026rsquo;s decent pay and I even enjoy the work a good percentage of the time. And of course, I\u0026rsquo;m also providing \u003ca href=\"http://clair.pinoyweb.net/?p=467\"\u003efinancial support for the rest of the family\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt becomes more frightening when I take into consideration what my passions are. The main ones right now are: gaming and web development. Taken together, it points in one direction: I should work on a web-based game. But the size of this task at this point is too huge for me to imagine, and the risks far too obvious.
