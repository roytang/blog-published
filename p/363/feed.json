I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if there\u0026rsquo;s any important reason to backup all the episodes I\u0026rsquo;ve been watching to DVD when I\u0026rsquo;ve already watched them all. Of course the argument can be made that it makes it easier to lend out to people, but truth be told there are a lot of people I know who already have such copies so my keeping backups is just redundant. And it\u0026rsquo;s not like the world would end if someone wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to borrow the last season of Heroes off me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m especially wary now about committing stuff to optical media; going through all the discs I had I encountered quite a few that were already beyond recovery. I\u0026rsquo;m considering reburning some of the older stuff from CDs to DVDs, both to conserve space and to make sure I can still access those old files later on.

I dunno, like I said I know people who have loads more stuff on CDs/DVDs than I do, and they\u0026rsquo;ve never watched them all. At least I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to consume at least 90% of the stuff I archive. I guess it\u0026rsquo;s a geek thing, to want to have access to \u0026ldquo;historical data\u0026rdquo; and stuff. Organizing all of it is probably a geek thing too. Heck, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to think of a way to have everything be searchable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m considering buying something like a 250 GB external and just using that as a backup. Eventually it would run out, but by then something like 1 TB drives might be common enough. Tempting\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

TO back up these beliefs, I could point to my DCI ratings. But as a programmer who loves stats, I compiled additional stats for my own pleasure: \u003ca href=\"/page/stats/mtg/\"\u003eMy Playing Stats\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bit of background: I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing Magic on and off since Revised, but only gotten into the tournament scene seriously in 2006. I\u0026rsquo;ve played in a few Limited tourneys before that, but I guess I took them with a different DCI number as they don\u0026rsquo;t reflect on my ratings history. In particular I remember placing 2nd at a Team Sealed event at BCI Makati back during the Invasion block era. And I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I went 4-0 at an Onslaught prerelease, as I have the shirt to prove it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs can be seen in the stats page though, this was the year I started taking it seriously. I devoted more time to Magic, studying my own technical play for faults and missteps, struggling to learn from every mistake. I read more articles online and tried to practice on Magic Online more to improve my game.  I joined more tournaments (31 this year versus 18 the previous year), and got 9 top 8\u0026rsquo;s this year as opposed to 2 last year. (Granted, some of those were for Prereleases :p) I managed a GPT top 8 and a PTQ top 8 this year, my first ones ever!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I have a long way to go towards improving. I was disappointed to find out my match win percentage was under 60% (although I have no idea how much higher the match win percentage of top players would be.) For next year I hope I can push that win percentage even more, make fewer misplays and get more PTQ top 8s (although I doubt I will be able to play in the extended season\u0026hellip; maybe Block Constructed). My goal is to stabilize my rating in the top 75 of the Philippines so that I can play in Nationals without having to go through those horrendous qualifiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWish me luck 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I believe that this year, I have managed to improve my Magic-playing a bit (despite the abundance of embarassing mistakes).I also believe I\u0026rsquo;m slightly better at Limited than I am at Constructed. TO back up these beliefs, I could point to my DCI ratings. But as a programmer who loves stats, I compiled additional stats for my own pleasure: My Playing Stats.\nA bit of background: I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing Magic on and off since Revised, but only gotten into the tournament scene seriously in 2006.",

Not because I\u0026rsquo;m tired of it or anything, but because I\u0026rsquo;ve run out of people to play with. Unlike last year where we had enough players in the office to occasionally have an 8-man draft, this year most of the Magic players have either switched to WoW or moved to a different company/country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are only two of us seriously playing now, so our card pool has become so much smaller. That also means less preparation for constructed formats as it\u0026rsquo;s harder to get serious playtesting done. Having a team and a shared card pool makes a huge difference. You can see this easily because so many of the players that repeatedly hit top 8 in the local tourneys are known members of a team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not  sure how I\u0026rsquo;ll proceed next year, but I\u0026rsquo;m not quitting. I love to play the game and will make do with what I have if I need to. I\u0026rsquo;m even contemplating playing in the Extended PTQs, although how I can gather the needed cards for that is still a mystery!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

makes me sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first round matchup is against one of the more veteran players. He\u0026rsquo;s playing some R-B-W combination, fast aggro stuff. I\u0026rsquo;m faster in game 1 and manage to play Colfenor\u0026rsquo;s Plans, attracting some onlookers who told me it was a deathtrap. I had read about some pros liking it and wanted to try it out. The logic being, if you\u0026rsquo;re out of cards anyway, and you can only play one spell per turn anyway (the one you topdeck), and you can win with just a bit more push, might as well grab the next seven cards immediately. As one of the judges pointed out, I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to play the plans, it was plain greedy, since my opponent was at six and I had a flier and two Tar Pitchers out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame 2, I hit Footbottom Feast targetting Spiderwig Boggart then I put the Boggart in my hand then said, \u0026ldquo;draw a card from feast\u0026rdquo;. I looked at the top card before my opponent could stop me. Oops, of course the Boggart was already the draw from the feast, so I got a warning for looking at extra cards and the judge shuffles my deck. I\u0026rsquo;m glad it\u0026rsquo;s not a game loss, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter as I lose to an aggressive Blades of Velis Vel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame 3, I mull to five and am unable to recover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 1: 1-2 loss. Yes, not a good start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond round is\u0026hellip; some guy. Don\u0026rsquo;t recall what he was playing. I win in 2 games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 2: 2-0 win\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird round is a guy I\u0026rsquo;ve been up against a few times before. His deck is black-green but light on removal. I power out Giants, he stacks Treefolk on his side to keep me from attacking, dragging out the game. (I hate fighting Black Poplars!) but eventually I take it in 2 games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3: 2-0 win\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFourth round is against one of the better limited players around, he plays fast so somehow I\u0026rsquo;m forced to match his pace. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember his deck, though it must have had blue because I remember getting countered. We trade the first two games, and I draw no gas for game three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: 1-2 loss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I am X-2 once again. Sigh, it has not been a good limited PTQ season for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5 was fun. He\u0026rsquo;s white-green. Game 1 I\u0026rsquo;m losing badly to his early creatures, but then I hit Spiderwig giving Axegrinder fear (six damage), sac the Spiderwig to Fodder Launch one of his guys (+5 damage). End of his turn I footbottom the Spiderwig to give the Axegrinder fear again, dealing 17 damage in two turns to win from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame 2 I get hit by the early aggro rush again and am unable to recover. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember game 3, but my notes tell me hit was pretty bad for him as I took no damage at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5: 2-1 win\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6, my opponent is a merfolk deck with Springleaf Drum, Falloysage and Veteran of the Depths, which gets annoying quick. I hold on for a long time in game 1 before succumbing to School tokens. Game 2 I keep a hand with Adder-Staff, 2 Lash Outs and another creature. I play the Adder-Staff and Lash Out his first two creatures, which I soon regret as his third play is a Veteran that goes all the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6: 0-2 loss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSigh, I\u0026rsquo;m not even getting prizes anymore. I tick \u0026ldquo;Drop\u0026rdquo; on the result slip, then change my mind and cross it out. I want to play the last round to at least get some practice\u0026hellip; hopefully my play skill can improve just a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 7: 0-2 loss. Bleah. I think my play was tight, but he just drew better cards. I remember he had an Epic Proportions that stopped my Lash Outs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA 3-4 finish, how terrible. Before this season I had actually envisioned myself as a decent limited player. Obviously, Lorwyn limited is hard, I need to do so much to improve my deck construction and technical play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext: Morningtide Release Events? I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to play in the prerelease since I\u0026rsquo;ll be out of town\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Impulsiveness made me throw away this game and I vow it will never EVER happen again. It was game one, I was dead to his next swing, but 3 of my guys were fliers and I drew into Final Revels. I quickly went for +2/+0 thinking I had enough damage to win the game. As he considered his options I realize the miscount and that he would live with 1 life, killing me the next turn with two Kithkin guys with no blockers. Oh man, what an idiot. I just saw the Final Revels topdeck and played it without thinking. NEVER AGAIN. I figure I\u0026rsquo;ll recover in game 2, but I draw no lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSigh. 1 and 2 after 3 rounds. I figure I\u0026rsquo;ll play until I get the 3rd loss, maybe win some packs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: 0-2 loss vs GWb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOops\u0026hellip; so much for that plan. I keep him back on tempo with Whirlpool Whelms and faeries, but he eventually overwhelms me with critters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFacing lethal damage in game two, I pick up the result slip and tick the \u0026ldquo;Drop\u0026rdquo; option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSigh, one more PTQ to go, last chance to go to Kuala Lumpur. I made so many bloopers this tournament, and my mental game was so off\u0026hellip; must do better next time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut first, next week: Standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

But I get a bad draw in game two and almost lose to a Spectral Force before topdecking into the Damnation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2-0 win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5: A 4-0 start feels good. A friend warns me beforehand that my next opponent is U/B, but turns out he\u0026rsquo;s wrong. He has Dreadship Reefs as storage lands so that\u0026rsquo;s where the mistake was made, but my opponent was none other than MUP \u0026ndash; Monoblue Pickles. I win game one somehow and board in +2 sudden death, +3 Extirpate. I break the Pickles combo in both of the next two games, but sadly due to bad attacks and blocks on my part I still manage to lose to Teferi and an army of Factory Workers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1-2 loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 6: Mannequin Mirror match here, but his build is new, as he shows me Ponder on the first turn. I lose game one to Profane Command. In game 2, 3 of the lands I draw are Faerie Conclaves\u0026hellip; coincidentally he draws 3 Riftwing Cloudskates. I was behind on creatures and mana all day.

It\u0026rsquo;s my turn to be insane with the Riftwing Cloudskates here, grabbing lots of tempo off my opponent while bashing with Ironfoots.

I take the first game easily, but fumble on sideboarding \u0026ndash; I certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware of this matchup going in, so I had no idea. Bottle Gnomes? Extirpate? I just bring in 3 Vesuvan Shapeshifters to handle his Red Akroma and Hellkites. Game two, he shows me the other 10% of his deck that would give me fits: Chandra Nalar. My entire offense literally stops after Chandra takes down one creature and Incinerate knocks out my last one. I lose to the card disadvantage and proceed to search my board for answers to Chandra. I had none (I don\u0026rsquo;t own any Pithing Needles sir), so I just sucked it up and decided to try for a fast aggro kill. I had a good hand too \u0026ndash; Faerie Conclave into suspended Cloudskate. But midgame he shows me another aspect of his deck \u0026ndash; land destruction. I get hit by Avalanche Riders and Mwonvuli Acid-Moss and he even shows me his sideboarded card: Rootgrapple! I have mana problems up to the end, and he even gets Chandra out again. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get in a single point of damage for this game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1-2 loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal record: 5-3, finishing 17.

Notable cards include Mistbind Clique, Profane Command, Mulldrifter, Cloudgoat Ranger, Oblivion Ring, Shriekmaw and Silvergill Douser. Haven\u0026rsquo;t written up the sealed pool yet, will probably do so later.

However, thanks to his Drowner of Secrets and 4 other ‘folk, I\u0026rsquo;m down to 8 cards in the library, just enough to survive one more turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe draws his card for the turn and quickly says done with two cards in hand. He\u0026rsquo;s practically dead, so I wonder what he has up his sleeve; I fear removal and I\u0026rsquo;m sure to lose if I don\u0026rsquo;t kill him next turn so I decide to ensure the victory.

I\u0026rsquo;m shocked at his play until I remember that Broken Ambitions actually has a clash ability that matters in this matchup. I frown as I flip Island, and my opponent flips Silvergill Douser.

And it always seems to be a blowout too. Of course it\u0026rsquo;s all superstition, as I have on occasion been able to play evenly with other players who are also very good.

I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any good deck ideas this time around (some would argue I never do!), so I played a netdeck.

He has a not so good draw and I win game one easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI board +4 Nameless Inversion, -2 Grim Harvest and -2 random guys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two, he attacks third turn with a Treetop Village, I hit it with a nameless inversion and he\u0026rsquo;s down a land. On my turn I play the Shadowmage Infiltrator and it\u0026rsquo;s all uphill from there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2-0 win. Good start!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 2: vs Monoblack\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deck is not monoblack aggro, more of disruption + midsize creatures (Shriekmaw, Crovax the black, Korlash). The matchup seems bad for Manny since I have 8 dead cards (Shadowmage Infiltrator and Shriekmaw) I lose game one to Crovax the black, I didn\u0026rsquo;t even notice that my Epochrasite was dead on arrival. (I pretended that I did that on purpose to suspend it)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI board -4 Shadowmage Infiltrator -4 Shriekmaw -1 Grim Harvest +4 Nameless Inversion +2 Damnation +3 Vesuvan Shapeshifter (to kill Korlash and Crovax)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two goes my way, as he has no creature drops at all for the first six turns or so. He has a warhammer, so any creature that comes out I immediately hit with removal. My offense consists almost entirely of two epochrasites and a faerie conclave. An interesting board position came during this game:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy side: Faerie Conclave, Epochrasite, other lands. No removal in hand, and I\u0026rsquo;m at 17 life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis side: Warhammer, no creatures. Urza\u0026rsquo;s Factory, Mouth of Ronom + 6-7 other lands. He\u0026rsquo;s at five life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swing with Faerie Conclave and Epochrasite, then immediately realize the mistake. I had assumed he would just Ronom the Faerie, but if instead he makes a Factory worker and blocks the Epochrasite I\u0026rsquo;m screwed since I have no removal and he can equip the warhammer next turn to climb back in life. Luckily, he assumes that I do have removal and does not risk taking the two damage from the faerie. I win game 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame 3, we had less than ten minutes left, so I play quickly. However, since I had boarded in removal, my side was now control. He had sided back in most of his creatures so he got the aggro draw. We trade hits for a while, but eventually he gets out a 9/6 Korlash with lifelink (warhammer) and there\u0026rsquo;s no way I can catch up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1-2 loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 3 \u0026ndash; B/R Goblins\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorry to my opponent but this matchup was really easy. Manny\u0026rsquo;s removal and card advantage is more than enough to keep the Goblins in check, and Phyrexian Ironfoot + Epochrasite is really bad for their deck. 2-0 win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 4 \u0026ndash; UGw Shifters\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUG shifters. With the Shapeshifter, Thelonite Hermit and all, + white for blink. I win game 1, he seems to have a bad draw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bring in Shapeshifters of my own to take advantage of his hermits. I lose game two to a Mystic Snake that was blinked 4 times (including flashback).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame three I take a midgame advantage, he has 2 morphs down but is obviously waiting for a second forest to turn the hermit face up. He plays a Birds of Paradise. And I pass my turn without doing anything to it. (Mistake no. 1)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course I attempt to bounce it during his turn (Mistake no. 2). He of course flips the hermit, creates saprolings etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stall off the saps coz I have a lot of ironfoot blockers. I swing with a Shriekmaw. (Mistake no. 3) He of course turns the other morph face up, revealing shapeshifter, copying one of the ironfoot guys. :(\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lost obviously, with those kinds of mistakes it\u0026rsquo;s a wonder I held out so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1-2 loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo 2-2 now. But it\u0026rsquo;s an 8-round tourney, so \u003cstrong\u003emaybe\u003c/strong\u003e I can still make top 8. I fight on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 5 \u0026ndash; B/G Tarmorack\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWooh! Lucky, a good matchup. I take it again in two games with massive card advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2-0 win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 6 \u0026ndash; R/G aggro\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame one was not too difficult, given the massive card advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two, he managed to bring down my life early with three Ascetics before I could play the Damnation. I lost to Barbs (he also had a Wisent but that\u0026rsquo;s a blank against me)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame three he gets the Barbs down while we\u0026rsquo;re still at a high enough life. I play Venser to send it back, going down to 4, and on my turn I drop 3 creatures to discourage him from playing it again. It works, he instead drops creatures of his own. I play Profane Command for the win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2-1 win\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 7 \u0026ndash; U/W control\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seems to be permission light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame one, I bring him down to 14 and he plays Akroma off charge lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the first hit (down to 14 life).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy turn I play Infiltrator and Epochrasite comes out of suspend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the next hit (down to 8 life)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swing with Infiltrator, then play two ironfoots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the next hit (down to 2 life)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy turn, Profane Command for 5, opponent loses 5 and all my guys get fear. Nice game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI board in Shapeshifters to deal with Crovax the White and Akroma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two he got out an early Crovax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI play Shapeshifter to kill Crovax. He plays Akroma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI play Mannequin on Shapeshifter. (Opponent: \u0026ldquo;Ano ba yan!\u0026quot;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get out fear guys. He gets out Triskelavus, we start racing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI play Mannequin again, targetting shapeshifter, copying Triskelavus (a Shapeshifter with 3 +1/+1 counters is pretty good)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe plays Disenchant on the Shapeshifter! (Opponent: \u0026ldquo;Ang squatter naman\u0026rdquo;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eventually manage to bounce his triskelavus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe race some more, I win with 3 life remaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2-0 win\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, one more win and possibily top 8! But I look at the standings and I\u0026rsquo;m last among the 5-2s :( Boo! 21th place, too far away. If I win the last round I make top 16 and win three packs. Lose, and I probably still get one pack. Then, it\u0026rsquo;s practically \u0026ldquo;no bearning\u0026rdquo; for me now, I get at least one pack either way. (Yes, this story does not end in a top eight finish, I apologize.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I slack off in round 8. In a matchup where I need to slack off the least \u0026ndash; pickles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRound 8 \u0026ndash; UB pickles\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0026rsquo;s playing pickles with black instead of the usual white for momentary blink. He has an aggro mode with Ironfoots and Shadowmages, Cryptic Command for permission, Ancestral Visions for card draw. This is the first round I\u0026rsquo;m playing the pickles combo, so I\u0026rsquo;m sorta still stupid (or slacking off, as I said.) What I understand about the pickles matchup is that you have to be careful not to tap out if your opponent has 10-11 mana already \u0026ndash; since he can lock you down at any time (even less for the white version which has blink).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame one I lost to pickles lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI side in +4 Nameless Inversion (Mistake\u0026hellip; should have also brought in +3 Extirpate)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame two I lost to pickles lock. Okay, a bit longer story. I lost to pickles lock after making the misplay of bouncing the Brine Elemental so he could delay me one more turn. He had Liliana Vess out \u0026ndash; he was going to get the other half of the combo no matter what. If I had an Extirpate then the bounce was the correct play, as there was already a Brine Elemental in the yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I finish 5-3 with the Mannequin deck, a crappy 32nd place, winning a single booster! In fairness, I got an Auntie\u0026rsquo;s Hovel from that booster, so it\u0026rsquo;s all good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the tournament some people were asking me whether it was difficult to play. I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. Two of the losses I attribute to bad plays on my part, and the monoblack matchup was just bad. After boarding it was probably 50-50 or 60-40 at best. The weakness I can see is the lack of instant speed removal (unless you have a Shriekmaw in the graveyard), so Treetop Villages cause problems. I always board in the Nameless Inversions for decks with Treetops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManabarbs is also very bad for the deck, as you have no permission to stop it, only bounce. At the minimum you will take 4 damage (or 2 damage and wait 3 turns) to bounce the Barbs, then have one turn to try to get back in the game before they cast it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, the Mannequin tricks are awesome and will lead to some devastating draws and plays. But every so often you draw something like 3 Mannequins and a Grim Harvest, with your only creatures being Epochrasite, Phyrexian Ironfoot or Shadowmage, all of which are not that good with the reanimation. Next time I will probably cut 2 Grim Harvest entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext: PTQ KL #2.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I figured I could wipe all his creatures if I Thundercloud for 3, so I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etap the changeling to turn my merfolk into a giant and cast the Giant. After casting the Shaman, I immediately realized the problems:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea. One of his creatures was a changeling (wouldn\u0026rsquo;t die to Shaman)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eb. That creature was a Mirror Entity (can prevent all his creatures from dying to Shaman)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pretty much deserved the 17 damage that came my way the next turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, that makes me sad. I\u0026rsquo;m at 0-2 obviously I\u0026rsquo;m pretty much dead. I decided not to drop so I could salvage some wins and maybe learn to actually play better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 3: 2-0 win vs R/G\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorst problem was an Epic Proportions\u0026hellip; no wait, that was the previous tournament. I count 58 cards in the opponent\u0026rsquo;s pile shuffle and mention to him that he\u0026rsquo;s over 40. He says \u0026ldquo;Yeah, probably should trim it.\u0026rdquo; and he\u0026rsquo;s right. He\u0026rsquo;s color screwed both games, so easy win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 4: 2-1 win vs (I forgot what the deck was)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy deck really performed here, giving me so much removal I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even remember what his creatures were. I hit Tarfire, Lash Out and Nameless Inversion and put him on fast clocks. I got him down to one and an evoked Cloudthresher did the job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRound 5: 1-2 loss vs B/G\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe opponent jokes around about his bad deck and wonders how he even got two wins. I lose game 1 to 1/1s and 2/2s, all I had was the Stonybrook Angler.  Game 2 I mulligan to six and he keeps, but he misses the 3rd land drop. I have a Cloudgrown Oak carrying a Runed Stalactite, a five-turn clock. He gets the third land and tries to play Eyeblight\u0026rsquo;s Ending on it and I shake my head. \u0026ldquo;Elf.\u0026rdquo; He gets out a few blockers at 8 and trades two for one with the Oak. I cast the Treefolk Harbinger for Changeling Titan. When the Titan attacks, he tries the Eyeblight\u0026rsquo;s Ending again, and I shake my head again. Right, he scoops and we go to game three. Game three I mulligan to six again, only it\u0026rsquo;s a proper mana screw this time. I barely put up a fight and lose to random dorks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo 2-3 and drop. Quite disappointing, as it seems I\u0026rsquo;m not improving my limited game at all. I still made a suboptimal sealed deck build (was siding in the same six cards every round) and made several play mistakes. I would blame lack of sleep, but obviously I didn\u0026rsquo;t have my A-game this time around. Hopefully, the next few PTQs are better for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "The format is Lorwyn Sealed. Note here that I they had a shortage of boosters and had to split tournament packs into 3 boosters to be able to accomodate all the players.\nDecklist/Card pool later, I\u0026rsquo;m too lazy to type it up. Unfortunately, I failed to learn from the previous mistakes as I got blinded by the shiny again, thinking I could actually cast Horde of Notions, so I went with an almost-five color build, major red-blue-and-green.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eOne of the qualities that I think make a really good software developer is the ability to solve difficult technical problems. Unless you\u0026rsquo;re the sort of software developer who just sells the same piece of software over and over again, at some point in time you\u0026rsquo;ll to need to find out how to implement some feature you\u0026rsquo;ve never tried before. Or you\u0026rsquo;ll hit a problem that\u0026rsquo;s not documented in any official docs and you need that critical functionality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypically, there are two approaches: Research and Experimentation. Today I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about Research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResearch means the internet of course, but what part of it exactly? At first of course you should search for the information yourself, using Google usually. But often if the technology is new or the problem is esoteric enough, you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to find what you need (or you would need very precise keywords). The second step is to ask for expert help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an example, some recent postings of mine on a Microsoft-related forum (I was trying to figure out how to do an addin for Microsoft Office) elicited a mail from someone with the subject \u0026ldquo;Hello, I need ur help\u0026rdquo;. I was feeling a bit helpful, so I gave him a reply. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it was smarmy or anything, but I also gave him some additional advice, and I quote:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Also I have some additional free advice for you:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour email looks like SPAM. I was about to mark it as spam when I happened to spot the phrase \u0026ldquo;MSWord Addins\u0026rdquo; in the body. Learn to write better email subjects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSending personal emails to people asking for help isn\u0026rsquo;t a very good way to solve technical issues. Most people are likely to ignore such requests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou might want to read this: \u003ca href=\"http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html%22\"\u003ehttp://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html\u0026quot;\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not trying to deride him or anything, god knows I\u0026rsquo;ve sent my own share of personal email requests for help before. And it\u0026rsquo;s correct that they are often ignored, so it\u0026rsquo;s not very effective. I think the most effective way, as mentioned in the ESR link above, is to use forums. Specifically, don\u0026rsquo;t look for forums where newbies like us ask questions; use forums where experts congregate. By forum, I\u0026rsquo;m not strictly referring to bulletin boards, it also includes mailing-lists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow to find the best forums? It depends on what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best thing is if your subject matter of choice has an active community of developers interested or passionate about the product. Google about the subject matter and see what forums or mailing lists are popular. An example would be \u003ca href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/\"\u003eAdobe Flex\u003c/a\u003e, which I started reading up on a while back for a work-related issue. Finding help on Adobe Flex is really easy. There\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/flexcoders/\"\u003ea very active mailing-list\u003c/a\u003e, where you can even expect replies from some of the guys who actually made Flex. If you visit some of the active blogs about Flex (there are a lot), many of them will reference the flexcoders mailing list so you know you can get a lot of good help there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNon-official forums are better because people are more likely to be passionate than paid reps. One problem I often encounter when researching is Microsoft. Whenever I search for Microsoft-related stuff inevitably sources dry up \u0026ndash; there are literally hundreds of unofficial forums where many newbies ask questions. Now, what to recognize about Microsoft is that they have hundreds (maybe thousands?) of experts called MVPs in every different Microsoft technology. These MVPs are recognized by Microsoft for providing unofficial support to the community. So, the trick is to figure out where you can post such that a good number of MVPs will see your question and possibly respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what the best place would be, but the one that I have gotten the most results from would be \u003ca href=\"http://groups.google.com/\"\u003eGoogle Groups\u003c/a\u003e. Any of the microsoft.public.* ones. I guess Google Groups would be pretty good for non-MS topics as well, but I find that inevitably my MS searches lead me here. For Office-related questions at least there are often one or two MVPs who reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother resource I have used on occasion: the forums at \u003ca href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/\"\u003eJoel on Software\u003c/a\u003e. A lot of very good developers frequent those forums, so even if no one can answer your questions, they might be able to point you in the right direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond forums, well good luck. At this point you might need to resort to personal emails, although I have personally never gotten any success from such a method. Or you probably have to resort to detailed experimentation or even \u0026ndash; god forbid \u0026ndash; giving up.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "One of the qualities that I think make a really good software developer is the ability to solve difficult technical problems. Unless you\u0026rsquo;re the sort of software developer who just sells the same piece of software over and over again, at some point in time you\u0026rsquo;ll to need to find out how to implement some feature you\u0026rsquo;ve never tried before. Or you\u0026rsquo;ll hit a problem that\u0026rsquo;s not documented in any official docs and you need that critical functionality.",

Seriously, I should\u0026rsquo;ve probably at least splashed for the Tarfire and the Consuming Bonfire. That would\u0026rsquo;ve been a better choice than Rootgrapple. (To be fair, the Treefolk Instant actually took out Garuk for me. I still lost that game though.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing blinded by shiny stuff. I saw the 2 Goldmeadow Stalwarts and the Thoughtweft Trio and just had to go Kithkin. I saw the Timber Protector and just forced my treefolk in there. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if my second choice (UBR Faerie/Goblin) would have been better, but I definitely didn\u0026rsquo;t give enough consideration to the other cards. I forced the Kithkin/Treefolk build too much, trying to put in a lot of Kithkin to maximize the Stalwarts I ended up with too many 2/x dorks that didn\u0026rsquo;t do anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot having a good plan.Yeah. Evasion guys would have been a good plan. A bunch of small Kithkin guys? Not so much. Even though I could get the awesome double Stalwart opening (I never did), it\u0026rsquo;s not consistent enough. Trying to win in Sealed by rushing small dudes isn\u0026rsquo;t a very reliable since it\u0026rsquo;s more likely for them to have midrange guys as well. I had a few fatties yeah, but in n environment with 2 common tappers, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t very effective. Which reminds me\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot having a way to kill tappers!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot paying attention to game state. In one game, I had a creature with a Stalactite equipped and I attacked into Protection from Elf guy. I had several misplays in round 3 where we stalled with like 15 creatures on each side of the board. My opponent put down a Mulldrifter and equipped a Runed Stalactite, while he had an Imperious Perfect in play. I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize until too late that it got +1/+1 from the Perfect.  My opponent wanted to create an elf token and he was searching for a good item to use. I gave him one of my dice to use and only later realized that I was actually using it to track my own Kithkin tokens! By then it was too late as I would\u0026rsquo;ve lost anyway on the next alpha strike, but maybe having those tokens on my side could have convinced me to make my own alpha strike as it was a close game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpatience.In round 3 again, I was facing a creature stall on game one and I made a massive mistake, attacking with two Treefolk and two Springjacks hoping I could get at least one double-strike off the clash. Obviously I got none, and I lost two Springjacks for nothing. I should\u0026rsquo;ve just waited out the stall instead of being impatient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make so many mistakes like this which make me question why some people think I\u0026rsquo;m a good limited player. I\u0026rsquo;m not — I just had a good streak for a while that brought my rating up to 1800 but it will surely drop down now. I\u0026rsquo;m glad I decided not to even consider going to GP:Bangkok as I\u0026rsquo;m obviously not yet ready. Luckily there are 4 Kuala Lumpur PTQs scheduled for the Philippines, all of them Lorwyn Sealed of course, giving me a chance to learn from my mistakes and make a comeback.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass for a few days now; the controls are purely-stylus driven so my wrist aches a bit after a few hours of play. Of course the game has been consuming a good number of my waking hours (I didn\u0026rsquo;t even play any \u003ca href=\"/tags/mtg\"\u003eMagic\u003c/a\u003e this weekend), but that\u0026rsquo;s not what this post is about. This post is about the original Legend of Zelda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first time I played the game, I was able to borrow some sort of faulty and/or bootleg copy that wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to save games. Stupid right? Well, it could save as long as the console wasn\u0026rsquo;t powered off, so you could still progress a bit. So in theory, with a single marathon gaming session, I could\u0026rsquo;ve finished the game. The thing is, during those days my dad didn\u0026rsquo;t like having us play too much video games. At most he\u0026rsquo;d let us play maybe 1-2 hours at a time. On weekends. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there\u0026rsquo;s some sort of speed run where some hardcore dude finished the Legend of Zelda in like fifteen minutes, but no way I would\u0026rsquo;ve been able to do that as a kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, that limitation became a sort of challenge. We tried getting as far ahead in the game as we could within what time we had. As kids that day were wont to do, my brother and I memorized the heck out of the Zelda world map. Up to this day, from muscle memory alone, looking at a random overworld Zelda screen I could point if any trees or cliff walls could be burned or blasted to reveal a secret. (The dungeons were another matter, since 90% of the game time was spent in the overworld, I was far more familiar with it.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, we were able to borrow a decent (read: able to save!) copy, and the quest to beat the game began in earnest. Of course, given our previous time-limited trials, we were well familiar with the game, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know how long it took us to defeat the mad sorcerer Gannon and free Princess Zelda, but I have no memory of it being particularly difficult, so I suppose it was not a long period. Besides, we would have needed to return the cartridge eventually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite beating the game, we didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to grow tired of it. Sometimes I felt like we craved the dungeon-crawling even more. Through friends who actually had money to buy gaming magazines, we found out about the second quest. We would borrow the cartridge again, and eventually beat the second quest as well. Bored but still immersed in the game, we would then proceed to try various challenges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I wonder if we can beat the game without getting the sword?\u0026rdquo; Well, no. The fourth dungeon boss (two-headed dragon) requires a sword to defeat. Of course we just did the next best thing \u0026ndash; we beat the first three dungeons without getting the wooden sword; Boomerangs, Bombs and Candles were enough for us!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;I wonder if we can beat the game without getting additional Heart Containers?\u0026rdquo; This one was far more difficult than the other one, as staying at three hearts meant instant death if you took a hit in the later dungeons. Eventually we realized it was theoretically possible to finish the game with less than three hearts, given that there were rooms that could take away a Heart Container. My memories are fuzzy on this one, so I don\u0026rsquo;t know if we actually fulfilled this challenge. I\u0026rsquo;m sure we whiled away a few hours trying it out though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not sure when we eventually grew tired of the game and stopped borrowing it. But the Zelda overworld theme music was pretty much burned into our memories. The music is familiar even to my second youngest brother, who could not have been more than three years old at the time we were playing the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the original Zelda, I eventually finished Link to the Past on the SNES, then skipping out on the N64/Gamecube/Game Boy generation of Zelda games since I didn\u0026rsquo;t have those consoles. Of course I could play those games on an emulator, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t really the same thing. An emulator\u0026rsquo;s save/load game state was far too powerful for one to enjoy the game. Holding the NDS in my hands and playing the Phantom Hourglass brings back childhood memories of walking through unforgiving dungeons and defeating vicious bosses with just enough life to stay alive; a single misstep or badly timed sword thrust would destroy hours of progress \n\n    \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#footnote-1\" id=\"footnotebase-1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e\n. A boy dressed in green traveling across a vast land filled with dangerous monsters to stop a great evil and save a princess. So very cliche.

with this sealed deck, a bit disappointed too coz I thought the pool was really good (I had a Wrath! Well, the Thundercloud Shaman also acted like a one-sided Wrath at one point) I lost to a blue black deck where I just kept getting dead land draws. One turn from losing to two black creatures with me having only one non-black blocker, I said, \u0026ldquo;I have so much removal in this deck, surely I will draw one now.\u0026rdquo; And I did, I got Shriekmaw. :/ I\u0026rsquo;m always disappointed when I get my loss in a Pre-release, I haven\u0026rsquo;t won a pre-release shirt since Time Spiral!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, the set is fun, the tribal implementation seems really good. (Not sure how it compares to Onslaught, I have no memory of Onslaught limited, although I\u0026rsquo;m sure we played it a bit back then as I have the cards to prove it). The Changelings are great; the more you have in your sealed pool, the stronger the pool becomes as you have more options. I was sad that I only got two shapeshifters. Clash is stupidly fun. You seldom win, but it\u0026rsquo;s exciting! Surely Spikes won\u0026rsquo;t like the mechanic, I guess it\u0026rsquo;s more of a Timmy thing. Well, I guess it wasn\u0026rsquo;t fun for that guy I fought who drew something like 12 or 14 cards of Hoarder\u0026rsquo;s Greed. I just kept a land on top to keep him going. Yeah, I won that one\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to play again today, but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have gotten there in time I think. I hope we get more limited Lorwyn events. Since I\u0026rsquo;m probably not going to be buying a box this time around, I need to play more Limited to win/acquire cards until I have something decent for Constructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
