            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThis post is just quite a few thoughts on mobile apps and mobile app development, all mishmashed together. I don\u0026rsquo;t claim to be a mobile app specialist, at best I\u0026rsquo;ve \u003cem\u003edabbled\u003c/em\u003e in them, but enough to form some opinions I guess?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"a-bit-of-history\"\u003eA Bit of History\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first exposure to mobile app development when I got pulled to help my then-company\u0026rsquo;s then-fledgling mobile team with cleaning up the codebase for their iOS app. This was back in maybe 2011? It was one of those projects where some devs built a quick proof-of-concept demo using new technology, then management liked it and asked for new features and they kept adding new features haphazardly until there was just this huge unmaintainable mess of code. This isn\u0026rsquo;t a knock against Objective-C or iOS development specifically or the dev team; the fact is they were new to the stack and were learning as they went while still trying to meet deadlines. I also spent some time reviewing the corresponding Android team\u0026rsquo;s code as well. This was the bulk of my exposure to native mobile dev on iOS/Android. (This was before Swift, so I never got to experience that. Language looks neat though.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComing from a web dev background, I\u0026rsquo;ve always found the fragmentation of platforms annoying. Basically your effort gets multiplied by the number of platforms you have to support, and what would work well on iOS may not work well on Android and vice versa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater on, this concern was alleviated a bit with the rise of common frameworks that could publish to both iOS and Android. The first one I tried of these was React Native. I tried it for a small mobile project I did around 3-ish years ago. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t tremendously happy with the experience. My mistake was probably diving head-first into React Native, when this was my first experience with React and front-end frameworks in general (something new to someone with \u003ca href=\"/2020/02/old-web/\"\u003emy jQuery background\u003c/a\u003e!), so a lot of concepts were new to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo make matters worse, the React Native docs at that time seemed to assume some familiarity already with React, or at least similar frameworks like Angular. I had a bit of confusion with whether I should be using Expo or not, and how to eject, and it resulted in having to restart the project a couple of times. It was also my first encounter with NPM\u0026rsquo;s dependency management, and that annoyed me a lot. A lot of the third-party dependencies I used back then were still immature too, so I often had problems with things like accessing the camera roll and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, it was experience, and the ability to publish cross-platform to iOS and Android was invaluable. I went on to use React Native as my go-to mobile framework I would recommend for other projects afterwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecently, I had to do a UI revamp for that small mobile app I wrote three years ago, and I hadn\u0026rsquo;t touched it for a while so I had some trouble with NPM trying to get it to run. In frustration, I gave up on it and decided to rewrite it in Flutter, of which I\u0026rsquo;ve heard good things. Flutter turned out to be great, and it took me just a little over two weeks, part-time to rewrite the app, probably slightly less effort than it took me to write it in the first place. I don\u0026rsquo;t have enough experience yet to have a detailed review of Flutter, but I was generally much happier with the experience compared to React. Part of that may be I\u0026rsquo;m much more familiar with the mobile landscape now and have a better idea of what I\u0026rsquo;m doing, but I really did encounter much fewer points of friction and Flutter seems to have much better documentation. I believe it will be my first choice of frameworks moving forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"not-everything-needs-to-be-a-native-app\"\u003eNot Everything Needs to Be a Native App\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the things that annoys me about mobile apps is that people/companies unnecessarily want things to be native mobile apps when they would work perfectly fine as web apps. I can understand applications such as Uber may need numerous native functionality (GPS, timely notifications, offline functionality), so that\u0026rsquo;s fine (although many of those things are available using modern browser APIs as well!). Things like online newspapers, forums like Reddit, and so on, are perfectly fine as normal web apps, and should stop prompting me to install their native apps when they detect I am on mobile. Granted that you may get a much better UX experience with a native app, but you also have to install it locally and grant it more access than what the browser\u0026rsquo;s sandbox provides, and that feels like a tradeoff decision that the user needs to make, and not something to nag the user about constantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess part of it is that I grew up with the open web and have a significant bias towards it. In general, if I can just access an app via web, I will prefer that, unless the native app experience is vastly superior or otherwise necessary. And this focus on native apps can be bad for the web. This is apparent in apps like Instagram, which don\u0026rsquo;t allow you to use their primary function - uploading images - on a desktop browser. I also had a similar discussion with a freelance client a few years ago, when they wanted to make a mobile app, but not a corresponding web platform, when all of the app\u0026rsquo;s functionality was simple stuff that web could do easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"different-platforms\"\u003eDifferent Platforms\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe differences in iOS and Android are particularly annoying to me as a developer, especially since I\u0026rsquo;m used to web development. With web, everything is open and standards-based, so you generally write everything using a single stack, and any reasonably standards-compliant web browser will work with the web app in a reasonably consistent way. (Granted, there will be browser-specific issues, but nowadays those aren\u0026rsquo;t too common.) With iOS and Android, you have to test on both platforms extensively, and the build processes and distribution methods are different for each. Frameworks like React Native and Flutter lighten this load considerably, but you still really have to devote more time and resources to testing on the different platforms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"backward-compatibility\"\u003eBackward Compatibility\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, this one may be an unfounded concern of mine since I don\u0026rsquo;t have much experience in the matter, but I have this worry that native mobile apps tend to \u003cem\u003erot\u003c/em\u003e more easily, and by \u003cem\u003erot\u003c/em\u003e I mean, get worse with time, as the mobile OSes upgrade themselves very rapidly. Unlike, say, Windows, which gets a new major version every few years, iOS and Android are constantly getting new versions and more importantly, deprecating APIs and adding new ones! Hence my worry that unmaintained, a perfectly functional app may become unworkable a few years down the line and no longer work on the latest mobile OSes. It\u0026rsquo;s my totally unfounded belief that this is a significant reason why \u003ca href=\"/2020/07/itunes-purchases/\"\u003emore than 50% of my lifetime App Store purchases are no longer listed on the App Store\u003c/a\u003e. (And also why I\u0026rsquo;ve pretty much disavowed making mobile purchases again.) Say what you will about Windows, but at least they have a pretty good record of backward compatibility when software I\u0026rsquo;ve written for Windows in the early 2000s is still very likely to run on Windows today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"closed-platforms\"\u003eClosed Platforms\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother issue I have with native apps is that I have been used to working on open platforms. Windows, for all its faults, is still an open platform, and anyone can write software for it and distribute it using whatever method they desire. And the web is even more open and standards-based (for now at least). For mobile, Android is mostly open, but iOS is mostly a closed platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApple\u0026rsquo;s tight control over the iOS platform has been in the tech news recently. First was \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation\"\u003ethe kerfuffle with hey.com\u003c/a\u003e a few months ago, and more recently, \u003ca href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/\"\u003etheir removal of Fortnite and battle with Epic\u003c/a\u003e due to Epic\u0026rsquo;s objection to Apple taking a cut of all purchases on iOS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a mobile developer, the most annoying things about Apple\u0026rsquo;s tight control over iOS apps are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethat $100 annual fee for an Apple Developer account. If you\u0026rsquo;re a 1st world developer, that cost isn\u0026rsquo;t much, but if you\u0026rsquo;re a young hobbyist developer in a poorer country who just wants to try making an app, it can be a significant hurdle. Google also charges you some token amount for Play Store access, but at least it\u0026rsquo;s just a one-time fee.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe fact that you need to use a Mac to publish apps to the App Store. This is another significant hurdle for hobbyist developers; Macs are typically very expensive computers. Granted Android development requires a beefy setup too, but at least you get a choice of platform for Android development.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eApp store review can be unpredictable; sometimes things that were perfectly fine during a previous release are now flagged in the next review. It feels like you need to get lucky with the reviewer you get. And if the reviewer is unfair to your app, you may be out of luck unless you\u0026rsquo;re a big company like Epic or \u003ca href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/wordpress-developers-says-apple-wants-30-percent-of-its-profits-from-app-store/\"\u003eWordpress that can raise a stink about it\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of the issues that could be levied against Apple for their monopoly over the App Store could be largely addressed if the platform allowed users to install apps via alternative methods, the same way Android does. I fully understand that Apple\u0026rsquo;s tight controls enable a safer environment for naive end users (presumably, assuming they don\u0026rsquo;t screw up), and I actually approve some of their controls like their iOS14 plans to restrict targetted advertising. But more advanced users should be given the option to use alternative methods if they so choose. They can still flag apps installed via alternative methods as \u0026ldquo;potentially unsafe\u0026rdquo; and add hurdles to prevent less capable users from being easily tricked by malicious actors, (Android does this, I believe).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"in-conclusion\"\u003eIn conclusion\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t really have a point here. Maybe I just want everything to be open? I like open platforms lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

A very relaxed and chill week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again a tiny bit of work done this past week, some fixes, including to side projects. I also spent some time preparing for some events next weekend. Although I wasn\u0026rsquo;t productive this week, I did outline a bit of a roadmap of new features for one of my side projects, hopefully I can get into that in the coming weeks!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are still in a pandemic! But I did have my first dine-in meal at a restaurant last Monday. It was because I went to get blood drawn for routine medical reasons, and I had needed to skip breakfast for the test (spoiler: my blood sugar levels were very, very normal). So after getting the blood drawn I was super hungry and decided to have breakfast at the nearby Pancake House. I was the only customer since it was super early (and you know, pandemic), although a second guy came in after I had given my order. I almost subconsciously picked up the glass of water to sip from it as soon as it was served, luckily I remembered I was wearing a face mask and a face shield. I decided to hold off on removing the gear until the actual pancakes were served, to minimize the exposure time. The next day I also decided to have a snack at a Starbucks after running some errands, mainly because I had a free coffee from Globe Rewards. It was afternoon so there were a few other customers there. The cashier said it was ok to dine in, but for a maximum of one hour only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a longish post I was writing, but it felt too raw to publish and might break it up into smaller posts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe actually managed to win an online quiz night this week! It\u0026rsquo;s been a while, good job trivia team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt feels great to no longer be following the covid19 stats regularly, even though they are still fairly terrible. UP experts are projecting that we get the reproduction rate to below 1 in like a month though, so that\u0026rsquo;s some good news, though we may still be a ways away from getting this under control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are the things I\u0026rsquo;ve been watching and playing the past week:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStill playing a lot of SC2 Coop, trying to unlock the new prestiges. Levelling the commanders again can be a pain, but at least they managed to provide new goals/objectives for the players, breathing back a bunch of life into this game mode.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStill drafting Amonkhet Remastered, although the last few drafts haven\u0026rsquo;t gone well. Need to save up gems, so I\u0026rsquo;ll do one last one draft once I get enough gold.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHuh, I guess I kind of paused Uncharted 4 for most of the week, not sure why. I should get back to it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI started re-playing Super Mario 3D Land (on the 3DS) lately, mostly to stave off my desire to get a Nintendo Switch (prices are still inflated here due to supply issues!). I had forgotten a lot about this game, so even when I finished the first 8 worlds and rescued Princess Peach, I was pleasantly surprised to find there were another 8 \u0026ldquo;special\u0026rdquo; worlds to play!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewatched the video game history documentary \u003cstrong\u003eHigh Score\u003c/strong\u003e on Netflix. Pretty good, although there\u0026rsquo;s some Dragon Quest erasure going on in the RPG episode!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewatched \u003cstrong\u003eBill and Ted Face the Music\u003c/strong\u003e, this was a most excellent sequel. I found the start a bit clunky (I always find it awkward watching characters be awkward), but the rest of it was a fun and sweet adventure that echoed elements of both of the first two movies. A lot of the time travel stuff didn\u0026rsquo;t make any sense if you sat down and thought about it, but I was smiling through a lot of it. Little Billie and Theda are great!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ealso watched \u003cstrong\u003eSuperman: Man of Tomorrow\u003c/strong\u003e, the first entry in the new DC animated universe (following the reboot at the end of Justice League Dark: Apokolips). Yet another Superman origin story here. Not too happy with this one. Not fond of the animated style, and the writing and plot seemed weird at many points. I felt like there could have been a better way to resolve the whole situation with the big bad that felt more \u0026ldquo;Superman\u0026rdquo;-like, and the movie doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to earn the monicker \u0026ldquo;Man of Tomorrow\u0026rdquo; for the hero.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efor one reason or another, I also ended up watching a few standup specials on Amazon Prime. A couple from Craig Ferguson, and one from Jimmy Yang.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCobra Kai is now on Netflix! Yet another thing to add to the ever-increasing backlog.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome tech stuff:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI have about three months left on my Webfaction hosting, which I\u0026rsquo;ve \u003ca href=\"/2019/03/rip-webfaction/\"\u003ebeen planning to migrate away from\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;m currently leaning towards getting a cheap $5/mo VPS from Linode, although I\u0026rsquo;m still willing to accept any recommendations. Switching to a VPS means more effort (since it won\u0026rsquo;t be a managed service anymore), but that should provide some learning opportunities. It\u0026rsquo;s just as well anyway, my apps have been pushing the memory limits on the current hosting, and even the cheapest Linode VPS provides more RAM.  I\u0026rsquo;ll probably start looking into the migration in September.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI wrote before about \u003ca href=\"/2020/05/gmail-migration/\"\u003emigrating away from GMail\u003c/a\u003e, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Migadu.com\u0026rsquo;s free tier for about half a year now. This past week, they wrote that they are sunsetting the free tier. Totally understandable, given the economy. They are also introducing a new Micro tier at $20 a year, with slightly better limits than the old free tier, so I may migrate to that near the end of September (when the free tier runs out). In theory, I could just try to run a mail server on whatever VPS I set up (see above bullet), but that\u0026rsquo;s a big hassle. This cost + the $5/mo for the VPS is still less than what I was paying for at Webfaction, so I don\u0026rsquo;t mind paying for this for a while.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI was notified by a local bank that their old web platform is being sunsetted and I needed to migrate to the new system, so I did that. But whenever I tried the migration steps, the process never completed, it just kept telling me it was processing. I finally had to message someone I knew on the dev team lol. Hopefully it can getr resolved next week.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",

I haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten very far yet, but unsurprisingly Nathan Drake\u0026rsquo;s antics still really challenge one\u0026rsquo;s suspension of disbelief. He has to be one of the most peak-performance athletes in the world to consistently pull of the jumping and wall climbing stunts he regularly does. Not to mention being able to win over basically hordes of heavily-armed mercenaries in gunfights. Not that it\u0026rsquo;s not fun and engaging as a game, it just feels so ridiculous.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.dcfandome.com\"\u003eDC Fandome\u003c/a\u003e was today, I watched some panels and new trailers and such.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eFiled under \u0026ldquo;Things I Don\u0026rsquo;t Really Grok\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"podcasts-and-audiobooks\"\u003ePodcasts and audiobooks\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese 2 are kind of in the same boat. Their main sin is that they are audio-only. When consuming content, my order of preference for formats is roughly:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003etext (+images I guess) (most preferred)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003evideo (with audio)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eaudio only (least preferred)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think these preferences have to do with information density: I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I prefer text because text can convey the most amount of information in the least amount of bits. I\u0026rsquo;ll also watch informative videos, to a point. If it\u0026rsquo;s movie-length, it better be damn entertaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat leaves us with audio. I don\u0026rsquo;t see the appeal. I try podcasts, sometimes, when I\u0026rsquo;m out walking or such. Audiobooks, I\u0026rsquo;ve never tried. My main concern is the amount of attention you have to give the content. Because you only have the audio as a source of information, if you lose track of it, then why are you even bothering? And if I try to listen to an audiobook or podcast while doing something else that requires my attention, there\u0026rsquo;s a very low chance I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to absorb anything from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the few times I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to listen to podcasts while I\u0026rsquo;m out walking, I only dare to if I\u0026rsquo;m walking in this safe, short, and circular route inside our subdivision. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t dare do it in the streets outside where there\u0026rsquo;s real traffic. That seems like a recipe for being distracted while crossing the road, which CAN LEAD TO DEATH! Granted, the odds of such a disaster are fairly low, but why risk it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe if I still had a regular 2-hour commute (one way) to work, then audiobooks/podcasts would be more appealing while I sit in the back of an FX in Metro Manila traffic. But even then, I think I\u0026rsquo;d rather nap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make an exception for listening to music of course. Listening to music doesn\u0026rsquo;t take much concentration, and can easily happen as a background task, so that\u0026rsquo;s fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I just haven\u0026rsquo;t found the right podcast to follow? IDK, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried a few. Never could keep it up as a habit. Also, can I subscribe to podcasts using RSS feeds? I think I can, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never tried it. Like, if I find a podcast on Spotify there doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be an RSS option?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"newsletters\"\u003eNewsletters\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy \u0026ldquo;Newsletters\u0026rdquo;, I don\u0026rsquo;t mean those popups that appear on news sites or commercial blogs asking you to subscribe to get updates or such. Those are just spammy marketing BS and I have no interest in such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy \u0026ldquo;Newsletters\u0026rdquo;, I\u0026rsquo;m referring to a recent trend in the tech/online world of people moving their writing from websites/blogs to newsletters via platforms such as substack. These have some merit, as it basically involves the type of blog writing I like to consume, except in email newsletter form. There are some such newsletters whose posts I\u0026rsquo;ve read and I do find their content interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what\u0026rsquo;s the problem? The problem is I want to treat this type of content the same way I treat blog posts and newspaper editorials - as casual reading that I can pick up and read at my leisure. And (for me at least), casual reading doesn\u0026rsquo;t belong in my email inbox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have an inbox zero policy, and to achieve that I\u0026rsquo;m very strict about what I let in my email inbox. It\u0026rsquo;s mostly limited to actual conversations with people and important notifications. The email inbox is \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e where I\u0026rsquo;d like to consume casual reading that I can pick up whenever I\u0026rsquo;d like. Just the idea of leaving them there while having unread markers is annoying. In theory I could filter them to a subfolder and then the unread count would accumulate there, but I don\u0026rsquo;t like unread counts even in my email subfolders!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have nothing against the Substack business model (writers gotta earn a living I guess) and I\u0026rsquo;m sure a lot of people don\u0026rsquo;t mind consuming casual reading content via email, but Substack (and similar platforms) should provide alternate ways to consume their content, preferably RSS feeds. In the meantime I\u0026rsquo;ve been using a service called \u003ca href=\"https://kill-the-newsletter.com/\"\u003eKill the Newsletter\u003c/a\u003e to subscribe to a few newsletters I like. It works well enough (though I checked just now and one of the feeds, on a nonsubstack platform, seems to have stopped last June. I just created a new inbox in KTN for it).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(It would be even better if the content writers made their content available on their own websites, instead of centralized in a silo like Substack!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, are there any newsletters anyone can recommend that might be relevant to my interests?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eMozilla made the tech news recently for laying off a whole lot of people. (\u003ca href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/\"\u003eOfficial statement\u003c/a\u003e). People were alarmed and worried about the future of what is the last major independent browser and the open web, bit it looks like it isn\u0026rsquo;t that bleak. Most of the layoffs were to teams other than those working on Firefox, things like the experimental browser engine Servo, devtools, and MDN. The core Gecko team seems to be unaffected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that these things aren\u0026rsquo;t important. MDN, if you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar, is a set of documentation of web standards and browser support, \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\"\u003eavailable online\u003c/a\u003e, that is one of the best resources for web developers working on cross-platform things. Mozilla no longer funding it\u0026rsquo;s maintenance is a big deal, it means it\u0026rsquo;s less likely to be kept up-to-date, even though community work can still continue. Peter-Paul Koch, writer of \u003ca href=\"https://quirksmode.org\"\u003equirksmode.org\u003c/a\u003e, which was the original resource for cross-browser compatibility back in the heyday of the browser wars, wrote an article about Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s problems titled \u003ca href=\"https://quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2020/08/the_cult_of_the.html\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;The Cult of the Free\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e where he argues that it\u0026rsquo;s time to step out of this mentality that all these resources must be maintained for free by \u0026ldquo;the community\u0026rdquo;, but that we as consumers must get used to the idea of paying or donating to support these resources. Expecting \u0026ldquo;the community\u0026rdquo; to step in and maintain these resources \u003ca href=\"https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2020/08/i_love_mdn_or_t.html\"\u003ealso devalues the work of technical writers.\u003c/a\u003e Trying to get more people to support these \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; resources is a good idea, but I worry it goes against the grain of years of internet culture which has conditioned people to expect online content for free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of contributing, a while back I had considered looking for open source projects I could contribute to, and preferred projects that I actively use. Given that I\u0026rsquo;d been using Firefox \u003ca href=\"/2004/10/firefox-1-0-on-november-9/\"\u003esince before version 1.0\u003c/a\u003e, one of the projects I considered was Firefox. I went through the whole rigmarole of \u003ca href=\"https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/windows_build.html\"\u003etheir instructions to set up my machine for the Windows build\u003c/a\u003e, and just the setup process, which involved setting up and checking out code took more than an hour. That was fine for initial setup, but actually building and running Firefox itself took an additional hour or so. Might have been more than that even, it was a while back so I don\u0026rsquo;t clearly remember, but I do remember thinking that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have time for these hour-long build times. The whole set up also took up a nontrivial amount of my SSD disk space (imagine how much worse the build time would have been if I had used my non-SSD drive!), which I am always dangerously low on. These 2 factors led me to shelve the idea for the time being; perhaps I could revisit the idea of contributing to Firefox when I upgraded my computer or had more SSD space available. (TBF, I kind of gave up real quick after the first build, maybe the builds get faster on succeeding runs?). So that\u0026rsquo;s my personal \u0026ldquo;contributing-to-Firefox\u0026rdquo; story, for now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sheer size of the codebase and the long build times just drive home the point of how much modern browsers are these large complex beasts that are doing so much. They are pretty much an OS of their own since they host a ton of features and web applications and JIT JS and all of that. This means it\u0026rsquo;s really difficult for independent browser efforts to hit feature parity with modern web browsers - even just working with JS and CSS standards, there are so many to implement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew DeVault laments that \u003ca href=\"https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/13/Web-browsers-need-to-stop.html\"\u003eWeb browsers need to stop\u003c/a\u003e with all these new functionalities and APIs that add scope and complexity, and maybe focus more on performance, efficiency, etc. I do agree - if I was contributing to Firefox, I would want to find a way to reduce the massive memory footprint it always has. I don\u0026rsquo;t even use that many tabs, and I already feel burdened by Firefox\u0026rsquo;s memory footprint. (Pretty sure Chrome is pretty bad in this regard as well.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy care about Mozilla/Firefox at all? Why not just use Chrome, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty good right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, no, Chrome is not necessarily \u0026ldquo;pretty good\u0026rdquo;, given how it props up a surveillance capitalsm engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, even if you didn\u0026rsquo;t dislike Google, having a browser (engine) monoculture is not a good thing. I \u003ca href=\"/2020/02/old-web/\"\u003egot my start in web development\u003c/a\u003e at around the height of Internet Explorer 6\u0026rsquo;s dominance, and I\u0026rsquo;d rather not find my way back there. Granted, one of the issues back then was that IE6 was a stagnant platform that upstarts Firefox and eventually Chrome left behind. No such problem exists now, since Chrome is still in active development and still pushing new web standards forward. And the fact that Chrome is an open-source platform means in theory someone could just fork it if ever Google goes off the rails or such. (And people have already built indie browsers on top of Chrome of course!) But it\u0026rsquo;s still dangerous for a single company and/or codebase to be the sole major implementer of web standards. A single company dictating the future of the web isn\u0026rsquo;t a good thing, and is the very opposite of the idea of an \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo; web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSide note: Maybe I should try building Chromium too, just for comparison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, that\u0026rsquo;s all my ranting for today. In conclusion: reduce your surveillance capitalism footprint and support the open web, use Firefox.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Mozilla made the tech news recently for laying off a whole lot of people. (Official statement). People were alarmed and worried about the future of what is the last major independent browser and the open web, bit it looks like it isn\u0026rsquo;t that bleak. Most of the layoffs were to teams other than those working on Firefox, things like the experimental browser engine Servo, devtools, and MDN. The core Gecko team seems to be unaffected.",
