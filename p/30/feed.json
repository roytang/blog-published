I had also read online that while Seattle was very much a walkable city, there was a nontrivial homeless population, and some areas may be a bit sketchy after dark. As a friend of mine said though, \u0026ldquo;sketchy\u0026rdquo; in the US is probably a lot safer than \u0026ldquo;sketchy\u0026rdquo; in Metro Manila. I still worried a little bit, but given where I from, it didn\u0026rsquo;t make sense to worry about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy primary purpose for this leg of the trip was of course \u003ca href=\"/2019/07/grand-prix-seattle-2019/\"\u003eGP Seattle\u003c/a\u003e, but I also looked forward to being able to walk and explore the city by myself. Not that I don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy hanging out and travelling with my family, but I enjoy being able to wander around freely by myself with no real agenda, \u003ca href=\"/2009/03/sometimes-you-just-go-where-your-feet-take-you/\"\u003eletting my feet take me wherever\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat meant instead of theme parks and tourist attractions and shopping outlets, I found myself walking around looking into small bookstores, vintage shops, collectibles stores, hobby shops, gaming arcades, and so on. My poor performance at the GP main event gave me some extra time to wander the streets as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did hit a few tourist spots:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI took some pictures at the Space Needle. Didn\u0026rsquo;t bother going up, I felt like I\u0026rsquo;ve already climbed enough tall structures in my lifetime and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t really worth the cost\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI did take half a day to go through the Museum of Pop Culture near the Space Needle, which I enjoyed. They had exhibits on Washington state bands like Pearl Jam and Nirvana, fantasy and sci-fi exhibits, and even an independent gaming exhibit sponsored by Nintendo.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSupposedly, Seattle\u0026rsquo;s number one tourist attraction is Pike Place Market, which I found weird, because well, it\u0026rsquo;s a market. I did visit the market and wander the shop and had some of Beecher\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;World\u0026rsquo;s Best Mac and Cheese\u0026rdquo; (tastes great, but the cheese is very sharp, some people might not like it). There were some nice market shops - I enjoyed browsing a couple of the used bookstores there and there was a comic book store as well (was able to resist adding more to my reading backlog though). I think there was supposed to be some performance by the fishmongers in the market proper, and I did see some crowd gathered around one of the stalls and clapping, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t push through quick enough to see what was going on, and didn\u0026rsquo;t bother waiting for something to happen again.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing I did not enjoy was how steeply inclined Seattle\u0026rsquo;s streets were. Going from my Airbnb near Capitol Hill to the downtown area was easy enough as it was mostly downhill, but going back home at the end of the day was always a bit of a challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like Seattle as a city, especially the Capitol Hill district - it feels like it has a lot of character, compared to say, Los Angeles (although that might be an unfair comparison as I didn\u0026rsquo;t really get to wander LA much). The city has more of a west coast-artistic vibe going on, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of posters for events everywhere, art murals on a lot of walls, there\u0026rsquo;s more music shops and book shops, a lot of random small parks, and a lot of place are very LGBTQ-friendly, even some of the crosswalks are rainbow-colored. The bookstores I browsed were great, a couple had the staff leaving small notes on the shelves about various titles they recommend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn my last day in Seattle, due to some combination of poor planning and cheapness, I had to spend an inordinate amount of time at SEATAC airport, pre-security. I was basically at the airport 8 hours before my flight, a personal record. I thought Southwest would at least let me check my bags and go through security maybe 3-4 hours before the 5am flight, but their counter only opened an hour and a half before the flight. So I have no real opinions on whether SEATAC is a good airport or not lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I\u0026rsquo;ll leave you with some pictures!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeattle photo dump:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/Q6yBFyk\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"//imgur.com/a/Q6yBFyk\"\u003eSeattle\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cscript async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoPOP photo dump (part 1):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/45uzuCk\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"//imgur.com/a/45uzuCk\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cscript async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoPOP photo dump (part 2) - scfi and fantasy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/KgOUcEX\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"//imgur.com/a/KgOUcEX\"\u003eMoPOP part 2\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cscript async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e",

I had the choices of Washington DC on the 14th-16th (Limited), Seattle on 20th-23rd (Limited), or Dallas on 28th-30th (Modern). After some wrangling with the family\u0026rsquo;s schedule, Seattle was the one most convenient to go to, and Limited meant I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to try and put together a decent deck. (IDK how GP Dallas is going to go next weekend, given the problem in Modern that is Hogaak, so I guess I\u0026rsquo;m lucky I didn\u0026rsquo;t choose Dallas). Seattle was split over four days because instead of the regular day 1 and 2 for the main event, they had day 1A and 1B, and you could join either event or both to qualify for day 2. I chose to register for Saturday, Day 1A.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt turns out the limited format for GP Seattle was Modern Horizons, a set which was released on the weekend the US trip started. This meant I had no chance for any sort of practice beforehand, since the laptop I had was a Mac, which could not run MTGO. (Had the format been War of the Spark limited, I could have simply practiced at home during the trip).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo my first taste of Modern Horizons limited was the first Last-Chance Trial on Thursday. Before that all I had was reading and research and theorycrafting. I knew from all of that MH1 limited was a tough format with a lot of synergies to consider. With perhaps a bit too much arrogance, I assumed my basic limited skills and prep work could push me through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s the sealed pool I got for the

For this limited format, I tended to prefer color pairs where I had one of the indicative uncommons or rares, so I decided to go G/W this time since I had Good-Fortune Unicorn. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a record of my decklist for this pool, but I do remember my curve wasn\u0026rsquo;t that good on the low end; I won the first round on the back of a Scale Up overrun, but lost the next 2 rounds due to being aggro\u0026rsquo;ed out and a bit of color screw. A bit discouraging, but I chalked it up to bad beats and kept my confidence for the main event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the main event!

Another sword (the better one, actually, since it stops black and red removal), some good rares, decent removal. White looked decent with Answered Prayers, On Thin Ice and Rhox Veteran, and red had some good removal, a few slivers and I had a Lavebelly, so I went W/R. The only problem with this build was that the creature count was a bit low, so I felt it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a good idea to play all the Answered Prayers.

I won a quick round 1, which got me time for a quick lunch. Unfortunately, the low creature count bit me in round 2, where I was unable to close out the third game despite having the sword and Answered Prayers out. Round 3 was against an aggressive Mardu deck; I lost a quick game one, and I almost stabilized in game two but lost to a 2/2 I couldn\u0026rsquo;t remove. I realized only after signing the match slip that I had two Lava Darts in the yard that I could flashback to stay alive. I beat myself up for a while over it, and had some food to psych myself up and avoid going on tilt, still hoping I could win the rest of the day. Unfortunately, my deck didn\u0026rsquo;t come to play in Round 4, giving me 14 lands drawn in the 3rd game, leading to an easy defeat. I sadly dropped out of the main event at 1-3.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoing poorly at a GP always bums me out, especially when I had to travel for it. But I only had myself to blame for this one, since I came in with minimal experience with the format. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure my sealed deck build could have been more optimized too. I probably should have tempered my expectations and remind myself that Magic is a game of variance - skill only comes into play over a large number of events, and it\u0026rsquo;s unwise to expect to be able to spike any single given event. I decided to just leave early and come back the next day for my traditional post-GP drop Chaos Sealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, when I came back the next day, I found out Chaos Sealed was cancelled due to lack of products. Perfect end to an unfortunate weekend. Not to be undone, I decided to just do a MH1 draft, and I managed to win 2 rounds and split the finals to win a few more packs and at least end the weekend on a high note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was it for me playing Magic. I did enjoy the rest of the MagicFest though, there were some enjoyable panels and side stuff. There were a lot of artists in the artist alley (though I didn\u0026rsquo;t buy anything as usual), the usual cosplayers wandering about, and there was a really nice painting demo by Rob Alexander that I sat through on Friday. On Sunday, I watched this silly \u0026ldquo;Match game\u0026rdquo; event where the audience could win packs by trying to answer prompts and hoping they could match the answers by the panel made up of community personalities. I didn\u0026rsquo;t win anything, but I was entertained watching the thing before I went to do my draft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the 2nd time I\u0026rsquo;ve played a CFB GP, the first one was \u003ca href=\"https://roytang.net/2015/08/grand-prix-london-2015/\"\u003eGP London back in 2015\u003c/a\u003e, but this is the first time since they\u0026rsquo;ve been given a monopoly on GPs worldwide. I will admit to being a bit annoyrd at the higher entry fees for the events, and the fact that the prize wall items seem to be more expensive now too. The GP playmat used to be complimentary with main event entry too, this time I had to pay a bit extra for it. I guess there are a lot of expenses, but the costs are discouraging me from considering travel to future GPs. Also, I miss that system by ChainLinks (who used to manage the SEA GPs) where they give each player a lanyard for the weekend which could be used to enter events and tracks your dci number and prize points. For this GP, they gave out physical cards to represent your prize points, and this almost got me in trouble because I accidentally left them at the AirBNB when I headed out on Sunday and had to double back to get them. CFB also had online pairings, but I wish they did that thing where you could subscribe to an FB messenger bot that would message you automatically with your pairings. They did have some nice tech usage like having restaurant-style buzzers for on-demand events though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter very time I do poorly at a GP, I ask myself whether I should quit playing Magic competitively. Or at least the travelling for GPs part. It is kind of a young man\u0026rsquo;s game after all. Anyway, Magic Arena gives me a good outlet for playing Magic competitively without leaving the comfort of home, so that helps. But it\u0026rsquo;s hard to say for sure, we\u0026rsquo;ll see where the future takes us.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Grand Prix / MagicFest Seattle Photo Dump:\n I wasn\u0026rsquo;t actually planning to play much competitive Magic this year, at least not on paper, but when the family planned a US trip in June, I figured I\u0026rsquo;d take a short side trip to attend and experience a US GP. I had the choices of Washington DC on the 14th-16th (Limited), Seattle on 20th-23rd (Limited), or Dallas on 28th-30th (Modern). After some wrangling with the family\u0026rsquo;s schedule, Seattle was the one most convenient to go to, and Limited meant I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to try and put together a decent deck.",

Not Asian like living in Asia, but like Chinatown in any other city I guess? The city felt a bit dirty, I\u0026rsquo;m told the metro elevators smelled bad, and there was grafitti everywhere and a high incidence of homeless people. One time we took an elevator to get to the Metro and there was a homeless person smoking in the elevator. When he saw the kids, he promptly killed the cigarette and muttered apologetically \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t smoke near kids.\u0026rdquo; Hollywood was all ritz and glitter and tourist traps though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe only spent a couple of nights and one full day in Las Vegas, but the heat was insufferable. And considering I\u0026rsquo;m from Manila, that\u0026rsquo;s saying something. It was hot too in LA and Anaheim, but LV had a weird sort of desert heat that seemed to linger on your skin. On our full day, we opted to spend most of daylight just hanging out in the hotel room, with the occasional outside forays for food. We spent the night on a short walking tour among the nearby hotels and the free shows like the Atlantis show at the forum or the fountain at Bellagio. Our LV-native cousin was our guide, and we (or they at least) took a lot of pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe spent a few days in Houston, enough to bring the kids to attractions like the Space Center, Kemah Boardwalk, the Aquarium, and the Natural Science Museum. The kids enjoyed some of the rides; I tried one of the tamer ones at the Boardwalk, but still came away dizzy. I\u0026rsquo;m too old for these things. Science geek that I am, I most enjoyed the Space Center and the Natural Science Museum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHouston felt like a large expanse where everything was so far away from each other. We were lucky to be visiting a cousin who could drive us around; it would have been impossible to live here without a car. There\u0026rsquo;s always so much room everywhere, even downtown Houston never felt congested or anything remotely like Metro Manila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trip is only halfway done, but I think the most exhausting days should be behind me. Famous last words?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

(I guess this isn\u0026rsquo;t really a Seattle-specific question, but more of I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if a US airport will let me do this. Where I\u0026rsquo;m from they typically won\u0026rsquo;t let me check baggage more than 3 hours before my flight)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e​\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
