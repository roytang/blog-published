Recently with the planning for the \u003ca href=\"/2019/04/i-got-a-us-visa/\"\u003eUS trip\u003c/a\u003e, the worry that comes to mind is financial: this trip is expensive, should I be cutting back? Can I afford this Airbnb? Can I afford going to Disneyland with my nieces? etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll this worrying is silly of course. I already know I can well afford the trip, but the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s so expensive triggers the spendthrift in me to worry that I might be spending too much and I might be on a slippery slope to financial ruin. Again, silly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes when I\u0026rsquo;m outside I watch the people around me and such worries seem ridiculous when I realize a lot of people are worse off than me and yet they are able to thrive and survive and carry on with their lives enjoying simple things like a movie or a walk in the park. Even the poor or the unfortunate are able to enjoy daily life despite all of the problems around us. I\u0026rsquo;m reminded that I should not worry and just be grateful I can go on the trip at all, as not everyone can enjoy that privilege. Maybe someday I\u0026rsquo;ll lose my privileges I do enjoy so I should take advantage of them while I can. And not worry so much, even if did manage to somehow get into financial ruin, I\u0026rsquo;m skilled and employable enough that I can still live comfortably even then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot to be preachy or anything, but all of this also reminds me of a quote from Matthew 6:26:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously the analogy isn\u0026rsquo;t perfect, because you know, birds can die and be hunted easily, but the point remains. Many are able to live their lives with much less than what I have so I should be grateful and not worry so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0026rsquo;t worry, be happy\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n",

But the teeth thing is really important, it\u0026rsquo;s most probably up there somewhere in the top five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t have a good record of taking care of my teeth. I visited the dentist Friday last week and warned her as such. I knew from a years-long ago check up that I had several teeth that would need to be pulled but never followed up. And last week\u0026rsquo;s checkup confirmed that. I scheduled a second visit today to get some of them pulled. I\u0026rsquo;m writing this post before the visit, so if I don\u0026rsquo;t write a post tomorrow, maybe I died from the procedure or something. Does that happen? Do people die from teeth pulling?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously I\u0026rsquo;m not looking forward to the visit, but it\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;ve put off for too long. I\u0026rsquo;m not fond of visiting the dentist (who is?) even though I should know better about how it\u0026rsquo;s necessary. I especially don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of getting my teeth pulled. I have a pretty low tolerance for pain, and there\u0026rsquo;s always the anxiety before the actual visit. There was one time I made a \u003ca href=\"/2004/12/i-get-bored-easily/\"\u003eblog post about an eternity of pain due to a toothache\u003c/a\u003e, and my dentist happened to read the post and jokingly (maybe?) complained to me about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot taking care of my teeth is probably one of my worst regrets in life. It often makes it difficult for me to chew! I know we have a lot of urgent world problems that science could help us with, but if I was allowed to selfishly genie-wish for one scientific innovation to suddenly occur it would be the ability for medical science to regrow human teeth PAINLESSLY. Sure, civilization would probably collapse due to climate change and resource scarcity, but at least I\u0026rsquo;d have my teeth back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpdate: I\u0026rsquo;m alive! The procedure was a lot less uncomfortable than I thought it would be. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m misremembering how bad previous extractions were? Or maybe dental anesthesia technology has advanced since then? In either case I am grateful, yet I have to go back again next week so that more of my teeth may die.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

And yet the very subject invites some to ask why we should even care about the feelings of rapists or murderers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s why we need to care. We need to care because our justice system demands it. Regardless of where we stand on the appropriateness of a death penalty, we must agree that the administration of any punishment must be done in the absence of passion or cruelty. Whether we\u0026rsquo;re putting someone to death, locking them up for shoplifting, interrogating them in a criminal case or holding them while we determine their legal residency status, we must be adamant in our commitment to do so in a way that\u0026rsquo;s free from resentment or rage… or amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy is this so important? It is important because when we allow anger and apathy to seep into our justice system we begin to do unjust things. We keep prisoners in tents whose temperatures reach 114 degrees. We lock them in solitary confinement and laugh as we watch them die of a seizure. We surround them at a traffic stop and kick them in the stomach and face while they lay handcuffed and helpless. We end up with a Supreme Court justice who erupts in a blind rage when his fitness is questioned. We end up with a president who admonishes police not to \u0026ldquo;go so easy\u0026rdquo; on suspects when apprehending them, a president who leads cheers of \u0026ldquo;lock them up\u0026rdquo; whenever he brings up a political opponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe lose our way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe very existence of a criminal justice system is an agreement where the public allows its government to suspend – or even eliminate – some of the rights outlined in our constitution. In doing so we expect our government to exercise this power with the utmost care and respect, even for those accused or convicted of the most serious offenses. Because to do otherwise invites vengeance into our system. Vengeance and justice cannot coexist; one will always replace the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m reminded of how in our country, there are politicians advocating for the death penalty in response to the supposed drug menace, when there has generally been \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/04/30/theres-still-no-evidence-that-executions-deter-criminals/?utm_term=.55ee4ef75738\"\u003eno evidence to show the death penalty deters crime\u003c/a\u003e. The last time we had the death penalty, only one convict was ever executed, the country did not have the stomach for it. I imagine (based only on the perceived behavior of our politicos) that those advocating for the death penalty do not really have deterrence in mind, but rather punishment - they wish to cruelly punish the offender to satisfy the bloodlust of the populace. i.e. Vengeance, not justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eFamily\u0026rsquo;s been planning a US trip this year, and while I wasn\u0026rsquo;t originally planning to join them, they convinced me to go. I was like, why not? My schedule is flexible, I\u0026rsquo;ve never been there, and going to the US meant adding a whole new continent to my experiences. Getting a US Visa was a good idea anyway, in case I ever decided to travel there for some other reason (i.e. I miraculously get a slot in a MTG Mythic Championship or something), and it was a good chance to spend some time with family for a while. It might also be the last time my parents are able to take such a long trip, so might as well take the chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe US Visa screening process has a reputation for being a bit difficult, with many stories of being rejected for random reasons, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too worried. In the end, it turned out easier to get the US Visa than to get \u003ca href=\"/2015/03/europe-trip-2015/\"\u003ethe Schengen visa for the Europe trip\u003c/a\u003e a few years back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe process is actually pretty straightforward. For the Philippines, there\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"http://www.ustraveldocs.com/ph/index.html?firstTime=No\"\u003ea website to help\u003c/a\u003e guide you, all the instructions are there, you just have to follow it. You can do most of the things except for the personal interview online as well. The steps I did were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFill up and submit the online form. This includes uploading a photo to be used in the visa, they have some guidelines to follow. I considered using a webcam photo, but apparently that was a bad idea. Go to a photo studio, they know what kind of picture you need, ask for a digital copy so you can upload it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMake an online payment (they have a couple of options, I did BPI Online). The fee is like $160 for a tourist visa.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSchedule an interview appointment. The first available slot may be weeks out, but sometimes slots open up earlier for some reason. During one of my earlier checks I thought I\u0026rsquo;d have to wait til May to get a slot, but by the time I actually submitted the form and made the payment, there was a March slot freed up.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePrepare any supporting documents you want to bring to the personal interview. You are not actually required to bring any documents, but the website above will give you a list of suggested documents to bring, depending on your visa type and purpose of visit. Everyone I asked actually said the documents they brought weren\u0026rsquo;t needed, but better to be sure of course. I ended up preparing bank statements, certificate of employment, payslips, and tax returns.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOn your scheduled date, go to the US Embassy in Manila for your interview\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interview itself was straightforward, but before you get even there, there\u0026rsquo;s at least six different queues you have to go through:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewaiting outside the embassy for applicants in your time slot (there will be around 50 applicants per time slot)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003equeueing at the embassy entrance so the staff can inspect your appointment papers and tell you where to go\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003equeueing in a holding area outside the processing building. There\u0026rsquo;s seats, and they\u0026rsquo;ll let people proceed to the next step one row of seats at a time. There\u0026rsquo;s snacks and water you can buy here, but it felt awkward to buy because you don\u0026rsquo;t know when your row might suddenly be called to go ahead. Also, this is the last time you get to stay seated for the entire process, once you go in you might have to stand in line(s) for about an hour\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e(step 1) pre-screening. A Filipino embassy staff member will review your documents and your photo. If you didn\u0026rsquo;t upload a photo when you submitted the form online, they\u0026rsquo;ll ask you to go to a photo taking area and get a photo taken and come back to their counter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e(step 2) biometrics. There\u0026rsquo;s a helpful American at this window who will take your fingerprints\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e(step 3) interview. An American will be asking you questions and they will pass or fail your visa application on the spot.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people take a lot longer than others at step 3, and it can make you a bit anxious when you can see the person in front of you being grilled intensely. One lady in a window in front of me was asked how long she planned to stay, and she said \u0026ldquo;one to five months\u0026rdquo; and the interviewer seemed irritated at the vagueness of the reply. \u0026ldquo;Which is it, one month or five months, those are completely different!\u0026rdquo; Another lady and her son said they wanted to visit a sick relative and they had to present a certification from the doctor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy interview was pretty straightforward, I didn\u0026rsquo;t even need any of the documents I prepared. The guy asked me about my purpose of travel, where I had travelled before, and what kind of work I did. He drilled down a bit into the work question, asking me what kind of software I did, which I suspect was just to make sure I wasn\u0026rsquo;t BSing him about being a dev. Overall my time at the window didn\u0026rsquo;t take more than five minutes I think, and he said \u0026ldquo;Ok, I\u0026rsquo;m approving your application and you\u0026rsquo;ll get your visa in a week.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think you don\u0026rsquo;t have anything to worry about as long as you\u0026rsquo;re honest about your reasons for travelling (no intention to deceive) and you\u0026rsquo;re confident (don\u0026rsquo;t look sketchy, which should be easy if you\u0026rsquo;re honest!). I would imagine being able to communicate well in English also helps a lot, that\u0026rsquo;s a bit elitist, but such is life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt worried me a bit that I left without any proof that I had left my passport with them, like a receipt or such. What if they lost it and claim they never had it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, that\u0026rsquo;s just my unnecessary worrying. My passport came back to me by courier three days after the interview, with the visa approved, ten years multiple entry. I\u0026rsquo;m going to the US!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

These days my morning newspaper consists mostly of Flipboard articles, then the local newspaper during lunch and dinner if I am at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from mealtime readings, I also regularly take breaks to check what is going on in social media and my RSS reader. I am, to invent a word, hyperinformed. As soon as something happens, I like to know about it. A bus exploded on EDSA the other day and I told my parents about it before it came up on local news TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis may be a bit of information overflow. And some even say that for the sake of our own mental health, we should avoid consuming the news too regularly. Especially these days, when the news is full of negativity: natural disasters, politicians being stupid or corrupt, crimes and atrocities, invasions of privacy, hatred, racism, war, poverty, and so on. The world can be dark, and news tends to highlight the negative, and consuming it too regularly may begin to affect our worldview.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a desire to stay informed of course, I still consider that a duty as a responsible citizen. To know what issues are being faced by people in our country and in the world, so that we may help craft the decisions to solve those issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut perhaps regular consumption is not so necessary. It might be a good idea to shift to some kind of weekly or monthly schedule of news consumption, instead of daily. The problem would be finding sources that can sum up the past week or month\u0026rsquo;s news, distill it into those things important to know. This might be challenging, especially for local news. But maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll start looking around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then what would I read during breakfast?\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I appreciated how they re-told the \u0026ldquo;Carol getting her powers from an explosion\u0026rdquo; and Mar-vell still being there. I appreciate the surprise that Annette Benning was Mar-Vell all along. I appreciate their reimagination of the Kree Supreme Intelligence. I appreciate that by the time Avengers Endgame or any potential Captain Marvel 2 rolls around, Monica Rambeau will be old enough to be her own superhero as well. I appreciate all the little things connecting this movie to the first Iron Man, the first Avengers, and even to Infinity War itself. I also appreciated that their depiction of the Kree did not rule out the Agents of SHIELD versions existing!

The Arrowverse is limping along. Recent episodes of \u003cstrong\u003eSupergirl\u003c/strong\u003e have been great, I loved Jon Cryer as Lex Luthor, and I love how they\u0026rsquo;ve been able to adapt multiple comic book storylines this season such as \u003cem\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s So Funny About Truth, Justice, \u0026amp; the American Way?\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eAmerican Alien\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eRed Son\u003c/em\u003e.

The big headliners to look forward to are of course \u003cstrong\u003eAvengers Endgame\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eShazam\u003c/strong\u003e, and the final season of \u003cstrong\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

For every person, there likely exists a \u0026ldquo;tribe\u0026rdquo;, not necessarily all in one place, a community where that person would fit in. And in the modern age, the internet and social media make it all the more easier for such \u0026ldquo;outsiders\u0026rdquo; to connect with each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a power to this connection, to finding your tribe. It gives you strength and reinforces your beliefs and reassures you that you aren\u0026rsquo;t some strange outlier undeserving of connection. This is why nerd culture has become so popular lately. Traditionally seen as outcasts in the 90s and earlier, now more than ever it has become acceptable to have geeky interests like comic books, Star Wars, tech stuff, and so on. As the early adopters of the online community, nerd culture found its footing earlier than other subcultures, and they found that yes, there are a lot of us, and now the big businesses are starting to listen, seeing the \u0026ldquo;nerds\u0026rdquo; as a massive market to be served.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis connectivity has some downsides too though, since it does not discriminate. This means that even followers of fringe views such as white supremacists, flat earthers, antivaxxers, conspiracy theorists, and so on can connect to each other. If you can find your tribe, they can too. The more fringe the view, the more the worldwide connectivity can empower them. Whereas before a small community might have at most 1 antivaxxer, he would have no source of materials to support his fringe view thus finding it difficult to spread his views. But multiply that with tens of thousands of such communities connected globally online, and you have potentially tens of thousands of antivaxxers. With the internet allowing antivaxxers to reach out to each other and form Facebook groups and discussion forums and such, they can spread the word more easily reinforce their own suspicions about mainstream channels and try to convince other people to join their cause. This can apply to any fringe group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust take a look at the recent Christchurch massacre in New Zealand. The gunman livestreamed and uploaded a video manifesto online and the social media channels had a lot of trouble trying to block the spread of the video. Tens of thousands were re-sharing it, some even modifying the video to evade filters. Supportes in such violence might be rare in your local community, but online they are able to gather in the thousands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt feels like a fundamental weakness in freedom of speech. The traditional argument in favor of allowing all speech is that the best ideas rise to the top and the terrible ones are drowned out, that such fringe views would fall to the wayside in the light of superior arguments. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t take into account people being stupid and succumbing to their confirmation biases and ignoring anything that doesn\u0026rsquo;t support their world views. And as we can see with terrorism, fringe views don\u0026rsquo;t require widespread support in order to damage real lives. This feels like one of those instances, where we have to sacrifice a little bit of freedom for a little bit of security (and probably lose both).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t like it. Hopefully it\u0026rsquo;s something humanity will be able to figure out sometime soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I did a quick PoC in Python/Flask, with \u003ca href=\"http://www.tweepy.org/\"\u003eTweepy\u003c/a\u003e for accessing the Twitter API. I normally prefer Django for my webapps, but since this was just a small, quick app, I figured Flask would be ideal. That worked out fine, except that I had to use my personal access tokens to for all the API calls. This means that if many people were using the app, it was likely to hit Twitter\u0026rsquo;s rate limits!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a few months back. A couple of days ago, someone emailed me asking about an error he encountered using the app, and sure enough it was due to the rate limits. I had a couple of free hours last weekend, so I figured I\u0026rsquo;d update the app a bit. I decided to add a Twitter login requirement, that way we can use the individual user\u0026rsquo;s access token instead of using mine globally. This would allow the rate limits to be per user and thus less likely to be hit. Now, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried implementing OAuth login some years ago and it can be terribly complicated, but luckily I found out that there\u0026rsquo;s a nifty Python package called \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/singingwolfboy/flask-dance\"\u003eFlask-Dance\u003c/a\u003e that made it super easy to add Twitter OAuth to a Flask app. This also let me discard the Tweepy dependency, since the Twitter OAuth session let me query the API endpoints directly. I also did a bit of UI cleanup and error handling and deployed the changes quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe app is available online at \u003ca href=\"/apps/twitter\"\u003eroytang.net/apps/twitter\u003c/a\u003e. There\u0026rsquo;s a few other Twitter tools I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to build, so I\u0026rsquo;ll probably put them here too when I get around to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThe concept of a \u0026ldquo;meritocracy\u0026rdquo; has come to the fore again with the \u003ca href=\"http://time.com/5549921/college-admissions-bribery-scandal/\"\u003erecent college admissions scandal\u003c/a\u003e in the US, where wealthy parents bribed coaches and other professionals to get their kids into high-end universities with supposedly high standards. It\u0026rsquo;s put a lie to the idea that the students of these universities represent the \u0026ldquo;cream of the crop\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the best of the best\u0026rdquo;, showing that kids can get in not only due to their own talent, but also due to money. Of course, it was always open knowledge before that one could get their kid admitted to such universities simply by making a huge donation. The recent events apparently crosses some line because the \u0026ldquo;donation\u0026rdquo; was in the form of bribe money to individuals instead of the school itself, but even without them there was no true meritocracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to a specialized high school (and college) that had supposedly merit-based entrance exams as well, such that one could simply not get in without passing the exams. (Athletics-based admissions aren\u0026rsquo;t very popular in this country.) Even in such a system, rich kids still have a significant leg up of course - aside from growing up in an environment that favored them, their parents could also afford to send them to expensive review centers to prep for the exams. I was reminded of this due to a recent thread among my HS batchmates discussing how their kids had to prep for the entrance exams years early because it was much more competitive these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to be a strong believer in meritocracy when I was young (probably due to my educational background), believing it to be an ideal for society to aspire to. The idea is certainly attractive - that we should give the jobs and positions to those who would be able to use them most effectively, for the betterment of society. I later learned that the term orignated in 1958 as a condemnatory word by Michael Young in his work \u0026ldquo;The Rise of the Meritocracy\u0026rdquo;. I realize now that while a pure meritocracy would be nice, it would disadvantage people who are already behind in life due to poverty, sickness or other such challenges. I think that like many things, some sort of balance is better struck, with a \u0026ldquo;meritocracy at large\u0026rdquo; in effect for the most part, but with opportunities promoted for marginalized groups. That is, a meritocracy that favors the poor instead of the rich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll this meritocract quote reminds me of a quote from the Simpsons\u0026rsquo; villainous Mr Burns who tries to justify cheating in a contest during a company retreat, which gives us a different perspective:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Burns: Tell me, Simpson, if an opportunity arose for taking a small short-cut, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be averse to taking it, would you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHomer: Hmm, not as such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Burns: Neither would I. If you can take advantage of a situation in some way, it\u0026rsquo;s your duty as an American to do it. Why should the race always be to the swift, or the Jumble to the quick-witted? Should they be allowed to win merely because of the gifts God gave them? Well I say, \u0026ldquo;Cheating is the gift man gives himself.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHomer: Mr. Burns, I insist that we cheat!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Burns: Excellent!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n",
