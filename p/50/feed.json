Many times she would be putting in extra hours for days at a time and I would say to her \u0026ldquo;Put that off until tomorrow, it\u0026rsquo;s time to go home.\u0026rdquo; and she would reply along the lines of \u0026ldquo;But I still have so much work to do.\u0026rdquo; and my usual rejoinder would be \u0026ldquo;Are you expecting to finish all of that work tonight?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe modern working world is full of problems, issues, tasks and other work that needs to be resolved, and it can be overwhelming at times. It can seem like the list of to-dos is endless. Software development in particular can seem like never-ending crises and issues and tickets to be resolved, especially for larger teams and larger projects. But that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t mean we sacrifice all our time in pursuit of emptying that to-do list. We put in our hours and pare down that list the best we can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne learns this quickly when faced with any nontrivial project with an issue tracker. Often the list will seem to keep growing with no signs of slowing down. You might have a tendency to say \u0026ldquo;but we can\u0026rsquo;t release software with this many issues!\u0026rdquo; But deadlines are real, and you learn that you have to triage and make trade-offs with the time you have available. Real-world software is released with issues still pending, simply because there isn\u0026rsquo;t enough time to do everything. So you prioritize and choose the most important things, the most critical bugs, and fix what you can in the available time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne has to apply this to one\u0026rsquo;s personal workload as well. No matter how many things you have to do, you don\u0026rsquo;t have infinite time. You have to figure out what\u0026rsquo;s important for you and that\u0026rsquo;s where you focus your time and effort. Pushing yourself beyond what your time and health allow will do no good. That way lies madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven for personal goals this is an issue for me. I want to do a lot of things. There are so many things I want to read, write, create, draw, learn, watch, and try out. I want to do everything. There are so many things I want to have mastery over. Mastery implies regularly spending hours on practice and effort. But there are only so many hours in the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Maybe mild, unmarked spoilers somewhere in this review, be warned!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOverall: the game was amazing and spectacular and fun, especially for a big comic book fan like me, well worth the buy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMechanics: Combat felt a bit weird to me at first, mainly because I was expecting it to be closer to Arkham-style combat, and I kept trying to use Spider-Man\u0026rsquo;s Circle Dodge the same way I use Batman\u0026rsquo;s Triangle counter, and that got me clocked by the first boss of the game (Kingpin) a few times. Spider-man\u0026rsquo;s Dodge doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow you to cancel out of existing animations like Batman\u0026rsquo;s counter, so I really needed to unlearn that instinct. Once you get a hang of it, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty good, but feels a lot more chaotic than Arkham style combat. Arkham combat felt a lot more rhythmic where you just tap commands out and point at the baddie you want to hit. Here it feels like you have to be jumping all the time and swinging across the air and moving the camera around to look for objects to throw at enemies.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMechanics: Web-swinging around Manhattan also felt weird at first. Sometimes the command to web swing would be unresponsive, which I would later realize would be because I was at a height that was too high to find surfaces to swing from. Once you get the hang of it, it feels very smooth and fun and you\u0026rsquo;re zipping around Manhattan like a boss.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStory: Peter Parker in this universe is reminiscent of old-school Peter Parker who\u0026rsquo;s always late to things and always behind on his rent. The early parts have him getting evicted from his apartment (classic Parker!) and looking for a place to crash. (Although after that point, it\u0026rsquo;s never mentioned where he\u0026rsquo;s sleeping, if he is at all.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStory: Spider-man here is however, a well-known public figure, a veteran of super-heroing who even gets some assistance from law enforcement primarily in the form of Captain Yuri Watanabe. He\u0026rsquo;s been webslinging around long enough to build a stable of villains who are constantly referenced about being held in the Raft.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMechanics: There\u0026rsquo;s actually a lot to do around the city. Not really collectibles, but more like different kinds of challenges and missions. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of crimes to stop that you\u0026rsquo;ll hear on police bands as you\u0026rsquo;re web-swinging around. More difficult crimes and missions unlock as the story progresses, and they all come with optional objectives (such as perform X type of special move, etc) that give you bonus rewards. There\u0026rsquo;s also stealth missions reminiscent of Arkham\u0026rsquo;s predator modes, pigeon chasing, research missions that have you doing all sorts of weird tasks, and so on. Missions typically reward you with some form of tokens, which are used to unlock suits, gadgets and upgrades. This Spider-Man has a lot of gadgets, making him closer to a Batman figure in this universe.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStory: In this universe, J. Jonah Jameson is retired from his days at the Daily Bugle and instead hosts an internet radio show where as can be expected, he\u0026rsquo;s always castigating Spider-Man. His broadcasts come in as you\u0026rsquo;re swinging around the city, and Jonah will often comment on things you\u0026rsquo;ve recently done or missions recently accomplished. I especially like it when one of the missions had you doing something ridiculous like intentionally swinging through smog and Jonah makes wild speculations about what the hell you were smoking.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMechanics: The suit selection in the game is fairly good, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of suits available and you unlock more as you level up (you need to purchase them with tokens). You can change costumes at any time, and most cutscenes will show Spider-Man wearing whatever suit you have on at the time, which can be sometimes hilarious. I\u0026rsquo;m severaly disappointed at the lack of the \u003ca href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/spiderman/images/6/69/F0ab528486904cef1297397514b73ef9.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120721011355\"\u003eFantastic Four Amazing Bag-Man costume\u003c/a\u003e though. My favorite costume from this game is the classic comic book costume (screenshots below), I really like how well it\u0026rsquo;s animated so smoothly and gives such a cartoony vibe. I would totally play an entire game rendered in this fashion. It\u0026rsquo;s also hilarious when this costume is used in cutscenes!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/KcHOHTc.png\" alt=\"My favorite costume!\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/4KOBWj0.jpg\" alt=\"Why won\u0026rsquo;t you take me seriously MJ?!?\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://imgur.com/XyiqRIW.jpg\" alt=\"Those guns won\u0026rsquo;t work on me, I\u0026rsquo;m a cartoon!\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMystery: I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why, but the distance scaling in this game is super-off. In-game measurements tell me Manhattan island is about 4 km from top to bottom, which feels really small. The \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan\"\u003eWikipedia entry\u003c/a\u003e says Manhattan is almost 60 sq km, but in-game it can\u0026rsquo;t be more than 10 sq km. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why it would be like this.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStory/Mechanics: You don\u0026rsquo;t get to play as Peter Parker/Spider-Man all the time, there\u0026rsquo;s also a few missions you have to play out as one of two side characters. One of them is the lovable spunky red-headed Mary Jane Watson, who in this universe is not a supermodel actress, but rather has a more Lois-Lane like role as an investigative reported for the Daily Bugle. That means she gets herself into all sorts of troublesome situations where she has to sneak around enemies in order to escape. She\u0026rsquo;s no damsel in distress here, I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure if Peter ever rescues her directly. I like this MJ iteration, she has a lot more spunk. The other side character you get to play at is young Miles Morales, who enter\u0026rsquo;s Peter\u0026rsquo;s life somewhere in the 2nd act of the story. Miles parts consist of sneaking around as well, although he has a different toolset than MJ, mainly consisting of a hacking app that lets him create distractions to bypass guards.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStory: One of the best things in this game\u0026rsquo;s story is the mentorship relationship between Peter Parker and Otto Octavius, although if you know comics, you have a pretty good idea of where this is headed. Unlike the \u003ca href=\"/2004/07/movies-spiderman-2/\"\u003e2nd Tobey movie\u003c/a\u003e, the game gives their relationship sufficient time to develop before you start to see signs of trouble. The fall itself is well-executed and heavily foreshadowed and Peter has only himself to blame when he finds out he helped turn his mentor into an insane mechanical octopus.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStory: The overall story had some twists and some surprises in the ending itself. At the heart of all the problems facing Spider-Man this time around is the incumbent Mayor Norman Osborn, but who never actually turns into a green villain himself. The game\u0026rsquo;s ending heavily hints at a 2nd outing, so they\u0026rsquo;re probably saving Norman for later. Wise decision as well, Spider-Man has a deep bench of villains to pull from, and many of the classic ones haven\u0026rsquo;t been hinted at yet in this game. Aside from the Goblin, the 2nd game could very well introduce us to the Lizard, Sandman, Mysterio, and maybe even Venom among others!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAfter getting the platinum, I was tempted to purchase the \u0026ldquo;City That Never Sleeps\u0026rdquo; DLCs as well for additional content, but I decided to hold off for now. My experience already feels \u0026ldquo;complete\u0026rdquo; and just right anyway, and adding more missions might be too repetitive. Maybe if it goes on sale sometime.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStan Lee (RIP) also had a small cameo in this game. For me it\u0026rsquo;s bittersweet that I got the platinum a couple of days after his death; I consider the game to be a fitting tribute to his life\u0026rsquo;s work.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs is tradition, here\u0026rsquo;s a screendump, awash with in-game spoilers! (Mainly because I chose to include the automatic screenshots that came with each Trophy unlock). You can see during the later parts I was using the comic costume almost exclusively!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/GXG9Qb5\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"//imgur.com/GXG9Qb5\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cscript async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e",
            "summary": "Finally had the time to play Marvel\u0026rsquo;s Spider-Man for PS4. Took just a little under two weeks from start to Platinum. Maybe mild, unmarked spoilers somewhere in this review, be warned!\n Overall: the game was amazing and spectacular and fun, especially for a big comic book fan like me, well worth the buy. Mechanics: Combat felt a bit weird to me at first, mainly because I was expecting it to be closer to Arkham-style combat, and I kept trying to use Spider-Man\u0026rsquo;s Circle Dodge the same way I use Batman\u0026rsquo;s Triangle counter, and that got me clocked by the first boss of the game (Kingpin) a few times.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s been a while since I took one of those internet quizzes that categorize you and try to describe your personality. I ran into this one called \u003ca href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/sparketypes/\"\u003eSparketypes\u003c/a\u003e recently. Here\u0026rsquo;s my result:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour Primary Sparketype reveals the essential nature or \u0026ldquo;driver\u0026rdquo; of the work you\u0026rsquo;re here to do (whether it\u0026rsquo;s the work you get paid to do, or not). When you do the work of your Primary Sparketype, you come alive with purpose and, fully-expressed in a healthy way, deepen into meaning, flow, connection and joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a Maven, fascination is your call. You latch onto a topic, field or industry and devour everything you can know about it. Staying \u0026ldquo;surface level\u0026rdquo; just isn\u0026rsquo;t an option for you. It\u0026rsquo;s no fun. You are driven to learn, to discover, to ferret out information, wisdom, knowledge for no other purpose than the joy of learning and knowing something as fully and deeply as you can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour Maven\u0026rsquo;s fascination and yearning to learn might be expressed more generally, as a perpetual curiosity about everything and everyone. Or, it may be more focused on highly-specific topics or fields of interest that evolve over time, often because your ceaseless yearning to learn has largely exhausted what the topic has to offer. So, you find the next area of fascination to move on to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Maven\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s not necessarily about what you \u0026ldquo;do\u0026rdquo; with your rapidly-accumulating reservoir of wisdom. What you learn may be useful to the others, or not. When it is, you enjoy sharing it. It is a beautiful potential \u0026ldquo;by-product\u0026rdquo; that also is essential if you want to turn your Maven-ness into your living. But, when you\u0026rsquo;re really being honest, it\u0026rsquo;s not the essential reason you do it. The fact that is has value to others is more a measuring stick of the depth of your knowledge and ability to fully-express what you\u0026rsquo;ve learned than a true expression of your reason for being. Either way, the deeper driver is the quest to learn, to satisfy your perpetual, insatiable fascination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, there\u0026rsquo;s two results! I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I understand what the difference is. Here\u0026rsquo;s the second one:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember, your Primary Sparketype (above) represents the essential nature of the work you\u0026rsquo;re here to do. Your core driver of purpose, passion, expression and flow in work and life. Your Shadow Sparketype, on the other hand, is also a big part of you. Some may feel its call nearly as strongly. Your Shadow Sparketype most often reveals the work that you may well enjoy and have developed a high level of skill around, BUT it is also largely taken up in service of doing the work of your Primary Sparketype better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour Shadow Sparketype is The Scientist, which means you are driven by, and find a deep sense of satisfaction in the pursuit of an answer to a burning question, or the solution to a significant problem. But, for you, when you\u0026rsquo;re really being honest, that drive is almost always in service of doing the work of your Primary Sparketype at the higher possible level. It\u0026rsquo;s more a means than an end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMany times quizzes like these are eerily accurate - which shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a surprise since you\u0026rsquo;re the one providing the input, so the results will tend to reinforce what your own views are about yourself. I\u0026rsquo;m especially fond of the assessment of the Maven\u0026rsquo;s tendency to latch onto anything that fascinates him, since that happened to me just recently with \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/site-migration-from-wordpress-to-hugo/\"\u003elearning Hugo and the site migration from Wordpress\u003c/a\u003e which I lost sleep over. I think this is one of things that makes me feel most alive - when I find a topic of interest and dive into it and lose sleep over it. Unfortunately, that happens fairly rarely nowadays and rarely lasts very long.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m slightly amused by how I\u0026rsquo;ve read so much about strategies for monetizing content on the internet that by now I can easily recognize when someone else is doing it. After sending me my Sparketype, there was also a link to a page upselling me on their \u0026ldquo;Mastery Program\u0026rdquo; which would allow me to make the most of this knowledge for $29.99. I guess it was a book or video of some sort. Exactly 24 hours after the initial results email, I got a 2nd email which was following-up and encouraging me to take a look at the program. I unsubscribed at this point, but I find it safe to assume I\u0026rsquo;m still in their database. I don\u0026rsquo;t even think I ever signed up. I\u0026rsquo;m not really the type of person who would pay for these things, so as long as I know what I\u0026rsquo;m getting into, I don\u0026rsquo;t mind tolerating the sleazy marketing for a bit.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n",

I can usually figure it out, but it feels like things are unnecessarily more complicated than they need to be\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWordpress\u0026rsquo;s rich plugin library is a plus, but it also means having to figure out how to have multiple plugins interoperate with each other. An easy example is that I was using a queueing plugin that didn\u0026rsquo;t work great with the Gutenberg editor\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWordpress requires a lot of maintenance, including needing to regularly update plugins for security purposes, and comment moderation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"static-site-generators\"\u003eStatic Site Generators\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, while reading across some blogs over the past few months, I had ran into the idea of static site generators, which intrigued me as a Wordpress alternative. SSGs offered several advantages:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI could compose my posts offline and using any \u003ca href=\"https://roytang.net/2018/11/my-history-in-text-editors/\"\u003etext editor\u003c/a\u003e I wanted, using a simple format like Markdown\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePage load performance is better since Apache will simply serve up the static files, no processing or database hits of any kind\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStatic sites don\u0026rsquo;t require security updates of any sort - there\u0026rsquo;s no database or admin backend to be hacked\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEasy backups. In WP I was using a custom plugin for backups. With an SSG, I can simply have the raw content stored in Github, then the static content \u0026ldquo;built\u0026rdquo; from there. The content always exists in at least three places - the actual site, Github, and my local computer I use for posting.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"why-hugo\"\u003eWhy Hugo\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s quite a lot of static site generators available right now actually. The most popular one seems to be \u003ca href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\"\u003eJekyll\u003c/a\u003e which is ruby-based. I first decided to try \u003ca href=\"https://blog.getpelican.com/\"\u003ePelican\u003c/a\u003e because I preferred Python over Ruby. However, it turned out problematic on my Windows machine, I encountered some interoperability problems with pandoc for the WP migration. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to have too many dependencies and issues with dependencies because I would later want to deploy the generator itself to my hosting on Webfaction for automated deployments, so I wanted the setup to be as easy as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I stumbled upon \u003ca href=\"https://gohugo.io/\"\u003eHugo\u003c/a\u003e, which offered two main advantages:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe MSP was performance. I wanted to migrate over the entire history of the blog, which was almost 900 posts at this point.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eno external dependencies - all I needed was to download the hugo executable\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter reading up and testing a bit of Hugo, I had a fit of \u0026ldquo;I couldn\u0026rsquo;t sleep, I\u0026rsquo;ll just go ahead and do the site migration now\u0026rdquo; that I would later regret since it completely screwed up my sleep schedule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"wordpress-export\"\u003eWordpress Export\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter\"\u003eWordpress to Hugo plugin\u003c/a\u003e to convert my Wordpress content for Hugo. Many posts had reported problems with this plugin, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any issues with its basic operation. I had a two problems with it:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewhen exporting existing Wordpress comments, it didn\u0026rsquo;t include the commenter\u0026rsquo;s URL, which I felt I should include\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eall the posts were exported into a single \u003ccode\u003eposts\u003c/code\u003e folder. While this didn\u0026rsquo;t create any permalinks issues due to each post having the \u003ccode\u003eurl\u003c/code\u003e attribute in the frontmatter, it made the entire folder look very unorganized since I had almost 900+ posts. I preferred that the posts be grouped by year and month, matching the \u003ccode\u003e/yyyy/mm/slug/\u003c/code\u003e format of the permalink\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I had the source for the plugin, it was straightforward to fix both issues myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter getting the export from the plugin, I still had a bit of post-processing and cleaning up of the posts to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one thing, all the single-quotes in the exported posts seem to have been converted to HTML entities for that smart quote thing, so I had to reverse that. Luckily, it was a simple find and replace across text files. The format for embedding posts such as Twitter, Youtube, etc was different as well, I had to correct those files one by one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"cleaning-up-the-taxonomies\"\u003eCleaning up the taxonomies\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had always wanted to clean up the categories in the blog, but I never got around to it with Wordpress because I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like figuring out the SQL I would have needed to do it. (I\u0026rsquo;ve never liked Wordpress\u0026rsquo;s table structure.). With Hugo, all I had to do was update a bunch of text files, which I was much more comfortable with. This involved simply importing a Python library to \u003ca href=\"https://elbauldelprogramador.com/en/how-to-parse-frontmatter-with-python/\"\u003eparse frontmatter\u003c/a\u003e, and a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/roytang/blog/blob/master/utils/clean_categories.py\"\u003escript\u003c/a\u003e to do the conversion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"generating-the-archive-pages\"\u003eGenerating the archive pages\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t have built-in support for archive pages, so I had to create them myself. I followed the setup described in \u003ca href=\"https://blog.atj.me/2017/10/generate-yearly-and-monthly-archive-pages-with-hugo-sections/\"\u003ethis blog post\u003c/a\u003e and wrote a python \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/roytang/blog/blob/master/utils/create-archives.py\"\u003escript\u003c/a\u003e to generate the individual year/month archive pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bigger problem was the archive listing (the page that would link to the individual archive pages). Because the blog has been running for 15 years, there\u0026rsquo;s a whole lot, so I preferred to organize them in a table like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#bc6ffeab2c0e919e9cfc9edeb1084a63-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/site-migration-from-wordpress-to-hugo/archive-grid_hue4b4a2fae19a0f11e617fa08057e7adf_25861_300x0_resize_box_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"bc6ffeab2c0e919e9cfc9edeb1084a63-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/site-migration-from-wordpress-to-hugo/archive-grid.png\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"14 Nov 2018 3:06am\"\u003e14 Nov 2018 3:06am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI actually couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a decent Wordpress plugin that did this for me exactly, so I wrote my \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/roytang/wp_grid_archive/\"\u003eown plugin\u003c/a\u003e for this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Hugo, I struggled with this a while and was close to figure out when I finally got the approach right. CHeck \u003ca href=\"/archives\"\u003emy archives page\u003c/a\u003e for how it turned out. The upside is I got to become a bit familiar with \u003ca href=\"https://golang.org/,\"\u003ehttps://golang.org/,\u003c/a\u003e particularly the way content is parsed and processed in Hugo templates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"custom-shortcodes\"\u003eCustom shortcodes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had some custom-formatted code in Wordpress that wasn\u0026rsquo;t exported properly by the plugin. This required I create some new shortcodes for Hugo and replace the corresponding calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSpoilers. I had only recently added this WP plugin, and only one post was using it so this was straightforward. I created the spoiler shortcode and added some simple jQuery-backed code to toggle the spoiler content. I would have preferred doing this with vanilla JS so as to avoid the jQuery dependency, but I decided to put off learning how to do that for another day.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"/categories/magic-the-gathering\"\u003eMTG\u003c/a\u003e Decklists and card links. Individual card links wasn\u0026rsquo;t an issue - I just generated an anchor as needed, and had to clean up some of the pages that used it. The decklist part was more challenging, as it involved a lot of text parsing. I managed to get it working to a point where the decklists were formatted correctly, but individual cards weren\u0026rsquo;t linked, before deciding to give up. The main issue is I haven\u0026rsquo;t figured out how to parse each line to split the card count and the card name, if the card count exists, i.e. \u0026ldquo;3 Lightning Bolt\u0026rdquo;. I considered just adding JavaScript to format the contents post-load, but the current behavior will do for now. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll even revisit the Hugo parsing issue later.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"redirects\"\u003eRedirects\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to minimize changes in the URLs of older content, so the permalinks for the old posts were kept in place. Another issue was the RSS feed, generated at \u003ccode\u003e/index.xml\u003c/code\u003e by Hugo, which I wanted at \u003ccode\u003e/feed/\u003c/code\u003e so that feed readers don\u0026rsquo;t need to be updated. A simple redirect in .htaccess was enough to get this done. I\u0026rsquo;m not much good at regexes, so I had to reference another \u003ca href=\"https://blog.philipphauer.de/moving-wordpress-hugo/\"\u003eblog post\u003c/a\u003e for this one. The RSS feeds for categories/tags has changed, I think that\u0026rsquo;s fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"automatic-deployment\"\u003eAutomatic Deployment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI referenced another \u003ca href=\"https://gomakethings.com/automating-the-deployment-of-your-static-site-with-hugo-and-github/\"\u003eblog post\u003c/a\u003e for setting up automatic deployment. The main difference was my host was Webfaction while his was Digital Ocean, which did cause me a bit of trouble when I was trying to set up a Github webhook to automatically deploy on every push. It turns out Webfaction doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow me to set an env variable in .htaccess to be read by the PHP script (as was in the blog post linked above). It took me a while to figure out this was the issue, so I just gave up on the Github webhook for now and just set a cron job to periodically pull and redeploy the site. I needed the cron job anyway, if I wanted to support future publishing and possibly some form of queueing later on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"comments\"\u003eComments\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLegacy comments from WP are imported directly into the markdown of each page.

I\u0026rsquo;ll probably be cleaning up the exported older posts every so often because I\u0026rsquo;m OC that well. The theming/templating turned out to be a bit more complicated than I expected, but I think it was easier to manage than Wordpress. The last time I tried to use a custom blog engine, I got tired of maintaining and upating it so I switched back to Wordpress, hopefully that doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen here.

I remember I bought the game for Steam on launch day. I finally \u0026ldquo;finished\u0026rdquo; it after 350 hours of gameplay and seven years real-time. \u0026ldquo;Finished\u0026rdquo; in this case means \u0026ldquo;achievement complete\u0026rdquo;, not just \u0026ldquo;main quest complete\u0026rdquo;, because as any Bethesda gamer knows, that’s not how their RPGs roll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had been looking forward to this game because I had previously enjoyed both ES4: Oblivion and Fallout 3 on PS3 and had also just finished Fallout: New Vegas on Steam and was open to more open-world exploration. I remember being tempted by the badass collector’s edition Alduin statue too but opted out due to price and the fact that it was huge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first character was a male Nord named Hunter. I actually managed to finish the main quest a bit more than a month after getting the game (fairly fast!). I used that first character to complete all the guild quests \u0026ndash; Companions, Mage’s Guild, Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood. Afterwards I immersed myself with the open world and toyed around with mods for a bit. I played it on and off again for a few years, and buying the DLC expansions (Hearthfire, Dawnguard and Dragonborn) eventually when they were on sale. I started a few other runs but never got far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2016, I started my final run \u0026ndash; the character that I would be able to bring to \u0026ldquo;achievement completion\u0026rdquo; including all DLCs. This final character was Arche, an Imperial (named after the Tales of Phantasia character).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#1b033aa856422de0367794d936365c4d-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2018/11/late-game-review-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/2%20-%200mR5pvs_hu199fdb365079d28ca2b0d5d133f8063f_273613_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"My final armor set was the Deathbrand from the Dragonborn expansion since I was trying to level up Light Armor.\" title=\"My final armor set was the Deathbrand from the Dragonborn expansion since I was trying to level up Light Armor.\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003eMy final armor set was the Deathbrand from the Dragonborn expansion since I was trying to level up Light Armor.

It’s been available for a while and been ported to every platform imaginable (it even got a new console release this year!), so there’s not much point talking about the features and whatnot. There are some other things I’d like to cover though:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLevelling Up and Legendary Dragons\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last achievement I got was the one for killing a legendary dragon, which took me forever. The first issue was that legendary dragon’s don’t spawn unless you’re already level 78. In my 2nd run, I finished the Dawnguard and Dragonborn content and all other achievements by around level 50, and it was a grind to get to level 78 througn conventional means. I didn’t want to do any console cheats to get to 78, so I tried to look for faster ways to level up. There’s a bunch of suggestions on the internet, but here are the best ones:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTelekinesis \u0026ndash; with enchantments to reduce MP cost, you can use Telekinesis to quickly level up Alteration, simply by levitating an object in front of you until you run out of magic, then you just rest and repeat. This method was still fairly slow for me though and more importantly it was really boring. I read some posts saying you could speed up this process by levitating an object then doing fast travel to a far location so that the game thinks you were using Telekinesis during the entire trip, but I could never get this to work and that feels a bit too exploit-y for me.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGiant blocking \u0026ndash; basically go find a camp with high level giants, then keep blocking their attacks with your shield, healing when necessary. The advantage of this is that it increases multiple skills \u0026ndash; Block, Restoration and Light/Heavy Armor (depending on what you’re wearing). However, it wasn’t much faster than the Telekinesis method and it was also quite tedious and if you weren’t careful, you could die.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFinally, I came upon, in my opinion, the single fastest way to level up in Skyrim: the Illusion mastery spell Harmony. You can use Muffle to level up your Illusion until you learn Harmony, but once you have Harmony, things go into overdrive. You simply go into the middle of Whiterun (near the plaza is fine, or that big tree in the middle section) and cast Harmony. The spell has a very, very wide AOE so it affects almost all citizens, gaining you ridiculous amounts of Illusions skill levels. A single casting can earn you as much as 50+ Illusion levels. This method is quick, safe, easy, and I wish I had discovered it earlier. As it is, it took me from 68 to 81 in around an hour.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter getting to Level 81, the next problem was actually finding a Legendary Dragon to fight. Supposedly there was one that always spawns at Arcwind Point, but I never got one to spawn there, even after clearing my mods. I tried fast-travelling across dragon burial grounds for a while with no luck. Eventually I managed to randomly find a Legendary Dragon while wandering near Dragon Bridge (that’s where my last save is!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMods\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a *lot* of mods installed, mostly additional gameplay/quests, additional items added to the game world, convenience mods (adding map markers etc), or stuff to improve the ambience. I’m not much for stuff like graphics improvements or silly mods that add Thomas the Tank Engine or Macho Man dragons. I did have this mod that added Star Wars lightsabers to the game that I wanted to get rid of but I had so many mods installed I always gave up trying to find it on the list. The best mods I used throughout my 350 hours were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70219/\"\u003eForgotten City\u003c/a\u003e \u0026ndash; this mods add a self-contained quest that involves time travel, groundhog day-style time loops, multiple paths to resolution and investigating a mystery. It was so good it got turned into its own \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/874260/The_Forgotten_City/\"\u003estandalone game\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=720815421\"\u003eStan Bush combat music\u003c/a\u003e \u0026ndash; basically replaces Skyrim’s combat music Stan Bush’s songs \u0026ldquo;The Touch\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Dare\u0026rdquo; from \u003cem\u003eTransformers The Movie,\u003c/em\u003e giving you a quick adrenaline boost when combat starts. I didn’t actually notice that Skyrim had separate combat music before I installed this mod!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThat’s it, out of literally two hundred mods only two stood out for me lol.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWishlist for Elder Scrolls 6 (or things I wish they had done in Skyrim)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMake the shovel useful \u0026ndash; it’s weird that there’s a shovel object in the game but it’s not really used for anything, not even as a weapon (I’m sure there’s mods that do that), but I was thinking stuff like buried treasure quests could require you to have a shovel to dig up chests or maybe you can randomly dig in the dirt and hope for goodies (one of the Zelda games did this AFAICR)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMountain climbing \u0026ndash; okay, this wish is straight from Breath of the Wild. One of the best things about BOTW was the ability to climb anywhere, a refreshing addition to an open world overworld after Skyrim’s \u0026ldquo;How the heck do I get to the top of this mountain\u0026rdquo; challenge.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMore immersion in the Hearthfire DLC \u0026ndash; don’t get me wrong, I liked the Hearthfire DLC, it added a nice opportunity for role-playing with the chance to get married and adopt kids, makes for some nice stories and \u003ca href=\"https://tumblr.roytang.net/post/174535189435/playing-skyrim-i-have-my-wife-aela-and-adopted\"\u003efun moments like this\u003c/a\u003e. After a while everything falls into a rut though, it would have been nice if they had expanded the Hearthfire content with some additional radiant quests. Some random ideas: Your wife or one of your kids goes missing, you have to find her; bandits threaten your house and you and your family have to defend it; you gave one of your kids two many daggers and now he accidentally stabbed one of his friends; your entire house has vanished along with your family! It has been teleported somewhere!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eActually just more radiant quests in general would have been nice for a bit more variance (I’m not sure if I will ever be satisfied). I think there’s already mods that do this, but I never tried them out.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe ability to take over a fort after you clear it. Skyrim has a lot of small forts or buildings held by bandits or whatever, it would have been a nice alternative to buying a house, after you clear a bandit the Jarl of the containing hold offers you a chance to buy/earn the title for the hold. Once you own a hold, whenever you recruit new followers you can choose to send them to the hold instead of following you around, and same as the house you could build improvements like a smith, stables, etc, and earn money from shops maybe?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also have the Legendary Edition on Steam (free upgrade since I had the DLCs), but I don’t think I have the patience to go through the entire game again. The size of the game and the excellent mod community mean one could very well play Skyrim forever, especially since Bethesda tells us \u003ca href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-elder-scrolls-6/elder-scrolls-6-next-console-generation\"\u003eThe Elder Scrolls 6 is still a ways away\u003c/a\u003e. Unfortunately, there are still a lot of other games to play, and now I’m finally able to uninstall Skyrim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAttached to this post are a dump of my Steam screenshots folder. (These used to be embedded via an \u003ca href=\"//imgur.com/a/ZWNxtnz\"\u003eImgur album\u003c/a\u003e, but I edited the post on 2020-Sep to embed them here instead, for reasons.)\u003c/p\u003e\n",
