            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt my old job I used to have this group of coworkers I had Friday lunch outs with. Inevitably, every Friday around noon someone would message the others asking \u0026ldquo;where are we eating?\u0026rdquo;. Now, there are a lot of good places to eat around the area and we\u0026rsquo;ve all been working there a while so most of the time we don\u0026rsquo;t care where we eat and we\u0026rsquo;d say we\u0026rsquo;ll decide when we get to the elevators. We get to the elevators but we\u0026rsquo;re still not sure where to eat. So we take the elevators down and we\u0026rsquo;ll figure it out downstairs. What often happened is that we ended up walking around, wasting time and eventually just choosing a place at random. It was a weird sort of decision-making.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecision making can be tough, especially for big, complicated decisions that need to be evaluated on multiple axes. Buying a house, choosing a new job, and yes, even where to have lunch, these are all examples of possibly tough decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, you are able to put forth a set of requirements for your decisions and then you check which among the available options best fulfills the requirements. Sometimes that approach is insufficient. It can be because you are lacking information or have too much information or have too many choices or none of the choices are acceptable or you are unable to properly evaluate the trade-offs between different criteria, or maybe even that your subconscious has a set of \u0026ldquo;secret\u0026rdquo; requirements that you are unable to formalize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome notes I\u0026rsquo;ve kept on decision-making:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSpending too much time on decision-making is a cost. Be aware if there is a time limit to your decision making.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFor most things, decision-making should be quick and easy. Minimize decision making for unimportant (read: low cost or low impact) stuff. For example, remembering passwords. Either use an app or a scheme so that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to decide or try to remember what the password for each site is. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t sweat the small stuff.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s okay to use your guts or emotions to make an initial decision, then validate if it\u0026rsquo;s okay using more empirical criteria. If your emotions don\u0026rsquo;t lead anywhere, measure and use data, pros/cons to determine best course of action\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUnderstand the difference between an acceptable choice and the best choice. It may be easier to settle merely for a choice which is acceptable rather than spending extra time to try to find the best choice.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eNot making a choice is also a choice. Sometimes not all the choices will satisfy your standard or requirements. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget that abstaining or deciding not to do anything can also be a valid choice.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf you’re having trouble choosing between some options, that means they are mostly within an acceptable range for you (if any of the options was flat out unacceptable you would have rejected them on the spot). In that case, just choose one at random (literally roll a dice if you can’t decide) and go. If it turns out later that it wasn’t the best choice, figure out if there was any information that would have helped you, take note of it for next time.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBe careful when making big purchases. Even if you have already made a decision, you may want to delay it a bit for really big amounts to give your subconscious some time to ponder it. (This is really more about money management than decision making\u0026hellip;  but I had it in this list so here you go)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eIn moments of self-doubt, ask other people for advise. It can be friends and family or even random strangers on the internet.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack to the lunch out story. Some years later, a different lunch group (that I was occasionally a part of) thought of a better approach: they set up an automated email that got sent out to the members around 11:30am. The program would choose at random one of the nearby places to eat, making the decision for the group. If anyone objected to the randomly selected choice, they bore the responsibility for providing the new choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife is too short to waste on poor decision making.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e― Sun Tzu, The Art of War\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was reading a forum thread recently about learning competitive Street Fighter. The poster was using a particular character (his \u0026ldquo;main\u0026rdquo;) and asking how he could learn to counter the attack strings of other characters. The answers from more experienced players were pretty much what I would have expected: you had to dedicate specific time and effort to each matchup you wanted to study. That meant going into training mode, looking at the opposing character\u0026rsquo;s attack strings and seeing where he could interrupt them or the proper way to answer them. It meant a lot of hard work too, since fighting games typically have a lot of characters. So reaching the top tiers meant understanding each opposing character in and out, knowing their strengths and weaknesses and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think it not only applies to competition, but also to any scenario where there is an opposing party or point of view. In order to make any progress or improvement, it is necessary to understand where the other side is coming from and study their motivations. Sadly, in online debates it often turns into the equivalent of a shouting match where everyone just screams out their POV hoping to brute force their opponent into some kind of \u0026ldquo;submission\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack to Street Fighter: When picking up a new fighting game, I typically try to sample all the available characters until I find one whose fighting style I like and am comfortable playing as \u0026ldquo;main\u0026rdquo; (hint: it\u0026rsquo;s often Ryu lol).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the same way, in any online discussion it\u0026rsquo;s important to expose yourself to a variety of opinions, and not limit your discussions only to people with similar views. Political discussion online can get toxic so it becomes tempting to block out those views that you disagree with, but this tends to create an echo chamber effect. It\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to keep a healthy amount of opposing views on your feeds. Although where you draw the line is of course your own decision; Personally I try to avoid blocking any friends and have not yet had occasion to do so, although I do block any sites that tend to promote misinformation or stuff like racism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike competition, the goal of an online discussion (especially for sensitive topics like politics) isn\u0026rsquo;t really winning. Discussion should lead to some sort of progress or learning, or in the worst case, \u0026ldquo;agreeing to disagree\u0026rdquo;. But regardless of the outcome, understanding opposing points of view should give you valuable insights into your own views, and maybe even convince you to reconsider them.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
