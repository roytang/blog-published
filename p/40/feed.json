            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAs I\u0026rsquo;m writing this, I\u0026rsquo;ve been grinding \u003ca href=\"/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/\"\u003eEternal\u003c/a\u003e\u0026rsquo;s ranked ladder, trying to beat the end-of-month ladder reset and hoping to make Master rank again. Since this morning, I\u0026rsquo;ve been moving up and down the threshold of the Diamond I, the rank just below Master, hence frustratingly there has been little progress, less than 24 hours before the ladder reset. I usually do manage to hit Master rank a bit earlier than this, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been a bit busier this month for some reason, so my daily Eternal grinding had been reduced to the token one win per day. I decided to step away from the game for a while and instead write the next day\u0026rsquo;s blog post (this one, obv).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrinding ranked ladders can be a bitch. You basically need to be able to get into a long win streak or have a burst of short win streaks, enough to push you over the next threshold. On average, even good players will win only a bit more than half the time in any decent ranked ladder (since presumably you are matched close to people of your own skill level), so such streaks can sometimes be frustratingly hard to come by. Ranked ladders do reflect one\u0026rsquo;s play skill, at least as long as you are at a rank where you have a significant skill advantage. Once the skill gap narrows, there comes into play a significant element of getting lucky due to win streaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy earliest experience with ranked ladders was Warcraft III back in the early 2000s, but I don\u0026rsquo;t remember taking the ladder there too seriously. Maybe because back then they didn\u0026rsquo;t have the concept of ladder rewards - end of season rewards based on where you finished for that season. They didn\u0026rsquo;t have the whole lootbox/cosmetics/collectibles economic model for online games back then, so there weren\u0026rsquo;t really much rewards to be given out. These days I still have the RTS ranked ladder option via Starcraft II, but somehow online Starcraft is much more stressful for me now and I\u0026rsquo;m getting on with the years, so most likely my ranked ladder grinding will be focused on the less dexterity-reliant genres like CCGs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from Eternal, the only other game I regularly play ranked on these days is \u003ca href=\"/2018/12/mtg-arena/\"\u003eMagic Arena\u003c/a\u003e. Eternal is the one I\u0026rsquo;m currently grinding to Master every month though, as the Arena ladder feels a lot harder to climb. That may change in succeeding months with Wizards\u0026rsquo; recent eSports push, as doing well on the Arena ladder may give a path towards playing in high-level tournaments. Of course, I may also consider cutting down to one regular CCG instead of two, as the ladder grinding can be time-consuming on some days. In such an event, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry Eternal, but Magic is my first love among CCGs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully by the time this post goes up tomorrow I\u0026rsquo;ll have managed to hit my Masters rank target in Eternal. I am of course aware that this grinding is totally unnecessary - there is no significant life penalty if I don\u0026rsquo;t make Masters this month. At worst I miss out on a premium legendary which I don\u0026rsquo;t really need. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m really just grinding to Masters out of habit. It should be okay, as long as I don\u0026rsquo;t stress out over it too much though.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It\u0026rsquo;s basically \u003cem\u003eStar Trek\u003c/em\u003e for a newer generation, but with a different (and sometimes more interesting) mythos and history and so on.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eFor my first few years in elementary school, I didn\u0026rsquo;t get any pocket money. Instead I\u0026rsquo;d have a couple of sandwiches and a thermos of water. So I wasn\u0026rsquo;t used to handling money. One time while waiting for the school bus, I was a bit thirsty but my thermos was already out. For some reason, I decided to borrow five pesos from a classmate to buy a coke from the canteen. This gave me a bit anxiety on the ride home. It meant I had to ask my parents for money so I can pay back the guy! I had never asked for money before. I didn\u0026rsquo;t mention it when I got home. The next day, the guy asks to be paid back, and I put him off til the next day. This went on for a couple of days until I got the nerve to ask my parents for money and it turned out to be no big deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered this today because I was wondering why now as an adult I\u0026rsquo;m extremely averse to debt. This incident isn\u0026rsquo;t probably all there is to it, but it was the earliest and only time I can ever remember being in debt. I dislike owing other people, whether it be money or other things. I try avoid borrowing money as much as possible, and even when I end up having to (usually due to something silly like forgetting my wallet or something), I\u0026rsquo;ll pay it back as soon as possible. I don\u0026rsquo;t take out loans to make large purchases, I wait until I have enough money available for all of it. I use credit cards, but only for convenience. I pay off each bill in full immediately so I don\u0026rsquo;t accrue debt and/or interest. If I buy something on installment, in my head and in my accounting that is money already spent in full. To this day, I am primarily a creditor, not a debtor. I am the one other people owe money to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand that debt can be a powerful instrument for things like investments and businesses as such, but I just dislike the idea of it. This might be one of the reasons why I can\u0026rsquo;t be an entrepreneur - I would be very averse to for example taking out a loan to fund a business. In spite of that, I think it\u0026rsquo;s a net positive overall. (Although certainly, I can say this because I enjoy a certain level of privilege in life.)\u003c/p\u003e\n",

That kind of stuff. Really, if you can demonstrate that you really worked on a project (and not just coasted by on teammates help etc), you\u0026rsquo;re already an above average interview.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntry-level candidates might have more trouble since they often won\u0026rsquo;t have a portfolio, but the quality of candidates is a bit low locally, so if you can demonstrably do simple stuff like loops, recursion, stacks, etc you\u0026rsquo;re probably already an above average interview. Bigger companies will have written exams to filter out peeps who can\u0026rsquo;t do that though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore random technical interviewing tips, even though you didn\u0026rsquo;t ask for that: being able to communicate well is a big plus, mandatory even. Lack of confidence makes the interviewer worry that you don\u0026rsquo;t really know what you\u0026rsquo;re talking about. Sometimes I\u0026rsquo;ll slip in something I know to be wrong \u0026ldquo;Diba pag cinall mo yan, ganito mangyayari?\u0026rdquo;, and see how the candidate reacts\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/arsxjg/afternoon_random_discussion_feb_18_2019/egpp2yr/\"\u003eveeequalseyeare\u003c/a\u003e: How many years of experience do you have? And what\u0026rsquo;s your basic salary?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do people keep asking about salary? That\u0026rsquo;s not really a programming or software dev question. I am a freelancing consultant at the moment, so I can\u0026rsquo;t really give a simple answer to that anyway (it\u0026rsquo;s almost always \u0026ldquo;it depends\u0026rdquo;)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will answer the experience one - 15ish years in the industry (yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m old).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit: Also, there is a high range in the salaries of software devs in this country (not sure if the same elsewhere, probably), because:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esome people are better at selling themselves than others\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esome devs are way better than others (and thus are more valuable)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eeach dev\u0026rsquo;s career path and growth is often unique, so it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to compare, especially once you rack up some years of experience\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ei.e. for a given number of years of experience, the salary band will be quite wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get that when you\u0026rsquo;re starting out, salary is a big deal, but honestly if you\u0026rsquo;re a decent enough programmer, you can get into any place with above average salary. You can grow your salary a bit faster by hopping jobs every so often, but too many hops looks bad on a resume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, my advice is that once you get to a decent salary range that is good for you (i.e. you\u0026rsquo;re not starving), focus less on comparing yourself to other people, and more on increasing your own value and managing your work/life balance. Money isn\u0026rsquo;t everything, beyond basic survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/arsxjg/afternoon_random_discussion_feb_18_2019/egpqfdb/\"\u003egetmeoutofherealive\u003c/a\u003e: Anong advice ang maibibigay mo kapag gusto magcareer shift? Ex: IT Support to Development/Programming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShifting careers from IT support isn\u0026rsquo;t an unreasonable proposition, but you need to already know your stuff before going in for interviews. You will also still need some basic level of programming knowledge. A lot of things you\u0026rsquo;ll need can be learned on the fly/on the job (like usage of specific languages or tools or libraries), but you need a good basic foundation to build on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I\u0026rsquo;m interviewing someone coming from a nonprogrammming background, I\u0026rsquo;ll basically be treating her as an entry-level candidate. You will need to be able to justify why I should hire you over say, a fresh grad who still remembers his java programming from his college days. The interviewer will need to know you\u0026rsquo;re not trying to BS your way into the position. Having some work you can show off (side projects or whatever) can be a big help. You can also cite anything you\u0026rsquo;re doing in your current domain that might show off some related skillset. Like, if you did some minor scripting to gather support statistics, something like that? IDK if IT support people do that kind of stuff. See my other interview tips in the other answer elsewhere in this thread too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/arsxjg/afternoon_random_discussion_feb_18_2019/egpquyz/\"\u003ecaptainph\u003c/a\u003e: web services in web development, ELI5 please\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait, what do you mean? Web services are like web pages, except they\u0026rsquo;re endpoints that usually do only one thing and return some machine readable format like JSON or XML instead of HTML that can be rendered and viewed by a human in a browser. Basically you send them an HTTP request and they maybe do some processing and spit back an HTTP response that you consume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome types are simpler than others - REST-based web services are usually very simple for example, and can sometimes be invoked directly via the browser address bar. Some follow more complicated protocols (SOAP) that support things like authentication and signing and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeb services are developed the same way as normal web pages, with the usual backend processing and stuff (but there are some frameworks to make this easier, especially for complicated protocols like SOAP), but the client program (the one calling the web services) does not have to be another web application. It can be a mobile app for example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the typical usages would be third-party integration. For example, Philhealth I believe currently has some kind of e-Claims web services in development (maybe? IDK the current status), where the idea is to allow third-party systems to submit Philhealth claims electronically. The idea is that individual hospitals have their own medical records systems, those systems can send HTTP requests to the e-claims web services in order to for example check whether a patient is eligible for a claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOk, sorry I know that explanation doesn\u0026rsquo;t really work for a 5-year old lol\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/arsxjg/afternoon_random_discussion_feb_18_2019/egptmll/\"\u003eacequeen21\u003c/a\u003e: Do you have plans going abroad? Either work temporarily or move permanently. Why or why not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNah, I like living here, in spite of everything, and I\u0026rsquo;m programming avails me a good living naman. I\u0026rsquo;ve worked abroad on short stints (pinadala ng company), but TBH, I had never even considered leaving the country long-term, but I started looking into it after 2016.

The main problem right now is my RSS feeds - I follow some feeds that simply have too much content, and this means I accumulate a significantly high unread count in the app, which gives me some anxiety. While those feeds have the occasional interesting post or article I want to read, the sheer number of posts means the signal-to-noise ratio is very low for those channels. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to cut the most prolific offenders and see if the content I would\u0026rsquo;ve gotten from there would surface some other way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do still like those channels, so I\u0026rsquo;ll also promote them a bit:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\"\u003eHacker News\u003c/a\u003e - there is a lot of high quality content here, and many of them won\u0026rsquo;t surface through other channels. But there are \u003cem\u003ea lot\u003c/em\u003e of posts, so the volume is still difficult to keep up with. I\u0026rsquo;ve instead moved them to a Flipboard section, and just check out that section from time to time.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://dev.to/\"\u003eDev.to\u003c/a\u003e - less tech industry and more programming-related posts, many of them beginner-oriented so not really for me. There is the occasional gem, but the S/N ratio is worse than HN by far. It would be great to read all that content if your goal was to know everything in all areas of software development, but anyone who\u0026rsquo;s spent any nontrivial amount of time in the industry knows that\u0026rsquo;s a fool\u0026rsquo;s errand. I also follow them \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev\"\u003eon Twitter\u003c/a\u003e, so maybe that\u0026rsquo;s enough instead of the RSS feed. They also have a weekly \u0026ldquo;most popular posts\u0026rdquo; post, I might look into whether I can somehow subscribe to only those posts and see if that\u0026rsquo;s sufficient\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://slashdot.org/\"\u003eSlashdot\u003c/a\u003e - one of the oldest tech news blogs around, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been following them on and off for years. The content I get from their feed has a lot of overlap with Hacker News and the tech section on Flipboard, but occasionally they have an interesting post that none of my other sources provide. The volume of posts isn\u0026rsquo;t as high as the previous two, but the S/N ratio is worse. I\u0026rsquo;ll try living without them for a while.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote that a feed having a low S/N ratio is in no way a condemnation of their content. It\u0026rsquo;s just that not all content is good for everybody, and hence some feeds are better for some people than others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this applies to social media too of course. I try to unfollow ruthlessly. On Facebook, which I mostly restrict to friends and family, I unfollow anyone who posts content I dislike (conspiracy theories, chain messages, \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rsquo;s see who will read this\u0026rdquo;, inspirational messages, etc) and generally favor anyone who posts puns lol (I find the overlap between those two sets is low). Anyway, they\u0026rsquo;re still \u0026ldquo;friends\u0026rdquo; on Facebook, so they can still message me and stuff. On Twitter, every so often I\u0026rsquo;ll unfollow a bunch and follow some other set, change it up a bit. You need to adjust your feeds when it feels like you\u0026rsquo;re seeing too much of one type of content or too much you dislike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be great to have some sort of machine learning that I can teach as to which kinds of posts I prefer and which ones I want to ignore. Supposedly, social media\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;algorithmic timelines\u0026rdquo; are supposed to improve the S/N ratio of your feeds, but my problem with those is that items aren\u0026rsquo;t being displayed chronologically, which makes a feed work. Maybe I should write my own feed reader! (Not the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve had this thought!)\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "There\u0026rsquo;s a significant risk of information overload nowadays. For someone like me who spends a lot of time on the internet, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of feeds I follow. Not just social media like Facebook and Twitter, I also follow a set of RSS Feeds via Inoreader, I\u0026rsquo;ve signed up for a few newsletters, and on weekends I read through several Flipboard categories. Just another symptom of my tendency to want everything I guess.",
