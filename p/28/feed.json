(Not gonna link to the original thread because it might seem like I\u0026rsquo;m shaming the OP.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that there\u0026rsquo;s anything bad with such \u0026ldquo;garage sale finds\u0026rdquo;, as it were. These things are posted every so often on subreddits especially those dedicated to some sort of collectible. I mentioned that while I would be very excited to find something like this in the wild, I might have an attack of conscience because I\u0026rsquo;m potentially cheating someone out of fair market value and taking advantage of their ignorance. I\u0026rsquo;m probably more likely to feel this way if I was dealing with a seller personally (like at a garage sale), rather than some entity indirectly (like at a big store for example).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously, my ethical dilemma is only for the scenario where there is an information imbalance - where I as the buyer have information about the product\u0026rsquo;s fair market value that the seller is not aware of. If the seller knew full well the actual value of what he\u0026rsquo;s selling and he still sells at that price, then I will gladly buy it cheap with no concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"this-is-why-im-not-a-salesman\"\u003eThis is why I\u0026rsquo;m not a salesman\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn such a case, the way to assuage my ethical concerns would be to bring up the possible imbalance. Something along the lines of \u0026ldquo;I think you\u0026rsquo;re selling this for much less than what it\u0026rsquo;s worth!\u0026rdquo;, and if he nods and still wants to sell at that price anyway, then both of you complete the transaction happily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriend O commented:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think people have a kind of \u0026ldquo;code of ethics\u0026rdquo; that applies to marketplaces\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat\u0026rsquo;s a bit different from everyday ethics\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust like how doctors/lawyers/priests have a code of ethics specific to their contexts\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe idea is that participants in the marketplace should assume that everyone else is doing their due dilligence when it comes to price/quality research\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I guess I can satisfy my concerns as well by telling myself that \u0026ldquo;Caveat Emptor\u0026rdquo; applies in the opposite direction as well, so \u0026ldquo;Caveat Venditor\u0026rdquo;?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"hold-yourself-to-a-higher-standard\"\u003eHold yourself to a higher standard\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am only presenting an ethical dilemma here as it applies to myself when I am the buyer in the above scenario, or otherwise the one with information advantage in the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have been on the receiving end of bad trades before of course, numerous times. Such often happens when I foolishly decide to participate in a transaction without doing the necessary research, so I guess Caveat Venditor is accurate. I don\u0026rsquo;t lay blame on the other party for taking advantage of my ignorance either; after a bad trade I will most likely blame myself. Therefore, I don\u0026rsquo;t expect other people I am transacting with to treat me as fairly as I want to treat other people should I have the advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriend J pointed out that holding myself to a higher standard like this can be considered a bit elitist since it\u0026rsquo;s like considering yourself \u0026ldquo;better\u0026rdquo; than others. I think of it more like managing expectations of other people. Other people don\u0026rsquo;t have the same life experiences and values as I do, so some things are more important for me than for them. I would of course love it if everyone was conditioned to treat everyone else fairly in this manner - society would be much the better for it, but I understand the reality of human wants and needs enough to know that\u0026rsquo;s a pipe dream at best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"all-in-theory\"\u003eAll in theory\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, all of this is untested, because I haven\u0026rsquo;t been lucky enough to find a deal like I originally described. Maybe when I\u0026rsquo;m there at that point in time all my ethical questions give way to impulse or greed and I\u0026rsquo;m already at home gleefully counting my winnings before the dilemma comes to mind. But I like to think thought experiments like these help to flesh out one\u0026rsquo;s thought processes so that when the time comes, one is more likely to behave appropriately.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Other people can see and bear witness to your life, but they only see a sliver, a fraction of what it is to be you, and only what you choose to let them see. How other people experience you varies for each group. You have your set of high school friends, who know of your early days of hijinks, your work friends who know how you react to stress and how you unwind, your relatives who know how you are during the holidays in the face of family turmoil, and so on. None of them know the real you, not completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"true-heart\"\u003eTrue Heart\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can\u0026rsquo;t be helped that the \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; version of each person is known only to that person alone. No one else lives the same life exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsider myself. I write a lot about what\u0026rsquo;s going on in my life, whether through social media or through this blog. I strive to be open and honest and true in my dealings with other people, and I am almost always willing to offer up my thoughts without filter, if asked. But despite that, the picture I present to the world is still always incomplete. There are things I omit and things I hold back and things I don\u0026rsquo;t like to talk about. It\u0026rsquo;s something I have since learned to respect in other people as well, despite my inquisitive nature: to hold back when they obviously don\u0026rsquo;t want to talk about something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Don\u0026rsquo;t worry I haven\u0026rsquo;t secretly committed any heinous crimes.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"public-facing\"\u003ePublic-facing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was reminded of this quote only because I was reading some discussion about private content on the internet. In general, if I post something on the internet, I don\u0026rsquo;t expect it to be private, not completely. Otherwise, why post it on the internet at all? Anything on the internet has the chance to be exposed later, one way or another, and we should be careful accordingly. And \u0026ldquo;on the internet\u0026rdquo; here isn\u0026rsquo;t even limited to websites and blogs and social media. \u0026ldquo;Private\u0026rdquo; communications are a weak point too, as anyone can capture a screenshot anytime. If you want to keep secrets, then don\u0026rsquo;t put them on a network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree can keep a secret if two of them are dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"black-mirror\"\u003eBlack Mirror\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a Black Mirror episode where the personality of a human who passed away is recreated based on his social media postings and what not. Because of the nature of humans, I don\u0026rsquo;t believe this process can ever be 100% accurate. What you will get is a shadow of the original human, an approximation of who he chose to present himself as. His true self will have been forever lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Now that Gitlab and Github both offer unlimited private repos, there\u0026rsquo;s no reason to stick with Bitbucket either. I had already migrated most of my private Git repos to Gitlab before, but hadn\u0026rsquo;t realized until now that I also had a couple of Mercurial repos there that needed to be migrated as well.

I went in blind, not knowing anything, since mysteriously no one on Reddit could explain what makes the game good. This is understandably so as any sort of information kind of spoils the story for you. As such, consider yourself warned that this review might be considered spoiler-y. Overall if you like story-based games, just go ahead and play this one, then come back here to read the review if you\u0026rsquo;d like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"1-narratives\"\u003e1 Narratives\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat Remains of Edith Finch\u003c/em\u003e is a first-person exploration game. The gameplay is largely focused around the story and advancing the narrative. The story revolves around the Finch family and their so-called \u0026ldquo;curse\u0026rdquo; which causes many of the family members to die of unusual causes. You spend the game exploring the now-abandoned Finch family house where five generations of Finches have lived since coming to America. As you explore the house you come across shrines for each deceased Finch family member, and each one takes you into a different scenario narrating their individual stories. Each family member\u0026rsquo;s story is told in a different manner: there\u0026rsquo;s one told as if it were a comic book, one told from the point of view of a baby in a bathtub, several are seen through the lens of a child\u0026rsquo;s imagination, and so on. The presentation of the substories and the main story exploring the house is very clever, with the actual text of the narratives often appearing throughout the environment, guiding you where to go next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"2-gameplay\"\u003e2 Gameplay\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGameplay is primarily based on exploration and experimentation. In the main story you explore the house and unlock secret passages and crawl through tunnels and climb to the roof and so on. There are no failure states in the gameplay, you simply keep pushing forward. If you get stuck, you walk around until you figure out a way to advance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe individual substories are the same way, although many of them adjust the control schemes and expect you to experiment accordingly. As an example, in one of the substories you get to fly around as an owl, then later crawl around a cruise ship as some kind of tentacle monster. In another, you\u0026rsquo;re a baby in a bathtub imagining your toys coming to life. In yet another, you\u0026rsquo;re an assembly-line worker in a cannery dreaming of a fantasy world, and you must explore your fantasy world and slice off fishheads at the cannery at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe substories take place in their own little sandboxes, so to speak, and many of them seem like tech demos of cool things a developer would want to try like \u0026ldquo;Ooh, let\u0026rsquo;s make the player a shark on land and he has to fall into the ocean!\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s make a scenario where the player is just flying a kite!\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s not a proble, and it does create some interesting ways of presenting the narratives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this happens from the first person view, which was a bit problematic at times. Since I\u0026rsquo;m getting along with age, I\u0026rsquo;m not as good with first person gaming as I used to be, and playing with this view for an extended period of time can give me some dizziness. Luckily, the game was quite short, and I managed to finish it in two sittings. (Maybe 1.5 hours total)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"3-achievements\"\u003e3 Achievements?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI usually try to go for achievement completion before posting a review, especially for story-based games like this. But this time I didn\u0026rsquo;t bother. Most of the achievements are silly things that you can do during the exploration gameplay, like knocking all of the balls off a pool table. Most can be acquired after completing the game the first time, since that unlocks the ability to replay individual substories. But there was one achievement that required looking through every peephole/telescope in the game, and that seemed like I couldn\u0026rsquo;t do it without replaying everything from the beginning. That didn\u0026rsquo;t appeal to me because (a) I might get dizzy again; and (b) this is the sort of game where it\u0026rsquo;s best experienced the first time around, and successive playthroughs won\u0026rsquo;t be of much value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"4-overall\"\u003e4 Overall\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026hellip;I liked it, though not as much as say, Life is Strange. The exploration of the house is great and the all of the scenes and sandboxes are well set up and very detailed, although the overarching Finch family story is a thinly-veiled framing device to bring together the individual substories. The game is well worth the 1-2 hours to go through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eMy current desktop PC has been with me since late 2015, so going on 4 years now. I bought relatively high-end parts for it at the time, hoping to be a bit future-proof so that it would last me longer than previous desktops. So I was a bit worried when I started encountering issues during the recent weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s the timeline:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMay 2019, before my overseas trip. It happened a few times that the computer would completely shut down while I was playing \u003ca href=\"/2019/04/starcraft-2/\"\u003eStarcraft 2\u003c/a\u003e coop. The displays would go black, but they still had power, and for a little while the OS would keep going. I know this because I could still hear the game sounds for a bit. Eventually the PC would be inaccessible, even via network. Only choice would be to hard reset. It didn\u0026rsquo;t happen regularly enough for me to figure it out before we left for the 5 week trip.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eJuly 2019. After getting back from the trip, I encountered the Starcraft 2 issue again. Some reading indicated early concerns that SC2 may be killing video cards, but that was from 4 years ago! Besides, after my quick hard reboot, the GPU temp would be quite normal so I didn\u0026rsquo;t think that was the issue. The problem began to happen regularly, until I could not play SC2 at all. Eventually, a friend suggested I tried lowering SC2 graphics settings and surprisingly that worked! Things looked terrible, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t mind, and I could play again.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEVO weekend, Aug 3-4 2019.

At least my PC case is a lot more organized and spacious this time; my older PCs had super tight layouts that were hard to manipulate\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI started with the easy one: I moved my monitors to the onboard graphics card and enabled it in the BIOS. If the issue is the video card, then I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t encounter it while using the onboard graphics. Nope, had a crash less than an hour in.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNext we try the memory. I had two 8gb DDR3 ram sticks installed. I removed one of the sticks (pretty sure I could live on 8gb RAM tbh) and then rebooted and ran the memory diagnostics. Pass! I used the PC for one whole day with this config, even playing some SC2 and DBFZ and no issues were encountered. Things were looking up, it was likely there was a faulty memory stick!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe next day I decided to confirm it by swapping the memory sticks. Oops, now PC wouldn\u0026rsquo;t boot. Displays don\u0026rsquo;t get any signal, USB devices (mouse and keyboard unpowered). Is it because of the faulty memory stick? I swap back the \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; RAM, but still the same issue. I try a few other combinations, different RAM slots, but no such luck.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThis was last Monday (Quezon City holiday!). I concede defeat and acknowledge that this is beyond my power. I call up a nearby EasyPC branch and ask if they can take a look at it for me. I take a quick Grab there and the guy starts taking a look. He starts by pulling out the mem sticks and the vid card and cleaning out the connectors with an eraser. He pops out the CMOS battery to reset the board. He plugs them back in but the PC doesn\u0026rsquo;t boot. He tells me the motherboard is dead. He tries some thing with a jumper, and the MB comes back to life!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI have my full 16GB back. He tells me the memory problems were probably due to the dirty connectors and suggests I take the desktop back home to do an extended memory diagnostic. I agree, since I don\u0026rsquo;t want to leave it at the shop. I happily pay the repair fee plus a small tip and take another Grab back home. I was expecting that I would have to shell out for new memory sticks as the best case! The whole process took less than an hour. This is one of those examples where I was wasting too many man-hours trying to do something myself!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBack home, I run the standard Memory Diagnostic first and it passes! Hooray. I use the PC for a while, no issues. Before going to sleep, I start the extended Memory Diagnostic and left it running overnight. In the morning, it was still going around 10 hours after it started, at less than 80% of the first pass! I reduce the passes from 2 to 1, because to be honest I wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to wait another 10-12 hours for a second pass! Luckily, the test finished a couple of hours later without issues.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHooray! All is well! Generally, at least. It\u0026rsquo;s been 48 hours and no crashes or BSODs or such have been encountered. Gaming seems fine. There seems to be a minor problem of Windows Explorer randomly spiking in CPU usage every so often, but that\u0026rsquo;s probably some software issue I\u0026rsquo;ll have to figure out independently. In any case, the Great Memory Scare of 2019 was over, and I get to keep using this desktop, hopefully for a lot longer!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a bit amused at how sad I felt when I first realized there might be a hardware problem with the PC, especially since I was hoping it would last me for years down the line. I may be a bit too attached to it lol. Well, my desktop generally does give me joy, so I\u0026rsquo;m not Kondo-ing it anytime soon!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I bought relatively high-end parts for it at the time, hoping to be a bit future-proof so that it would last me longer than previous desktops.

When I think of the \u0026ldquo;good old days\u0026rdquo; of the internet I tend to harken back pre-social media to the heyday of blogging around 2005-2008 maybe? Those were times when instead of everybody holed up in social media silos, there were still a lot of people running independent websites and blogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommercialization and advertising pretty much ruined blogging too, well before the silos started consolidating people\u0026rsquo;s personal writings into their title-less posts and shares and retweets. When people caught on that you could run advertising on your blogs and earn money from increasing traffic, there began a trend of content writers who would write for money. Even now you can see job listings on sites like Upwork for people needed to write content for blogs, with the aim of earning money off advertising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ll be honest and tell you I thought about this myself, and added the Google Adsense to the blog back in the day. But that would never really have worked out for me, as to make money off blogging you have to find a niche and to focus on that topic and be writing about that constantly and be doing SEO and marketing to drive the traffic to you site. Being focused to one topic and marketing are kind of very off-brand for me. I like being able to write about whatever I want and whatever comes to mind. I did try spinning off some dedicated blogs at some point, for topics like for \u003ca href=\"http://royondjango.blogspot.com/\"\u003eDjango programming\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"/2007/09/roy-on-magic/\"\u003eMagic the Gathering\u003c/a\u003e, and I even made a \u003ca href=\"https://ireadcomicbooks.tumblr.com/\"\u003ecomic-book focused tumblr\u003c/a\u003e. The efforts never last too long. Like I said, focus doesn\u0026rsquo;t become me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSocial media killed blogging (or tried to anyway), but advertising ruined blogging in the same way it ruined social media. People thought they could earn money, so they changed what they posted to try to earn more views/followers/clicks. It became less about being genuine (if it ever was) and more about pandering to a wider audience and driving traffic. There was a rise in clickbait and polarizing headlines and replicating content from other sites. Things like truth or originality didn\u0026rsquo;t matter, clicks and views did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"2\"\u003e2\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not begrudging anyone their right to try to earn a living. I just wish the business model didn\u0026rsquo;t have to be so annoying lol. The advertising business model existed before the internet of course, and was good enough to drive \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; industries like radio and television. So when people wanted to start making money off the internet, it was easy to adopt the same model. People online were used to other people providing content for free after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat other business models could exist on the internet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s hiding content behind a paywall, which is the approach of newspapers like the New York Times or the Washington Post or sites like Medium. That kind of thing gets annoying too and commercialization can ruin the site as well. I recently read \u003ca href=\"https://blog.elementary.io/welcome-to-the-new-blog/\"\u003ethis writeup\u003c/a\u003e about how a company moved their blog away from Medium because it gradually became a worse proposition as they started to monetize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at free-to-play gaming, there\u0026rsquo;s one other model that I think could work: microtransactions. I mean something like cosmetics and content packs and making money off \u0026ldquo;whales\u0026rdquo;, the same way games like Hearthstone and Magic Arena does it. Magic Arena\u0026rsquo;s model doesn\u0026rsquo;t annoy me at all. I don\u0026rsquo;t play regularly enough to want to buy things and am content just being free-to-play. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop other people from making purchases for cosmetics and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough I realize I might not enjoy that world either. Imagine if Twitter or Instagram had cosmetic purchases where you could buy like stuff to decorate your profile page or custom frames for your posts or something like that. I think it would be a huge hit among some people, at the same time be really annoying for other people (people like me lol).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"3\"\u003e3\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess what I\u0026rsquo;m saying is: I wish we could live in an (online) world where people weren\u0026rsquo;t constantly trying to make money off each other. I realize that this comes from a position of privilege - of having enough so that I don\u0026rsquo;t need to be thinking about earning money all the time. I realize that\u0026rsquo;s not the world works and that commercialization is a sad reality that I have to live with, but a man can dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It often seems that it might be a waste of time to do something like this since you don\u0026rsquo;t know if the project will actually push through or maybe the client will want something else. To kind of hedge my bets a bit, I decided to take the opportunity to try out some new technologies so that no matter what I at least learned something from all of this.

There is a little bit of a learning curve when it comes to views and serializers, but for the most part it\u0026rsquo;s straightforward. I did enjoy how the framework has out of the box support for the most common REST API scenarios, and there are available backends for different authentication methods. I used JWT Authentication, which isn\u0026rsquo;t part of the library by default, but already had a pretty good implementation available elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePython Unit Testing\u003c/strong\u003e. I have dabbled \u003ca href=\"/2019/02/triviastorm-text-and-answer-parsing/\"\u003ea little bit with Django\u0026rsquo;s Unit Test framework before\u003c/a\u003e, but not having worked with any company that does TDD I\u0026rsquo;ve never tried doing it the \u0026ldquo;test first\u0026rdquo; way. For reference I used an online book: \u003ca href=\"https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/part1.harry.html\"\u003eTest Driven Development with DJango\u003c/a\u003e. I actually enjoyed the exercise, perhaps a little too much. My impression of TDD has always been that the value lies in how much courage it can give the developer - the courage to try new things without worrying about whether you have broken something that was working before. This support came in handy while I was trying to figure out some issues with DRF especially around permissions etc. Really helpful for backend APIs like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePython Social Auth\u003c/strong\u003e. The proof-of-concept needed some social media logins. I used \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-core\"\u003ePython Social Auth\u003c/a\u003e for this, really straightforward library with good documentation and supports a lot of backends. I ended up using Twitter and Github OAuth as those were the simplest to implement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVueJS\u003c/strong\u003e. The proof-of-concept needed to be a single-page app, so that meant a bunch of Javascript was needed. I willingly admit I\u0026rsquo;m still behind with the latest web frontend frameworks and trends. In my head I\u0026rsquo;m still living in a jQuery world. I dabbled a bit with React when trying out \u003ca href=\"/2019/07/upgrading-a-react-native-project/\"\u003eReact Native\u003c/a\u003e, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t fond of it. For this project I decided to use \u003ca href=\"https://vuejs.org\"\u003eVueJS\u003c/a\u003e since I had skimmed through their documentation before and things seemed cool. I used it mostly for the dynamic parts and the data binding. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get too far into using components, my VueJS app was a huge monolith, which is apparently is frowned upon when using these frameworks lol. (Someone familiar with VueJS who looked at the code said it was \u0026ldquo;very strange\u0026rdquo;). I have barely scratched the surface of this framework, I will probably need to build something a bit more involved with it to get a better grasp. I will say that I enjoyed the VueJS syntax/structure better than React.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoogle Maps API and Geocoding\u003c/strong\u003e. The miniproject had some components that required me to show stuff on a map and do some geocoding, so I had to set up the API for that. Google\u0026rsquo;s documentation is fairly good here. One thing I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect is that you need a Google Cloud account with a billing method in order to access the API. My understanding is I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be charged for anything since I was just using the free tier, I hope that was accurate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNightwatch e2e Testing\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;ve had some projects with end to end testing before, mostly via scripts or Selenium, but it\u0026rsquo;s my first time trying out one of these end to end testing frameworks by writing the scripts myself. I chose to go with Nightwatch, it was reasonably strightforward and worked on Mac and Windows. One thing I will note that initially gave me problems during set up is that using the ChromeDriver can be a bit finnicky on Windows. You have to specify the actual location of the executable in your nightwatch.json, like so: \u003ccode\u003e\u0026quot;server_path\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;node_modules/chromedriver/lib/chromedriver/chromedriver.exe\u0026quot;,\u003c/code\u003e instead of just the \u003ccode\u003enode_modules/.bin/chromedriver\u003c/code\u003e the documentation implies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all the mini-project didn\u0026rsquo;t take much work - maybe 2-3 mandays of effort at most, and I did learn a lot from it, so no matter the outcome it was already a win.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "I recently found myself doing a really small project as sort of a proof of concept/demo for a potential client. It often seems that it might be a waste of time to do something like this since you don\u0026rsquo;t know if the project will actually push through or maybe the client will want something else. To kind of hedge my bets a bit, I decided to take the opportunity to try out some new technologies so that no matter what I at least learned something from all of this.",

Spoilers, but the answer is that has never stopped me before!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn today\u0026rsquo;s installment of \u0026ldquo;I thought you were quitting paper Magic?\u0026rdquo;, I attended an MCQ yesterday for MC Richmond. The format was Modern constructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI initially wasn\u0026rsquo;t planning to play because (a) the entrance fee was kind of ridiculous; (b) modern is a bit of an unbalanced debacle right now because of Hogaak; and (c ) my one assembled Modern deck (Grixis Death Shadow) hasn\u0026rsquo;t been used since 2017, and was completely absent in the meta for the recent MC Barcelona. That being said, I was still considering it because in my head there\u0026rsquo;s always the fantasy of \u0026ldquo;Oh, I won the MCQ now I went to the MC and somehow I won too and now I\u0026rsquo;m on the gravy train.\u0026rdquo; Oh, and the Death\u0026rsquo;s Shadow discord convinced me this deck is still legit. (There\u0026rsquo;s a discord!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat helped in my decision to play was bringing the GDS deck to a Modern FNM a couple of weeks prior to the MCQ. Only three people joined up (including me) due to the heavy rains, but that was enough for a couple of matches and enough to remind me why I enjoy playing this style of deck so much. GDS plays out like a puzzle every turn, where you\u0026rsquo;re trying to find the right sequence of moves for your turn to optimize for your Death Shadows and also to stay alive. Granted that\u0026rsquo;s not unique to this deck, as that\u0026rsquo;s typical of Modern; that\u0026rsquo;s why I enjoy this format much more than Standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I decided to play the MCQ. With only an FNM as practice. Good luck to me, although I kind of already spoiled the outcome with the first line of this post.

For most other people, they will often have a pet modern deck and will prefer to stick with it rather than spend a ton of money to move to a different deck (which may even not exist in a couple of weeks!). That being said, my general plan for Hogaak decks was to avoid them (and I did that successfully!). This being Manila, I expect the metagame to lean a bit more towards aggro, burn and control.

Apparently Vengevine is an Elemental. Who knew! His deck also had Lightning Skelemental! I won game 1, then mulled to 5 in game 2 looking for the Leyline, promptly losing to his super aggro hand. Game 3 I mulled to 6, keeping a one-lander with no Leyline because I was unhappy with my mull to 5 in g2, and that didn\u0026rsquo;t turn out well either.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR2 2-1 WIN vs rg burn. Game one I kept a one-lander again and opened with double Street Wraith to look for a land (and failing to find one), before going fetch into shock into Thoughtseize into sadness at seeing Monastery Swiftspears in his hand. I quickly lost game 1 and boarded out many of my lifeloss cards. I stayed in control games 2 and 3 and won easily.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR3 1-2 LOSS vs uw control. Game one vs UW control is tough since I have so many dead cards (although Fatal Push on Colonnade is always fun), and I lose to a JTMS that has brainstormed too many times. Game two I hit him with four hand disruption spells before quick aggro with a Shadow and an Angler to win. Game three I do turn one Serum Visions drawing Thoughtseize, and he goes turn two Rest in Peace and I curse that Thoughtseize for being one turn too late. The game goes long and he throws a lot of removal at my creatures and manages to take out both of Lilianas that I snuck under his permission. I eventually run out of gas at six life just as he draws a Restoration Angel and I lose in the air.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR4 2-0 WIN vs whir. I got an early Shadow in game 1 and use Dismember to stop his Engineer from building an Ensnaring Bridge, then just protect the Shadow with Stubs for the win. Game two he\u0026rsquo;s stuck on two lands and a Mox Opal which I disable by using Inquisition and Kolaghan\u0026rsquo;s Command to get rid of his other artifacts.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR5 1-2 LOSS vs burn. The burn matchup is completely manageable despite how I joke all the time about helping the opponent out. The key is to keeping creatures off the enemy board, which is why we board in more removal. His build however had Bedlam Revelers, which was problematic for me as few of my spells could cleanly answer it (aside from Dismember, which I board out in the matchup). Game three went long and I managed to stablize at around 7 life, but he drew a Reveler before I could draw a threat to close the game.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eR6 0-2 LOSS vs tron. Okay, this one was against my teammate so we both knew what we were facing. We played seriously though (more or less), and I lost to his optimal Tron draws despite the disruption.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt X-4 there\u0026rsquo;s no chance of prizes so I dropped. My teammate winning round 6 was probably better anyway, since his deck had a better matchup against the field. He later went on to win the last 2 rounds, so our pool won some packs for the event despite how poorly I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the occasional imbalance, I love Modern as a constructed format. The power level is high, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of deck diversity, and most matchups are very skillful. It would be super easy to quit (paper) Magic if Standard was the only format you played - the yearly rotation times are natural quitting points after all. But Modern makes it more likely for me to keep playing constructed, even if only occasionally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSide note: someone called me out at the tournament yesterday with \u0026ldquo;Roy Tang! You\u0026rsquo;re still playing?\u0026rdquo; which is indicative of both how active I used to be (since people still recognize me) and also how inactive I am these days. I half-jokingly replied that I only play about once a year these days, but that\u0026rsquo;s not too far from the truth. A few weeks back, popular player Sam Black tweeted about \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SamuelHBlack/status/1154986279047696384\"\u003ehow he much he valued the in-person aspect and community of playing paper MTG and not so much the eSports/online/Arena/streaming side\u003c/a\u003e. For me it\u0026rsquo;s kind of the opposite; I don\u0026rsquo;t have any ill will towards the local community, a lot of them are fun to hang out with, but I believe that if I could play Magic 100% online for an affordable rate (i.e. on Arena, and if it had Modern), I would gladly do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing to tournaments is a pain and a hassle, given conditions in Metro Manila, and they take up far too much time. Then there\u0026rsquo;s all the logistic of putting together decks, trading and buying and selling individual cards, having to shuffle with my sweaty hands, having to be aware of whether your opponent is doing something shifty, etc, all of these things that I dislike about paper Magic go away if I\u0026rsquo;m playing Arena. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying I\u0026rsquo;m quitting paper Magic, I know better than to assume I can do that, especially given that Wizards just announced their new plans for profession play going forward, but I am looking forward to the day that Arena and paper have parity in the formats and opportunities they afford players.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "Should I still write tournament reports even though I did poorly? Spoilers, but the answer is that has never stopped me before!\nIn today\u0026rsquo;s installment of \u0026ldquo;I thought you were quitting paper Magic?\u0026rdquo;, I attended an MCQ yesterday for MC Richmond. The format was Modern constructed.\nI initially wasn\u0026rsquo;t planning to play because (a) the entrance fee was kind of ridiculous; (b) modern is a bit of an unbalanced debacle right now because of Hogaak; and (c ) my one assembled Modern deck (Grixis Death Shadow) hasn\u0026rsquo;t been used since 2017, and was completely absent in the meta for the recent MC Barcelona.",

Examples:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea wifi password\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAPI keys\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe url for the production server\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eaccount numbers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI need to record something on a regular basis (for example, blood pressure) and need a place to store that information for future reference\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn mobile, the main way I capture information now is via Google Keep since it\u0026rsquo;s quick and easy. This means my Google Keep is full of many random cards with lists, some of which I can\u0026rsquo;t even recall the context of later. For longer-term inputs, I will typically use either a text file stored in Dropbox or StandardNotes or Google Docs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe solution came to me when I realized that I was capturing all these inputs and leaving them in the same place: so all the free-floating ideas I captured stay in Google Keep, unorganized and chaotic. I figured I needed to have two separate phases:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCapture ideas/todo items into an \u0026ldquo;inbox\u0026rdquo; (in this case, Google Keep)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePeriodically review the \u0026ldquo;inbox\u0026rdquo; and move items to the appropriate locations, for example:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eimmediately actionable items can be done immediately\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003etodo lists for actionable items\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ereference folders for reference material\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mostly didn\u0026rsquo;t have step 2 before. This is largely similar to the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;Getting Things Done\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e workflow that became popular for productivity nerds a while back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn additional step for me to have more well-defined \u0026ldquo;buckets\u0026rdquo; or locations, where different types of items need to be sent. Having them be well-defined makes the review step easier. For now my initial schema is:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGoogle Keep\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003einbox for capturing new items, should be reviewed and cleaned regularly\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eshort reference notes can be kept here for quick access\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTrello\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efor lists, such as todo lists, ideas lists, project lists\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStandardNotes\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efor reference material that can be stored plaintext\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGoogle Docs\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efor reference material that requires formatted documents or spreadsheets\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efor document drafts that will later be published elsewhere\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote: I have largely abandoned Evernote because of free account limitations. I also want to reduce Dropbox usage for the same reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully this scheme lets me be a bit more organized than I have in the past!

Unfortunately this means that for now there is no way to comment directly on posts. I will be adding that back later, hopefully in a matter of days. Having the comments be a separate post type means you can now \u003ca href=\"/comment/\"\u003ebrowse them directly\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWebmentions! I set up \u003ca href=\"https://webmentions.io\"\u003ewebmentions.io\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://brid.gy\"\u003ebrid.gy\u003c/a\u003e so this site now accepts webmentions. Currently only Twitter webmentions are enabled on brid.gy (see the samples in the screenshots above).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSearch! Previously the search widget was only sending you to a \u003ccode\u003e\u0026quot;site:roytang.net\u0026quot;\u003c/code\u003e search on DuckDuckGo. I changed it to perform indexing on the server, via the \u003ca href=\"https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html\"\u003ePython Whoosh library\u003c/a\u003e. Then any search request is sent via Javascript to a Flask server I have running, which queries the index and returns the relevant results.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also joined a webring! So 1990s lol. It\u0026rsquo;s a webring for Indieweb people, I\u0026rsquo;ve been enjoying browsing other people\u0026rsquo;s sites. Brings me back to the early 2000s internet. Links are in the footer!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are almost certainly broken things still around, but I wanted to push the initial changes for now.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
