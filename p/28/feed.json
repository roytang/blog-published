But it\u0026rsquo;s been a while, I think the time has come to write about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do I know I was burnt out? I don\u0026rsquo;t believe there is any generally accepted consensus of symptoms for burnout, but I had a good set of indicators:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eexhaustion, both physical and mental. More and more often I found myself simply \u003ca href=\"/2016/08/some-days-you-are-tired/\"\u003etired\u003c/a\u003e of everything.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efrustration with all the problems at work and the projects I was assigned to, frustration that we kept running into the same issues again and again (mostly relating to scheduling and deadlines and resources), and frustration that any concerns I raised were not being addressed\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethinking about work all the time, even on my off hours I would be mentally considered the open Jira tickets, etc\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea feeling of helplessness in the face of overwhelming and seemingly never-ending project issues, re:scheduling, resources, quality, and so on\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea general feeling that that the effort I was putting in wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth it or wasn\u0026rsquo;t appreciated as much as I\u0026rsquo;d have liked\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003egeneral lack of free time, and even when there was free time, lack of energy to pursue anything productive\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epermanently broken sleep cycle (a problem I still struggle with to this day)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe work at my former employer had always been\u0026hellip; challenging, to say the least. Overtime was not uncommon, and many people often quit citing the heavy workload. And yet I was generally happy/content working there for the better part of a decade. I kind of enjoyed and thrived in the environment most of the time, especially when facing technical challenges. Things got worse for me personally starting around 2014ish I think. There were a variety of challenges during this time, some of them due to the company/environment and some due to my own personal shortcomings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnvironment challenges:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea large project with constantly changing requirements and overly aggressive schedules (due to sales/marketing push) and almost continuous crunch.

I realize this doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound like a negative, but it\u0026rsquo;d kind of a double-edged sword in that I take my duties as an employee very seriously and will sometimes sacrifice my own well-being if I think it is needed. For the longest time, one of \u003ca href=\"/2012/08/232395423602573312/\"\u003emy favorite quotes has been\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Death is lighter than a feather, but Duty is heavier than a mountain” - Japanese proverb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find this quote symptomatic of the \u0026ldquo;hustle culture\u0026rdquo; that tends to lead to burnout. That\u0026rsquo;s probably a topic for another time, but the gist of it is that most companies and projects are a never-ending well of work that needs to be done, so much so that oftentimes the reward for good work is often more work. i.e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/2019/10/1185221831990464513/\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;The price for being the best is always having to be the best\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis \u0026ldquo;sense of duty\u0026rdquo; was so strong that even when I realized I was burning out, I still gave half a year\u0026rsquo;s notice for resignation, because I at least wanted to make sure everything was fine before I left. (Spoilers: it would take them a couple more years to actually finish the project). Someone reminded me recently that I expressed regret at leaving \u0026ldquo;in wartime\u0026rdquo; since the project got even further delayed and many of the issues were unresolved at that time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erelated to the above, I also had a strong sense of pride. I considered myself very good at my job (justifiably so, based on annual reviews etc) and somehow had the mentality that I needed to be able to carry the weight of the project by myself. Whenever there was a resource or scheduling problem, one of my first instincts was to be to offer to take on the needed load myself, no matter how busy I already was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhat related to the above, but I also had (and often still have) an obsessive-compulsive need to read and reply to all emails and messages and notifications immediately, even outside of work hours\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecoupled with my strong sense of duty is a lack of ability to say no. As an example, for some reason even after I realized I was burnt out and notified the company I was leaving, I agreed to go live in another country on-site for three months. While it was good to experience another country, the work-life balance while I was there was even worse because the time zone problem still existed (except in reverse, i.e. the dev team was now on the other end of the world), and now I became a bottleneck (since I was one of the only two people on-site) and had to dedicate more time to bridging the gap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs noted, I think many of these issues existed even before, but perhaps most of them were exacerbated by the fact that we now had to provide support across two time zones seven hours apart. That really took a toll on my work-life balance. Looking back at my emails during that period, I would often be replying late into the night or even early in the morning. I think it was really a question of energy and time being in short supply. I almost burnt myself out again in 2018, but at least I had the sense to recognize it faster and to step back as needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must point out that I bear no ill will towards my former employer or the people who worked there. There was a lot of room for improvement but everyone was just trying the best with what they were given. And I share some of the blame since I was kind of in a leadership position \u0026ndash; I should have pushed harder to make things better for everyone involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow to avoid burnout:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eset reasonable boundaries between work time and personal time. Having a strong sense of duty is probably fine, as long as you know where that ends and to prioritize your own well-being as needed. Guard your free time zealously. As much as possible, don\u0026rsquo;t accept calls/messages outside of agreed upon work hours. The occasional exception for an emergency is probably fine, but don\u0026rsquo;t let it become a regular thing. Having well-defined boundaries allows your brain to avoid overlaps - if you\u0026rsquo;re at home, you should get used to not thinking about work.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eunderstand your own value and your own limits. Having a good understanding of what you bring to the team and the limits of your own ability and capacity means you can more effectively allocate your time and energy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ealways be aware of the employee-employer relationship. It\u0026rsquo;s okay to have a good working relationship with your superiors and coworkers and even to be friends with them, but never lose sight of the fact that to the employer, you are an employee. You aren\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;family\u0026rdquo; no matter what the company says. You are being paid to do a job, and that job has limits. You don\u0026rsquo;t owe the company your personal time or your absolute loyalty. It\u0026rsquo;s a capitalist enterprise, not a nation. Remember that in the end, the company will need to look out for itself (especially for publicly-traded companies), so you will need to look out for yourself as well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003elearn to say no. This is coupled with the first two points above. If you know what your boundaries are and what your limits are, it will become easier to say \u0026ldquo;No\u0026rdquo; to unreasonable requests. And remember that your personal time is your own, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to defend or explain why you don\u0026rsquo;t want to work on weekends or such\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eregularly reflect on how things are going. Check your energy levels to make sure they aren\u0026rsquo;t constantly low and that you\u0026rsquo;re getting enough recharge time. If you think are starting to burn out, pull back, take some time off, and reassess how to move forward. Assess also how the company is addressing your concerns, and if they aren\u0026rsquo;t or are unwilling to do so, consider whether it may be time to move on.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor people in leadership/management positions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eunderstand the value and capabilities of your team and build them up. One of the best things about working in larger companies/projects/teams is that you have other people to back you up, to support you and handle things when you reach your limits. Understanding both your own limits and the team\u0026rsquo;s limits allow you to better allocate tasks to avoid burnout.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eit isn\u0026rsquo;t sufficient to simply be asking your team members \u0026ldquo;Are you still ok?\u0026rdquo;, because if they\u0026rsquo;re anything like me, they may not be aware that they are starting to burn out already. Pay attention to how they are performing and how much time, effort and energy they are putting them in, and don\u0026rsquo;t push them unnecessarily.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eif your team members raise a concern, make sure to not only listen but to make them know what is being done to address their concerns. Unaddressed problems lead to frustration.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, software development is a demanding industry, and it tends to attract people like me - industrious people who enjoy and take pride in their work. (Hence the famous quote about laziness, impatience and hubris.) Add to that the common difficulties in estimation, scheduling and planning, and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to understand why burnout is rampant in this industry. All the more reason for everyone involved to be aware of the risks of burnout and how to avoid it, and perhaps to somehow help reshape the industry to better avoid it.\u003c/p\u003e",

            "title": "Tales from the Old Web (Development)",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThere was this great (and long!) \u003ca href=\"https://eev.ee/blog/2020/02/01/old-css-new-css/\"\u003earticle that came out recently about the history of CSS\u003c/a\u003e. It reminded me a lot of the old days when I started out in web development. So join me in a walk down memory lane as I reminisce about the trials and tribulations of early web development. (This one isn\u0026rsquo;t about CSS as much as that linked article.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started out with web applications during the heyday of the much-maligned Internet Explorer 6, and pretty much the start of the age of webapps. Most of our projects during this time involved government agencies wanting to upgrade from their old existing client-server style systems. Those were often written in programming languages/tools like Delphi, Oracle Forms, PowerBuilder and such. That meant there was a lot of pressure on the web applications we developed to be able to match most of the client-side functionality available in those kinds of programs, which was often a challenge due to the limitations of the HTTP model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"activex\"\u003eActiveX\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypically, the government agencies at that time used only Internet Explorer in their workstations, so we could write our web applications to target just IE specifically. This meant we could use things like ActiveX to attempt to do things browsers normally can\u0026rsquo;t do. Some of it was for security purposes, like confirming the user\u0026rsquo;s authentication matches the current workstation user, or for Single-Sign On purposes, things like that. There were also some for interfacing with things outside the web browser, like document scanners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also had to use some ActiveX to get around browser quirks. For example, IE6 had this problem with combo boxes/select elements where the width of the drop window would always match the width of the \u003ccode\u003eselect\u003c/code\u003e element, but this means if the \u003ccode\u003eoption\u003c/code\u003e text was longer than that width, they would not be readable. We had to make an ActiveX component just to fix this, by making the drop window wider on document load! Sample screenshot recovered from the vaults:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#f47a745a95a668a6f94a9b0ba34a768e-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2020/02/old-web/Combo_hu3c773b5aac8489cf2c66b31c0ac0d078_147716_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"f47a745a95a668a6f94a9b0ba34a768e-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2020/02/old-web/Combo.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"4 Feb 2020 12:00am\"\u003e4 Feb 2020 12:00am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome other ActiveX uses were to do things that would later on become standard features in browsers. Some other examples I can recall:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003espellchecking. We used an ActiveX component from a company called \u003ca href=\"https://www.wintertree-software.com/dev/wspell/info.html\"\u003eWinterTree software\u003c/a\u003e. I was surprised to find this particular product of theirs is still available, when practically all modern browsers have spellcheck support! I suppose it\u0026rsquo;s still useful for legacy environments maybe?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewe had this one project that needed a complicated graphing diagram. Think about those pinboards with pictures and documents connected by wires that conspiracy theorists use in memes, something like that. These days that kind of thing can be done using modern HTML+Javascript only, but during the IE6 days we were still pretty limited. We used another third-party ActiveX (can no longer recall the component name), that we wrapped in our own Delphi program for customization purposes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs far as I can tell, we ended up using ActiveX in some projects up to the early 2010s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"gmail-and-ajax\"\u003eGMail and Ajax\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur initial webapps also did the thing where we would reload the page whenever doing something like going to the next page of results. This was pretty bad user experience-wise, especially compared to the client-server programs of old, which felt a lot more snappy since they were only loading the database results via the database driver, instead of an entire HTML page. By 2005, we were already using Ajax/XMLHttpRequest to get around these limitations in IE6. (\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest\"\u003eThe wikipedia entry\u003c/a\u003e says XHR didn\u0026rsquo;t officially exist in IE6, so I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how we did that, but I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure we did). Our main use was for paging search result grids, but we weren\u0026rsquo;t even fetching XML or JSON back then, the XHR response would be the grid HTML itself, which we just plop right where the previous page was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember I was talking to the SA for the project about ajax, he asked what it was and why we were using it, my explanations was:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAjax is \u0026ldquo;Asynchronous Javascript and XML\u0026rdquo;; it\u0026rsquo;s a method of using\nJavascript and XML data that allows us to make server-side (database)\ncalls without having to resubmit the entire page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe use it because it\u0026rsquo;s cool =p With Ajax, we can do something like allow\nthe user to re-sort a grid of records without reloading the rest of the\npage. It is easier for us to meet the performance reqt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;ve seen the Google Maps or GMail webapps, they both use Ajax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe response was (unedited):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve used Gmail.  AJas is client side library??? Seems they process very\nfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(I would later kind of \u003ca href=\"/2006/05/gmail-raises-the-bar-for-everyone/\"\u003eregret using Gmail as a comparison\u003c/a\u003e!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"cross-browser-development\"\u003eCross-browser development\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of our projects were for internal systems where the workstations had controlled environments so we were free to target a single browser only (usually IE). Some projects also had a public-facing portal though, and that required we do some cross-browser frontend stuff. Early on, the typical targets other than IE where Netscape and Firefox. This is where the IE6 compatibility headaches come in. It was usually a game of write the code for IE first, then let the testers find any NS/FF issues, then quash accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe started checking in Firefox around the quirks mode era, as described in the article linked at the start of this post. The biggest challenge really was getting everything pixel-perfectly the same between browsers. The typical problems were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ebrowser differences in CSS models (the famous box model issue)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edifferences in native controls (typically the \u003ccode\u003eselect\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003einput type='file'\u003c/code\u003e controls were the more problematic ones)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efor cases where we needed ActiveX plugins for IE6, we would also need to develop corresponding FF add-ins, usually targeting Firefox 2.x (It\u0026rsquo;s fun to think about how the current version of Firefox is 70 major versions ahead of that!)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe did very little cross-browser work at the start, with the proportion accelerating in tune with Firefox/Chrome\u0026rsquo;s rise in marketshare. By around 2010, it was common for projects to be testing across at least 2 versions of IE (6 and 7), 2 versions of Firefox (2 and 3), Google Chrome, and often Safari as well. (We didn\u0026rsquo;t really start thinking about Mac users until around 2007ish).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoogle Chrome came out in 2008, I found some old comments I made to our internal tech team when it came out:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have an installer in t:\\roy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s not an OS, but it runs browser tabs in separate processes (literally\u0026hellip;each one has a different PID), such that a single webapp won\u0026rsquo;t crash everything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore info here: t:\\keis\\Google_Chrome.pdf\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it gets widespread adoption, it may affect the webapps we develop - it uses Webkit as a rendering engine (used by Safari), so it\u0026rsquo;s different from Firefox and IE. Haven\u0026rsquo;t encountered any problems yet though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also tested the memory usage of Chrome vs FF back then:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTry this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirefox - open 9 tabs. Check the memory consumption. Close 8 tabs. Check\nthe memory consumption. (Remains around the same as previous one)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Chrome, the memory usage of closed tabs is 0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a far cry from Chrome\u0026rsquo;s modern reputation as a memory hog! (Although I guess that reputation is probably related to people keeping too many tabs open.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSide story: while looking up old files for this post, I came upon a thread where we were discussing printing issues across browsers, and there was a problem in printing some pages from the browser because of limitations in IE6, and some management higher-up chimed in with a suggestion to \u0026ldquo;just tell the client to use IE7\u0026rdquo; as if the client will magically upgrade all their workstations for that one problem. :shrug:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"jquery\"\u003ejQuery\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the linked article mentioned, jQuery raised the bar when it came out, allowing developers to easily paper over cross-browser JavaScript concerns and providing an API that became so prevalent, years later parts of it would become built-in to modern browsers (i.e. \u003ccode\u003edocument.querySelector\u003c/code\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shared the link to \u003ca href=\"/2006/01/jquery-new-wave-javascript/\"\u003ejQuery via delicious\u003c/a\u003e in 2006, but for sure we weren\u0026rsquo;t using it yet in our projects at that time. Based on my own CV, the first time I used it in a project was in 2009. It quickly became part of our standard libraries. I still remember in one particular project I spent some time thrashing out a bunch of issues because we needed to upgrade from like jQuery 1.3 to 1.4? Or something like that. Normally we\u0026rsquo;d fix to a certain version, but I think we needed to upgrade because of a jQuery plugin we needed. This was before the modern frontend development frameworks where you already have dependency management tools, so we had to make sure none of our other third-party JS components would break with the upgrade. The company ended up using jQuery as a standard in projects up to the time I left in 2015. (I\u0026rsquo;m told they later on switched to Vue.js, so more power to them.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI identify as a \u0026ldquo;full stack developer\u0026rdquo;, but these days the \u0026ldquo;frontend\u0026rdquo; half of that usually implies usage of one of the modern frontend frameworks: Angular, React, or Vue. While I am cognizant of those frameworks and have tried them all in some form or another over the past few years, my frontend development experience is still largely defined by the jQuery era. So when setting up personal projects or quick prototypes that\u0026rsquo;s still what I default to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"css\"\u003eCSS\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe linked article was about CSS, so I figured I should have some CSS stories too, but I find that I don\u0026rsquo;t have much, other than the cross-browser compat above. My main issue with CSS back then was that in a large project with a nontrivial amount of developers each working on separate screens, the CSS style sheets tended to get longer and denser with time. And with bug fixes and whatnot, it would tend to be full of hacks and workarounds like randomly placing \u003ccode\u003e!important\u003c/code\u003e in so many places. I just assumed we had a whole bunch of CSS selectors that were no longer necessary but no one would bother cleaning up the style sheets because who knows what you\u0026rsquo;ll break? Basically a whole chaotic mess. IDK if modern tooling handles this because I haven\u0026rsquo;t been on larger projects since leaving the company, but I suppose the stronger delineation/specialization between frontend and backend dev work means less people to mess up the stylesheets, and those who do handle the styles are more aware of such pitfalls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"thats-it-for-now\"\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s it (for now)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, this was a fun trip down memory lane. This post is already longer than I thought it would be, but those are all the old-timey stories I can recall right now. There\u0026rsquo;s a good chance there\u0026rsquo;s some more of them lodged in my brain somewhere that will come out sooner or later, so maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a part 2 sometime in the future.\u003c/p\u003e",
            "summary": "\u003cp\u003eThere was this great (and long!) \u003ca href=\"https://eev.ee/blog/2020/02/01/old-css-new-css/\"\u003earticle that came out recently about the history of CSS\u003c/a\u003e. It reminded me a lot of the old days when I started out in web development. So join me in a walk down memory lane as I reminisce about the trials and tribulations of early web development.

Not personally big on basketball myself, but I can get why a lot of people sympathized. It was sad, but at least it wasn\u0026rsquo;t on the scale of another natural disaster or global pandemic. Although the global pandemic did also spread to the Philippines this week\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know it\u0026rsquo;s only been a month, but I\u0026rsquo;m digging this weeknotes practice. It establishes a regular cadence for the blog and at the same time provides a general bucket where I can place any spare thoughts that don\u0026rsquo;t make it into a shorter note but don\u0026rsquo;t merit a whole blog post. And somehow I always find a few more bits to say! At the same time, I can still be writing additional blog posts other than the weeknote, so that\u0026rsquo;s fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, this week wasn\u0026rsquo;t very productive. I did have a few meetings/events I was supposed to do during the week that for one reason or another didn\u0026rsquo;t push through as scheduled, so I had a lot of free time for the week. Most of that free time actually went to \u003cstrong\u003eTales of Berseria\u003c/strong\u003e though. Game is good, I have to start regulating myself to make sure I\u0026rsquo;m not just playing it all the time. I also got a bit of writing done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne event I did manage to go to was a Lord of the Rings themed quiz night last Friday. We had decided to try out this new quiz venue/organizer (new to us at least). And it turned out to be quite a different! There were a few written rounds, as in we write all our answers on a sheet of paper then exchange papers after the round. And after that, a couple of rounds with a physical component: teams had to race to raise their hands after the question was shown! And this was a right-minus-wrong section, with heavy penalties for wrong answers. So maybe our strategy of \u0026ldquo;just always raise our hands as fast as possible assuming we can get the answer\u0026rdquo; wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite the best strategy we had hoped it would be. We didn\u0026rsquo;t do too well (I think we finished at most 5th among 8 teams), but it was still pretty interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a personal note: pamangkin#5 was born last Friday, the 31st.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSite changes this week:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esearch no longer uses JS, HTML now rendered directly by the Django backend.

I\u0026rsquo;m not super happy with the top menu (I kind of want more items on there), and the main feed on the front page that mixes all the different content types kind of de-emphasizes the blog posts. I like having the notes/photos/links archives on the site, but I kind of want the main focus to still be on the longer blog posts?

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if I should continue this \u003ca href=\"/tags/watching-lately\"\u003ewatching-lately\u003c/a\u003e series since I already set up a separate page for \u003ca href=\"/lists/2020/movies\"\u003elisting my 2020 movies watched\u003c/a\u003e. It might have been more consistent to have a list for the 2020 TV shows also? But then again, TV shows are a much different beast, since each show/season is broken into an episode and sometimes you watch them all in one go or sometimes over the span of a few months. So maybe let\u0026rsquo;s keep this going for the while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo yeah, movies. From the list for January, I think the best one was Parasite. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any expectations on what this movie was about yet somehow I still feel like it subverted those expectations anyway. I only saw 15 movies in January, which is below rate if I\u0026rsquo;m targetting 200 for the year. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s one of those NYR things that peters out after a month or so. Too early to tell, and besides, that\u0026rsquo;s not an insurmountable deficit. And 200 isn\u0026rsquo;t a hard target either so let\u0026rsquo;s just see what happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the realm of TV, this kind of explains why my movie-watching trailed off in the second half of the month, since the regular TV series started coming back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI already \u003ca href=\"/2020/01/arrowverse-crisis-on-infinite-earths/\"\u003ewrote about the Arrowverse crossover\u003c/a\u003e when the back half aired. This month the last two episodes of Arrow aired. The first one was a backdoor pilot for a new spinoff series, Green Arrow and the Canaries, starring Mia Queen. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what to think about the spinoff or whether I\u0026rsquo;ll even try it out. The whole time travel thing seems so convoluted as a way to bring Mia, E2 Laurel and Dinah together. The second episode was the series finale, basically a retrospective on the entire series. They pulled out all the stops, bringing back supporting characters from all 8 seasons of the show (Except for Malcolm Merlyn, apparently John Barrowman was busy reappearing in a different series), and even surrendering to some long-time fan wishes such as Digg picking up a mysterious green object dropped from space. In spite of all my complaints about the poor writing on this show (and the related ones) through the years, I will admit the finale was pretty good and they stuck the landing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the rest of the Arrowverse, some comments that I\u0026rsquo;m not sure where else I can post, mostly on the post-crisis set up:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eApparently in the rebooted universe, there was still a multiverse (since E2 Laurel exists, and doppelgangers showed up in Supergirl), but then the other universes were destroyed in a crisis (probably similar but different than the one we actually watched.) This is totally different from the \u0026ldquo;it became one universe from the very start\u0026rdquo; ending of the original CoIE and took away from the crossover a bit.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI was mildly annoyed when Jonn turned out to be able to restore pre-crisis memories. This only makes sense if what he\u0026rsquo;s restoring are part of his own memories, but not events he never knew about, otherwise, where did those pre-crisis memories come from? This annoyance was exacerbated by the GAatC backdoor pilot introducing a \u0026ldquo;device made by Cisco that replicates\u0026rdquo; Jonn\u0026rsquo;s powers so now anyone can restore pre-crisis memories, even from people Jonn has never met like future JJ. And in the Arrow finale, it seemed like everyone at the funeral was aware of the previous universe, did Jonn reset them too?? Seemed wholly unnecessary, but I suppose then we get difficult to explain things like Tommy wondering why E2 Laurel seems different\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFun fact: at Oliver\u0026rsquo;s funeral, Dinah is from before the GAatC episode (since in that episode she says she vanished after the funeral), Mia is from after that episode, and presumably so is E2 Laurel, although this isn\u0026rsquo;t explicitly specified. Timey-wimey!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Good Place\u003c/strong\u003e is also ending this week. As the time this post goes live, I will not have yet watched the season finale, but I did binge the rest of the seasons leading up to it, so maybe I can share some thoughts anyway. The Good Place was a weird series. It\u0026rsquo;s highly acclaimed and covers a lot of interesting topics philosophically, and puts its cast through a lot of interesting situations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy main issue with TGP is that I don\u0026rsquo;t find it particularly funny. Not like other Schur-influenced shows such as Brooklyn Nine Nine and Parks and Recreation. The characters can be charming sure and ridiculous sure. But their situations are rarely sitcom funny. I think part of it is that the situations they face are always so dire. I mean, their consequences somehow ramped up from eternal torture and damnation to the erasure of earth and all of humanity during the course of the series. Not very light-hearted topics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother part of it might be the severe \u003ca href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization\"\u003eFlanderization\u003c/a\u003e of the most of the characters. Typically this is a process that happens over the lifetime of a show, but with TGP, the characters\u0026rsquo; most annoying traits are highly focused on from the start: Eleanor is an asshole, Jason is an idiot, Tahani is a name-dropping socialite and Chidi is an anxious, undecisive philosopher. Eleanor and Chidi get a bit of character growth through the series (more Eleanor than Chidi), but Jason and Tahani are kind of still the same people by the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, I like the show, but more for the questions it raises about how the afterlife could possibly work, rather than for pure comedic value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome friends somehow convinced me to watch \u003cstrong\u003eKim\u0026rsquo;s Convenience\u003c/strong\u003e (it was on NF). I have no regrets. It\u0026rsquo;s a smart, funny show about a Korean immigrant family in Canada. There were 3 seasons to binge on NF and it was very easy to side-watch since it\u0026rsquo;s a sitcom. The best character is the father of the family, a first-generation Korean immigrant who owns a convenience store (hence the show title). My only complaint is that it\u0026rsquo;s challenging my suspension of disbelief that the first generation immigrants still speak in English when among themselves, but as a friend said, it was probably for the sake of avoiding subtitles. Also, I wanted to see what the future Shang-chi actor looked like. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it kind of weird that he\u0026rsquo;s Chinese but he\u0026rsquo;s playing a Korean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shorter series I saw on Netflix was \u003cstrong\u003eThe Witcher\u003c/strong\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty good, and I much prefer Henry Cavill as Geralt in this show rather than as Superman. (Although he looks nothing like W3 Geralt). I wish I had seen this series before playing the games, as it sets up a lot of the character back stories that I kind of just accepted in the games. Looking forward to future seasons!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I managed to watch the first half of The Expanse season 3. It takes me a whole to catch up with this show because each episode is heavy and a lot of things are always happening, so it always needs my full attention. It\u0026rsquo;s so good, and it\u0026rsquo;s not like those shows where you never get any answers, things actually get resolved at a reasonable pace. One and a half more seasons to catch up on!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
