            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThe big news this week was the passing of basketball legend Kobe Bryant. Not personally big on basketball myself, but I can get why a lot of people sympathized. It was sad, but at least it wasn\u0026rsquo;t on the scale of another natural disaster or global pandemic. Although the global pandemic did also spread to the Philippines this week\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know it\u0026rsquo;s only been a month, but I\u0026rsquo;m digging this weeknotes practice. It establishes a regular cadence for the blog and at the same time provides a general bucket where I can place any spare thoughts that don\u0026rsquo;t make it into a shorter note but don\u0026rsquo;t merit a whole blog post. And somehow I always find a few more bits to say! At the same time, I can still be writing additional blog posts other than the weeknote, so that\u0026rsquo;s fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, this week wasn\u0026rsquo;t very productive. I did have a few meetings/events I was supposed to do during the week that for one reason or another didn\u0026rsquo;t push through as scheduled, so I had a lot of free time for the week. Most of that free time actually went to \u003cstrong\u003eTales of Berseria\u003c/strong\u003e though. Game is good, I have to start regulating myself to make sure I\u0026rsquo;m not just playing it all the time. I also got a bit of writing done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne event I did manage to go to was a Lord of the Rings themed quiz night last Friday. We had decided to try out this new quiz venue/organizer (new to us at least). And it turned out to be quite a different! There were a few written rounds, as in we write all our answers on a sheet of paper then exchange papers after the round. And after that, a couple of rounds with a physical component: teams had to race to raise their hands after the question was shown! And this was a right-minus-wrong section, with heavy penalties for wrong answers. So maybe our strategy of \u0026ldquo;just always raise our hands as fast as possible assuming we can get the answer\u0026rdquo; wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite the best strategy we had hoped it would be. We didn\u0026rsquo;t do too well (I think we finished at most 5th among 8 teams), but it was still pretty interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a personal note: pamangkin#5 was born last Friday, the 31st.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSite changes this week:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esearch no longer uses JS, HTML now rendered directly by the Django backend. Output might be a bit buggy though.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efor some reason I decided I needed less content types, so I folded \u0026ldquo;Replies\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Reposts\u0026rdquo; into \u0026ldquo;Notes\u0026rdquo;, so that \u0026ldquo;Notes\u0026rdquo; now feels like a more comprehensive microblog/tumblr-like thing.

This is fun for me because I sometimes use this as a reference for finding new/interesting blogs to follow\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emay or may not be related, but I was looking at the AWStats for the site, and for some reason, January was a record in terms of number of unique hits, more than 3x the monthly peak for 2019. Not sure what happened there\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking for a while about revamping the front page. I\u0026rsquo;m not super happy with the top menu (I kind of want more items on there), and the main feed on the front page that mixes all the different content types kind of de-emphasizes the blog posts.

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if I should continue this \u003ca href=\"/tags/watching-lately\"\u003ewatching-lately\u003c/a\u003e series since I already set up a separate page for \u003ca href=\"/lists/2020/movies\"\u003elisting my 2020 movies watched\u003c/a\u003e. It might have been more consistent to have a list for the 2020 TV shows also? But then again, TV shows are a much different beast, since each show/season is broken into an episode and sometimes you watch them all in one go or sometimes over the span of a few months. So maybe let\u0026rsquo;s keep this going for the while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo yeah, movies. From the list for January, I think the best one was Parasite. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any expectations on what this movie was about yet somehow I still feel like it subverted those expectations anyway. I only saw 15 movies in January, which is below rate if I\u0026rsquo;m targetting 200 for the year. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s one of those NYR things that peters out after a month or so. Too early to tell, and besides, that\u0026rsquo;s not an insurmountable deficit. And 200 isn\u0026rsquo;t a hard target either so let\u0026rsquo;s just see what happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the realm of TV, this kind of explains why my movie-watching trailed off in the second half of the month, since the regular TV series started coming back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI already \u003ca href=\"/2020/01/arrowverse-crisis-on-infinite-earths/\"\u003ewrote about the Arrowverse crossover\u003c/a\u003e when the back half aired. This month the last two episodes of Arrow aired. The first one was a backdoor pilot for a new spinoff series, Green Arrow and the Canaries, starring Mia Queen. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what to think about the spinoff or whether I\u0026rsquo;ll even try it out. The whole time travel thing seems so convoluted as a way to bring Mia, E2 Laurel and Dinah together. The second episode was the series finale, basically a retrospective on the entire series. They pulled out all the stops, bringing back supporting characters from all 8 seasons of the show (Except for Malcolm Merlyn, apparently John Barrowman was busy reappearing in a different series), and even surrendering to some long-time fan wishes such as Digg picking up a mysterious green object dropped from space. In spite of all my complaints about the poor writing on this show (and the related ones) through the years, I will admit the finale was pretty good and they stuck the landing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the rest of the Arrowverse, some comments that I\u0026rsquo;m not sure where else I can post, mostly on the post-crisis set up:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eApparently in the rebooted universe, there was still a multiverse (since E2 Laurel exists, and doppelgangers showed up in Supergirl), but then the other universes were destroyed in a crisis (probably similar but different than the one we actually watched.) This is totally different from the \u0026ldquo;it became one universe from the very start\u0026rdquo; ending of the original CoIE and took away from the crossover a bit.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI was mildly annoyed when Jonn turned out to be able to restore pre-crisis memories. This only makes sense if what he\u0026rsquo;s restoring are part of his own memories, but not events he never knew about, otherwise, where did those pre-crisis memories come from? This annoyance was exacerbated by the GAatC backdoor pilot introducing a \u0026ldquo;device made by Cisco that replicates\u0026rdquo; Jonn\u0026rsquo;s powers so now anyone can restore pre-crisis memories, even from people Jonn has never met like future JJ. And in the Arrow finale, it seemed like everyone at the funeral was aware of the previous universe, did Jonn reset them too?? Seemed wholly unnecessary, but I suppose then we get difficult to explain things like Tommy wondering why E2 Laurel seems different\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFun fact: at Oliver\u0026rsquo;s funeral, Dinah is from before the GAatC episode (since in that episode she says she vanished after the funeral), Mia is from after that episode, and presumably so is E2 Laurel, although this isn\u0026rsquo;t explicitly specified. Timey-wimey!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Good Place\u003c/strong\u003e is also ending this week. As the time this post goes live, I will not have yet watched the season finale, but I did binge the rest of the seasons leading up to it, so maybe I can share some thoughts anyway. The Good Place was a weird series. It\u0026rsquo;s highly acclaimed and covers a lot of interesting topics philosophically, and puts its cast through a lot of interesting situations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy main issue with TGP is that I don\u0026rsquo;t find it particularly funny. Not like other Schur-influenced shows such as Brooklyn Nine Nine and Parks and Recreation. The characters can be charming sure and ridiculous sure. But their situations are rarely sitcom funny. I think part of it is that the situations they face are always so dire. I mean, their consequences somehow ramped up from eternal torture and damnation to the erasure of earth and all of humanity during the course of the series. Not very light-hearted topics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother part of it might be the severe \u003ca href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization\"\u003eFlanderization\u003c/a\u003e of the most of the characters. Typically this is a process that happens over the lifetime of a show, but with TGP, the characters\u0026rsquo; most annoying traits are highly focused on from the start: Eleanor is an asshole, Jason is an idiot, Tahani is a name-dropping socialite and Chidi is an anxious, undecisive philosopher. Eleanor and Chidi get a bit of character growth through the series (more Eleanor than Chidi), but Jason and Tahani are kind of still the same people by the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, I like the show, but more for the questions it raises about how the afterlife could possibly work, rather than for pure comedic value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome friends somehow convinced me to watch \u003cstrong\u003eKim\u0026rsquo;s Convenience\u003c/strong\u003e (it was on NF). I have no regrets. It\u0026rsquo;s a smart, funny show about a Korean immigrant family in Canada. There were 3 seasons to binge on NF and it was very easy to side-watch since it\u0026rsquo;s a sitcom. The best character is the father of the family, a first-generation Korean immigrant who owns a convenience store (hence the show title). My only complaint is that it\u0026rsquo;s challenging my suspension of disbelief that the first generation immigrants still speak in English when among themselves, but as a friend said, it was probably for the sake of avoiding subtitles. Also, I wanted to see what the future Shang-chi actor looked like. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it kind of weird that he\u0026rsquo;s Chinese but he\u0026rsquo;s playing a Korean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shorter series I saw on Netflix was \u003cstrong\u003eThe Witcher\u003c/strong\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty good, and I much prefer Henry Cavill as Geralt in this show rather than as Superman. (Although he looks nothing like W3 Geralt). I wish I had seen this series before playing the games, as it sets up a lot of the character back stories that I kind of just accepted in the games. Looking forward to future seasons!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I managed to watch the first half of The Expanse season 3. It takes me a whole to catch up with this show because each episode is heavy and a lot of things are always happening, so it always needs my full attention. It\u0026rsquo;s so good, and it\u0026rsquo;s not like those shows where you never get any answers, things actually get resolved at a reasonable pace. One and a half more seasons to catch up on!\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I followed the \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/jamesclear\"\u003eauthor on Twitter\u003c/a\u003e for a while before deciding to buy the book. I read it sporadically through the month. It\u0026rsquo;s not very long - less than 300 pages on the Kindle app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book is fairly good and insightful, although I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if there are any ideas I haven\u0026rsquo;t encountered elsewhere (especially if you read a lot of self-improvement stuff). Most of the concepts are easy to arrive at if you sat down to spend like thirty minutes thinking about (\u0026ldquo;Oh, I should make my good habits easier to do!\u0026rdquo; seems kind of obvious in hindsight).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the book shines in tying these ideas together thematically into what the author describes as \u0026ldquo;four laws of behavior change.\u0026rdquo; I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m taking anything away from the book by listing the four laws here as: make it obvious/make it attractive/make it easy/make it satisfying. As is typical with this kind of book, the theme is further supported by citing research, anecdotes, success stories, quotes, tips, and such. While the material in question doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel entirely revolutionary, the presentation is very good and makes it a worthwhile read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve had my own share of trouble building new habits in the past of course. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a specific set of good habits to learn/bad habits to unlearn when I started reading, but the book\u0026rsquo;s insights did give me some ideas of how I could restructure some of my daily habits to make things easier for me. And I thought of some new habits during the course of reading and have been keeping them up for a week or so. So, the book has already provided some value for me personally. I hope I can keep it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI rarely tell other people my dreams anymore because it feels kind of weird, but this one was too good to pass up. It involves pro streamers and the fighting game community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo in the dream for some reason I found myself attending some sort of fighting game conference and ended up in a convo with a Guilty Gear pro streamer named \u0026ldquo;verythepast\u0026rdquo; about a recent patch that nerfed a particular character. The discussion was somewhere along the lines of \u0026ldquo;why would you practice a follow-up combo after an astral chain when the astral chain always kills the enemy?\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;Astral chain\u0026rdquo; here probably refers to an instant kill move that doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually exist with that name, as that name is a different game). I commented that since the recent patch, in some instances this particular character would be able to survive against such a move and you would need a followup to finish him off. I basically got called a scrub and verythepast said that was ridiculous and he sent me a link of a video showing him upgrading to the latest patch and peforming the \u0026ldquo;astral chain\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went home a bit humiliated and decided to review the video. But when I checked the video, I saw that he only upgraded to patch 7.x.10, when the latest version was patch 7.x.12. I was a bit miffed and spent some time trying to decide whether I should just let it go or call him out publicly or what. Then the next morning I woke up and found that he had tweeted and said he had tried it out and there was indeed a bug in the latest patch that could cause the character to survive the \u0026ldquo;astral chain\u0026rdquo; and he tagged me and a couple of other guys who had pointed it out and in effect apologized to me in public, so all\u0026rsquo;s well that ends well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDream ends and I wake up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that I wrote it out that doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem much. (There was some other inconsequential stuff I don\u0026rsquo;t remember like going to the toilet during the conference and there was this one guy sitting on a suitcase blocking the doorway and everyone had to walk around him, etc), but I was amused because of a few things:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe username my subconscious came up with: \u0026ldquo;verythepast\u0026rdquo; (a pun on \u0026ldquo;bury the past\u0026rdquo;). I had to double check when I woke up that Google showed no such streamer. Now I want to use this username somewhere!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethere was actually a detailed discussion of Guilty Gear game mechanics during the \u0026ldquo;conference\u0026rdquo;. Of course, most of it was probably inaccurate.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe apology tweets by verythepast the next day were very detailed when I read them in the dream, enough for me to remember most of the text when I woke up (except verythepast tagged me as @roy instead of @roytang). It\u0026rsquo;s always nice when I\u0026rsquo;m able to read text inside a dream, because as anyone who has seen the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perchance_to_Dream_(Batman:_The_Animated_Series)\"\u003eBatman:TAS episode \u0026ldquo;Perchance to Dream\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e knows: you can\u0026rsquo;t read inside a dream!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve always been amazed by the complex and sometimes convoluted plots that your subconscious can come up with for dreams. This one is relatively simple by comparison, but I still felt amazed at it when I woke up, enough to write this post immediately after! (Or perhaps the amazement is part of the dream??).\u003c/p\u003e",

At least the Volcano eruption doesn\u0026rsquo;t map directly to a horseman of the apocalypse, so that\u0026rsquo;s something. What are we in for this week??\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis past week has been quite productive with my personal projects. I managed to get a very very minimal version of one of my self-data tracking projects online (to replace a bunch of spreadsheets I\u0026rsquo;ve been using before). IDK if this is something that might eventually turn out to be useful for other people, but for now it\u0026rsquo;s still limited to my use only, until I am satisfied with the features/usability, as it is still very raw. I also migrated a small app from \u003ca href=\"/2020/01/flask-vs-django/\"\u003eFlask to Django\u003c/a\u003e, that was fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kind of got in the groove of the Twitch streaming thing, I did 3 more streams this week. I still don\u0026rsquo;t actually identify as a streamer, but I did put a link to the Twitch account here on the site, so that\u0026rsquo;s a thing now. I announce all streams on Twitter, and you can also check past broadcasts on this site via the \u003ca href=\"/tags/twitch\"\u003etwitch tag\u003c/a\u003e. Thanks to my friends for being supportive! Also, maybe I should buy a decent headset! The great thing about this game streaming thing is that I\u0026rsquo;m basically taking time I would have already spent playing games and doing something extra on top of that, so that\u0026rsquo;s something!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne game that I have been playing a bit but not streaming is \u003cstrong\u003eTales of Berseria\u003c/strong\u003e, which I started just before the last weeknote. I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to get into this for a while (got it from Humble Bundle monthly like half a year ago or such), since I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of the Tales series. I sunk like a dozen hours into it this week, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty good! Combat is engaging as usual, and I think the story is one of the best in the series. As usual, full review when I get done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween all the coding and the streaming and the gaming, I\u0026rsquo;ve fallen behind on my \u003ca href=\"https://roytang.net/lists/2020/movies/\"\u003e2020 Movies target\u003c/a\u003e, with no movies finished watching this week. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if I can make up for it in later weeks. I did manage to finish half of \u003cstrong\u003eThe Expanse\u003c/strong\u003e season 3 though, so that\u0026rsquo;s a thing. \u003cstrong\u003eStar Trek Picard\u003c/strong\u003e started this week and it\u0026rsquo;s on Prime Video, but it\u0026rsquo;s one of those episode-a-week deals, so that can wait until later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrivia team won our first quiz of the year last Tuesday at \u003ca href=\"https://geekfight.ph/\"\u003eGeekfight\u003c/a\u003e! I was looking forward to this one since like half of the categories were good for me. Batman round was very tough, but I confidently carried the MTG and One Piece rounds and helped a bit with the other rounds to bring us to victory! We finally manage to join one of their leagues from the very start, so we\u0026rsquo;re hoping to do well in this particular league!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis week\u0026rsquo;s site updates:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eminor cleanups and QoL updates all around\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis coming week I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emaybe a Lord of the Rings themed quiz on Friday, it depends\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e(paper) Theros Sealed event next Saturday\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethere\u0026rsquo;s also a bunch of things I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to write, hopefully I get around to them\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003enew family member probably arriving!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n",

            "title": "Flask vs Django",
            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eIn a bid to reduce the number of webapps actually running on my server (for resource consumption reasons), I decided to migrate a small Flask app I had and merge into this larger Django app where I have a lot of my personal data tracking stuff. The Flask app was small enough, mostly containing backend support for this blog (like search and comment submissions) and some Twitter things. The migration was straightforward, taking around half a day, most of that was wrangling with Twitter API rate limits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt got me thinking, why did I build this using Flask in the first place? And that led to the more general question: when do I prefer using Flask over Django?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonal experience: I\u0026rsquo;m much more familiar with Django than Flask, having started using it back in 2008. Professionally, I\u0026rsquo;ve also worked on more Django projects, compared to only one Flask project that actually made it to production.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe usual quick comparison is that Flask is the more lightweight web framework, suitable to smaller apps like microservices perhaps; while Django is the big monolithic web framework with all the bells and whistles already available. In practice this means Django already provides a lot of functionalities out of the box, while with Flask you have to install and figure out extensions for even the most common tasks like database management. A negative for Flask, but partly due to my inexperience: if you were already well-versed in the use of those extensions, I imagine getting everything together and setting them up will be easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there is need for a traditional RDBMS, I will probably use Django. I\u0026rsquo;m not super familiar with SQLAlchemy, the usual recommended ORM for Flask, so that\u0026rsquo;s a big factor. That being said, if I needed to work with something like a NoSQL database or some other nontraditional backend, it might be better to consider Flask since Django isn\u0026rsquo;t super flexible in that record - most of the pluses are oriented towards RDBMS-backed models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmin: The built-in Django admin is a big plus for me; it means that for things like simple record CRUD, if usability and presentation isn\u0026rsquo;t a big concern, I can just use the Django admin as my backend without needing to write maintenance screens. There is an equivalent \u003ca href=\"https://flask-admin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\"\u003eFlask Admin plugin\u003c/a\u003e, but I\u0026rsquo;ve not tried that either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAPI building: I\u0026rsquo;m already familiar with the Django REST framework, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if there\u0026rsquo;s an equivalent for Flask. The one Flask project we did, we rolled our own API backend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find that I tend to favor Flask when building quick proof-of-concept apps that don\u0026rsquo;t need a database. An example that was part of the app I migrated recently would be this quick \u003ca href=\"https://apps.roytang.net/twitter/\"\u003eTwitter app I wrote about a year ago\u003c/a\u003e, to find intersections between follows/followers. It didn\u0026rsquo;t need a database, only twitter API calls. (I have since merged it into the Django app, so the current version is using Django now.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn general I prefer Django, but that is probably due to familiarity and experience. I would love to have a full-scale project that uses Flask though! Perhaps in the future, for now all my personal projects are running on Django.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
