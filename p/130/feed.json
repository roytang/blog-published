Framework coding is a bit different from the actual application development. At the core it\u0026rsquo;s a simple idea: you have a whole bunch of code that helps do programming tasks that you expect will often be necessary in a certain set of projects, so you write that code with the intent of reusing it across multiple projects. For a web development framework, those tasks will be things like handling request parameters, form validation, form to database mapping, and so on. You can have frameworks for a variety of domains too, not just web development. There are mobile development frameworks, and game development frameworks, and so on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypically, a framework is developed alongside a project using that framework (to save on costs), but the framework\u0026rsquo;s objective of code reuse may not always align with the project\u0026rsquo;s objectives of \u0026ldquo;get stuff done already\u0026rdquo;.  Investing in reusable code often means there will be a bit more work done as you start up, to make sure that the code is flexible and reusable enough for future projects, but when your schedules are tight, these concerns may become secondary and you will be tempted to write in some substandard code that you will \u0026ldquo;just refactor later\u0026rdquo;. Technical debt by itself already tends to be a problem, it gets worse when it\u0026rsquo;s technical debt in framework code since you\u0026rsquo;re going to carry that across multiple projects, so be wary when sacrificing the quality of framework code for the sake of one project\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother thing is that you need to be more aware of separation of concerns, especially if the application development team overlaps with the framework development team. The idea of a framework is that it should be handling the most common tasks in a typical project, but when you\u0026rsquo;re embedded in a project there will be a tendency to try to handle even those special cases that are unique to the project. The danger here is that parts of the project domain will start seeping into your framework code because of requests by devs to provide a way to handle so-and-so scenario. And you end up with a situation where a few years later you ask, what the hell is this code doing, and the answer is that it was something needed by a developer three projects ago\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of separation of concerns, I\u0026rsquo;ve also found that devs working on framework code need to be more cognizant of things like that, meaning they have to be able to write good, modular, flexible code that can be easily reused for future projects. That means you need a solid understanding of coupling, separation of concerns, interfaces, and so on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlexibility is particularly important, as I\u0026rsquo;ve found in one of my later projects that was sold to multiple clients. Different clients will have varying needs and wants, so making sure your code is flexible and configurable enough to cater to a wide variety of needs. When you\u0026rsquo;re writing framework code, your clients are other developers, all the more reason to present an API that is consistent and flexible enough for their use. If you expect your framework to be used as the baseline for multiple projects, you will need to make sure it can cater to a wide variety of projects\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat flexibility will have limits though. Frameworks will tend to require a \u0026ldquo;certain way of doing things\u0026rdquo;, meaning devs will have to do some adapting to be able to use it. For example, if you post about an out of the box approach on a Ruby on Rails forum, you might get some replies about how \u0026ldquo;that\u0026rsquo;s not how things are done in Rails\u0026rdquo;. In practice, it\u0026rsquo;s impossible for a framework\u0026rsquo;s maintainers to anticipate all possible future needs of different projects, and developers will need to be able to build on top of your framework or even extend it as necessary. Instead of wasting effort trying to anticipate everything, framework developers should provide an easy, default path for the most common things, but be flexible enough to allow divergence for things the framework doesn\u0026rsquo;t support\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother thing to pay attention to is how tightly coupled different components of your framework are. Is the framework still useful if you have to support a third-party component to replace some functionality later on? What if you need to use a different database vendor? What if the client requires a different way of storing resource strings? You don\u0026rsquo;t have to support all the different possible implementations up front, but it would be wise to leave room for a future extension or plug-in to be easily swappable with the framework\u0026rsquo;s components\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most important thing to keep in mind is that the objectives of a framework are two-fold: (a) be reusable across multiple projects; (b) make it easier for developers to do the most common tasks in the chosen domain. Anything else beyond that, tread carefully\u003c/p\u003e\n",
            "summary": "For the better part of my software development career so far, I\u0026rsquo;ve had the doubtful pleasure of being one of the devs using and maintaining our in-house web development framework. Framework coding is a bit different from the actual application development. At the core it\u0026rsquo;s a simple idea: you have a whole bunch of code that helps do programming tasks that you expect will often be necessary in a certain set of projects, so you write that code with the intent of reusing it across multiple projects.",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m kind of a serial project starter. I\u0026rsquo;m sure it\u0026rsquo;s a very common thing. I\u0026rsquo;ll often have random ideas for projects I could do, big or small. I\u0026rsquo;d have a dozen of them percolating in my head at any one time. And somewhere between four to five dozen scattered down in various documents, notepads and what not, waiting to be explored. (I literally have two such small post-it notes with 5 such items in front of me right now)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese projects range from the small (programming: small scripts to automate some stuff I do regularly; sketches: quick sketches I want to do; writing: blog posts, short stories;) to the rather large and time-consuming (game development ideas, complicated data analysis ideas, novel ideas, some major reorganization/sorting of stuff, and so on). Unfortunately, starting new projects is rarely fruitful unless you actually finish those projects. And I rarely finish the larger projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about what it takes for me to get one of the largest projects to completion. At which stages do I typically falter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypically it starts with an idea. Something cool I could do. Or make. Or write. At this stage there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of optimism. I\u0026rsquo;m probably in love with the idea. If it\u0026rsquo;s a big enough idea, I might even think it\u0026rsquo;ll make me famous. Or earn me a lot of money. Or win me a nobel prize. Or all of those!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea enough to start on it immediately, I\u0026rsquo;ll add it to one of my lists that hopefully I manage to get back to sometime within the next century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I do like the idea enough, I\u0026rsquo;ll move on to some form of brainstorming. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll let the idea run around in my head for a couple of nights. Typically I\u0026rsquo;ll run the idea through some people I trust and would have a similar interest in the area. Then maybe draw up a short idea document outlining some of the details I\u0026rsquo;ve already imagined, to be expanded or reduced later as needed. If it\u0026rsquo;s a writing thing, I start to think in broad strokes: what the setting is, who the protag is, where I imagine him to be ending etc\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point I pretty much have an idea of what I want to do. The next step is to study what I need to execute. If it\u0026rsquo;s a programming or game development project, I look into what tools I\u0026rsquo;ll need or programming techniques I need to learn. I might need to access or scrape some sort of data source for analysis so I\u0026rsquo;ll start looking for sources\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I would try to get started. For programming stuff I might make a small prototype already. If it\u0026rsquo;s a writing thing, I might write a scene or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the first tranche of work, I\u0026rsquo;m going to assess how much farther I need to go. And typically this is where many of the projects will drop off. At this point I become aware of the size and scope of what I plan to do. I would look at the sheer amount of work needed to bring the project to conclusion, and it can be disheartening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start out optimistic, thinking about the exciting, cool stuff I get to try out, amazing scenes I want to write, interesting gameplay mechanics I thought of, and so on. But once I get past that I start to realize that finishing the job will require a lot of drudgework too. That means a lot of small, annoying, menial tasks that I\u0026rsquo;ll put off and won\u0026rsquo;t want to do\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI read a lot of self-improvement and \u0026ldquo;getting things done\u0026rdquo; sort of stuff, so I know all the usual advice: break down the big tasks into small tasks, take one step at a time, and so on. The problem is usually lack of focus. Since at this point there\u0026rsquo;s a lull in my interest towards the project, it\u0026rsquo;s an opportune time for some other idea to come along and distract me. Or maybe some shiny new video game or book starts taking up my time. Or some other random distraction that takes my time away. Then I\u0026rsquo;m too lazy to pick it up again, and the vicious cycle repeats with the next big project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmaller projects are fine \u0026ndash; the ones that only take me a few hours or a day to do. It\u0026rsquo;s the bigger ones that are the problem. I mostly know where I have to improve \u0026ndash; I have to be able to focus and commit my time. Eliminate distractions. Stay on track. And so on. Someday I\u0026rsquo;ll get it right\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n",
