            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eA while back I answered a question over on Quora about how I got started down the path of programming. It\u0026rsquo;s not a particularly interesting story, but I still thought I\u0026rsquo;d record it here for posterity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eSometime when I was much younger, maybe somewhere between twelve to fourteen years old, I remember having some sort of QBasic programming learning book at home. I forget how we got it, I think my uncle brought it home for me sometime for some reason. I don’t know why he would have such a thing, we didn’t even have a personal computer at home (we had a Nintendo Entertainment System, but that wasn’t really the same thing)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eIn spite of that, I took to the book easily. In fact, I kind of devoured it with a passion. Not that it had a lot of information. It was maybe 20-30 pages long, and I remember the font being a bit too large so I guess it was really meant for a younger audience. (It was the early 90s though, what kids learned QBasic in those days? Very few families even had computers in the Philippines then) \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eIt was extremely basic (pun intended), with pages dedicated to line numbers and print statements and if statements. I remember that most of the control flow discussion centered around the use of GOTO which I would later learn was very bad. But I was fascinated with the idea of programmable machines. That you could give this machine a set of instructions and it would do what you asked. For the first time, I had a glimpse of the mechanisms behind those video games I loved to play. I read that book cover to cover again and again. It seemed like the possibilities were endless. My imagination was set afire.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eSome time later, and for some reason I don’t remember anymore, my parents signed up me and my younger brother for some sort of computer usage basics class at the nearby mall. I think it was like 2 weeks of daily classes during one summer. The guy taught us stuff like how to use the command line (Windows wasn’t really a thing yet at that time). It’s kind of silly, but I don’t really know what else we were taught. The main thing I remember from those sessions was that my brother and I figured out how to render \u0026ldquo;art\u0026rdquo; to the screen by printing out extended ASCII characters using batch files. Whatever it was the guy was teaching us, we quickly devoured and went through, which gave us a lot of extra time. We used that time to simulate video game screens using the extended ascii characters. I remember we made something that looked like a Nintendo game title screen, with options to choose \u0026ldquo;1 PLAYER\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;2 PLAYER\u0026rdquo;. Of course, we didn’t really get anywhere.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eFast forward a bit more. I was in fourth-year high school when I had my first computer programming class. We had a new computer lab on the top floor of the school, where we learned the basics of using Turbo Pascal. By this time, we already had a personal computer at home, a 386 (slightly dated) whose main use at that time was playing games like \u003c/span\u003e_\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eSid Meier’s Civilization, Romance of the Three Kingdoms,\u003c/span\u003e_\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e.and \u003c/span\u003e_\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eDay of the Tentacle\u003c/span\u003e_\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e. I remember installing a copy of Turbo Pascal and teaching my brother how to use it. We may have had a book as reference, I’m not sure. (I assume we had a textbook for the class at school)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eNot soon after, he had already written some simple programs simulating the \u0026ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure\u0026rdquo; type of stories, what we would later know to be called Text Adventures. I remember his first \u0026ldquo;game\u0026rdquo; being something about a kid visiting a haunted mansion. Of course, it was mostly unfinished and you would not be able to get more than a few decisions in. I remember taking a look at his code and it was a complicated mess of print statements and conditionals and hardcoded decision checks. We had no concept of how to write good code then, although I do remember telling him that it wasn’t a good idea to have variables named like \u0026ldquo;v\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;vv\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;vvv\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;vvvv\u0026rdquo;, etc.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eJump ahead again a few years. I’m doing my thesis, soon to graduate as an Electronics and Communications Engineer. I had thought about taking up Computer Science, but in my youthful arrogance I felt like I already had a pretty good idea of programming and would find the actual course boring, based on my previous experiences. Despite that I had spent some time during the intervening years reading programming books and game development books I found in the Engineering library, and doing quite well in the data structures and algorithms class I had to take. For our thesis, we had to do a hardware part and a software part, and my thesismate easily agreed to let me do the software part; he knew how twitchy my hands were when working with hardware.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eSomehow, we managed to actually finish the thesis and graduate (quite delayed I might add), and I took a year off to \u0026ldquo;study for the board exam.\u0026rdquo; During that time, I sent out various job applications. I wasn’t yet sure where I would end up working, A few weeks after passing the board exams, I received a call from a software company based in Ortigas. They had received my application and asked me to come in for an exam. Um ok. I didn’t even remember sending an application in, I think it was one of many I sent out using Jobstreet. They were the only software company who contacted me. I believe at that time I was considering applying for a job at a small electronics company of the north side of the metro, closer to home (other opportunities for ECE graduates were more on the south side). I had no idea then what the local software industry looked like or whether it paid well or whatever, but I decided to try it out anyway. I ended up working at that company for more than ten years.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

I found it both inspiring (though some might consider me the wrong age to be inspired by it) and amusing as a look into the life of a young man in the early 80s. As a set of journal entries, the writing isn\u0026rsquo;t particularly spectacular, but it is an easy enough read, especially for someone with an interest in game development. You are not likely to learn anything for practical use for game development, unless of course you were planning to develop games for old-school Apple II or Commodore 64 platforms with limited amounts of memory to work with. I found it interesting mostly because the stories harken back to a bygone-era of game development, when the norm was the single developer working on all aspects of the game by himself all the while being a full-time student, and eventually getting published and making it to the top of the sales charts. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to reading the second book where he covers the creation of his second hit Prince of Persia\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/18436248-roy-tang\"\u003eView all my reviews\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

With recent events I\u0026rsquo;ve found myself getting into more discussions, debates and otherwise friendly arguments online. The quality of these interactions hasn\u0026rsquo;t always been the best, and many times I feel like I should have stopped engaging sooner or maybe not participated at all. I\u0026rsquo;ve considered some points to help me decide in the future whether to bother engaging other people online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonally, I\u0026rsquo;ve always been both used to and biased in favor of vibrant and open debate and discussion. And I\u0026rsquo;m happy to say many of my closest friends are of the same temperament. But one thing I\u0026rsquo;ve learned is that \u003cstrong\u003emany people don\u0026rsquo;t like their views being criticized\u003c/strong\u003e. For some people, posting on the internet is putting themselves out there and risking being criticized (as if receiving criticism were a bad thing in and of itself!). I do think that more people voicing their opinions can only be a good thing, so maybe we can try not to be so aggressive when we know the person doesn\u0026rsquo;t like criticism or isn\u0026rsquo;t used to an open debate. \u0026quot; I understand that you believe that, although have you considered the studies that say \u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1222\" style=\"width: 836px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"#f8dff1d9da1ba1bb035397e7cc6d0c49-lightbox\"\u003e\n    \u003cfigure\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"/2016/05/debating-on-the-internet/discussion_hu1e6b6f008ac53ad78a5c7d9e861c8940_109375_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\" alt=\"(Image cribbed from a friend)\" title=\"(Image cribbed from a friend)\" class=\"tn\" /\u003e\n      \u003cfigcaption\u003e(Image cribbed from a friend) (Click to view full-size)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox\" id=\"f8dff1d9da1ba1bb035397e7cc6d0c49-lightbox\" style=\"display: none;\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/2016/05/debating-on-the-internet/discussion.jpg\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"lightbox_overlay\"\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e(Image cribbed from a friend)\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ctime class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"24 May 2016 12:30am\"\u003e24 May 2016 12:30am\u003c/time\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_\"\u003eClose\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAccept that you are not going to \u0026ldquo;win\u0026rdquo; any debate.\u003c/strong\u003e From experience, it is very rare to win a debate on the internet.

It can be difficult, sometimes people can pretend to be open to discussion but really just want to reinforce their own views. It\u0026rsquo;s easiest if you already know the person. For example, if the person has a history of not believing easily-verifiable facts, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s better not to engage at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**Know what you are looking for. **Typically, there\u0026rsquo;s one of three things I want out of a discussion: (a) I want to gather more information to help in my own decision-making; or (b) I want to point out misinformation or logical problems; or (c) I want to present my own point of view for others to consider. If you\u0026rsquo;ve already met your goals, you can safely consider tapping out \u0026ldquo;I just wanted to say that I think X is a better choice. Take that as you will\u0026rdquo;. Of course sometimes there\u0026rsquo;s a fourth thing I want: just to engage in a lively discussion 😀\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAvoid attacking the other person\u003c/strong\u003e, even when he/she is obviously being a bloody idiot. Bloody idiots can have opinions too after all. It should be possible to point out logical flaws or misinformation without taking things personally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**If you are aiming to convince others to change their position, you should be willing to change yours as well. **Not only is it more sincere, it\u0026rsquo;s also fair. It will make your own arguments more compelling if you can show a willingness to question your own assumptions as well. That being said, you probably only need to employ this if the other people are willing to change their positions too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**Don\u0026rsquo;t take things personally, and don\u0026rsquo;t respond to criticism in anger. **If someone says something like your work is cringeworthy, instead of taking offense maybe you can ask the person to elaborate \u0026ldquo;Which parts did you find problematic and why?\u0026rdquo; If the person is not willing to discuss in detail, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s no longer productive to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKnow when to tap out of a discussion.\u003c/strong\u003e You have to learn to recognize when other people are (a) not willing to consider other points of view; or (b) not looking for a debate or discussion or pros and cons. It will usually become obvious once they reply one or two times (sometimes it will be bloody obvious when they say something like \u0026ldquo;I believe in X no matter what\u0026rdquo;). Unless you are really enjoying the debate (which I am sometimes wont to do!), it\u0026rsquo;s probably not productive anymore to continue discussion. In that case, it\u0026rsquo;s probably better to just agree to disagree and move on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m probably still going to occasionally dive into a debate just to be a devil\u0026rsquo;s advocate or even just for fun though, but hopefully these guidelines help me (and maybe even you!) recognize when it\u0026rsquo;s unproductive to engage and just to move on.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

It means that you are comfortable enough with yourself that you don’t mind talking about your own interests and passions when other people are interested and keeping quiet when they are not.

Here is a truth: every person can be boring or interesting to other people, it all depends on whether those other people share the same passions or culture with you. I work in software development, so when I encounter another software developer in the wild, we can easily have good conversations even if we are strangers. Being a true person facilitates this: when people see that you are honest and open and unpretentious, those who share your interests and passions will be more likely to gravitate to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from that, one other tip I can give you is: be interested in other people. What you think of other people matters more to them, so if you show interest in them, they are more likely to show an interest in you. This means being willing to listen to them and their stories to figure out where their interest lies, and asking them questions to make them elaborate on those interests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing a true person helps here too, because people can easily spot fake interest. Be genuinely interested in other people. Even if you dislike another person, try to find something about him that you find interesting and try to make him talk more about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
