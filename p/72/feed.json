            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eEver since I came of age, I\u0026rsquo;ve exercised my right (and duty) to vote in every election that comes around. Except for Barangay/SK elections. I\u0026rsquo;ve never voted in Barangay elections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand that voting is a civic duty, and I have no real justification for shirking it. But the fact is that my level of awareness re: barangay-level government is very low. I have no idea what their responsibilities or jurisdiction is supposed to be. I know they have some sort of role in dispute resolution, low level law enforcement, and disaster relief efforts, but that\u0026rsquo;s about it. If I have a local issue, I\u0026rsquo;m not likely to think about bringing it up to the Barangay. To be fair, bringing it up to the Mayor\u0026rsquo;s office wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be my first thought either, but I\u0026rsquo;d definitely think of that before the Barangay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil today, I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know what geographic scope was covered by my Barangay. (I looked it up just now.) I had no idea who were the incumbent Barangay captain and kagawads. I have never had need to conduct business with them. The things that concern me about the government are more often city-wide (traffic) or nation-wide (taxes, internet, bloody anti-crime campaigns, loss of national territory) in scope. There\u0026rsquo;s also the perception that many Barangays are largely a waste of taxpayer money with many of the officials being useless people who mainly indulge in meaningless projects like local basketball leagues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that there is very little information about the candidates for those positions. Their campaign posters are little more than faces and names, indistinguishable from one another. They try to make \u0026ldquo;clever\u0026rdquo; initialisms to improve name recall but such attempts always fall flat. They annoy residents with their blaring campaign jingles that are all medley and no substance. Even if I decided to today to troop to the voting center and choose for someone to vote, I would have no idea who would be deserving. To be fair, the same criticisms can be said of the campaigns for national office \u0026ndash; but in those cases there is often a lot more information available about the candidates from other sources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand that this is partially my fault \u0026ndash; I don\u0026rsquo;t really engage much with the community. If I really wanted to, I suppose they had some sort of miting de avance that I could have attended to get more information about the candidates. Or maybe I could have gotten into more discussions with others in my local community to find out more. Unfortunately, engaging in the community at that level might require more social effort than I am willing to spend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also understand that my situation is partly the result of privilege. The privilege of not needing to invoke the services of this particular branch of local government and thus not really caring too much about them. It might even make some kind of sense that the ones voting on those positions would be the ones who are more affected by it, and not people like me who hardly interact with the Barangay at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a bid to understand more, I started a \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/8gxjep/do_you_find_the_barangay_to_be_a_relevant_andor/\"\u003ereddit thread about it\u003c/a\u003e. The responses mostly confirm my perception that the Barangay matters more for poor people and that there are a lot of incompetent/useless Barangay officials. The best answer tells us there is a significant gap between the current state of the Barangay and the ideal state, and that a good Barangay would do wonders for the residents. I\u0026rsquo;m not certain what would need to be done to close that gap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s too late for me to vote in today\u0026rsquo;s elections given my lack of knowledge. Maybe in the future it\u0026rsquo;s something I can look into.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eGoogle recently had a demo of their new AI assistant Duplex at Google IO 2018:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"\u003e\n  \u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bd1mEm2Fy08\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s an amazing demo to watch, from an engineering perspective. Basically a combination of natural language processing + text-to-speech that can emulate human speaking patterns. It\u0026rsquo;s not that much of a breakthrough (more like putting several different things together), but it\u0026rsquo;s impressive and is a good indicator of where we are with regards to true conversant AI. On the other hand, it\u0026rsquo;s a staged demo, it\u0026rsquo;s yet to be seen how robust the technology will turn out to be in real life. And I doubt it passes the Turing test. The ovation from the crowd was understandable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the technical aspect, there is another concern that many in the tech community (outside of the crowd) immediately raised though: this is deception. In the demo, the assistant calls up restaurants and basically pretends to be a real human. It adds \u0026ldquo;umms\u0026rdquo; and other human-like pauses to sound like a human. Not only is that deception, it\u0026rsquo;s creepy deception. And totally unnecessary for the proposed use cases. If it was obviously a bot calling a restaurant to make a reservation, it could still work, the staff receiving the call would just need to get used to it. People already know how to talk to voicemail and answering machines and dial-in menus so it\u0026rsquo;s not too far of a leap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s problematic from an ethics point of view so there was some blowback. Google got the hint, and soon after announced that they were staying ahead of the ethical concerns and that \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/10/17342414/google-duplex-ai-assistant-voice-calling-identify-itself-update\"\u003ethe AI will declare itself to the other party\u003c/a\u003e. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t erase the concerns about what happens when this kind of technology becomes widespread and available outside of Google though. (This may not be a concern for a long time to come, since the computational power involved here is almost certainly not yet available to the normal consumer.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is an understandable fear. While we have reaped the benefits of technological advances over the past couple of decades, there are almost always bad actors that use the new technology for nefarious purposes. Mostly scams or to try to sell you things. See: emails from Nigerian princes, spam SMS messages trying to get you to transfer load, social media bots trying to promote their agenda, and so on. The future scenario of some bad guy robocalling your non-tech savvy parents and trying to scam them is not too far-fetched. One can assume regulation or such would keep them in line, but as you know, bad guys don\u0026rsquo;t always follow the rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScience fiction of course is replete with examples of AI that can mimic human communications, such as Iron Man\u0026rsquo;s Jarvis or the droids from Star Wars, or Data from Star Trek. I believe none of those examples have human \u0026ldquo;umms\u0026rdquo; probably because that seems obviously creepy for some reason. (They do use human expressions of course, like C3PO\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Oh my goodness!\u0026quot;). I\u0026rsquo;m also reminded of Tad Williams\u0026rsquo; \u003cem\u003eOtherworld\u003c/em\u003e series of books, of which I don\u0026rsquo;t remember much but I do recall that AIs were required to answer truthfully if asked whether they were AIs. (It was very insulting to ask a human if it was an AI.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven how much we are able to imagine it, such tech is probably inevitable in the trajectory of human advancement (assuming we don\u0026rsquo;t bomb ourselves to extinction). I\u0026rsquo;m sure eventually humanity will be able to adapt (soon inbound phone calls will require some kind of captcha), but there\u0026rsquo;s bound to be some transition time where it\u0026rsquo;s problematic.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
