            <title>Thoughts on Tech Censorship and Social Media
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/tech-censorship/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/tech-censorship/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Discussions on tech censorship came to the forefront in recent weeks due to the aftermath of the Jan 6 capitol insurrection in the US. I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing down a bunch of thoughts about the complicated issue, let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can hammer them into a blog post. (I also wanted to defer posting about it until after the Biden inauguration, in case more things of interest happen.) Here&amp;rsquo;s where I am now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;trump&#34;&gt;Trump&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so first Trump (or anyone) getting kicked off Twitter (or any service) for TOS violations (inciting violence etc). it&amp;rsquo;s kind of a free speech issue, except the censorship is being done by a private entity, so it specifically doesn&amp;rsquo;t violate the US first amendment. I think that without question, I agree that social media platforms have a right to pick and choose what they allow on their platforms (except those that they aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to discriminate against, by law, like race, religion, etc). And Trump absolutely violated ToS by inciting the Jan 6 riots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are thinking this is a free speech issue because being deplatformed feels similar to being escorted off and banned from a public square. Of course, if you were on a public square goading people to raid govt buildings and kill elected officials, a lot of people would you want you dragged away from there anyway. That being said, I think the bigger issue is why have we these tech companies/platforms that are being treated as de facto public squares in the first place. It feels like we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have allowed them to grow to this size/amount of influence in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re on the fence as to whether this was a correct decision, there is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/misinformation-dropped-dramatically-the-week-after-twitter-banned-trump/ar-BB1cOqVP&#34;&gt;research that says misinformation dropped drastically after Twitter kicked off Trump&lt;/a&gt;, so that as you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll circle back to social media platforms/public square stuff in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;parler&#34;&gt;Parler&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Parler. In theory, Parler could have become a competing public square, in fact that&amp;rsquo;s one of the things it&amp;rsquo;s doing. But Parler itself has been deplatformed, not just by Google/Apple, but by the webhost, AWS. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any opinions either way about the app stores kicking them out (although I will say Apple is more egregious, since there&amp;rsquo;s no alternative to Apple&amp;rsquo;s app store on iOS), but AWS kicking them out seems more problematic. It is a bit analogous to a landlord kicking out a tenant from their building because they are doing illegal things, like maybe running a meth lab? So by that analogy it can be justified. Technically, the discussions on Parler aren&amp;rsquo;t directly violent, but they are planning violence. So, can a landlord evict a tenant because his space was being used to plot violence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the landlord analogy, they could always just find another landlord, but few compare in scale and capability to Amazon. So this may be another case of monopolies being problematic. They could also just host the content themselves, build their own datacenter etc. It&amp;rsquo;s akin to saying you can just buy/build your own house if no one is willing to let you rent one. It&amp;rsquo;s true, but not very pragmatic in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My gut is that AWS kicking Parler off was justified, because Parler wasn&amp;rsquo;t making a good-faith effort to manage harmful content on their platform, but it still leaves a worse taste in the mouth than the Trump/Twitter. scenario&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s super dumb to be planning these things in public anyway! Why don&amp;rsquo;t they get private forums, those are still things right? Or even a private FB group. Can FB ban them for discussions in a private group? Maybe. Or why don&amp;rsquo;t they all join those QAnon forums or whatever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-should-social-media-platforms-change&#34;&gt;How should social media platforms change?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circling back to my earlier assertion, I don&amp;rsquo;t think social media platforms should be liable for what their users post. To me, this seems sensible on its face, otherwise no one would bother hosting content posted by other people (which I don&amp;rsquo;t mind, I have a website.) I also think platforms are well within their rights to filter what is or is not allowed to be posted on their platforms. (See above.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(There&amp;rsquo;s a whole side discussion about section 230 of the US CDA where conservatives are thinking repealing platform protections provided by that law would step them from censoring people, but that seems completely wrong. I&amp;rsquo;m not an American though, so I don&amp;rsquo;t particularly care.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think however, that platforms should be held responsible for promoting, recommending or otherwise broadcasting harmful content via their algorithmic &amp;ldquo;timelines&amp;rdquo;, as that is more of an editorial decision than anything else. Think of it in terms of, if I was a content curator who recommended stuff to my followers, and I started recommending or promoting things illegal things like child porn or criminal stuff, I should absolutely be held accountable. The less that platforms promote harmful material, the less likely they are to gather steam and influece. Don&amp;rsquo;t give harmful people megaphones! &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hankgreen/status/1351736509095792640&#34;&gt;Related twitter thread I read recently talking about this very same thing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the platforms aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to use recommendation engines, what then? I would suggest that strictly chronological timelines should be fine, with no judgment made by the platform as to whether individual posts should be seen outside of that order or by people who aren&amp;rsquo;t subscribed to those sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ads, I think platforms should be liable for what ads they allow to run. And information should be publicly available for whoever paid for the ad. If someone advertises something illegal in real life, law enforcement needs to be able to track them down. And probably we should avoid targeted advertising as well. I think showing ads depending on what topics the user follows might be ok, assuming the topics aren&amp;rsquo;t super specific. For example, if the user follows a lot of politics, showing political ads might be ok, as long as the user is exposed to all flavors of political ads (i.e. ads from all sides). Definitely something that can still be refined. (And it goes without saying, if the platforms can&amp;rsquo;t do targeted advertising, they would be less inclined to siphon off all your personal data? Or is that too naive?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think stuff like Twitter&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;trending topics&amp;rdquo; section is fine, as long as it&amp;rsquo;s not super localized, i.e. you get a sense of what everyone is talking about, not just people in your bubble or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: I will agree not all algorithmic recommendations are bad. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching a lot of British TV show clips on Youtube recently, and YT keeps recommending more, so I watch more, and it&amp;rsquo;s fine, it&amp;rsquo;s entertaining. That said, I would willingly give up those recommendations in exchange for the above. After all, people can always curate and provide recommendations manually (and they can be held liable or banned if needed!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;regulation-and-monopolies&#34;&gt;Regulation and Monopolies&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately social media platforms aren&amp;rsquo;t likely to do the above changes on their own, as avoiding algorithmic recommendations cuts into their &amp;ldquo;engagement&amp;rdquo; or whatever BS metric they choose to use. So it would have to be enforced by some kind of government regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of talk about regulating big tech in the US government, but most of it centers on splitting up larger companies like Facebook and Google. I think that while this is not necessarily a wrong approach, it won&amp;rsquo;t be super useful. The monopoly power these large companies have doesn&amp;rsquo;t come directly from the services they offer but rather from the size of their userbase. (Which admittedly, is influenced by the services they offer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would suggest instead is to cut into that userbase monopoly by requiring the platforms to implement open standards for external services to subscribe/follow publicly-available content published on their platform. It can be something simple like RSS or something a bit more complicated like how Mastodon implements ActivityPub. Private comms/DMs can be via open protocols too like XMPP. (Or email! Remember email?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is, if I want to follow someone on Facebook, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to be required to have a Facebook account. This is part of the reason why so many people find it hard to leave Facebook - a lot of the people they follow and want to keep in touch with are there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t believe it would be necessary to require platforms to do the opposite thing - allow their users to follow users on other platforms - because users would just naturally prefer any platform that does implement such a feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requiring open protocols would remove the whole &amp;ldquo;public square&amp;rdquo; problem because now instead of having 1 or 2 de facto public squares, we can have as many as we want. Official government feeds could be hosted on their own servers instead of being forced to publish via Facebook or Twitter, and the public could still follow them from the platform of their choice. Same goes for influencers, brands, companies, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might think this would make it easier to distribute harmful content and harder to censor it, but as we can see on the open web, the opposite is true: harmful content is difficult to stumble upon normally (you have to be specifically looking for it) and can easily be punished, which is why we don&amp;rsquo;t see a lot of openly operating child porn websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;in-conclusion&#34;&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a whole lot of words, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have a conclusion. Like I said, complicated issue. (And I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are some easy flaws in my assertions above, I haven&amp;rsquo;t spent more than an hour thinking these through.) But these are discussions we should be having, and at least some of what I&amp;rsquo;ve outlined are above are options that are worth considering, given how harmful and divisive we have found the current social media paradigm to be. I still believe in the promise of the internet in bringing people and the world together - but we need to be doing it in a smart and responsible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;rrl&#34;&gt;RRL&lt;/h4&gt;

Repost from hankgreen https://twitter.com/hankgreen/statuses/1351736514762313728/:
            &lt;p&gt;Platforms should not be responsible for a person making awful content. They are absolutely responsible when they put it in front of people who didn’t even know it existed. They should know the difference between hosting awful content and choosing to broadcast it. We all should.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;2021 movie no. 3: World War Z (2013). Pretty typical action movie I think, entertaining enough. Should have watched at the start of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I see some people posting like &amp;ldquo;why are you all excited about biden, the US is still going to be imperialist/not progressive enough/whatever&amp;rdquo; and i&amp;rsquo;m like ugh sure whatever, lots of room for improvement still, but did you actually prefer trump?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US just kicked out a racist, misogynistic, egocentric sociopath president, let them enjoy that for a little bit maybe? There&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of people willing to push their admin for reforms either.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Book Review: The End of Everything by Katie Mack

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I finished the book The End of Everything (Astronomically Speaking) by Katie Mack. I got a Kindle copy on sale on Amazon at the top of the year, figured it was a good way to kick off a year of hopefully reading more books. This is a short review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figure it&amp;rsquo;s probably not a spoiler to tell you the book is all about how the universe ends. Or at least, the many possible ways it could end. The book gives a surface-level walkthrough of what we know about the nature, history and future of our universe through the lenses of physics and cosmology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me more than a couple of weeks to get through the book, as each chapter does discuss some challenging topics and I wanted to make sure I mostly got my head around it before continuing. I suspect those with less background in the sciences might have a bit of trouble with the text, but the author tries her best to not be too complicated (which can be challenging given the subject matter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that the text or prose is boring mind you. The author spices things up with a few humorous jabs here and there, although it might depend on your sense of humor. The author&amp;rsquo;s wit reminds me a bit of British-style humor, like in The Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy, so YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are able to power through the book, you are rewarded with a fascinating view of the current state of our knowledge of physics and cosmology, of how far we&amp;rsquo;ve come and much we still don&amp;rsquo;t know and how much there is yet to be discovered. Perhaps those who have not much background in science will come away with a deeper understanding of how scientific theories are formed, improved, discarded, iterated upon, and so on. I came away with a better understanding of things like the cosmic background radiation, dark matter, dark energy, and so on. Fascinating stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend the book to anyone with even a passing interest in physics. And even if you didn&amp;rsquo;t have such an interest, you could try it anyway, and maybe that will change.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;PRRD said that its unfair that only UP &amp;amp; PUP have a pact&amp;hellip; I completely agree!!!! So why not enter into a similar pact with ALL THE OTHER UNIVERSITIES or, better yet, pass a law that will guaramtee this to ALL UNIVERSITIES instead of abrogating these two. #TrustTheFilipinoYouth&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This is 2021 week 3. Or week 2. Two and a half? How do calendars work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;relatively calm compared to the chaos of the previous week. However in the US, a storm may be brewing over Biden&amp;rsquo;s inauguration next week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;locally: still a lot of confusion/inconsistencies around the vaccination plan. Or at least &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/01/17/2071005/senate-seeks-further-hearings-vaccines&#34;&gt;some senators think so&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, we are close to breaching 500k cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot about personal note taking recently, in a bid to find ways to improve my own systems. I skimmed this book from like 2004ish: &lt;a href=&#34;https://users.speakeasy.net/~lion/nb/html/&#34;&gt;How to Make a Complete Map of Every Thought You Think&lt;/a&gt;, which is like a super paper-heavy system. Probably totally impractical (for me at least), but some ideas there worth considering. The modern day equivalent would be something like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/&#34;&gt;Zettelkasten method&lt;/a&gt;, something I&amp;rsquo;ve also been considering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I read this Substack &lt;a href=&#34;https://paulskallas.substack.com/p/is-culture-stuck&#34;&gt;post about culture being stuck in the mid-2000s&lt;/a&gt;, presumably because the Internet became mainstream and people started forming a hivemind around what was popular, and creators responded accordingly by creating more of the same stuff. I think there&amp;rsquo;s still some space for fringe tastes out there, but it is true that pop culture has seemed monolothic recently. What hits me most from the article is the phasing out of rock n roll in favor of hip hop, because a more diverse crowd favors it. I&amp;rsquo;m not really a hip hop person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cory Doctorow &lt;a href=&#34;https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/&#34;&gt;blogs about his daily linkblogging process&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate 20 years of blogging. This reminded me that during my recent blog-hopping I also ran across &lt;a href=&#34;https://althouse.blogspot.com/2021/01/another-bloggiversary-this-blog-is-17.html&#34;&gt;Ann Althouse&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt;, which has been posting daily for 17 years without breaking the streak! I kind of wish I could be that prolific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald%27s_Restaurants&#34;&gt;McDonald&amp;rsquo;s coffee lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, often held up as an example of frivolous ambulance-chasing lawsuits, was much more complicated than that. The woman was hospitalized for more than a week and had to have skin grafts, and McDonald&amp;rsquo;s refused to settle for more than $800, which wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have even covered medical expenses, leading to the huge jury award.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tom Critchlow asks &lt;a href=&#34;https://tomcritchlow.com/2021/01/14/new-browsers/&#34;&gt;why we can&amp;rsquo;t write code in our browsers&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel B. Markham argues that &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielbmarkham.com/the-platform-is-the-enemy/&#34;&gt;platforms might be turning us into idiots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this (kinda old) story about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.damninteresting.com/who-wants-to-be-a-thousandaire&#34;&gt;a guy who hacked a TV game show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not a big fan of Tiktok, but I admit I have been enjoying some of the sea shanty performances coming out of it. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/etelsverdlov/status/1348654717036093440&#34;&gt;Example one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/EKingstonBooks/status/1349906687537373189&#34;&gt;example two&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PH stuff: A trailer came out for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ4ChZPlikM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&#34;&gt;Voltes V Legacy&lt;/a&gt;, which will be airing on GMA. I don&amp;rsquo;t have high expectations, but the animation seemed decent enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily sketches in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt;. I used to crosspost them all to &lt;a href=&#34;https://instagram.com/roytang0400&#34;&gt;instagram&lt;/a&gt; pretty consistently, but now I only do it when I feel like it. Been thinking of getting off instagram anyway, but that&amp;rsquo;s something for another time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finished &lt;strong&gt;Spectacular Spider-Man&lt;/strong&gt; on Netflix. I liked it, even if it was a kids&amp;rsquo; show. Too bad it was cut off abruptly due to licensing issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also started (re-?) watching Attack on Titan, from season 1, as the final season has been getting some hype. Anime is hard to background-watch though (due to subs), so this might take a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched my first two movies of the year: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1350042544567029763/&#34;&gt;The Godfather&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1350361902149324800/&#34;&gt;The Godfather Part II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First two eps of WandaVision are in! It&amp;rsquo;s so weird. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing how things unfold. Series runs until March, I feel like I should do one of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/spoiler-free-review/&#34;&gt;spoiler-free reviews&lt;/a&gt; when it&amp;rsquo;s done (haven&amp;rsquo;t done any of those in a while) but it feels weird to do it for a show that drops weekly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1349796416042856448/&#34;&gt;Fire Emblem Three Houses&lt;/a&gt;! Will probably kick off the 2nd run sometime this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG: &lt;strong&gt;Kaldheim&lt;/strong&gt; preview season in progress. I am fairly excited for the new set to come in, because I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to draft, the limited environment looks exciting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I feel like I should be starting one of the many Steam RPGs on my backlog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books: Been reading Katie Mack&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;End of Everything&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;m around 2/3rds in, so hopefully I can finish it and at least get 1 book in this month lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health: My muscle pains in the left upper arm are still there, although they&amp;rsquo;ve tapered off a bit, I think because I&amp;rsquo;ve been applying warm compresses twice a day for most of the week. Hopefully it will be gone by next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward-to-this-coming-week&#34;&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biden inauguration (chaos?!?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometime this week, I will probably put on pants for the first time since March.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;2021 #movies no 2: The Godfather part 2 (1974). This is two movies rolled into one. Still pretty good, but I think I liked the singular focus of the first one more.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;2021 movies no. 1: The Godfather (1972). Everyone is so young! Such a well-told gangster tale. Looking forward to the sequel&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Fun use of the counters to get around memory issues in paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it only has the flying counter -&amp;gt; it&amp;rsquo;s a 4/4 Spirit Warrior Angel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it has the flying counter and the 2 +1/+1s -&amp;gt; It has the Ophidian ability&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If the +1/+1s get removed, you start to get confused.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no counter to help with the 2/3 mode.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Finally finished #FireEmblem #ThreeHouses, or one run at least! Doing the other two might take a while!   #NintendoSwitch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, I could have gotten a much better screenshot from the ending I suppose, but I&amp;rsquo;m too lazy to go back and get one lol&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;OK, I don&amp;rsquo;t have high expectations or anything, but that trailer animation was pretty good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voltes V: Legacy, soon on GMA! &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ4ChZPlikM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ4ChZPlikM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/YouTube/&#34;&gt;@YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m wondering how Arena will handle using Foretell when some of the cards in the opponent&amp;rsquo;s hand are revealed to you, since the card you exile with foretell should be hidden information. i.e., if I thoughtseize you and you&amp;rsquo;re holding 3 different foretell cards, then during your turn you pay 2 and exile one of them, the other 2 should no longer be revealed to me, since I would be able to deduce which card was exiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have they made any statement about this? I&amp;rsquo;m not super confident they&amp;rsquo;d handle it well lol.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;There will be people who leave your life without closure and sometimes even many years after you thought you’d moved on, they will appear in your dreams and you will find that the sadness remains&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Philippines. Very little impact as few people use it here. The dominant messaging apps here are Messenger and Viber&lt;/p&gt;
