            &lt;p&gt;Invincible season 1 finale was pretty great, the fight was intense and afterwards I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe there was still half an episode to go. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I read the books so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure, but I think they diverged a bit from the source material, but it&amp;rsquo;s fine.&lt;!--sep--&gt;The series was developed well enough, decent pacing and enough to portray the major characters well. Looking forward to season 2!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Phrases like &amp;ldquo;insufficient evidence&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;no proof&amp;rdquo; does nothing to dissuade people whose arguments are along the lines of &amp;ldquo;it can&amp;rsquo;t hurt to try&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;maybe it will help&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;cite class=&#34;u-quotation-of h-cite&#34;&gt;
    Quoted &lt;a  href=&#39;https://twitter.com/reportrdotworld/status/1388063075199225856&#39;&gt;reportrdotworld&amp;#39;s tweet&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOH and FDA reminded the public that they do not recommend the use of Ivermectin to treat #COVID19 due to insufficient scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reportr.world/news/doh-fda-do-not-recommend-ivermectin-for-covid-a4736-20210430?utm_source=Twitter-reportr&amp;amp;utm_medium=Ownshare&amp;amp;utm_campaign=20210430-twnp-news-doh-fda-do-not-recommend-ivermectin-for-covid-a4736-20210430-twfirst&#34;&gt;https://www.reportr.world/news/doh-fda-do-not-recommend-ivermectin-for-covid-a4736-20210430?utm_source=Twitter-reportr&amp;amp;utm_medium=Ownshare&amp;amp;utm_campaign=20210430-twnp-news-doh-fda-do-not-recommend-ivermectin-for-covid-a4736-20210430-twfirst&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug actively harming people would be more effective but the disadvantage of relying on science is that we can&amp;rsquo;t just make claims like that without evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Friday afternoon Strixhaven draft! &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&#34;&gt;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&lt;/a&gt; #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgstrixhaven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I drafted a couple of decent yet average decks, but didn&amp;rsquo;t perform too well, had a couple of bad draws. A poor end to my Strixhaven premiere draft run&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Last night I accidentally watched most of the latter part of Green Hornet (2011) starring Seth Rogen. I never new he portrayed this character! Movie was reasonable popcorn action-comedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently the bundle is part of the normal package I got when I signed up for my plan, except the first 24mo were free. So when the 24mo were up, they automatically charge me for it.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Throwing away gems on Strixhaven draft(s?)! &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&#34;&gt;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&lt;/a&gt; #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgstrixhaven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet was weird today so stream was on and off. Probably won&amp;rsquo;t have the full episode on YT (maybe just the last few matches). But spoiler alert: I was able to break my unlucky streak with some Quandrix + Prismari goodness!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I was able to record the draft itself locally, so this draft has two videos. In order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 1 (draft): &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skUg-kWzq_g&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skUg-kWzq_g&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 2 (last few matches): &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuXcPVm0YQ&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuXcPVm0YQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Math and Privilege
</title>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/someone-has-to-run-the-fabs&#34;&gt;a recent STEM-focused newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, Noahpinion talked a bit about the myth of math being an inborn ability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again, we have seen the following pattern repeat itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different kids with different levels of preparation come into a math class. Some of these kids have parents who have drilled them on math from a young age, while others never had that kind of parental input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first few tests, the well-prepared kids get perfect scores, while the unprepared kids get only what they could figure out by winging it—maybe 80 or 85%, a solid B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unprepared kids, not realizing that the top scorers were well-prepared, assume that genetic ability was what determined the performance differences. Deciding that they “just aren’t math people,” they don’t try hard in future classes, and fall further behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-prepared kids, not realizing that the B students were simply unprepared, assume that they are “math people,” and work hard in the future, cementing their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, people’s belief that math ability can’t change becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I touched upon this in passing in a post last week about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/programming-is-hard/&#34;&gt;programming being hard&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people may make it look easy, because they may have a bit more aptitude than others (due to background or whatever), in the same way that some people find math easy and others find it nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about this after a convo with some friends where they mentioned they were teaching their kids to play &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtg&#34;&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; at a young age, since it helps them practice simple arithmetic. It seems like a simple thing, but that kind of thing contributes towards the kids being &amp;ldquo;prepared&amp;rdquo; for a better math education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad also made a comment last week about how when we were young they (our parents) would often be bringing home activity books for us. Basically books with number puzzles, crossword puzzles, logic puzzles, that kind of thing. I loved those activity books! Among other things, I&amp;rsquo;m sure that contributed to my love of math and problem solving, which often appears as &amp;ldquo;natural aptitude&amp;rdquo; to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a form of privilege: parents having the time and energy and know-how to instill additional knowledge in their kid from a young age. I can&amp;rsquo;t expect poor to lower-class people who work hard all day and are tired at night to be able to do that. So less privileged kids tend to grow up thinking they are bad at math, and they have trouble teaching their kids, and the vicious cycle perpetuates itself and inequality grows in succeeding generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During lunchtime on weekdays, I often find myself watching reruns of a certain local quiz show shown on cable TV, and I find myself alternating between laughter and frustration whenever one of the contestants fail a simple math question. Things like &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s the decimal equivalent of 3 and a half percent&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s 75% of 200&amp;rdquo; - questions I&amp;rsquo;d expect any elementary school graduate should be able to do. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to shake your head and blame the poor education system in this country - which is certainly a factor, but I can&amp;rsquo;t help but consider how this kind of inequality, compounding across generations, also contributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do? Adults who grew up without this privilege often think their case is hopeless. &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mahina lang talaga ako sa math&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just really bad at math&amp;rdquo;), people often lament, as if it were some innate ability that they were not fortunate enough to acquire at character creation. And even if they wanted to get better at math, most will not have the time or energy to do so, due to daily life struggles. I would guess at some level it&amp;rsquo;s also a bit harder for such adults to re-learn math as their brains have already been wired not to think that way. It&amp;rsquo;s probably not an insurmountable handicap like a physical injury, but it can be challenging nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just rambling. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a point, nor a solution. I don&amp;rsquo;t know where this post was going.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;the-jam&#34;&gt;The jam&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thing I did last weekend was to participate in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48&#34;&gt;the 48th LUDUM DARE game jam&lt;/a&gt;. Doing gamedev has been a long-time elusive dream of mine, all the way back to my college years. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a number of failed attempts to get into gamedev, both solo and with other people.I&amp;rsquo;ve also played around with things like PyGame, &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2017/01/10155238560218912/&#34;&gt;Unity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2020/11/1326919888472956928/&#34;&gt;DragonRuby&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read about the LD48 game jam this April and signed up to participate. My expectations weren&amp;rsquo;t very high and I was anxious going on; I was pretty sure I was not going to do well and doubted I could even put things together. I had never done a Ludum Dare or a game jam before, heck I haven&amp;rsquo;t even made anything I consider a &amp;ldquo;real game&amp;rdquo; before!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game jam has two modes you can choose to submit to. The 72-hour version (called the &amp;ldquo;Jam&amp;rdquo;) was easier, as you could have a team of people working together, and you could use any assets you had legal access to. The 48-hour version, called the &amp;ldquo;Compo&amp;rdquo; (which I guess is short for competitive?), is much more challenging. You can only work solo, and all assets must be created within the 48 hour period (with a few exceptions like fonts etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no intention of working with a team; in fact I didn&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone I planned to participate until after the jam started last Saturday at 9AM local time. I figured I would try my best and if I finished within 48h, I would submit for the jam. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t, I had an extra 24h to try for the compo, and I could even ask for help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That meant I would be working alone, which meant I would have to do things like art and sounds and music! I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any experience doing pixel art for games or anything like that, so I figured I could get by on &amp;ldquo;programmer art&amp;rdquo;. For sound effects, I knew there were online generators I could use, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried some before. Background music was the real challenge: I have no musical talent at all, so even if I could find tools to do it, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know how to put anything together. These were problems for me 48h into the future though. When the jam started, I just dove in to code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, not really. I woke up late and had to do some errands so I missed the start time by a couple of hours. Still, I dove right in as soon as I was free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-tools&#34;&gt;The tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the gamedev/programming part, I decided to use the Godot Engine game development framework. I had been trying it out since earlier this year, and I was pretty happy with it compared to Unity. The IDE was a lot lighter, the APIs felt more intuitive, and basically it made it easier for me to get into the guts of a game. Unity is great, but it always seemed geared towards 3D gamedev. Godot makes 2D gamedev feel like a first class citizen. I prefer working on 2D because I feel like that&amp;rsquo;s something more achieveable for me as an indie. Doing sprites and such is more in my wheelhouse than 3D models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the art, I&amp;rsquo;ve never tried any pixel art creation tools before, so I just searched online. I settled on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.piskelapp.com&#34;&gt;Piskel&lt;/a&gt; which had the advantages of (a) being free; and (b) running entirely in-browser, without needing me to create an account. Very low friction! I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried such tools before so I was impressed with how mature they were. There were functions similar to what you&amp;rsquo;d find in paint, plus support for layers and export to various formats, including into spritesheets. It was perfect for what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sound effects, I used another free online site &lt;a href=&#34;https://sfxr.me/&#34;&gt;JSFXR&lt;/a&gt;. Basically just kept rolling one of the settings until I got a sound I like. Godot&amp;rsquo;s AudioStreamPlayer didn&amp;rsquo;t seem like it accepted WAVs, so I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://convertio.co/wav-ogg/&#34;&gt;convert.io&lt;/a&gt; to convert the files to OGG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For background music, a friend suggested I tried &lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinesequencer.net/&#34;&gt;Online Sequencer&lt;/a&gt;. I tried it out for a while, banging out random notes since I knew nothing about how to compose music. I looked at a few interesting ones created by other people and tried to adjust the random notes I was banging out to better follow the patterns I saw. I still don&amp;rsquo;t understand, but I was able to create a couple of tracks I was fairly happy with (they sounded like music!) which I used as BGM in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also used one of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/sketchdaily&#34;&gt;sketchdaily&lt;/a&gt; attempts to generate some &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/04/1385956018509664263/&#34;&gt;splash screen/cover art&lt;/a&gt; for the game. The final game used a slightly cleaned up and modified version of that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also needed a Dynamic font, since using Godot&amp;rsquo;s built-in fonts didn&amp;rsquo;t allow me to resize text. The Compo rules allow you to use fonts you didn&amp;rsquo;t make during the jam, so I just used Xolonium-Regular from one of the Godot tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-game&#34;&gt;The game&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme of the jam was &lt;strong&gt;DEEPER and DEEPER&lt;/strong&gt;, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d go the easy route and do something with digging or undersea exploration. I felt like digging would be the more common approach, so I went the other way, since I&amp;rsquo;m a contrarian. I decided to do something inspired by things like the underwater level in TMNT (NES) or the underwater level in Earthworm Jim (SNES). These were the frustrating underwater levels I grew up with, so I wanted to replicate that experience a bit. Basically moving around underwater, with a time limit and trying to avoid obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the idea was to have a deep-sea diver exploring underwater. But for some reason the ocean is full of spikes, so he has to keep moving and swimming to avoid them. All the while trying to go deeper and deeper. I added in a few enemies like jellyfish that acted as moving obstacles, and seeker fish that actively tried to chase you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also added an oxygen tank mechanic to serve as the timer. The tank would be getting depleted constantly as you kept breathing and you had to avoid running out. There would be little things that generate air bubbles you can pick up to increase your oxygen level (this part was inspired by the 3d mario games). Initially the bubble generator was just a jar, but later I changed the sprite to a clam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also decided to add a collectible in the form of gems that you can pick up on your way down. Basically to add more things to do in each stage. And it added a bit of risk-reward mechanics: should I waste time trying to get this gem, when I might run out of air or get hit by enemies? When I added it I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how the gems would be relevant in the game. I eventually decided to have the player earn extra lives whenever he collects 5 gems. The initial gem sprite was a diamond but later changed to a pearl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the basic gameplay: Avoid obstacles, collect gems, avoid running out of air, try to get as deep as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controls were simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your diver is constantly sinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can move left or right using arrow keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can swim up (or bounce, in my internal terms) by pressing space bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bounce was kind of a flappy bird bounce: you hit spacebar and you go up by a fixed amount after which you begin sinking again. I wanted the controls to be not too smooth so that you needed to know the bounce distance really well to navigate tighter corridors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had something basic working, I showed it to some friends to get some feedback, and got some good ideas and bug reports from them. (I figured showing it to other people and getting suggestions was fine within the compo rules, as long as I did all the actual creation work myself!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of Saturday (around 16h after jam start, 32h before compo deadline), I was mostly done with all the mechanics and gameplay and such. But content was lacking: I only had five screens (&amp;ldquo;stages&amp;rdquo;) for the player to navigate through, which I felt was too short. Creating levels was fairly straightforward though once I had all the components ready. The feedback from my friends was also pretty good. By this point I was fairly confident I could finish in time, and probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t lose too much sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent Sunday working more on the game, in between a bunch of family errands. I added another five levels, and fixed a lot of bugs. By the end of day Sunday (around 9h before compo deadline), I was ready to submit. Godot lets me export both to web and to Windows binaries. I could have also exported to other OSes, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to test them. I was originally planning to host the game here on this site, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t decide how / where to put them in the site structure. Instead I went ahead and deployed the game to itch.io, as I already had an account there. This was a relatively easy and straightforward process (though I did have to answer some tax-related questions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the game is here on itch.io: &lt;a href=&#34;https://hungryroy.itch.io/diver&#34;&gt;https://hungryroy.itch.io/diver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ludum Dare requires the source code be made available, I have it up here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/roytang/diver&#34;&gt;https://github.com/roytang/diver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, the page for my entry on the Ludum Dare site itself: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/diver&#34;&gt;https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/diver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aftermath&#34;&gt;Aftermath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After submitting your game, you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to review and rate other people&amp;rsquo;s games, and you want to earn at least 20 ratings to get a &amp;ldquo;final score&amp;rdquo;. Coming in, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really aim to &amp;ldquo;win&amp;rdquo; the compo or anything like that, I just wanted to finish a game. But after submitting and checking out a few of the other submissions, I felt a bit more confident about my chances and am hoping for a decent finish. The &amp;ldquo;play, review, and rate&amp;rdquo; period lasts for 21 days after the jam ends, so it&amp;rsquo;ll be a while before I know the outcome of that! I am doing my part by playing through some of the entries and rating them and leaving helpful comments where I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, very impressed with how Ludum Dare works. The more ratings and quality feedback you give, the higher your game appears in the listings. This makes it more likely for you to receive ratings and feedback yourself, thus incentivizing the same and creating a positive feedback loop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest takeaway is that I learned how to build something with as small a scope as possible. In many of my past attempts, scope creep was always one of the bigger problems. I was used to playing big, epic games like grand strategy or long RPGs or open world games, so I often wanted to make games like those. The 48h limit helped me narrow my focus and reject stuff that would endanger that deadline. I had to discard some other ideas for enemies and stage elements because they would make things more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did enjoy the experience, no matter the outcome, I&amp;rsquo;ve already exceeded my own expectations. I expect to try my hand at game jams again moving forward. Building experience by making a series of small games might be a better way for me to find a path into &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; gamedev. That is, as opposed to &amp;ldquo;hobbyist&amp;rdquo; gamedev, which is the new level I consider myself at now that I&amp;rsquo;ve completed a Ludum Dare!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some screenshots of the game attached below!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier review (with some spoilers):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more action-packed and straightforward compared to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/wandavision/&#34;&gt;Wandavision&lt;/a&gt;, jumping straight into the action from the get go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some great performances here, especially from Sebastian Stan (Bucky), Wyatt Russell (John Walker), and Daniel Bruhl (Zemo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bucky and Sam have great chemistry, even though they start out annoyed at each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pacing is a bit odd at times; feels more like an extended movie than a weekly episodic series (especially compared to Wandavision, which took advantage of the weekly format really well)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;although a complete story by itself, this one felt more of a setup for future MCU storylines (again compared to Wandavision)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;while overall the season was good, I find Wandavision was the clearly better watch for me, though I suppose your mileage may vary if your preference is for action sequences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ending spoilers follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details class=&#34;spoiler&#34;&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;(Spoilers)&lt;/summary&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I felt like so much of the finale was rushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final confrontation and resolution with the Flag Smashers felt flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyatt Russell sudden redemption felt undeserved - we go from stripped of position to fighting buddies with Bucky very quickly; would have liked to see him publicly address Sam as Cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power Broker reveal was underwhelming; would have preferred it was done via a post-credits scene, possibly via Sharon telling someone about how she had to kill Batroc because he was threatening to expose her (presumably the earlier confrontation would have been cut to omit the reveal). Overall, I would have hidden the secret more (it was really obvious), so that the reveal at the end would have had a better impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish Bucky&amp;rsquo;s redemption arc had played a stronger part in the finale, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Felt like they could have extended an episode or two to at least make some of these things more impactful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next: Loki in June!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a bit busy this weekend (see below), so this post is running a bit late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ongoing saga right here in the Philippines:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last weekend, community pantries for the needy started sprouting up in Metro Manila and all over the country, largely inspired by one started in Maginhawa here in Quezon City. The central idea was &amp;ldquo;give what you can, take what you need.&amp;rdquo; Stories spread of heartwarming stories like a poor old man donating some food even though he had very little and an ice cream vendor giving away the remnants of his cart for the day to those in the queue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government critics pointed out the need for these pantries was largely a result of the lack of support from the government. (They&amp;rsquo;re not wrong.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predictably, it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for the government to butt in, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/roytang/status/1384280033351462912&#34;&gt;the police reportedly investigating the people behind the pantries for communist links&lt;/a&gt;. Some other national government people even said they might require permits. For what, giving food away?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The backlash was predictably quick, with netizens and even local government offcials and senators castigating the critics. Mayors started chiming in that the community pantries were welcome in their cities and that there was no permit required to help each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, notable spokespersons of the NTF-ELCAC still insisted on insinuating communist links to the pantries. There were also the usual critics who decried people getting stuff for free, speaking from the privilege of their safe houses and expensive cars. Critics also raised whether these pantries were spreading covid because of how people spend a lot of time queued up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some women in Pasig went viral for a bit after they were caught on video raiding a community pantry and getting much more than could be reasonably expected, one of them even carting off a trayful of eggs. They supposedly claimed they were going to give away to their neighbors. They later &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.msn.com/en-ph/entertainment/other/mga-babaeng-nanlimas-sa-community-pantry-sa-pasig-dumepensa-na/ar-BB1fUtan&#34;&gt;apologized&lt;/a&gt;, but supposedly they &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/news5ph/status/1384855185932042241&#34;&gt;were planning to file charges against the person who took a video of them&lt;/a&gt;. My take: the thing about decentralized movements like this is that they tend to easily self-correct through the vigilance of the participants as seen here. There have been no other reports of similar incidents after this one went viral, so at the very least they served as an example of what not to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last Friday, a community pantry started by actress Angel Locsin ended in disaster when an old man died while in the queue. Blowback from the pantry critics and the DDS was fierce. Locsin &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gmanetwork.com/entertainment/showbiznews/news/76345/angel-locsin-issues-apology-after-senior-citizen-dies-in-line-at-her-community-pantry/story&#34;&gt;quickly issued an apology&lt;/a&gt; and accepted the blame, drawing contrasts with how the national government never apologizes or admits to mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently, news broke that the National Security Adviser &lt;a href=&#34;https://onenews.ph/gag-order-imposed-on-parlade-badoy&#34;&gt;had imposed a gag order on the notorious NTF-ELCAC spokespersons re: community pantries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probably one of the reasons we can&amp;rsquo;t have nice things: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LaTtEX/status/1384416859701792771&#34;&gt;people can&amp;rsquo;t be generous without some other people becoming suspicious and assigning nefarious motives&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens with these pantries moving forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of covid, India&amp;rsquo;s experiencing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56798248&#34;&gt;worst surge of the pandemic so far&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://mashable.com/article/twitter-hides-tweets-critical-indian-government-handling-covid/&#34;&gt;accused of censoring tweets critical of the Indian government&amp;rsquo;s covid response&lt;/a&gt;. The US is facing calls to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/25/us-pressed-to-lift-export-ban-to-help-india-fight-surge-in-covid-cases?CMP=twt_gu#Echobox=1619342451&#34;&gt;loosen export bans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/24/covid-vaccines-patents-pharmaceutical-companies-secrecy&#34;&gt;lighten up on vaccine patents&lt;/a&gt; to help out India (and the rest of us in the global south, really).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some lighter news: One year ago in Apr 24 2020, an epic battle among a ton of people named Josh was scheduled a year in advance, to fight for the name. It &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gothspiderbitch/status/1386031209457852418&#34;&gt;happened yesterday&lt;/a&gt;! They had a pool noodle battle and named a 5 year old &amp;ldquo;King Josh&amp;rdquo; or some such. Lots of fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messaging app Signal, famous for its encryption protections, raised concerns about vulnerabilities in software often used by authoritarian regimes to bypass the security of such apps: &lt;a href=&#34;https://signal.org/blog/cellebrite-vulnerabilities/&#34;&gt;Exploiting vulnerabilities in Cellebrite UFED and Physical Analyzer from an app&amp;rsquo;s perspective&lt;/a&gt;. The great thing is how the report does a hilarious &amp;ldquo;wink wink nudge nudge&amp;rdquo; implying the users of such apps might not want to target Signal in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some stuff about blogging and personal websites:

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kottke.org/21/04/the-conversation-has-never-been-wider&#34;&gt;The conversation has never been wider.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gq.com/story/get-fit-from-just-walking&#34;&gt;How fit can you get from just walking?&lt;/a&gt; One of the tragedies of the pandemic is that I&amp;rsquo;ve had to reduce my general walking output, since I can&amp;rsquo;t just wander around as far as I want anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kottke.org/21/04/make-everything-important&#34;&gt;Mads Mikkelsen: &amp;ldquo;Make everything important.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blolook.osa-p.net/&#34;&gt;page / app you can check&lt;/a&gt; to see how many people have blocked you on Twitter.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In the Spanish dub of Terminator 2, instead of &amp;ldquo;Hasta la vista, baby&amp;rdquo;, the Terminator says &amp;ldquo;Sayonara, baby!&amp;rdquo; via &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/mwv4nd/fun_fact_in_the_spanish_dub_of_terminator_2_he/&#34;&gt;reddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Local liturgical song Tanging Yaman, often attributed to Carol Banawa, was actually &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/04/03/21/behind-the-music-tanging-yaman-by-fr-manoling-francisco&#34;&gt;first recorded by now-Senator Risa Hontiveros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The big thing for me this week (that I hinted at in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/weeknotes-2021-04-18/&#34;&gt;the previous weeknotes&lt;/a&gt;) is that I decided to give &lt;a href=&#34;https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48&#34;&gt;LUDUM DARE 48&lt;/a&gt; a shot! It&amp;rsquo;s a game jam, where you make a game in 48 hours (well, that&amp;rsquo;s the mode I&amp;rsquo;m participating in). Tt&amp;rsquo;s the first time I&amp;rsquo;m doing one, despite a lifetime of flirting with the idea of gamedev. Initial build is &lt;a href=&#34;https://hungryroy.itch.io/diver&#34;&gt;already available&lt;/a&gt;, even though there&amp;rsquo;s still 9ish hours to go. (I need to sleep!) I&amp;rsquo;ll probably (should) write more about this experience in a future post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Around the middle of this week, I got the first ever email that actually complied with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/about/contact/&#34;&gt;the contact protocol I had specified here in the site&lt;/a&gt; and on LinkedIn, namely putting a certain keyword in the subject line. I&amp;rsquo;ve had that condition for years, so I was really amazed someone actually read it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;still sketching&lt;/a&gt;, though I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen a couple of days behind due to the game jam. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1385224243848179719/&#34;&gt;tried to do one on paper like a comic&lt;/a&gt; but my handwriting was so terrible I had to edit it digitally!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/b178a1efcfc005930f062c7be447d7c1/&#34;&gt;Rocky (1976)&lt;/a&gt;, and I meant to watch the next Bond flick too, but ran out of time. New Mortal Kombat movie also came out this past week, I might watch that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt; season finale ran last Friday. A lot of people are happy with it (and the season overall), but I felt like some parts were too rushed and the finale suffered as a result. Will probably post more thoughts on it this week. After this, we won&amp;rsquo;t have MCU content until Loki kicks off next month I think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Invincible&lt;/strong&gt; is getting to the good part!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still drafting a bunch of Strixhaven on Arena (though I had to stop for the weekend due to the game jam). Most of my drafts went well, though the last 2 I did this week were terrible. I ended up listening to &lt;a href=&#34;http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-593-strixhaven-first-impressions/&#34;&gt;the Limited Resources podcast&lt;/a&gt; for the first time and got some good tips, hopefully that improves my drafts moving forward. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably play in the Sealed Open next weekend! Follow along via &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgstrixhaven/&#34;&gt;the MTGStrixhaven tag&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/strong&gt; actually had some progress this week. I really should finish this run soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downloaded &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4 because it&amp;rsquo;s temporarily free! I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to play this for a while, hopefully I have time for it this coming week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played some Street Fighter V again this week; I figured since a new character dropped, it might be easy to find matches again. I did manage to fight quite a few, but I also did quite poorly, dropping back to Ultra Bronze. Thinking about switching to a different character since everyone seems to know how to fight Ryu, so I unlocked Honda! We&amp;rsquo;ll see who I actually end up using.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Currently about halfway through &lt;strong&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/strong&gt; by Neal Stephenson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia: Pop Quiz is back (albeit monthly now, not weekly), so the trivia team was able to join two quizzes this past week. We didn&amp;rsquo;t win either though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a couple of birthdays in the family this weekend, so my game jamming was interspersed with zoom / messenger calls and food deliveries and such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Invincible, One Piece, BNHA, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new expansion dropping for Root, one of the digital boardgames we&amp;rsquo;ve been playing (and the one I have yet to write a review for&amp;hellip; sounds like a perfect opportunity!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strixhaven Sealed Open on Arena next week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was a bit rushed, so typos etc are a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

    so did anyone else know that there was a massive pool noodle battle planned between all the people named Josh today that was ultimately won by a 5-year old named Josh who was crowned The Supreme Josh or was I just supposed to find this out on my own

            &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do not be dismayed by the brokenness of the world. All things break. And all things can be mended. Not with time, as they say, but with intention. So go. Love intentionally, extravagantly, unconditionally. The broken world waits in darkness for the light that is you.&amp;ldquo;&lt;!--sep--&gt;&amp;ndash; L. R. Knost&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I originally drew this on my tiny pad then scanned it so the text could be readable, but my handwriting was so obviously bad in the scan, I edited a new (and different) line into the text bubble digitally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll attach the original anyway so you can see how terrible my handwriting was. I&amp;rsquo;d say it was because the pad was so small, but really my handwriting is terrible at any size!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Thursday afternoon Strixhaven draft(s?)! &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&#34;&gt;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&lt;/a&gt; #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgsrixhaven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like I&amp;rsquo;m finally paying for all the good luck I had over the past few days; I did two drafts today and both of them were terrible!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s this guy in Hong Kong named Roy Tang who is &amp;ldquo;Permanent Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs&amp;rdquo;, which I suppose is some Beijing stooge. It&amp;rsquo;s annoying because he always shows up in my Google alerts lol&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;2 twitter accounts have blocked me! Lol I know one of those accounts, I wonder who the other is. This count is low compared to some of my mutuals, maybe I should get into more fights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you can check your own stats here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://blolook.osa-p.net/&#34;&gt;https://blolook.osa-p.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h4 id=&#34;posted-on-rglobaltalk-question-what-are-the-police-like-in-your-countryhttpsredditcomrglobaltalkcommentsmvsss1question_what_are_the_police_like_in_your_country&#34;&gt;Posted on r/GlobalTalk: &lt;a href=&#34;https://reddit.com/r/GlobalTalk/comments/mvsss1/question_what_are_the_police_like_in_your_country/&#34;&gt;[Question] What are the police like in your country?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following recent events in the US (disclaimer: I&amp;rsquo;m not an American), police brutality is a big, controversial topic over there, leading to protests and calls to defund the police and such, popularizing the phrase ACAB (meaning &amp;ldquo;all cops are bastards&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my own country (the Philippines), cops don&amp;rsquo;t have a very good reputation either; they are often seen as corrupt extortionists and some may be complicit in extrajudicial killings in Duterte&amp;rsquo;s drug war; recently they have done some bad moves such as attempting to interfere with community pantries that popped up to help the poor during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that left me wondering what police are like in other countries. Are there countries where the police have a generally good reputation (maybe my country or the US can learn something from those places)? Or are they generally just tools for enforcing the (often unequal) status quo?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Wednesday afternoon Strixhaven draft(s?)! &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&#34;&gt;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&lt;/a&gt; #mtg #magicarena #twitch #strixhaven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a great draft! I went Quandrix+Prismari and managed to go 7-2. Very explosive. One of those losses was actually due to the server giving me a defeat without even going to a match, so I might even get reimbursement!&lt;/p&gt;

</title>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;This is a follow up to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/blogs-of-yesteryear/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Blogs of Yesteryear&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. This is the remainder of my blogroll from 2004/2005. I feel like the second half is less interesting than the first half, but I figured I might as well go through them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;geekiness&#34;&gt;geekiness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the blogs under this session are about general geeky topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absurd Genius&lt;/strong&gt; - looks this was a tech and gaming-focused blog that featured a web portal for the PSP browser. But I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anymore information about the author. It was formerly hosted on base2.org, but that domain doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have any content now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forever Geek&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a blog that covered a lot of geeky topics - tech, anime, gadgets, games, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://forevergeek.com/&#34;&gt;still around&lt;/a&gt;! I no longer follow them though, mainly because that&amp;rsquo;s not really the sort of site I follow anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kuro5hin&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a slashdot-like discussion site that was a bit popular back in the day. According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuro5hin&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the site was taken down permanently in 2016. Kuro5hin was owned by Rusty Foster, who now writes a newsletter, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.todayintabs.com/&#34;&gt;Today in Tabs&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/newsletters-redux/&#34;&gt;newsletters I follow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gaming&#34;&gt;gaming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed a lot of gaming sites back in the day. I no longer follow these, mostly because I&amp;rsquo;m not interested anymore in having 100% gaming feeds in my feedreader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;game girl advance&lt;/strong&gt; - a gaming blog with all women writers. Back then most of the people writing about games were male (I think), so following a site like this one helped diversify your POVs. The site is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gamegirladvance.com/&#34;&gt;still up&lt;/a&gt;, but the last update is from 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GameDevBlog&lt;/strong&gt; - this is a blog by game developer Jamie Fristrom. I think I followed this site after I read an interesting article he wrote about implementing web-swinging in the 2004 videogame Spider-man 2. His &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gamedevblog.com/&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt; and updated as recently as last October!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games from Within&lt;/strong&gt; - this was another game developer&amp;rsquo;s blog (in case it isn&amp;rsquo;t obvious, it is/was one of my interests). The &lt;a href=&#34;https://gamesfromwithin.com/&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt;, last post is from 2018. (Annoyingly, it&amp;rsquo;s one of those sites that doesn&amp;rsquo;t show the post date on the listing screens.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RPGamer&lt;/strong&gt; - a gaming site focused on computer/console RPGs. This and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rpgfan.com/&#34;&gt;RPGFan&lt;/a&gt; were my main source of RPG news back in the day. RPGamer is &lt;a href=&#34;https://rpgamer.com/&#34;&gt;still up&lt;/a&gt; and going strong. (The site even still has the same dragon logo and font!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These Damned Machines Are Killing Me&lt;/strong&gt; - another gaming focused blog, this one was short-lived, looks like it wasn&amp;rsquo;t updated past 2007, after which the site went down. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.damnedmachines.com/&#34;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt; currently redirects to a site called Furious Games, not sure if related.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3rd World Game Designer&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a blog by Gabby Dizon, a game designer from the Philippines! (I&amp;rsquo;m always interested in local content). The site is no longer accessible and the domain is parked. I think I found the author on Twitter, but he seems to be a crypto guy now or some such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;comics&#34;&gt;comics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still read webcomics these days, though not as much, and almost never through a feed reader (most of the time.) Related: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2006/10/webcomics-i-like-2006-edition/&#34;&gt;Webcomics I Like, 2006 Edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PvPonline&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a webcomic about the employees at a gaming publication, it was quite popular back in the day. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://pvponline.com/&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt; and the author recently rebooted/time-skipped the story. I currently follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pvponline&#34;&gt;the author on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and catch up on it whenever I see him update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Penny Arcade&lt;/strong&gt; - one of the longest-running mostly-gaming-focused webcomics (and one of the most well-known). The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.penny-arcade.com/&#34;&gt;site is still going strong&lt;/a&gt; after all these years, sporting largely the same color scheme. I get updates because I follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cwgabriel&#34;&gt;the artist on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comics: Foxtrot&lt;/strong&gt; - one of my favorite slice of life strips, I have a few of the books. It stopped being released as a daily a while back, and the author now only releases a new comic every Sunday, I think. Once again, I am following &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/billamend&#34;&gt;the artist on twitter&lt;/a&gt;. (Starting to see a pattern here.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comics: Sinfest&lt;/strong&gt; - it started out as a dark humor strip about this guy Slick who tries to hit on a girl named Monique and just kept expanding and expanding its scope, covering topics such as politics, patriarchy, religion, that kind of stuff. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://sinfest.net/&#34;&gt;still running&lt;/a&gt; but I mostly lost interest when he tended to do arcs that ran really long. I much preferred his silly, standalone strips like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sinfest.net/view.php?date=2004-04-05&#34;&gt;this one about Apples and Oranges&lt;/a&gt;. Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2010/08/1042004246/&#34;&gt;another one that I liked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dilbert&lt;/strong&gt; - this famous strip is of course still running (currently at &lt;a href=&#34;https://dilbert.com/&#34;&gt;Dilbert.com&lt;/a&gt;), although the author has in recent years come out as Trump supporter with many bad takes. I still read the strip, mostly because it comes with our daily newspaper. (On paper! We still have those!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real life comics&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a semi-autobiographical slice-of-life comic about a guy named Greg. I had stopped following it for a while because of reasons, but last year I found out that (a) it was still going strong; and (b) the author recently &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/reallifecomics/status/1284587454968651777&#34;&gt;came out as as trans&lt;/a&gt;. The strip is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reallifecomics.com/index.php&#34;&gt;still running&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comics: Calvin and Hobbes&lt;/strong&gt; - the quintessential comic about a little kid and his tiger. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why I bothered following this one, since the author stopped drawing the strip in 1995. I believe that I have already read every single strip of C&amp;amp;H, so there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to follow it now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Websnark&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a commentary blog about stuff on the internet, mostly webcomics. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember following it for too long, probably lost interest at some point. The domain currently has nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lifehacks&#34;&gt;lifehacks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are blogs I followed about self-improvement, productivity, that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working Smart&lt;/strong&gt; - looks like this was a blog from a guy who was head of a Christian publishing company. I guess I followed him because he sometimes published about topics like getting things done, communication, tech, gadgets, and blogging. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember following him for very long, so I imagine I lost interest quickly. The site is no longer accessible and he no longer seems to be blogging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve Pavlina&amp;rsquo;s Blog&lt;/strong&gt; - this is a guy who became well-known as a self-help author and motivational speaker. He often wrote about personal development. I&amp;rsquo;m not really into that kind of content anymore so I no longer follow him. He still writes at stevepavlina.com.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;43 Folders&lt;/strong&gt; - a site about &amp;ldquo;tricks, hacks and other cool stuff&amp;rdquo;, named after the number of manila folders in a tickler file. The site is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.43folders.com/&#34;&gt;still around&lt;/a&gt;, but the last update is from 2011. I&amp;rsquo;m currently following &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies&#34;&gt;the author on twitter&lt;/a&gt;, he no longer seems to be blogging and is more of a podcaster now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;feed-readers&#34;&gt;feed readers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the old site, my feeds back then were powered by an app called Bloglines. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloglines&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; says Bloglines became unavailable in 2015, but presumably I stopped using it in 2007 when I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2007/01/newshutch-feed-aggregator/&#34;&gt;switched to a different app called Newshutch&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, I was complaining that &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader&#34;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt;, released in 2007, was &amp;ldquo;slow as molasses&amp;rdquo;! I eventually did migrate to Google Reader and was a faithful user until &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2013/06/347364993144074241/&#34;&gt;it was killed off in 2013&lt;/a&gt;. (In hindsight, this was more recent than I thought it was!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-about-now&#34;&gt;what about now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I follow a mostly different set of blogs now. There&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/blogroll/&#34;&gt;a blogroll&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;rsquo;s a touch out of date and could use some updating. Maybe sometime soon. Looking over the list, it seems I prefer not to follow single-topic blogs anymore and enjoy slice-of-life blogs where people talk about their day-to-day pursuits on a personal level (instead of say, writing as a general-purpose article for any reader). Feel free to send me blogs or blogrolls you recommend, I will gladly spend an hour or so scrolling through a blogroll and clicking through links and checking out blogs!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Today I decided to watch Rocky (1976) for some reason. The quintessential sports film, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen it before. Stallone looks only a bit younger than I remember him from the 90s. Apollo Creed is that dude from the Mandalorian! Surprised at the ending.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Thursday afternoon Strixhaven draft(s?)! &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&#34;&gt;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&lt;/a&gt; #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgstrixhaven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went Silverquill, only finished 4-3, mostly due to a really bad misplay on my part in the last game. Decent outcome, but could have been better. I did manage to rare-draft a lot though lol&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;When you are full of hate and bitterness every act of love and every move of a good-hearted person will look like virtue signaling&lt;/p&gt;
