            <title>Book Review: Rhythm of War by Sanderson, Brandon

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Rhythm of War is book four in Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s epic fantasy Stormlight Archive series. Goodreads tells me I read the prior book Oathbringer back in Nov 2017, but didn&amp;rsquo;t bother writing a review, so I had to make sure I&amp;rsquo;d write one now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book&amp;rsquo;s launch day kind of caught me a bit unexpectedly so I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother doing a re-read of the previous three books. Which given an epic fantasy series of this scope might have been a mistake, but watch me do it again for book five. No review meant while reading every so often I&amp;rsquo;d stop and be like &amp;ldquo;Who is this character again, and why is she here?&amp;rdquo; Which is to be expected for this kind of thing, probably if GRRM ever manages to bring out Winds of Winter that&amp;rsquo;ll be a thing again. It&amp;rsquo;s a whole big sprawl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got this book on launch day last Nov 17. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/01/words-of-radiance/&#34;&gt;review for the second book Words of Radiance&lt;/a&gt; tells me it took me three weeks to get through it, so I was kind of expecting I might take until 2021 with this one. It only took me a around eight days, with the last third of the book taking me a single read in one long night. So, that says a lot about how good the book is and how the pacing is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a really fun book actually, things are happening, and there&amp;rsquo;s character growth and everything, and I feel like this one touched a lot more on the cosmere stuff. Or maybe I was just notificing more things because no review meant I was reading the wiki more. (Don&amp;rsquo;t worry I managed not to spoil myself!). It&amp;rsquo;s great that Sanderson manages to just put in a lot of stuff and give all of the lead characters significant things to do and character arcs and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s some happenings near the end that turn around some things the characters thought they knew about their history; not as big as the one in Oathbringer, but that&amp;rsquo;s always fun. And some things happen where I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how the next book is going to handle it, so I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to that. (Trying not to be too spoilery here of course!) At Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s rate, it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be at least 3 years before book 5 comes out, and even after that, the series is expected to have a second 5-book arc, plus there&amp;rsquo;s some side books that I feel like I should read because they introduce some relevant characters (Edgedanger, etc) so there&amp;rsquo;s still a lot of Stormlight Archive to look forward to!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Streaming some Kaladesh Remastered draft! Watch me be terrible &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&#34;&gt;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&lt;/a&gt; #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgkld&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As predicted; I was indeed terrible. Draft seemed to go well enough, but I made too many mistakes I guess? Seems like this format is not for me.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s National Heroes Day over here, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about heroics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In software development, &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.c2.com/?HeroicProgramming&#34;&gt;Heroic Programming&lt;/a&gt; can have a negative connotation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HeroicProgramming is often the only course of action left when poor planning, insufficient funds, and impractical schedules leave a project stranded and unlikely to complete successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it&amp;rsquo;s not just in software development either. Many times heroics are an indicator of failed systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonifacio and other Philippine heroes were needed because Spanish colonialism had failed the Filipino people, necessitating a revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this pandemic, we hail the medical workers and other frontliners as heroes for their sacrifices during the pandemic, but they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to do so if we had better health care systems and the government had made better planning early on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whistleblowers are hailed as heroes, but it would be better if instead the people in charge knew better than to do the bad things that would need whistleblowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever there&amp;rsquo;s an election, we look among the candidates, searching for a hero who will fix all our problems and save our country, but a few good politicians won&amp;rsquo;t be enough, what we need are systems and institutions that work to serve the citizenship and can survive even bad leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will always be exceptionalism, and heroics always make for great stories, but there&amp;rsquo;s also something to be said for just having normal, working systems, institutions, and communities that don&amp;rsquo;t need heroes to keep going. We should celebrate our heroes and be grateful for their heroics, but even better would be a world where we need less heroes; a society that functions normally without people having to make sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;December is almost upon us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an opportunity last week to take on some additional work, but on further reflection, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d pass on it. I am in general, averse to working during the Christmas season (that is to say, more so than during the entire year in general). Even back when I was working full-time, I&amp;rsquo;d prefer taking most of my leaves during December. It&amp;rsquo;s really a result of the terrible traffic in Metro Manila, which gets significantly worse during Christmas season, a trauma that lingers even when I&amp;rsquo;m home all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past week went by quickly. Not so much because of anything stressful or such, but more like there were a bunch of errands to be done. I also did a bunch of maintenance work for some of my smaller side projects (adding questions to the trivia bot, fixing some bugs in this site&amp;rsquo;s code, adding some minor features to some of my tracking stuff, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t been writing much lately, other than these weeknotes. Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve also found my thoughts wandering a lot and been having difficulty focusing on anything productive. I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel these things are related, and that I should be writing more to help me focus and get back into the habit of thinking better. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can get a few more blog posts out in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing much new. A new drop in the Civ6 New Frontier pass was released a couple of weeks ago, so I played a few Civ6 games this week to try things out. The new leader/civ (Hammurabi of Babylon) was pretty fun, kind of a unique experience, and I like the Heroes and Legends mode. I actually want to try the other new game modes added by the NFP recently, it&amp;rsquo;s just that Civ games always take so long, so it&amp;rsquo;s hard to fit them in when I have other single-player games I want to play. Steam Autumn sale is currently ongoing, but so far I have taken no damage (though I did let myself get billed for November&amp;rsquo;s humble choice). I kind of wanted to buy a couple of additional Switch games, but I might just start something on my very extensive Steam backlog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; I finished &lt;em&gt;Rhythm of War&lt;/em&gt;! Fun book, I may write a longer review, as I kind of regret not having a review for the previous book Oathbringer, as I had nothing to go back to as a bit of review before starting on Rhythm of War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt; I think I&amp;rsquo;ve only been watching more Perfect Strangers this week. Two more seasons to go! This also means I&amp;rsquo;m behind on the Mandalorian and Discovery, which means I risk spoilers lol. Should try to catch up this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward to:&lt;/strong&gt; December? Christmas? Not really, not so much, though it can&amp;rsquo;t hurt, but I&amp;rsquo;m counting the days until we are rid of this accursed plague year.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I wonder if any other Django devs always forgot what their local env&amp;rsquo;s superuser password is and just createsuperuser again every so often&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/art_abon/&#34;&gt;@art_abon&lt;/a&gt; Ranma has a much bigger cast that can cause hijinx. Dito it&amp;rsquo;s always either Larry or Balki (and Larry most of the time)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This week felt weird. It kind of went by quickly for me, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like anything important really happened. Its kind of like those moments in-between other events, where you&amp;rsquo;re just coasting along and waiting for the more significant things to happen. My country is still recovering from the storms of the past few weeks, Trump is still flailing around trying to overturn democracy, and our own president is still insecure when someone gets more attention than him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These moments feel fleeting, but they&amp;rsquo;re a pretty good time for some self-reflection. I probably need a bit more of that, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found my mind has been wandering through parallel universes lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; I pushed the post-game completion on Super Mario Odyssey, but I might just be at my limit. I have 7 moons remaining, and 5 of those are for minigames, and the last 2 are for the super frustrating Breakdown Road stage. All of these probably require a great deal more patience than I have available, so that might be it for me. Still, it was a great ride, and I&amp;rsquo;m proud I can even get this far given I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself great at platformers nowadays. Still looking around for a new single-player game to dig into, not sure if I want to do another platformer or look for an RPG or such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magic:&lt;/strong&gt; Still been drafting a bit of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgkld/&#34;&gt;Kaladesh Remastered&lt;/a&gt;, although it seems the draft format doesn&amp;rsquo;t like me very much. I&amp;rsquo;ve gone a single 5-3 and three 0-3s, so it&amp;rsquo;s pretty bad! Still, I can keep doing at least one draft a week until Kaldheim comes out next year I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Rhythm of War&lt;/em&gt;, fourth book in Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s Stormlight Archive came out this past week! I got a Kindle copy off Amazon and have been reading a few chapters every night. I&amp;rsquo;m about a third of the way through I think. The problem with this book is I didn&amp;rsquo;t do a re-read of the previous books (they&amp;rsquo;re pretty long!) so every few chapters I&amp;rsquo;m like &amp;ldquo;Who is this person again and why is she here?&amp;rdquo;. This is a typical problem for epic fantasy series like this, so I&amp;rsquo;ll probably have this same problem if/when GRRM manages to get &lt;em&gt;Winds of Winter&lt;/em&gt; out. (I think these two are the only unfinished fantasy series I&amp;rsquo;m still following.) I will say that Sanderson still writes quite well, and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this gets me back into the habit of reading regularly again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I caught up with the Mandalorian, pleasant surprise to see Katie Sackhoff around, apparently playing a character she voiced in Clone Wars (which I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen). Since I caught up with both Mandalorian and Discovery mid-season, now I have to wait every week for new episodes, like some kind of peasant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For my background binge watching, I found some old copies I had of Perfect Strangers, so I&amp;rsquo;ve burned through a few seasons of that already. I loved this series when it was on TV back when I was young. It&amp;rsquo;s not particularly deep; most episodes have the same plot of &amp;ldquo;Balki does/says something naive and/or Larry overreacts and gets them into trouble and hilarity ensures&amp;rdquo;, but it&amp;rsquo;s still fun, and has probably one of the best ever TV show opening themes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward to:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t know? US thanksgiving is next week, which is mainly relevant for me because there&amp;rsquo;s usually a bunch of gaming sales at the time, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything I&amp;rsquo;m particularly interested in yet. There&amp;rsquo;s also some family events coming up (my eldest niece&amp;rsquo;s birthday), but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to get excited about those since we can&amp;rsquo;t actually get together.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been binging Perfect Strangers. Fun show (and maybe best theme song), but 80% of the eps are like &amp;ldquo;Balki says/does something naive, Larry overreacts and gets them into trouble, but it all works out in the end&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Kaladesh Remastered draft really doesn&amp;rsquo;t like me; I thought this deck was pretty good, but it was yet another 0-3. D: At least I didn&amp;rsquo;t waste gems this time. #mtg #magicarena #mtgkld&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Streaming some more Kaladesh Remastered draft (ep 2) &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&#34;&gt;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&lt;/a&gt; #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgkld&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, internet was too poor again tonight for streaming :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, I went ahead and did two drafts which was a terrible idea because I did very poorly both times. (Didn&amp;rsquo;t bother getting a screenshot of the second result, they were the same!) Sigh, this format is tough. Hopefully I figure it out by next time.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a fantasy, but I&amp;rsquo;m kind of hoping &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/inquirerdotnet/&#34;&gt;@inquirerdotnet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/PhilstarNews/&#34;&gt;@PhilstarNews&lt;/a&gt; manages to put the word &amp;ldquo;Meltdown&amp;rdquo; somewhere on their front page for Nov 18 #DuterteMeltdown&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Okay I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to explain this, so bear with me. On Tiktok, an entire community has come together to create Ratatouille the Musical. What seemed like a joke has become an incredible undertaking. Or not? Here&amp;rsquo;s how it started, with a call:&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Weather this past week was very bad for those of us in Metro Manila (and many other places in Luzon). Howling winds and strong rains dominated for 2-3 days of the week due to typhoon Ulysses. This typhoon wasn&amp;rsquo;t as strong as Rolly a couple of weeks ago, but it seems that it brought a lot more rains, causing flooding and loss of power in a whole lot of places. Metro Manila was hit quite badly, even drawing comparisons to Ondoy back in 2009. Even up to today I&amp;rsquo;m still reading about a ton of people who need assistance, relief or rescue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fortunately got off relatively unscathed. The howling winds and pouring rain meant it was heard to sleep at some point, but we experienced no other bad effects and in fact were a bit more comfortable due to lower temps. Oh, and we still don&amp;rsquo;t have cable service until today, a minor inconvenience. A lot of my friends lost power and some in the more Northern provinces were subject to severe flooding as well. It also took us a couple of days to get in touch with some relatives on the southern side of Luzon, but it seems they are fine, power issues notwithstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; Still playing Super Mario Odyssey, hopefully to completion. Although given how difficult some of these minigames are for me, I&amp;rsquo;m not optimistic. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how close I can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magic:&lt;/strong&gt; Kaladesh Remastered is out on Arena! I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten started on a sealed and a draft, you can follow along via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgkld/&#34;&gt;MTGKLD tag&lt;/a&gt;, if you&amp;rsquo;d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Boys S2: Surprisingly the Boys kind of got a &amp;ldquo;good ending&amp;rdquo; this time, although there are still threats lurking around. I went back and reread the first Omnibus of the comic book after finishing the season, and the differences are really stark, as in the comics Butcher is really portrayed as a bastard, maybe even as much as Homelander, while in the series they&amp;rsquo;re pretty tame by comparison. Somehow a lot of the issues raised in this season feel topical too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star Trek Discovery S3: Season isn&amp;rsquo;t done yet, but I went ahead and got this started. It&amp;rsquo;s quite a trip. Discovery is charting an unknown future now in the Star Trek timeline, and there are a lot of fun moments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Queen&amp;rsquo;s Gambit: This Netflix limited series has been getting a lot of buzz so I decided to give it a go. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly good, in a sports anime kind of way.  It&amp;rsquo;s a testament to how good and realistic the portrayal of the 1960s chess scene is that for a while I thought it was based on a real-life chess prodigy. Apparently, the show is based on a novel instead, a well-researched one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misc:&lt;/strong&gt; In the starting-yet-another-side-project department, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with this library called the Dragonruby Game Toolkit, which I got from the itch.io Racial Justice bundle a while back. I tried building a simple platformer using a Kenney asset pack that I also got from the bundle. Here&amp;rsquo;s the WIP: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDRShB4psyU&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDRShB4psyU&lt;/a&gt;. I like that I can work with the framework using only my text editor (as compared to some big bulky IDE like Unity), and it&amp;rsquo;s fairly quick to start up, as it makes a lot of assumptions for you so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about things like screen resolution, screen coords, fps, etc. I don&amp;rsquo;t doubt that using Unity might have made the platforming physics a bit easier, but I did enjoy figuring things out on my own. Not sure if this is going anywhere, I&amp;rsquo;m mostly just dabbling with it at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trivia:&lt;/strong&gt; we actually won an online quiz this past week! Amazing. We had so much fun, we even went ahead and had our own internal 2-hour trivia quiz right after: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no0sYBcU5LA&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no0sYBcU5LA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward to:&lt;/strong&gt; I just found out that the next book in Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Stormlight Archive&lt;/em&gt; is coming out next week! That&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a huge book, hopefully I can manage to finish it before year-end (so that I can at least get my books read stat for the year up a tiny bit)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Kaladesh Remastered draft ep 1 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&#34;&gt;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&lt;/a&gt; #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgkld&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, internet wasn&amp;rsquo;t too good so I just cut the stream short. Too bad, so sad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draft didn&amp;rsquo;t feel super good, but I managed to break even in the games. No video because no stream. (In hindsight I could have just recorded locally!) Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll try streaming a draft again early next week.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/amirrajan/&#34;&gt;@amirrajan&lt;/a&gt; i dont have much other gamedev experience other than playing with unity a bit, but: I like that I can do most of the work in my text editor, and I like that it simplifies a lot of the work by making assumptions (like the 1280x720 resolution etc) so I can just focus on what I want&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Decided to try a Kaladesh Remastered sealed before diving into draft. Didn&amp;rsquo;t do particularly well, but at least I got a feel of what the Kaladesh limited format is like (again) #mtg #magicarena #mtgkld&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Past few days I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with this thing called Dragonruby Game Toolkit + some Kenney assets I got from the itch Racial Justice bundle. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDRShB4psyU&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDRShB4psyU&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This is genuinely the funniest piece of media I’ve ever seen in my life and should absolutely be what is shown to explain the 2020 election for generations to come&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Weeknotes 2020-11-01 A Collective Sigh of Relief

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The World&lt;/strong&gt;: Somehow the week seemed to go by both quickly and agonizingly slowly, mostly because of the US presidential elections held this week. Slowly because after the initial burst of results on Tuesday night (US time), the remaining states&amp;rsquo; results trickled in very slowly. Quickly because much time was spent doomscrolling and refreshing election-related updates. I think the world collectively breathed a sigh of relief this weekend as the US networks finally called the race for former VP and now president-elect Joe Biden. Celebrations on the streets in many cities in the US, notably New York and Philadelphia. Trump still won&amp;rsquo;t concede and vows legal action, but that seems unlikely to go anywhere except make him look immature and pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biden isn&amp;rsquo;t even the best or most exciting candidate, and it&amp;rsquo;s still to be seen how he handles crises like the BLM and police brutality stuff and even healthcare, but at the very least the US will now have a coherent leader and hopefully will be able to address the pandemic better. I would guess that Harris as VP will ultimately end up the more historic win. But I imagine the celebrations are less about Biden winning and more about Trump losing. It must be weird to be a fanatic Trump supporter seeing all these people celebrating his loss. He still got a lot of votes - America remains a deeply divided nation, but at least under Biden there&amp;rsquo;s a chance of that being rectified at least a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have written a lot of words on this topic, considering I&amp;rsquo;m not an American. My stakes in this are a bit lower, but I still found myself glued to the ever-changing blue and red numbers. The US leadership affects the rest of the world of course, especially in terms of climate change and multilateralism moving forward, so it&amp;rsquo;s serious business. But I admit, I also enjoyed the drama and the memes. I had more than one chat groups where some of the members were living in the US, and let me tell you, they were super active during this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of all this drama has to be the whole &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-four-seasons-total-landscaping_n_5fa6e08bc5b6f21920dc14f7&#34;&gt;Four Seasons Total Landscaping&lt;/a&gt; brouhaha. Basically, Trump announced his lawyers would have a press conferencce at Four Seasons in Philadelphia, then later corrected himself saying it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the Four Seasons Hotel, but rather Four Seasons Total Landscaping. Basically a parking lot in an industrial area, next to a dildo shop. It smacks of incompetence and miscoordination of the highest order. It&amp;rsquo;s the kind of comedy that TV shows just can&amp;rsquo;t make up, proving indeed that reality can be stranger (and funnier) than fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump&amp;rsquo;s loss is a repudiation of his style of populist, lying leadership. I wish I could say I was as hopeful for similar positive change in my own country in two years, but that remains to be seen&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, back to my stuff lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Server migration update:&lt;/strong&gt; Today, I&amp;rsquo;ve closed my account at the old hosting provider, so there is no more turning back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; I started and finished Super Mario Odyssey! Just about a week, but that was main game only, finished with a bit over 400 moons. (I believe I can get up to 999 in the game?). Immediately proceeding into the post-game, since I only borrowed this game, so I want to get as close to completion as I can before I have to give it back. That being said, there are some moons gated behind annoying minigames like jump rope, RC racing, etc, which I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;d have the patience to grind through, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see. After Odyssey, I&amp;rsquo;ll take it easy on the Switch games for a little bit, though I am already considering getting either Fire Emblem or the new Paper Mario. Would be good to get back to an RPG after all these platformers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt; About halfway through The Boys season 2 now. More thoughts when I finish I guess? I thought about watching a Sean Connery James Bond flick when he died this week, but neither Netflix nor Prime had any, sadface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got a new pair of glasses last Wednesday, but up to today my eyes still feel like they are adjusting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not start Nanowrimo. I started trying something else instead, not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s gonna go anywhere though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing I was anxious about last week never pushed through. I should care less about things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward to:&lt;/strong&gt; Kaladesh Remastered comes out next week on Arena, so there&amp;rsquo;s that!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Congratulations, USA, on getting a smart, hardworking woman as a VP. We’ve had one since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Server Setup Notes: Ubuntu, Nginx, Django, MySQL

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I recently did &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/site-migration-to-django/&#34;&gt;a server migration&lt;/a&gt; since I moved to new hosting, The move was from managed/shared hosting to a VPS, these are some notes I took during the process, which I figure might be helpful if I ever tried to  do this again. (And maybe someone else finds it helpful too). Links and references to helpeful resources are included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-up-a-webserver-and-wsgi-container&#34;&gt;Setting up a webserver and WSGI container&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already knew I wanted to use Nginx (managed hosting on the old server always used Apache), that meant needing to choose a WSGI container for the Django apps. The choices were either gunicorn or uwsgi. Readings suggest minimal performance difference between the two. I did try setting up both, and found uwsgi&amp;rsquo;s setup much more straightforward and with more helpful step-by-step documentation: &lt;a href=&#34;https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html&#34;&gt;https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nginx itself was pretty straightforward to set up. This &amp;ldquo;common pitfalls&amp;rdquo; article was helpful in resolving issues: &lt;a href=&#34;https://origin-www.wp.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/config_pitfalls/&#34;&gt;https://origin-www.wp.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/config_pitfalls/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I will note that&amp;rsquo;s not in the article above is that for static files to be served by Nginx, it was easier to just have everything be under /var/www, for permission purposes. I initially had static files in a different folder in my user root, but really there&amp;rsquo;s no reason for that since you&amp;rsquo;re going to serve them statically anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-up-php-on-nginx&#34;&gt;Setting up PHP on Nginx&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed PHP since I had a few minor scripts/pages and a Wordpress install that needed PHP. For the setup on Nginx, I found this guide from askubuntu super helpful: &lt;a href=&#34;https://askubuntu.com/questions/134666/what-is-the-easiest-way-to-enable-php-on-nginx&#34;&gt;https://askubuntu.com/questions/134666/what-is-the-easiest-way-to-enable-php-on-nginx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide from DigitalOcean was also helpful: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-nginx-mysql-php-lemp-stack-in-ubuntu-16-04&#34;&gt;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-nginx-mysql-php-lemp-stack-in-ubuntu-16-04&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was encountering some issues with fastcgi not mapping requests to the correct PHP script if the Nginx location block was aliased. This was with me using the default &lt;code&gt;snippets/fastcgi-php.conf&lt;/code&gt; that was provided with the fastcgi install. I resolved the issue by adding an additional fastcgi_param to the php location block like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    location /sample-path {
        alias /var/www/sample-path;
        # autoindex on;

        location ~ \.php$ {
                include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
                fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME    $request_filename;
                fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
        }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution for this came from the Nginx common pitfalls article listed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;choosing-a-database&#34;&gt;Choosing a database&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially wanted to use PostgreSQL (since that&amp;rsquo;s what I was using locally) and set that up first. Then I realized I had a Wordpress install I wanted to carry over, and apparently Wordpress needs MySQL, so oops. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have two databases running, so that was out. Plan out your database usage boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-up-mysql-for-django&#34;&gt;Setting up MySQL for Django&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created the initial MySQL database with character set &lt;code&gt;utf8&lt;/code&gt;, which apparently had the dumb implementation of only supporting 3 bytes for multibyte characters. This led to errors when I tried importing records into Django that had emojis and the like in text. Apparently the &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; character set to use is &lt;code&gt;utf8mb4&lt;/code&gt; (mb4 -&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;multibyte 4&amp;rdquo; I guess?). It&amp;rsquo;s kinda dumb that they had to invent a &amp;ldquo;more utf8 character set&amp;rdquo; because of their initial dumb implementation. It&amp;rsquo;s also dumb that I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize this when apparently the MySQL databases on the old server were already using &lt;code&gt;utf8mb4&lt;/code&gt;! On the Django side, you need to specify the charset in the database settings. Helpful for resolving this issue was donturner&amp;rsquo;s answer on this SO question: &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2108824/&#34;&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2108824/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some initial testing, I also encountered a &amp;ldquo;MySQL has gone away&amp;rdquo; every so often. Turns out Django was holding on to connections for too long, so a timeout had to be set in the database settings as well. SO reference: &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26958592/&#34;&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26958592/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: I just encountered this a few hours after I wrote this post, when I tried to make the site display all times in Manila local time. Apparently, even if I set my Django app to be timezone, aware, additional setup needs to be done on the MySQL side so it knows what the actual timezones are (feels like they should really do this as part of the install!). Basically you need to run &lt;code&gt;mysql_tzinfo_to_sql&lt;/code&gt; to load the OS timezone info into the database. This is in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://django.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ref/databases.html&#34;&gt;Django documentation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-tzinfo-to-sql.html&#34;&gt;MySQL documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;misc-stuff&#34;&gt;Misc stuff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used cron to set up most of the batch jobs I usually run (like the Twitter bots, etc). Initially I had problems where it seemed like cron wasn&amp;rsquo;t running the jobs, even though syslog showed me the cron daemon was actually running. I don&amp;rsquo;t have notes on how I resolved this, but mentioning it here so that if this happens again in the future, I know to actuall take notes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up log files for my cron jobs: I did it this way: &lt;code&gt;0 * * * * /path-to-batch/hourly.sh &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /var/log/cron/my-log-file.log 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1&lt;/code&gt;. The &amp;ldquo;2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1&amp;rdquo; at the end is necessary so that stderr is redirected to the same file (otherwise you&amp;rsquo;d only get stdout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log rotation: these is the kind of thing you don&amp;rsquo;t realize you need to do when you&amp;rsquo;re managing your own server. Anyway, I found this guide helpful: &lt;a href=&#34;https://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/setup-log-rotation-logrotate-ubuntu/&#34;&gt;https://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/setup-log-rotation-logrotate-ubuntu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to set up AWStats on the new server (and migrate data from the old server). This guide was helpful: &lt;a href=&#34;https://larsee.com/blog/2020/06/awstats-on-ubuntu-20-04-with-nginx/&#34;&gt;https://larsee.com/blog/2020/06/awstats-on-ubuntu-20-04-with-nginx/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When migrating the old AWStats data files, the filename format from the oldserver was slightly different (new install needed to end with &lt;code&gt;*.roytang.net.txt&lt;/code&gt;), so I learned a bit of bash scripting to do the batch rename:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;for i in /path-to-tmp/awstats/*.txt ; do cp &amp;quot;$i&amp;quot; &amp;quot;/path-to-tmp/awstats/out/$(basename &amp;quot;$i&amp;quot; .txt).roytang.net.txt&amp;quot; ; done&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt SSL on Nginx: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nginx.com/blog/using-free-ssltls-certificates-from-lets-encrypt-with-nginx/&#34;&gt;https://www.nginx.com/blog/using-free-ssltls-certificates-from-lets-encrypt-with-nginx/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect from the migration from shared hosting to a VPS is how much memory I&amp;rsquo;d need. My old hosting plan was only on 512MB ram, and the lowest DigitalOcean droplet had 1GB RAM, so I figured that was fine! But MySQL occasionally had out of memory errors on startup even at 1GB ram, so I bumped up to the next level (2GB RAM). I guess the database RAM usage didn&amp;rsquo;t count against my limits on the shared hosting! The next tier isn&amp;rsquo;t much more expensive and is still manageable for my casual/hobby hosting purposes, but I will probably try to look into more detail into the memory situation at some point to see what I can optimize.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now:&lt;/strong&gt; Stormy weekend here in Manila. Supposedly the &amp;ldquo;strongest storm of 2020&amp;rdquo; so far, typhoon Rolly made landfall earlier today and is currently battering many of the provinces south of Metro Manila. Storm signals are as high as number 5. As of this writing, weather is currently cold and nippy but not particularly rainy where I am. We expect stronger winds and rain to hit us as evening approaches as well. On top of everything, a second typhoon has entered the PH area of responsibility and is expected to affect us over the next couple of days as well. If those two typhoons get together, it may be very bad. Hoping for the best. (I thought about doing these weeknotes end of day&amp;hellip; but we might lose power, so here we go.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Server migration update:&lt;/strong&gt; Migrating the final domain now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; I finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1322214646221205504/&#34;&gt;Link&amp;rsquo;s Awakening!&lt;/a&gt; Full heart and seashell completion even! It was fun and a great throwback to classic games like Link to the Past. I never played the original on Gameboy, though maybe that&amp;rsquo;s for the best, as I liked how this one looked and my memory is not tainted by nostalgia over GB graphics. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a particularly long game, especially compared to other Zeldas, but there is a custom dungeon feature (new to this remake) which probably adds some replay value, though I don&amp;rsquo;t have much interest in it at the moment. On to Super Mario Odyssey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; I did terribly at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/11/review-eternal/&#34;&gt;Eternal Card Game&lt;/a&gt; worlds LCQ, but I must admit their current celebration promo was super effective in getting me back into the game, as I&amp;rsquo;m now doing daily grinds in both Eternal and Magic Arena again. I managed to hit Mythic in Magic Arena before month end, but didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough time for Eternal, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can keep it up next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying games of &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/965580/Root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; with the Saturday gaming group. It&amp;rsquo;s a multifaction boardgame where each faction plays differently and has different ways of scoring victory points, and the factions will naturally clash with each other. The main challenge is finding a fine balance between advancing your agenda and interfering with the others. Disrupting the other factions might lose you some momentum compared to the others, but if no one keeps the others in check, someone might run away with victory! Pretty fun. And given that the game supports asynchronous games (up to 3 days per turn), the term &amp;ldquo;Saturday gaming group&amp;rdquo; is a bit obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Done:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober2020&#34;&gt;the Inktober thing&lt;/a&gt;! I managed to get through the whole thing without missing a day! Doing daily drawings with a pen are hard for me, given my poor manual dexterity at this age (and it was never that good in the first place). My hands got tired so easily, and a lot of my lines were shaky. Still, I enjoyed doing a lot of the sketches, and while I don&amp;rsquo;t want to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/03/sketching-daily/&#34;&gt;commit to daily drawings&lt;/a&gt; again (at least for now), maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll warm up the old Apple Pencil every so often and do some digital stuff? Maybe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt; I finished Season 4 of The Expanse. I didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy it as much as the first 3 seasons, though the second half was better than the first. Things were ramping up too slowly, and a lot of things didn&amp;rsquo;t seem relevant to the what was going on with the Roci crew (and turned out to be mostly geared towards next season&amp;rsquo;s big crisis apparently?). As I said to a friend, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m here for the scifi protomolecule stuff not OPA terrorist or earth politics BS.&amp;rdquo; Still, looking forward to the next season. Also: Finished five seasons of NCIS (that&amp;rsquo;s all they had on Prime Video). In the queue: The Boys S2, Star Trek Discovery S3, Mandalorian S2. Where&amp;rsquo;s my Orville?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skipped:&lt;/strong&gt; Hacktoberfest. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considering:&lt;/strong&gt; Nanowrimo. Haven&amp;rsquo;t done any prep, so if ever it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a late start. I do have some ideas rolling around in my head, but I also have some other stuff to do, so for now let&amp;rsquo;s say this is &amp;ldquo;low probability&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxiety:&lt;/strong&gt; Low, most of it due to awaiting a call back about something that hasn&amp;rsquo;t pushed through yet, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really need? Why am I anxious about it then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Random:&lt;/strong&gt; This storm reminded me of my worst typhoon experience in Metro Manila, Ondoy back in 2009, so I wrote a short &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2009/09/ondoy/&#34;&gt;back-dated retrospective on it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad luck:&lt;/strong&gt; The hinge on one side of my glasses&amp;rsquo; frame broke while I was at the cashier at the grocery yesterday! D: I have a slightly older pair I can use in the meantime, but it&amp;rsquo;ll probably be a few days before I can even go to get a real replacement, given the storm and the long weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward to:&lt;/strong&gt; the US presidential elections, with a mix of morbid dread and anticipation, like an onlooker at a car crash.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Managed to hit mythic on #magicarena the day before rollover lol. I was using &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/karsten_frank/&#34;&gt;@karsten_frank&lt;/a&gt; &amp;rsquo;s Gruul Adventures list  #mtg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;cite class=&#34;u-quotation-of h-cite&#34;&gt;
    Quoted &lt;a  href=&#39;https://twitter.com/karsten_frank/status/1320480706867449861&#39;&gt;karsten_frank&amp;#39;s tweet&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I went 20-5 with Gruul Adventures across #RedBullUntapped2020 and the Arena Qualifier this weekend. Deck&amp;rsquo;s great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like this fancy black pen I bought 3-ish years ago is close to giving out on me. To be honest, it&amp;rsquo;s already a record for the longest time I&amp;rsquo;ve had a pen and not lost it somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
