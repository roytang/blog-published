            &lt;h4 id=&#34;posted-on-rglobaltalk-question-what-are-the-police-like-in-your-countryhttpsredditcomrglobaltalkcommentsmvsss1question_what_are_the_police_like_in_your_country&#34;&gt;Posted on r/GlobalTalk: &lt;a href=&#34;https://reddit.com/r/GlobalTalk/comments/mvsss1/question_what_are_the_police_like_in_your_country/&#34;&gt;[Question] What are the police like in your country?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following recent events in the US (disclaimer: I&amp;rsquo;m not an American), police brutality is a big, controversial topic over there, leading to protests and calls to defund the police and such, popularizing the phrase ACAB (meaning &amp;ldquo;all cops are bastards&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my own country (the Philippines), cops don&amp;rsquo;t have a very good reputation either; they are often seen as corrupt extortionists and some may be complicit in extrajudicial killings in Duterte&amp;rsquo;s drug war; recently they have done some bad moves such as attempting to interfere with community pantries that popped up to help the poor during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that left me wondering what police are like in other countries. Are there countries where the police have a generally good reputation (maybe my country or the US can learn something from those places)? Or are they generally just tools for enforcing the (often unequal) status quo?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Wednesday afternoon Strixhaven draft(s?)! &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&#34;&gt;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&lt;/a&gt; #mtg #magicarena #twitch #strixhaven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a great draft! I went Quandrix+Prismari and managed to go 7-2. Very explosive. One of those losses was actually due to the server giving me a defeat without even going to a match, so I might even get reimbursement!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;This is a follow up to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/blogs-of-yesteryear/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Blogs of Yesteryear&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. This is the remainder of my blogroll from 2004/2005. I feel like the second half is less interesting than the first half, but I figured I might as well go through them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;geekiness&#34;&gt;geekiness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the blogs under this session are about general geeky topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absurd Genius&lt;/strong&gt; - looks this was a tech and gaming-focused blog that featured a web portal for the PSP browser. But I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anymore information about the author. It was formerly hosted on base2.org, but that domain doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have any content now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forever Geek&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a blog that covered a lot of geeky topics - tech, anime, gadgets, games, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://forevergeek.com/&#34;&gt;still around&lt;/a&gt;! I no longer follow them though, mainly because that&amp;rsquo;s not really the sort of site I follow anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kuro5hin&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a slashdot-like discussion site that was a bit popular back in the day. According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuro5hin&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the site was taken down permanently in 2016. Kuro5hin was owned by Rusty Foster, who now writes a newsletter, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.todayintabs.com/&#34;&gt;Today in Tabs&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/newsletters-redux/&#34;&gt;newsletters I follow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gaming&#34;&gt;gaming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed a lot of gaming sites back in the day. I no longer follow these, mostly because I&amp;rsquo;m not interested anymore in having 100% gaming feeds in my feedreader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;game girl advance&lt;/strong&gt; - a gaming blog with all women writers. Back then most of the people writing about games were male (I think), so following a site like this one helped diversify your POVs. The site is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gamegirladvance.com/&#34;&gt;still up&lt;/a&gt;, but the last update is from 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GameDevBlog&lt;/strong&gt; - this is a blog by game developer Jamie Fristrom. I think I followed this site after I read an interesting article he wrote about implementing web-swinging in the 2004 videogame Spider-man 2. His &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gamedevblog.com/&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt; and updated as recently as last October!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games from Within&lt;/strong&gt; - this was another game developer&amp;rsquo;s blog (in case it isn&amp;rsquo;t obvious, it is/was one of my interests). The &lt;a href=&#34;https://gamesfromwithin.com/&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt;, last post is from 2018. (Annoyingly, it&amp;rsquo;s one of those sites that doesn&amp;rsquo;t show the post date on the listing screens.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RPGamer&lt;/strong&gt; - a gaming site focused on computer/console RPGs. This and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rpgfan.com/&#34;&gt;RPGFan&lt;/a&gt; were my main source of RPG news back in the day. RPGamer is &lt;a href=&#34;https://rpgamer.com/&#34;&gt;still up&lt;/a&gt; and going strong. (The site even still has the same dragon logo and font!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These Damned Machines Are Killing Me&lt;/strong&gt; - another gaming focused blog, this one was short-lived, looks like it wasn&amp;rsquo;t updated past 2007, after which the site went down. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.damnedmachines.com/&#34;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt; currently redirects to a site called Furious Games, not sure if related.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3rd World Game Designer&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a blog by Gabby Dizon, a game designer from the Philippines! (I&amp;rsquo;m always interested in local content). The site is no longer accessible and the domain is parked. I think I found the author on Twitter, but he seems to be a crypto guy now or some such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;comics&#34;&gt;comics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still read webcomics these days, though not as much, and almost never through a feed reader (most of the time.) Related: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2006/10/webcomics-i-like-2006-edition/&#34;&gt;Webcomics I Like, 2006 Edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PvPonline&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a webcomic about the employees at a gaming publication, it was quite popular back in the day. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://pvponline.com/&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt; and the author recently rebooted/time-skipped the story. I currently follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pvponline&#34;&gt;the author on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and catch up on it whenever I see him update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Penny Arcade&lt;/strong&gt; - one of the longest-running mostly-gaming-focused webcomics (and one of the most well-known). The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.penny-arcade.com/&#34;&gt;site is still going strong&lt;/a&gt; after all these years, sporting largely the same color scheme. I get updates because I follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cwgabriel&#34;&gt;the artist on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comics: Foxtrot&lt;/strong&gt; - one of my favorite slice of life strips, I have a few of the books. It stopped being released as a daily a while back, and the author now only releases a new comic every Sunday, I think. Once again, I am following &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/billamend&#34;&gt;the artist on twitter&lt;/a&gt;. (Starting to see a pattern here.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comics: Sinfest&lt;/strong&gt; - it started out as a dark humor strip about this guy Slick who tries to hit on a girl named Monique and just kept expanding and expanding its scope, covering topics such as politics, patriarchy, religion, that kind of stuff. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://sinfest.net/&#34;&gt;still running&lt;/a&gt; but I mostly lost interest when he tended to do arcs that ran really long. I much preferred his silly, standalone strips like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sinfest.net/view.php?date=2004-04-05&#34;&gt;this one about Apples and Oranges&lt;/a&gt;. Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2010/08/1042004246/&#34;&gt;another one that I liked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dilbert&lt;/strong&gt; - this famous strip is of course still running (currently at &lt;a href=&#34;https://dilbert.com/&#34;&gt;Dilbert.com&lt;/a&gt;), although the author has in recent years come out as Trump supporter with many bad takes. I still read the strip, mostly because it comes with our daily newspaper. (On paper! We still have those!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real life comics&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a semi-autobiographical slice-of-life comic about a guy named Greg. I had stopped following it for a while because of reasons, but last year I found out that (a) it was still going strong; and (b) the author recently &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/reallifecomics/status/1284587454968651777&#34;&gt;came out as as trans&lt;/a&gt;. The strip is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reallifecomics.com/index.php&#34;&gt;still running&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comics: Calvin and Hobbes&lt;/strong&gt; - the quintessential comic about a little kid and his tiger. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why I bothered following this one, since the author stopped drawing the strip in 1995. I believe that I have already read every single strip of C&amp;amp;H, so there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to follow it now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Websnark&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a commentary blog about stuff on the internet, mostly webcomics. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember following it for too long, probably lost interest at some point. The domain currently has nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lifehacks&#34;&gt;lifehacks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are blogs I followed about self-improvement, productivity, that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working Smart&lt;/strong&gt; - looks like this was a blog from a guy who was head of a Christian publishing company. I guess I followed him because he sometimes published about topics like getting things done, communication, tech, gadgets, and blogging. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember following him for very long, so I imagine I lost interest quickly. The site is no longer accessible and he no longer seems to be blogging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve Pavlina&amp;rsquo;s Blog&lt;/strong&gt; - this is a guy who became well-known as a self-help author and motivational speaker. He often wrote about personal development. I&amp;rsquo;m not really into that kind of content anymore so I no longer follow him. He still writes at stevepavlina.com.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;43 Folders&lt;/strong&gt; - a site about &amp;ldquo;tricks, hacks and other cool stuff&amp;rdquo;, named after the number of manila folders in a tickler file. The site is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.43folders.com/&#34;&gt;still around&lt;/a&gt;, but the last update is from 2011. I&amp;rsquo;m currently following &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies&#34;&gt;the author on twitter&lt;/a&gt;, he no longer seems to be blogging and is more of a podcaster now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;feed-readers&#34;&gt;feed readers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the old site, my feeds back then were powered by an app called Bloglines. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloglines&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; says Bloglines became unavailable in 2015, but presumably I stopped using it in 2007 when I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2007/01/newshutch-feed-aggregator/&#34;&gt;switched to a different app called Newshutch&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, I was complaining that &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader&#34;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt;, released in 2007, was &amp;ldquo;slow as molasses&amp;rdquo;! I eventually did migrate to Google Reader and was a faithful user until &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2013/06/347364993144074241/&#34;&gt;it was killed off in 2013&lt;/a&gt;. (In hindsight, this was more recent than I thought it was!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-about-now&#34;&gt;what about now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I follow a mostly different set of blogs now. There&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/blogroll/&#34;&gt;a blogroll&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;rsquo;s a touch out of date and could use some updating. Maybe sometime soon. Looking over the list, it seems I prefer not to follow single-topic blogs anymore and enjoy slice-of-life blogs where people talk about their day-to-day pursuits on a personal level (instead of say, writing as a general-purpose article for any reader). Feel free to send me blogs or blogrolls you recommend, I will gladly spend an hour or so scrolling through a blogroll and clicking through links and checking out blogs!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Today I decided to watch Rocky (1976) for some reason. The quintessential sports film, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen it before. Stallone looks only a bit younger than I remember him from the 90s. Apollo Creed is that dude from the Mandalorian! Surprised at the ending.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Thursday afternoon Strixhaven draft(s?)! &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&#34;&gt;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&lt;/a&gt; #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgstrixhaven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went Silverquill, only finished 4-3, mostly due to a really bad misplay on my part in the last game. Decent outcome, but could have been better. I did manage to rare-draft a lot though lol&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;When you are full of hate and bitterness every act of love and every move of a good-hearted person will look like virtue signaling&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Monday afternoon Strixhaven draft(s?)! &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&#34;&gt;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&lt;/a&gt; #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgstrixhaven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one draft this session, but I had a lot of fun! Mostly because it was my first 7-win of the season, but also because I drafted an insane quandrix deck with the other 3 colors splashed, and won 3 games off Approach of the Second Sun. I never got to activate codie though!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Someone tried to scam me out of my Netflix account. Weird because its never actually asked me to 2fa before. (Yes, I have reset my pw)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah i suppose it might have been someone using my phone from the recent fb data leak to try to reset the pw.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to think of this past week, feels like it went by quickly. I may have spent too much of it daydreaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NCR+ bubble is now one week into modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ - an acronym that makes no sense). Cases still seem to be pretty high on a day-to-day basis, though we&amp;rsquo;re told the R number is dropping slightly, so that&amp;rsquo;s good I guess? Still, would be nice if the case numbers would calm down. Still lots of stories about people having trouble getting into hospitals and dying in ICUs. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/4/12/Roque-un-Christian-COVID-19-confinement.html&#34;&gt;the presidential spokesperson claims it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;unchristian&amp;rdquo; to ask how he managed to get a hospital booking despite all the problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quezon City is out of vaccines, at least for now, until the national government gives them some more. They were able to vaccinate around 100,000 people so far, which isn&amp;rsquo;t too bad. The two seniors I live with still haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten vaccinated, so hopefully supplies come back up soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a rare show of spine, the Philippine government, in coordination with American friends, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.esquiremag.ph/politics/news/china-backs-down-a00293-20210416-lfrm&#34;&gt;have sent coast guard ships to chase away the Chinese invaders&lt;/a&gt; in Julian Felipe reef!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not sure what&amp;rsquo;s happening with the rest of the world, haven&amp;rsquo;t really been paying attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I guess we could note that in the US, cops are killing more black people while protests about previous killings are going on while a former police officer is on trial for a previous killing, but this sort of thing doesn&amp;rsquo;t really feel &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; for the US anymore. Now, if they actually do something to fix the systemic rot in their police system, that would be news. (Not that our cops here are much better&amp;hellip;) Don&amp;rsquo;t really feel like providing links for this one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google is rolling out a new Chrome feature called FloC that allows the browser itself to profile you for ads, instead of using third-party cookies. &lt;a href=&#34;https://seirdy.one/2021/04/16/permissions-policy-floc-misinfo.html&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s some more info.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://margint.blog/2021/04/05/creating-software-at-scale/&#34;&gt;Everyone is still terrible at creating software at scale&lt;/a&gt;. (I would argue humans are terrible at creating anything at scale&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dorinlazar.ro/2021-02-programming-is-hard/&#34;&gt;Programming is hard, says dorin.lazar.ro&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/programming-is-hard/&#34;&gt;a response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I might not play it, but I like the aesthetic of upcoming Metroidvania &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXDcMVvtPh4&#34;&gt;GetsuFumaDen: Undying Moon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;! Practiced &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1383150746334466051/&#34;&gt;sketching some elaborate hair&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;rsquo;s always a challenge for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tried out &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1382290950483976200/&#34;&gt;these three-cheese donuts from Lola Nena&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;, after I heard about them from a local streamer. Pretty good!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1381509474259673090/&#34;&gt;Airplane! (1980)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/ced0a77eea2857ad31bd014fac3ded9a/&#34;&gt;Live and Let Die (1973)&lt;/a&gt; to continute the James Bond run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt; was mostly set up for the finale next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have also been enjoying &lt;strong&gt;Invincible&lt;/strong&gt;, but I guess that I will reserve commentary until the season is done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did not watch this year&amp;rsquo;s Wrestlemania.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new set, Strixhaven, has dropped on &lt;strong&gt;Magic Arena&lt;/strong&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;m having fun drafting it. Follow along via &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgstrixhaven/&#34;&gt;the MTGStrixhaven tag&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also randomly decided into &lt;strong&gt;Eternal&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Stormbreak open this weekend, did terribly, as could be expected lol. At least I got to open a bunch of packs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other than the card games, I actually didn&amp;rsquo;t get much gaming done this week. I should correct that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/strong&gt; has no progress this past week lol. I really should finish this second run. I did play a bit of &lt;strong&gt;Pac-Man 99&lt;/strong&gt; on the Switch, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t manage to actually win a game, seems harder than Super Mario 99.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Currently reading &lt;strong&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/strong&gt; by Neal Stephenson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia: This past Saturday, our trivia group split into two teams: one played in an Attack on Titan-themed trivia (I didn&amp;rsquo;t join because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be spoiled) while the rest of us played in the regular AboutQuiz, with a poetry-themed game. Coincidentally, we finished in third place for both quizzes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier finale!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Invincible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rose DLC character for Street Fighter V drops on the 19th, part of season 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn will be free on PSN on the 19th, no PS+ required!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final Civ6 balance update drops on the 22nd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A couple of family birthdays next weekend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We actually have two regular trivia events this coming week, since PopQuiz is back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mystery event on Saturday the 24th, I&amp;rsquo;ll post about it if I decide to participate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Saturday afternoon Strixhaven draft(s?)! &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&#34;&gt;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&lt;/a&gt; #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgstrixhaven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managed to do 2 drafts today. First one with Witherbloom only went 3 wins, but I managed 4 wins with the second one using Quandrix before a matchmaking bug ended my draft prematurely (hopefully we get reimbursed!)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Friday afternoon Strixhaven sealed! &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&#34;&gt;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&lt;/a&gt; #mtg #magicarena #MTGStrixhaven #twitch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ended up with a 3 hour stream doing 1 sealed and 1 draft. Didn&amp;rsquo;t finish too well, only went 4-3 in sealed with silverquill and 3-1 in draft with lorehold, but it&amp;rsquo;s a decent enough start. I like the set so far and looking forward to trying out the other houses!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/momblogger/&#34;&gt;@momblogger&lt;/a&gt; Even if we criticize the choice of sinovac as less efficient, its still our duty to get vaccinated to improve public health. The Duterte govt gave us no choice. Those who still get vaccinated with sinovac should even be commended for setting aside their misgivings&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I got my #MagicArena stats for #mtgkhm! Pretty sure I was picking Priest of the Haunted Edge too highly. Also for some reason the last time I got one of these emails was for Theros Beyond Death one year ago. #MTGArenaStats&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Google Chrome is adding a new feature that lets their browser target you with ads without using third-party browser cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s some more info: &lt;a href=&#34;https://plausible.io/blog/google-floc&#34;&gt;How to fight back against Google FLoC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But basically it comes down to: if you&amp;rsquo;re a web user who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want your browsing history to be used to target you with advertisments, stop using Google Chrome. There are many alternatives. I&amp;rsquo;m a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; boy myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For site owners, you can add a &lt;code&gt;Permissions-Policy: interest-cohort=()&lt;/code&gt; response header to opt-out of your site being included in the data collected about your Chrome visitors. I&amp;rsquo;ve updated this site to add the header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update 4.18] &lt;a href=&#34;https://seirdy.one/&#34;&gt;sierdy.one&lt;/a&gt; says the &lt;a href=&#34;https://seirdy.one/2021/04/16/permissions-policy-floc-misinfo.html&#34;&gt;fears about FloC aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly accurate&lt;/a&gt;, and that webmasters don&amp;rsquo;t really need to add the response header as long as they aren&amp;rsquo;t using third-party scripts anyway? I&amp;rsquo;ll just keep it around though.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Bond film no. 8: Live and Let Die (1973).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore feels a lot more &amp;ldquo;generic white guy&amp;rdquo; than Connery was. Maybe I just need to get used to him. Young Jane Seymour is here! There&amp;rsquo;s a bayou chase scene here that goes on just a bit too long and had superfluous cop characters. &lt;!--sep--&gt;All the voodoo stuff felt weirdly out of place. There&amp;rsquo;s a character named Tee Hee! Most ridiculous villain death so far.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Honestly I feel like people like this should be named and shamed publicly. If we can&amp;rsquo;t catch them, we should at least make it socially unacceptable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;cite class=&#34;u-quotation-of h-cite&#34;&gt;
    Quoted &lt;a  href=&#39;https://twitter.com/rodelalbert/status/1378293200876564483&#39;&gt;rodelalbert&amp;#39;s tweet&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    I saw an acquaintance on ig who recently posted he got vaccinated and I asked if he was in the group A category. Turns out nasa friends of the VIP category pala sya.

            <title>Ted Lasso Season 1 spoiler-free review

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/ted-lasso-season-1-spoiler-free-review/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A number of people I follow have been raving about Ted Lasso for a while, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a try. My thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Season 1 is 10 episodes, each episode 30 minutes long. I finished all of the episodes over the span of one day!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know much coming in: I knew it was about sports, and I knew it was supposedly a comedy. For some reason I assumed it was about American football. It turns out to be about English association football, i.e. soccer!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wikipedia claims the series is a comedy, but it&amp;rsquo;s not a &amp;ldquo;ha-ha / laugh out loud&amp;rdquo; zany situation comedy like say, Brooklyn Nine-Nine or Modern Family. Ted Lasso is more of an &amp;ldquo;absurd premise&amp;rdquo; kind of comedy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bill Lawrence, creator of Scrubs, helped develop the series, but it is much less zanier than that one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, Ted Lasso is the story of an outsider coming into to help a dysfunctional team get their act together. I&amp;rsquo;d say the story it most reminds me of is Mighty Ducks. In both cases, I learned a lot more about the associated sport (Ice hockey / association football) works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difference between Mighty Ducks&amp;rsquo; reluctant coach Gordon Bombay and the titular Ted Lasso is that Ted is earnest, eager, and genuinely cares for his team, and he uses his abundant optimism to plot through any problems that life throws at him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The meat of the story is how Ted Lasso, an American football coach thrust into the unfamiliar world of the English Premiere League navigates both the foreign culture and the many contrasting personalities he has to work with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main plotline of the team&amp;rsquo;s eventual win-loss record is at many times overshadowed by the character arcs and development, as the cast grows to understand each other and their roles within the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think one of the main reasons Ted Lasso has been so popular during this pandemic is the absolute optimism both of the show and the lead character inspite of all the challenges thrown his way. It&amp;rsquo;s a kind of optimism we could all use in these trying times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dorinlazar.ro/&#34;&gt;dorinlazar.ro&lt;/a&gt; talks about &lt;a href=&#34;https://dorinlazar.ro/2021-02-programming-is-hard/&#34;&gt;programming being hard&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most beginners in programming eventually end up with the same ingratiating message: „Programming is easy, everyone can do it”, with some threatening message that people doing the gatekeeping should stop doing that. I’m here to tell you that that is not true. Programming is hard, programming is not for everyone, and for the time being everyone might be able to do it, but most definitely most should not. Like most of the empty, shallow, positive messages coming with an automatic defense against refute, in this case talking about this gatekeeping thing that simply doesn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think gatekeeping is definitely a thing that happens. I should know, I used to hold the opinion that not everybody can be a programmer, because there are non-trivial skill sets that are necessary, such as attention to detail, ability to analyze and reason out possible outcomes, the ability to imagine abstractions in your head, and so on. Back when I did training for new hires, I could easily tell who are the people who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t pass, by simply noting who had trouble with things like SQL joins. (This was back in the day when we expected our devs to be able to handle everything from backend database stuff to web frontends with HTML/CSS/JS. I assume modern day frontend devs wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have much use for SQL usage&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, it&amp;rsquo;s not a hard gate, where someone can tell you it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to become a programmer. Anyone can be a programmer, in the same way that anyone can become an accountant or a lawyer or such: it&amp;rsquo;s going to take a nontrivial amount of effort and hard work (I&amp;rsquo;m not claiming that being a programmer is necessarily as difficult as those jobs!). Some people may make it look easy, because they may have a bit more aptitude than others (due to background or whatever), in the same way that some people find math easy and others find it nearly impossible. And a lot of the time it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to detect whether that aptitude exists until you&amp;rsquo;re trying it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also a huge difference between learning to code just to write a few scripts in Python or some macros in Excel vs working professionally as a programmer, possibly in a team, with serious deadlines and crunch and all that. Not everyone is suited to that life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m all for inclusivity - we definitely need more people working in tech, and for people who are struggling, learning to code may be a way for them to live better lives. But we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t sugarcoat the challenges involved or the effort required. &amp;ldquo;Anyone can learn to code&amp;rdquo;, given enough time and effort, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean programming is easy.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This was great but sometimes I wonder how people know to video something before knowing how it&amp;rsquo;s gonna turn out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;cite class=&#34;u-quotation-of h-cite&#34;&gt;
    Quoted &lt;a  href=&#39;https://twitter.com/cheembeam/status/1381669042772193283&#39;&gt;cheembeam&amp;#39;s tweet&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way I screamed after watching the end of this video! 😩😩😩😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video width=&#39;320&#39; height=&#39;568&#39; controls&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Needed something light to watch in the background, so I watched Airplane! (1980). It&amp;rsquo;s the kind of movie where they just stuff in as many gags as possible, every throwaway line and even stuff happening in the background is a gag.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;People need to learn to stop sending scanned documents sideways. Your scanner software has a setting for the document orientation!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Without Their Permission by Alexis Ohanian
</title>

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/without-their-permission-by-alexis-ohanian/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without Their Permission&lt;/em&gt; is a 2013 book by Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian. The central thesis of the book is that modern-day internet breaks down barriers and allows anyone to accomplish great things without having to go through traditional gatekeepers like publishers and such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually read the first part of the book a few years ago, and just resumed reading the book now because I saw in iBooks that it remembered where I had stopped. The first part covered mostly the author&amp;rsquo;s involvement in two successful startups - Reddit and Hipmunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle part of the book is dedicated to the central idea that &amp;ldquo;all links are created equal&amp;rdquo; and as long as you make something that other people want and make it accessible on the internet, success is possible. The author extols how the modern internet has made it easier for anyone to start something big, the same way he and his cofounder built Reddit. The funny thing for me is he cites a number of interesting startups that he&amp;rsquo;s invested in, but I&amp;rsquo;ve not heard of most of them, so presumably they didn&amp;rsquo;t actually succeed in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last part of the book covers the then-online community&amp;rsquo;s protests against the SOPA and PIPA bills, lobbyist-fueled IP protection laws that would have stifled the open internet, the precursor of the modern DMCA. While the defeats of SOPA and PIPA were early successes for online freedom, these days there are still other insidious challenges such as surveillance capitalism  and the deliberate spread of online misinformation and conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I don&amp;rsquo;t object to this central idea, I feel like it should be tempered with the fact that despite the open internet, success is still much harder than the book might portray it. And despite the waning power of traditional gatekeepers, these days there are online gatekeepers as well that can hinder your success. Online gatekeepers include App Store reviewers, closed platforms like facebook that have unclear moderation policies, censorship from governments, algorithms that decide what to surface to other people, and so on. It&amp;rsquo;s still probably better than the old days, but there are still a lot of challenges on the modern internet. To be fair, the book was released in 2013, which was a lifetime ago on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
