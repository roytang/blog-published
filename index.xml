            &lt;p&gt;Honestly I feel like people like this should be named and shamed publicly. If we can&amp;rsquo;t catch them, we should at least make it socially unacceptable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;cite class=&#34;u-quotation-of h-cite&#34;&gt;
    Quoted &lt;a  href=&#39;https://twitter.com/rodelalbert/status/1378293200876564483&#39;&gt;rodelalbert&amp;#39;s tweet&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    I saw an acquaintance on ig who recently posted he got vaccinated and I asked if he was in the group A category. Turns out nasa friends of the VIP category pala sya.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

            <title>Ted Lasso Season 1 spoiler-free review
</title>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A number of people I follow have been raving about Ted Lasso for a while, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a try. My thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Season 1 is 10 episodes, each episode 30 minutes long. I finished all of the episodes over the span of one day!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know much coming in: I knew it was about sports, and I knew it was supposedly a comedy. For some reason I assumed it was about American football. It turns out to be about English association football, i.e. soccer!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wikipedia claims the series is a comedy, but it&amp;rsquo;s not a &amp;ldquo;ha-ha / laugh out loud&amp;rdquo; zany situation comedy like say, Brooklyn Nine-Nine or Modern Family. Ted Lasso is more of an &amp;ldquo;absurd premise&amp;rdquo; kind of comedy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bill Lawrence, creator of Scrubs, helped develop the series, but it is much less zanier than that one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, Ted Lasso is the story of an outsider coming into to help a dysfunctional team get their act together. I&amp;rsquo;d say the story it most reminds me of is Mighty Ducks. In both cases, I learned a lot more about the associated sport (Ice hockey / association football) works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difference between Mighty Ducks&amp;rsquo; reluctant coach Gordon Bombay and the titular Ted Lasso is that Ted is earnest, eager, and genuinely cares for his team, and he uses his abundant optimism to plot through any problems that life throws at him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The meat of the story is how Ted Lasso, an American football coach thrust into the unfamiliar world of the English Premiere League navigates both the foreign culture and the many contrasting personalities he has to work with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main plotline of the team&amp;rsquo;s eventual win-loss record is at many times overshadowed by the character arcs and development, as the cast grows to understand each other and their roles within the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think one of the main reasons Ted Lasso has been so popular during this pandemic is the absolute optimism both of the show and the lead character inspite of all the challenges thrown his way. It&amp;rsquo;s a kind of optimism we could all use in these trying times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dorinlazar.ro/&#34;&gt;dorinlazar.ro&lt;/a&gt; talks about &lt;a href=&#34;https://dorinlazar.ro/2021-02-programming-is-hard/&#34;&gt;programming being hard&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most beginners in programming eventually end up with the same ingratiating message: „Programming is easy, everyone can do it”, with some threatening message that people doing the gatekeeping should stop doing that. I’m here to tell you that that is not true. Programming is hard, programming is not for everyone, and for the time being everyone might be able to do it, but most definitely most should not. Like most of the empty, shallow, positive messages coming with an automatic defense against refute, in this case talking about this gatekeeping thing that simply doesn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think gatekeeping is definitely a thing that happens. I should know, I used to hold the opinion that not everybody can be a programmer, because there are non-trivial skill sets that are necessary, such as attention to detail, ability to analyze and reason out possible outcomes, the ability to imagine abstractions in your head, and so on. Back when I did training for new hires, I could easily tell who are the people who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t pass, by simply noting who had trouble with things like SQL joins. (This was back in the day when we expected our devs to be able to handle everything from backend database stuff to web frontends with HTML/CSS/JS. I assume modern day frontend devs wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have much use for SQL usage&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, it&amp;rsquo;s not a hard gate, where someone can tell you it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to become a programmer. Anyone can be a programmer, in the same way that anyone can become an accountant or a lawyer or such: it&amp;rsquo;s going to take a nontrivial amount of effort and hard work (I&amp;rsquo;m not claiming that being a programmer is necessarily as difficult as those jobs!). Some people may make it look easy, because they may have a bit more aptitude than others (due to background or whatever), in the same way that some people find math easy and others find it nearly impossible. And a lot of the time it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to detect whether that aptitude exists until you&amp;rsquo;re trying it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also a huge difference between learning to code just to write a few scripts in Python or some macros in Excel vs working professionally as a programmer, possibly in a team, with serious deadlines and crunch and all that. Not everyone is suited to that life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m all for inclusivity - we definitely need more people working in tech, and for people who are struggling, learning to code may be a way for them to live better lives. But we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t sugarcoat the challenges involved or the effort required. &amp;ldquo;Anyone can learn to code&amp;rdquo;, given enough time and effort, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean programming is easy.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This was great but sometimes I wonder how people know to video something before knowing how it&amp;rsquo;s gonna turn out&lt;/p&gt;

    Quoted &lt;a  href=&#39;https://twitter.com/cheembeam/status/1381669042772193283&#39;&gt;cheembeam&amp;#39;s tweet&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way I screamed after watching the end of this video! 😩😩😩😂&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Needed something light to watch in the background, so I watched Airplane! (1980). It&amp;rsquo;s the kind of movie where they just stuff in as many gags as possible, every throwaway line and even stuff happening in the background is a gag.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;People need to learn to stop sending scanned documents sideways. Your scanner software has a setting for the document orientation!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without Their Permission&lt;/em&gt; is a 2013 book by Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian. The central thesis of the book is that modern-day internet breaks down barriers and allows anyone to accomplish great things without having to go through traditional gatekeepers like publishers and such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually read the first part of the book a few years ago, and just resumed reading the book now because I saw in iBooks that it remembered where I had stopped. The first part covered mostly the author&amp;rsquo;s involvement in two successful startups - Reddit and Hipmunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle part of the book is dedicated to the central idea that &amp;ldquo;all links are created equal&amp;rdquo; and as long as you make something that other people want and make it accessible on the internet, success is possible. The author extols how the modern internet has made it easier for anyone to start something big, the same way he and his cofounder built Reddit. The funny thing for me is he cites a number of interesting startups that he&amp;rsquo;s invested in, but I&amp;rsquo;ve not heard of most of them, so presumably they didn&amp;rsquo;t actually succeed in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last part of the book covers the then-online community&amp;rsquo;s protests against the SOPA and PIPA bills, lobbyist-fueled IP protection laws that would have stifled the open internet, the precursor of the modern DMCA. While the defeats of SOPA and PIPA were early successes for online freedom, these days there are still other insidious challenges such as surveillance capitalism  and the deliberate spread of online misinformation and conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I don&amp;rsquo;t object to this central idea, I feel like it should be tempered with the fact that despite the open internet, success is still much harder than the book might portray it. And despite the waning power of traditional gatekeepers, these days there are online gatekeepers as well that can hinder your success. Online gatekeepers include App Store reviewers, closed platforms like facebook that have unclear moderation policies, censorship from governments, algorithms that decide what to surface to other people, and so on. It&amp;rsquo;s still probably better than the old days, but there are still a lot of challenges on the modern internet. To be fair, the book was released in 2013, which was a lifetime ago on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and Queen Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s husband, has passed away. So has DMX, American rapper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big facebook breach reported, etc. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like news, really. My &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/04/1379404077319168000/&#34;&gt;phone number was among the data leaked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The country is still experiencing a surge in cases, hospitals and  ICUs still bursting to capacity. Yet in spite of the crisis, the president has not been around. This has prompted questions of whether he&amp;rsquo;s  still alive. This in turn prompted multiple proof-of-life photos and videos from the senator-who-is-also-presidential-assistant, some of which &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/News5PH/status/1380408229495119875&#34;&gt;may or may have been photoshopped&lt;/a&gt;. We are told he will make a public appearance Monday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of the president, it feels like an ABS-CBN reporter did more to defend our sovereignty vs China when &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/multimedia/slideshow/04/09/21/china-boat-chase-abscbn-news-team-chiara-zambrano&#34;&gt;they went to report on Chinese vessels near Ayungin Shoal and were harassed for their trouble&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After two weeks of ECQ, the NCR+ bubble is &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ABSCBNNews/status/1381142347489013761&#34;&gt;now placed under MECQ status until the end of the month&lt;/a&gt;. No, I have no idea what that means.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once again, the Philippines in the international news after &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/07/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-cases?#a-man-died-after-being-forced-to-do-300-squats-for-breaking-curfew-in-the-philippines&#34;&gt;a man died because he was made to do 300 squats for breaking curfew&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Wrestlemania weekend! And apparently it&amp;rsquo;s a two-night event this year. I don&amp;rsquo;t really follow WWE anymore, but I do often take the time to at least watch Wrestlemania and the Royal Rumble every year, so I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can get myself a copy somehow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kottke.org/21/04/ted-chiang-fears-of-technology-are-fears-of-capitalism&#34;&gt;Fears of technology are fears of capitalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/yes-experts-will-lie-to-you-sometimes&#34;&gt;Yes, experts will lie to you sometimes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently one of our possible climate change solutions is to &lt;a href=&#34;https://earther.gizmodo.com/the-u-s-is-one-step-closer-to-establishing-a-research-1846552421&#34;&gt;block out the sun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;! My favorite sketch for this week is of &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/04/1379656430081351687/&#34;&gt;Akira Kazama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOdgfo7OaLI&#34;&gt;upcoming fighter&lt;/a&gt; in the Street Fighter V season 5 DLC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/04/first-sinovac-dose/&#34;&gt;got my first dose of Sinovac vaccine today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing the James Bond run with &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/04/8fd56682f77942eb0badef9444d465a4/&#34;&gt;Diamonds are Forever (1971)&lt;/a&gt;, Connery&amp;rsquo;s last outing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt; was great, and those last 10 minutes were intense!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other than that, just the usual weekly shows, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday gaming group decided to pick up &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1075190/A_Game_of_Thrones_The_Board_Game__Digital_Edition/&#34;&gt;Game of Thrones The Boardgame on Steam!&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve played this one IRL before, only once, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t remember much. The digital version reminds me why: It&amp;rsquo;s super complicated! Our first game took two hours, I didn&amp;rsquo;t win. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have time for a second one since I had to get up early for the vaccine appointment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses still progressing very slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This month&amp;rsquo;s Humble Choice was revealed, and was meh for me, so I immediately paused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did get Days Gone via PS+ on PS4 though, I might actually play that one. Though they are also planning to give away Horizon Zero Dawn sometime this month, that might be a higher priority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Finished reading Alexis Ohanian&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Without-Their-Permission-Century-Managed/dp/1455520020&#34;&gt;Without Their Permission&lt;/a&gt;, will write a review soonish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our trivia group posted a &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/04/1379623251479908354/#comments&#34;&gt;new trivia video&lt;/a&gt;. Like and subscribe to the channel etc. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly just us playing games and trivia, having fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Falcon and Winter Soldier, Invincible, One Piece, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strixhaven drops on Magic Arena!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;h3 id=&#34;the-on-site-process&#34;&gt;The on-site process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got my first shot of the Sinovac vaccine earlier today at Pinyahan Elementary School in Quezon City. My appointment was for 9am, I arrived on-site a bit before 8:30am. There was a short queue outside, so I waited there for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 9am, they called out for anyone booked for 9am and let us inside. They handed us health screening forms and waivers to fill up while we were queued up inside. So many steps!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;initial screening to verify your appointment and categorization (I was under A3 - person with comorbidity) and your QC residence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vitals check (temp and blood pressure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;second screening to&amp;hellip; review things again?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;third screening to check my patient id against the online registration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fourth screening to review medical conditions and hand me my vaccination card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(inside the vaccination room) one more screening to verify registration and some medical things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finally get the shot!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after the shot, go to another room for observation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they take your blood pressure first, then you have to wait for a bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every so often someone comes in to give a briefing about possible side effects and what to do for the second dose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every 20-30 mins, they call out who are the people who are cleared and can already go home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the shot a bit before 11am, and was done by 11:30am. All in all about 3 hours for me on site, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s only because they had to start late? I imagine if your time slot was 11am, it&amp;rsquo;d be a bit quicker for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing this around 3 hours after I got the shot, feeling fine, no apparent ill effects, though they said to monitor for up to 6 hours after the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly satisfied with how things were handled on-site, mostly because the past few days I&amp;rsquo;ve heard horror stories about chaos at some of the other sites, mostly because some sites allegedly allowed walk-ins. The staff at Pinyahan were handling things as well as could be expected, although the whole process felt a bit too redundant with all the checks. Here, when someone asked outside if walkins would be accepted, they were told that the doses available for the day were only those allocated for those who had booked online. Also, they did that annoying thing with the queues for people sitting in chairs where every few minutes you&amp;rsquo;d have to get up and scoot over to the next chair over, until you eventually got to the front of the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;online-registration-and-processes&#34;&gt;Online registration and processes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least the on-site process was a bit better than the online registration, which was kind of a disaster. Basically, early on they said vaccinations would be handled via their Quezon City ID initiative, so people should sign up for that. I applied for mine digitally, while the parents submitted paper forms to the barangay, since someone came around the subdivision surveying seniors who wanted to be registered. My QC ID was approved after a couple of weeks, but up to now still no word on my parents&amp;rsquo; QC ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime in March, they announced that there would be two ways to get vaccinated: one was to register via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.ezconsult.io/&#34;&gt;app.ezconsult.io&lt;/a&gt;, or if you had a QC ID, you could wait for the LGU/barangay personnel to process the lists and give you an appointment. Second option felt like it might take a while, so I went ahead and created an account for myself on ezconsult. My plan was to create an account for the parents after I&amp;rsquo;d seen the process, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to successfully book a vaccine appointment because apparently I had registered too early and the integration hadn&amp;rsquo;t been enabled yet??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, they announced ezconsult was available for everybody, so I proceeded and was able to book an appointment for april 27th, the earliest I had seen available. Weirdly, when I was searching for vaccination sites, it included sites in other cities like Las Pinas, who I assume also have an arrangement with ezconsult. I also created accounts for the parents and submitted them for review. When filling up the form expressing interest in vaccination, some of the fields still assumed you were a health worker, since this sytem was initially used for the A1 priority groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people online were reporting problems with the app saying the email was already taken; turns out they had batch imported some QC ID data and auto-created accounts for those people without informing them, so people had to reset passwords (something a nontechnical person wouldn&amp;rsquo;t think to try!). Since I had created my account before this import, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a problem. Then there also were reports of people being able to book vaccination schedules without being one of the currently allowed priority groups; apparently the site doesn&amp;rsquo;t validate for that. And because Sinovac, the only widely available vaccine in the country, was not advised for seniors, QC government had to advice seniors not to book yet since there were very few stocks of Astra Zeneca for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while my brother, who had previously registered the same slot as me on the 27th, mentioned he had been able to reschedule to an earlier slot, today at 9am. I was like, how did you do that? When I checked the app I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see any free time slots available earlier than the 27th. Checking online, a lot of people were reporting there were free slots, while others said they couldn&amp;rsquo;t see any, so I assume they were doing some kind of manual / batch updates to set free slots, I ended up having to check every few days. It was only last Thursday I was only able to reschedule my appointment to today. And at that time, my parent&amp;rsquo;s accounts were still under review!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then last Friday, the ezconsult app was down for most of the day for some reason. (So, I was lucky to rebook right before that!) Lots of complaints from people, of course. By Saturday morning they were back up, and thankfully, I found that my parents accounts&amp;rsquo; could now schedule an appointment! Except&amp;hellip; there were no slots available again! At this time, the QC government had to send out advisories telling people not to go if they weren&amp;rsquo;t among the priority groups, as apparently large numbers of such people were causing chaos at some of the sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in the queues earlier, I asked about the availability of AstraZeneca for seniors, but I was told they didn&amp;rsquo;t have any today and couldn&amp;rsquo;t say if it would be available until the day itself when they got their deliveries. A few days ago, the FDA had approved Sinovac for seniors, so the few senior citizens in the queues today were getting Sinovac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I got my shot, we were told by a doctor in the observation room that the system would send us an automated email about the schedule for the second shot, but we were told to DISREGARD IT and instead come back on the date specified at the back of the vaccination card. So, their automation wasn&amp;rsquo;t going well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I can&amp;rsquo;t really blame the developers of the app for all the problems, I can only imagine the rapid pace of changing requirements they were subjected to, especially with the flip-flopping on whether seniors could go, or comorbids could go, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully all of the problems are just growing pains and such, and that the systems and processes get better and clearer as time goes on, since we definitely to ramp up and scale up vaccination in this country! Not to mention, they also need to provide alternative methods of registration/scheduling for non-technical people (probably requires legwork by barangay officials), as right now the process is largely inaccessible to the poorer sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Bond movie no. 7: Diamonds are Forever (1971). Connery&amp;rsquo;s hair starting to go a bit gray in his last appearance. More Blofeld than I&amp;rsquo;d expected (harhar). Space laser! Plenty O&amp;rsquo;Toole seemed pointless, there just to die. A lot of cheesy lines from the assassin henchment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--sep--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These movies would be a lot shorter if they just shot Bond whenever they caught him. The action scenes in all these old Bond films always feel so jarring compared to modern ones. Limited by the technology of their time I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;During a recent session of spelunking through old web stuff, I managed to find some older versions of the blog that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t found before (and hence aren&amp;rsquo;t available in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/archives/ancient/&#34;&gt;ancient archives&lt;/a&gt;). Screenshots of those old versions have been &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2004/12/layouts-2004/&#34;&gt;inserted back in the timeline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it&amp;rsquo;s one of those things I never bothered to archive because in theory all of that content had already been exported from &lt;a href=&#34;https://roywantsmeat.blogspot.com&#34;&gt;Blogspot&lt;/a&gt; to Wordpress and eventually to the current site. But there was some content from this archive I hadn&amp;rsquo;t recovered before: the list of blogs I link to in the sidebar! This content was exported from Bloglines, an RSS reader service available at the time (Google Reader had yet to be invented!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of these old blogs no longer appear in my current follows. I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to look at each of them and see where they are in the current web, both as a look at the kinds of stuff I (used to) follow and as a commentary on how very few blogs last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;around-here&#34;&gt;around here&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is blogs of people who I knew to also be in the Philippines, though not all of them I knew personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the beautiful rookery&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a blog written by a batchmate of mine from HS, hosted on blogspot. The blogspot account apparently still exists, but you need to be invited to be able to access it, so IDK what&amp;rsquo;s going on there. I still follow the writer on social media like Insta.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Entertainment Capital of UP Village&lt;/strong&gt; - another HS batchmate, this blog was hosted on LiveJournal which means it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://zukeeper.livejournal.com/&#34;&gt;still accessible online&lt;/a&gt;! He hasn&amp;rsquo;t written anything there since 2015 though. We are still good friends and are in constant contact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sassy Lawyer&amp;rsquo;s Journal&lt;/strong&gt; - this was the blog of a female lawyer in Metro Manila; IDK who it was, and the site is no longer accessible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sachachua&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/strong&gt; - I didn&amp;rsquo;t know Sacha personally, although I knew some of her batchmates. Her url is still active and redirects to her &lt;a href=&#34;https://sachachua.com/blog/&#34;&gt;current blog&lt;/a&gt;, where she writes mostly about Emacs stuff, something she&amp;rsquo;s been doing since 2004 apparently, so that&amp;rsquo;s a bit of dedication there. I think she also used to write about some productivity stuff, but I stopped following her when she started focusing mostly on Emacs, since that&amp;rsquo;s not an interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the babel machine&lt;/strong&gt; - hosted on blogspot and written by a guy called Joey Alarilla. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I knew him personally. He wrote mostly about games and tech and such. The blogspot site is no longer accessible. Looks like he moved to a wordpress site in 2006 and to a personal domain in 2009, but neither are accessible now. He founded a digital media startup called &lt;a href=&#34;https://digitallifeasia.com/&#34;&gt;Digital Life Asia&lt;/a&gt; and I found him &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/joeyalarilla&#34;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clair&amp;rsquo;s Tech Blog&lt;/strong&gt; - I knew Clair from HS, though we weren&amp;rsquo;t batchmates. She used to write about Linux, Emacs, tech, blogging, etc. Her site is no longer available, but I still follow her on Insta. She does art stuff on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/claircolors/&#34;&gt;public instagram&lt;/a&gt; and takes commissions, if that&amp;rsquo;s your thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;general-purpose&#34;&gt;general purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waxy Links&lt;/strong&gt; - by Andy Baio. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://waxy.org/category/links/&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt; to this day and still on my follows!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J-Walk Blog&lt;/strong&gt; - by John Walkenbach, well-known for his Excel knowledge. His blog was &amp;ldquo;all sorts of things&amp;rdquo; kind of blog, and he was prolific, blogging daily. Looks like he &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bitsandpieces.us/2011/10/14/the-end-of-an-era/&#34;&gt;stopped blogging in 2011&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://j-walkblog.com/&#34;&gt;domain is still up&lt;/a&gt;, but IDK if it&amp;rsquo;s still by the same person - the posts seem like the sort of thing I&amp;rsquo;d expect to find in like copy-paste blogs out to earn money from advertising. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any social media presence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boing Boing&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://boingboing.net/&#34;&gt;Boing Boing&lt;/a&gt; is still up, but no longer written primarily by Cory Doctorow I think. Doctorow now writes a new daily blog on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pluralistic.net/&#34;&gt;Pluralistic&lt;/a&gt; and is still one of my follows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tech-blogs&#34;&gt;tech blogs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Daily WTF: The Daily WTF&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a blog that highlighted one programmer&amp;rsquo;s mistakes every day, some of them were funny. &lt;a href=&#34;https://thedailywtf.com/&#34;&gt;The site is still up&lt;/a&gt;! I think I stopped following them a while ago because I kind of lost interest in that kind of thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Blog&lt;/strong&gt; - I think this blog used to cover mostly Google&amp;rsquo;s tech and engineering stuff. The site is still up at &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.google/&#34;&gt;a slightly different URL&lt;/a&gt;, but because of how much stuff Google is into now, it feels like many of their posts aren&amp;rsquo;t of interest to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joel on Software&lt;/strong&gt; - Joel wrote a lot about running a software company back in the day, and his writing certainly influenced a lot of the dev culture at the time (for better or for worse?). His &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt;, but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t post very often these days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ned Batchelder&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/strong&gt; - Ned wrote about tech / programming stuff; his &lt;a href=&#34;https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/&#34;&gt;blog is still up&lt;/a&gt; (and still has roughly the same layout!). I still follow him and he mostly writes about Python these days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scobleizer: Microsoft Geek Blogger&lt;/strong&gt; - Robert Scoble was a tech evangelist for Microsoft I believe. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I followed him for too long, as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t super interested in Microsoft tech stuff back then. A few years ago he was embroiled in a #MeToo controversy and apparently no longer has a social media presence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;interesting-blogs&#34;&gt;interesting blogs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Troutgirl&lt;/strong&gt; - Troutgirl worked in the tech industry, but her blog was a combination of tech stuff, industry stuff and other nontech things. At some point she moved from her own domain to &lt;a href=&#34;https://troutgirl.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;a Wordpress blog&lt;/a&gt;, which is now only sporadically updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ButtUgly&lt;/strong&gt; - ButtUgly is a Finnish blogger who ran his blog on JSPWiki. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecyrd.com/ButtUgly&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt; but the last post is from 2017.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Section&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a blog by Ole Eichhorn, who was very prolific, multiple posts a day, posts whatever interesting things he find, that kind of thing. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://w-uh.com/&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt; and regularly updated and even has the exact same layout!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extraordinary Ordinary Guy In Japan&lt;/strong&gt; - this is a well-written English blog by a Tokyo native. I guess I followed him for more exposure to Japanese culture. It looks like he stopped blogging in 2004. The site &lt;a href=&#34;https://xogij.blogs.com/xogij/&#34;&gt;is still up&lt;/a&gt;, but the actual post contents don&amp;rsquo;t seem to load, I can only see sidebars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gapingvoid&lt;/strong&gt; - a blog by Hugh MacLeod who got some traction back then for drawing cartoons on the back of business cards. He is the source of one of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/3ac092f01e360750d83d1beb1112efa0/&#34;&gt;my favorite quotes&lt;/a&gt;. His domain currently resolves to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gapingvoid.com/&#34;&gt;company site&lt;/a&gt;, where he is listed under the staff. It looks like &lt;a href=&#34;https://thejerusalemseries.com/&#34;&gt;he&amp;rsquo;s writing elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MarkTAW&lt;/strong&gt; - Mark blogged about a variety of topics including economics, psychology, marketing, music, etc. For some reason his domain now redirects to Amazon. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any instance of him writing elsewhere recently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WIL WHEATON dot NET&lt;/strong&gt; - Wil Wheaton is of course of Star Trek fame. Followed him mostly for interesting showbiz-adjacent stories. I believe I kept following him until recently during the Trump era, when his content started becoming mostly about anti-Trump rants. That content is fine with me, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t subscribe to it. His site is still up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neil Gaiman&amp;rsquo;s Journal&lt;/strong&gt; - Gaiman is of course a well-known fantasy writer, even back then. He&amp;rsquo;s still &lt;a href=&#34;https://journal.neilgaiman.com/&#34;&gt;journalling regularly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GELATOMETTI&lt;/strong&gt; - I think this guy was some kind of comic book artist. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://gelatometti.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;blogspot site&lt;/a&gt; is still up, but the content seems different from what the internet archive has, and hasn&amp;rsquo;t been updated since 2005.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fishbowl&lt;/strong&gt; - Another blog by a dev, writing mostly about dev stuff. &lt;a href=&#34;https://fishbowl.pastiche.org/&#34;&gt;The site is still up&lt;/a&gt; and is still being updated. Not sure why I&amp;rsquo;m no longer following his blog, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really subscribe to blogs with mostly dev content anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GirlHacker&amp;rsquo;s Random Log&lt;/strong&gt; - she works in tech, but her blog is more general purpose, things of interest stuff. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.girlhacker.com/&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt;, but she hasn&amp;rsquo;t posted there since 2014.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in my mind&amp;rsquo;s zen garden&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a blog by a guy called randomguru on a site called RiceBowlJournals, which was kind of like a community for Asian blogs. Both sites are no longer accessible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kottke&lt;/strong&gt; - kottke.org is still up and running and going strong, still blogging after all these years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tricks of the Trade&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a weblog that posted tips and tricks for different professions. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it lasted very long. The domain currently returns an error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s actually a few more categories in the blogroll there, but they&amp;rsquo;re mostly gaming related, lifehacks stuff, or webcomics. And this post is fairly long already. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to them in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of old blogs from that blogroll that are still active is actually more than I expected! Though still a lot of them that are dead or inactive now, which says a lot about how pervasive &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/link-rot/&#34;&gt;link rot&lt;/a&gt; is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should make sure to archive a present-day version of my current blogroll and check those sites out around a decade from now, at which time I would hopefully still be blogging!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Book Reviews: Guards! Guards! and Men at Arms by Terry Pratchett
</title>

            <pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 08:28:08 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/book-reviews-guards-guards-and-men-at-arms-by-terry-pratchett/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;So after reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/neuromancer/&#34;&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/a&gt; last month, I was looking for a bit of lighter fare, so I decided to work on some Discworld books and started with the first book of the City Watch subseries, &lt;em&gt;Guards! Guards!&lt;/em&gt;. I was already quite a bit in when I was like &amp;ldquo;why does all of this seem so familiar? Are Discworld books really so same-y that it feels like I&amp;rsquo;ve read this before?&amp;rdquo; The good news is that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t true, Discworld books aren&amp;rsquo;t super-samey; I have read it before, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/12/805050532834353152/&#34;&gt;way back in 2016&lt;/a&gt; in fact. And I also found out that I had &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/08/equal-rites/&#34;&gt;done this in 2016 with another Discworld book as well&lt;/a&gt;! Ok, so I guess that means they are a bit same-y, but on the other hand I am getting better at retention because I actually recognized it this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I went ahead and completed the re-read and proceeded to the next City Watch book, &lt;em&gt;Men at Arms&lt;/em&gt;. And this one was totally new to me, for sure. So, this is a bit of a double review. And maybe a review of the Discworld series as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Guards! Guards!&lt;/em&gt; we get Pratchett&amp;rsquo;s treatment of common fantasy tropes such as dwarves, dragons that can&amp;rsquo;t possibly be flying, and unknown heroes becoming king by slaying evil dragons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have the effrontery to be squeamish, it thought at him. But we were dragons. We were supposed to be cruel, cunning, heartless, and terrible. But this much I can tell you, you ape—the great face pressed even closer, so that Wonse was staring into the pitiless depths of his eyes—we never burned and tortured and ripped one another apart and called it morality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Terry Pratchett, &lt;em&gt;Guards! Guards!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Men at Arms&lt;/em&gt;, Pratchett expands on the cast of the City Watch subseries, explores the guild structure of the city of Ankh Morpork, and expands the lore of races such as dwarves and trolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.
But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that’d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years’ time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.
This was the Captain Samuel Vimes “Boots” theory of socioeconomic unfairness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Terry Pratchett, &lt;em&gt;Men at Arms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yes, the Discworld books are maybe kind of same-y, but that&amp;rsquo;s kind of a good thing? You usually know what to expect. They&amp;rsquo;re light reading, they&amp;rsquo;re funny in a dry British humor kind of way, and Pratchett likes to attack and parody and deconstruct common fantasy tropes. I like the books, despite their sameyness, although I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;ll ever be able to work my way through the entire series.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s April! Or as it&amp;rsquo;s otherwise known, March 2020 month 13. As is usual, we are suffering the sweltering summer heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it&amp;rsquo;s Easter Sunday, if that means anything to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surprising almost no one, the PH government extended the ECQ lockdown in the NCR+ bubble. Anyone with half a brain could have told you that the one week ECQ was no way going to be enough, given what we know about the virus&amp;rsquo; life cycle. Meanwhile, we continued to hit record numbers of new cases, our 7-day rolling average now the highest in SEA since the pandemic began. It&amp;rsquo;s like we&amp;rsquo;re in the same situation we were in last year, except the numbers are much, much higher. And yet our leadership is like &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/inquirerdotnet/status/1377810270500790274&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not so bad, even France has lockdowns!&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Sigh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Austin Kleon reminds us that we all need &lt;a href=&#34;https://austinkleon.com/2018/01/19/something-to-look-forward-to/&#34;&gt;something to look forward to&lt;/a&gt;. (Arbitrary stupid goals!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was fascinated by this &lt;a href=&#34;https://theconversation.com/the-man-with-no-plot-how-i-watched-lee-child-write-a-jack-reacher-novel-51220&#34;&gt;article about how Lee Child writes Jack Reacher novels on the fly&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because that seems like the sort of &amp;ldquo;less work&amp;rdquo; approach I&amp;rsquo;d prefer when writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a curiosity: &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law&#34;&gt;Benford&amp;rsquo;s Law&lt;/a&gt;, or the law of anomalous numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://newrepublic.com/article/161106/defense-nothing&#34;&gt;In defense of doing nothing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent a long time working with Java projects, so &lt;a href=&#34;https://advancedweb.hu/a-categorized-list-of-all-java-and-jvm-features-since-jdk-8-to-16/&#34;&gt;this long list of new features from Java 8 to 16&lt;/a&gt; was interesting to me. After reading this, I asked my old workmates what version of Java they were now using, and they were still on Java 8, the same version as when I left there 6 years ago! Time flows differently in the enterprise universe I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My friends were amazed I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-1Ue0FFrHY&#34;&gt;Long, Long Man japanese commercials&lt;/a&gt; before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Peu6lw0nido&#34;&gt;this case study by Elsa Charretier of a Hawkeye comic book panel by David Aja&lt;/a&gt;. Probably helpful in my own sketching! Subscribed to her channel as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sony announced that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-store-shut-down-ps3-vita-psp&#34;&gt;they will be shutting down the PS3, Vita and PSP stores&lt;/a&gt;. End of an era really. A lot of people are complaining about content that will be forever lost, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure that there are people working to archive this stuff and make it available through other means. &lt;em&gt;Wink wink&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a person with comorbidities (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2005/05/hypertension/&#34;&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;), I&amp;rsquo;m in vaccine priority group A3, right after senior citizens (A2s). And since the stock of AstraZeneca is limited, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/QCGov/status/1377997094431129606&#34;&gt;QC is now allowing A3s to go ahead of A2s&lt;/a&gt;, so I was able to book a vaccine appointment on the 27th. Its a ways off, but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that means they&amp;rsquo;ve learned to streamline their on-site processes by then, so hopefully things go smoothly. It&amp;rsquo;s weird to have booked a schedule even before the more at-risk parents though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a bid to minimize having to go outside, we decided to try ordering groceries online via &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.metromart.com/&#34;&gt;Metromart&lt;/a&gt;. The first-time experience wasn&amp;rsquo;t great; we had to buy from a different grocery (since our usual one wasn&amp;rsquo;t available), not all the regular items we needed were there, and some items were way more expensive. And worst of all, I ordered Tostitos cheese dip and they bought spinach dip instead!! The weird thing is, there were some other items that were out of stock that they called me about (even though I explicitly set that if there were missing items, just don&amp;rsquo;t buy them??), yet for the dip, they just went ahead and bought a different flavor. I ended up having a long convo with their customer support about how disappointed I was, and somehow despite saying there&amp;rsquo;s nothing they could do, they later ended up offering me P100 store credit as compensation. I guess it will be useful if ever we decide to try this again. Anyway, we ended up doing a supplementary grocery run yesterday to cover the items the online delivery didn&amp;rsquo;t get (and the cheese dip!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only one movie watched this week, continuing the James Bond run: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1a1ab3ad610478ba3b672b0a89c26333/&#34;&gt;On Her Majesty&amp;rsquo;s Secret Service (1969)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supergirl&lt;/strong&gt; has started up again, carrying over baggage from the cut-short previous season, same as Flash. The writing was marginally better though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt; was pretty good, though I still found Wandavision more exciting overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tried grinding to Master Rank in Eternal on the last day of the month, but I ran out of time with half a level to go. Sigh. Arena I didn&amp;rsquo;t even bother and ended the month in platinum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a couple of Civ6 games, mostly achievement hunting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a bit more &lt;strong&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/strong&gt;, now down to 1 achievement remaining, but it requires going through all the secret levels, I think?? That might take a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s multiplayer games with friends: Blood Rage, Sentinels of the Multiverse, Root, and Orcs Must Die 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Finished reading Discworld&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Men at Arms!&lt;/strong&gt;, maybe I can write book review(s) this week. Need to find a new book to read, probably a nonfiction one this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was the second Holy Week in a row where we were just stuck at home all day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Falcon and Winter Soldier, Invincible, One Piece, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Bond movie no. 6: On Her Majesty&amp;rsquo;s Secret Service (1969). Only Lazenby appearance. He was fine, I suppose. Tracy probably best Bond girl so far. I liked the ski scenes more than Thunderball&amp;rsquo;s underwater scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--sep--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loose continuity. Was confused by Blofeld not recognizing Bond after they already met in the previous movie. Apparently, the novel order was reversed. Also, did Bond just leave him stuck in a tree assuming he was dead after hunting him relentlessly?&lt;/p&gt;
