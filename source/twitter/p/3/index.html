<p>While checking to see if Zendikar was already on #magicarena, I found that I still had an unfinished Historic Event with Jeskai Fires. I get to play with banned cards!</p>
<p>oops, went down for maintenance! Hopefully this is still around when it comes back up (and that I dont get the third loss!)</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re back! I decided to wrap this up before drafting Zendikar. When my opponents pause with Fires or Teferi on the stack, I can only assume they are dumbfounded lol</p>
<p>Got my 3rd loss to Rakdos Arcanist, which gives you an idea of how dumb that deck is. Maybe it&rsquo;s safe to bring Teferi and Fires back now? Lol. Anyway, on to Zendikar!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not unhappy about DFCs coming back to standard, but I am glad that I mostly only play #mtg on Arena these days so I don&rsquo;t have to deal with desleeving/helper cards all the time.</p>
<p>DFCs have unlocked a lot of design space for Magic, but they are <em>so</em> clunky on paper</p>

<p>Decided to risk my precious gems playing Ikoria Turbo Draft on #magicarena. Turned out well! Just need to draft crystals (essentially moxes). Draw cards and counterspells are great, so blue is best in this format apparently. #mtg</p>
<p>Okay, I had a lot of fun so I did another one. No Boon of the Wish Giver meant the deck wasn&rsquo;t as strong. This one was a lot closer, but managed to get there.</p>
<p>I went for a third one and was struck down for my insolence. Only got three crystals this time and even fewer card draw! I think that&rsquo;s enough for this event lol</p>
