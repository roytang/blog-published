My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2345577523&#34;&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This was my first Stephen King book outside the Dark Tower series. Before reading the Dark Tower, I had pegged King as a writer of &amp;ldquo;scary&amp;rdquo; books because of his early works, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too interested. This book is none of that. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice, informative, well-written time travel story that wraps up nicely. I actually had no idea it was a time travel story when I started reading (you&amp;rsquo;d think the title would have given that away.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When reading novels with a compelling plot, I tend to charge forward haphazardly, often skimming sentences and paragraphs to get to what happens next. For this one I often found myself slowing down to appreciate King&amp;rsquo;s prose. He&amp;rsquo;s quite good at writing compelling and descriptive sentences that aren&amp;rsquo;t just direct and simple &amp;ldquo;This happened, then he saw that.&amp;rdquo; etc. I suppose that comes from his prolific experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book had a bit of a weaker middle part where I lingered around for a few months before finally deciding to finish it over the long weekend. I learned a lot about American history and geopolitics around the time of the Cuban missile crisis along the way too.

It was ok. Some tropes turned around. Kind of frustrating how a lot of stuff just dragged out until the end. The identify of the Hero of Ages pretty much given away early on by the flavor text at the start of each chapter. I finished it in two sittings so that&amp;rsquo;s something

Great book. The story&amp;rsquo;s pace was a bit slow at first as Sanderson was doing his excellent worldbuilding and introducing us to the magic system in his world (he&amp;rsquo;s good at that sort of thing!), but it picks up about a third of the way through. A lot of the plot twists and character developments are handled very well. The pace proceeds fairly quickly towards the end - I burned through the last third of the book in one night because things were escalating quickly. Looking forward to the other books in the series

My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2106145410&#34;&gt;4 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I finished Well of Ascension only two days after finishing The Final Empire. I think I enjoyed it a bit less than the first book - mainly because there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of self-doubt here among the protagonists, a lot of paragraphs of &amp;ldquo;why am i doing this? I&amp;rsquo;m not good enough, etc&amp;rdquo;. The plot also takes longer to solidify. Unlike the first book where they had a very solid objective until the end (the downfall of the Final Empire), the protagonists spend most of this book running in circles trying to figure out what they should do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I did read through the book in two days, so I still found it compelling. Sanderson expands upon the worldbuilding, mythos and systems from the first book. The first book already had a theme of hopelessness around it, but the second book goes even darker. And as you can expect for the second book of a trilogy, the ending doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave our heroes or the world in a very good spot. Looking forward to the final book.

Scott Berkun&amp;rsquo;s latest book is short but pretty sweet. Irreverent and insightful, a great read for anyone looking to jump into creative endeavors!

My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1941667381&#34;&gt;4 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I realize that the Thrawn trilogy is no longer canon, what with The Force Awakens and all. But I remember reading an interview with Zahn in Inquest Magazine a lifetime ago and how his trilogy was one of the best parts of the extended universe so when I found a used copy I picked it up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is pretty good, taking place 5 years after Jedi, and explores what happens to the galaxy and the efforts of the Empire remnants to mount a comeback. A far cry from what Disney eventually approved to be the canon storyline of course :)

I don&amp;rsquo;t even know when I started reading this, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bookmark in it for maybe three or four years now. It&amp;rsquo;s a collection of Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s articles from the New Yorker, so that&amp;rsquo;s to be expected - not exactly designed to be consumed all in one sitting. The book is Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s usual mix of anecdotes spun into pop psychology and meant to make you ask questions or suggest some insight about this or that. It&amp;rsquo;s entertaining enough to read, even though it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really go into much detail about any one topic.

Some of these are creepy af, but this is my second Gaiman short story collection so I mostly knew what to expect. The man is a master at putting together words though. I could only aspire to be so good.

Starting the year off right with some Tolkien. The book is unapologetic about how it drags both unsuspecting Bilbo and the reader down a long adventure that includes a lot of singing and being captured and being almost eaten. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how they managed to stretch it into three movies though, the book isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly long.

This book is so Machiavellian. Somehow appropriate as my last book for 2016.

Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- I liked having the bear back&lt;br /&gt;- Diamond-legged creatures with wheels!&lt;br /&gt;- An honest effort to tie up all the loose ends and give each character decent endings&lt;br /&gt;- A decent read, at least&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- allegories aren&amp;rsquo;t very subtle&lt;br /&gt;- people get miraculously redeemed, even Mrs Coulter who was such a great villain&lt;br /&gt;- build up of Asriel&amp;rsquo;s awesome plan to take the War to Heaven only to find out he didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what he was doing until he found out he had to somehow help two kids find their pets&lt;br /&gt;- build up of how powerful Metatron was, but then at the end &lt;br /&gt;

Well, the knife may be subtle, but the allegories are not. I can see why some religious folk might find the trilogy&amp;rsquo;s themes controversial, but as far as I can see they&amp;rsquo;re still just fantasy stories. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how things ramp up in the last book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kind of miss that bear though.

Violent, mysterious, and the story unveils in a great way. Art was terrific too, even if there were some issues with guest artists. Some of the best comic-book space sci-fi I&amp;rsquo;ve read since the Annihilation War

Well, the book started off a bit slow, with the protag meandering about while the author did his worldbuilding and all, but the pace picked up quickly after the first third or so of the book; I finished the rest of it one sitting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t see anything too Church-controversial yet, though I&amp;rsquo;m told it becomes more obvious by the third book. I like how most of it was told through a child&amp;rsquo;s eyes. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that was the best way to end a first book though&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kind of want to see the movie, even though I heard it tanked, mostly just to watch the awesome bear duel to the death

I randomly decided to start reading a new book the other day and picked up Hyperion completely blind. I knew it was sci-fi, but that was about it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it turned out to be some really good sci-fi too. Simmons introduces new concepts and the history of his universe and human society quickly and unapologetically. Even the prologue bandies around the terms Hegemony and Ouster with little explanation save what we can glean from context. Most of it is expounded upon and elaborated in the short stories which comprise the majority of the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short stories tell the tales of each of the pilgrims making their way to the far off world of Hyperion to face their death before a time-defying god. It seems that each story follows and develops a different aspect of Hyperion&amp;rsquo;s universe: the first one tells us about religion and space travel and colonisation, the second talks about military life, and so on. My favorite was the scholar&amp;rsquo;s story: although the preceding parts of the story make the ending especially predictable, how he gets there is told incredibly well and you can feel the sadness and despair of his situation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The disappointing part of the book however was the ending, which seemingly just drops the story like a rock. The last story to be told doesn&amp;rsquo;t even explain why the pilgrim wanted to return to Hyperion, and we do not get the climactic meeting the rest of the book has been leading up to. I understand that the story was actually split into two books, and that I would have to read the succeeding book Fall of Hyperion to get any payoff, but I wish it had been handled better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In spite of that, I liked it. And maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll pick up the sequel too. Some really good sci-fi and world-building and storytelling with a disappointing ending.

I bought a used copy of this book a while back and finally decided to read it, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly long. I&amp;rsquo;d found however, that I&amp;rsquo;d already read it before lol. Anyway, I still managed to read through it a second time, it was pretty good. I like the Discworld books, they&amp;rsquo;re ridiculous, popcorn fantasy reads, and this one was no exception. However I do believe I should now track which ones I&amp;rsquo;ve actually read&amp;hellip;

Pretty informative and helpful stuff for beginners to stock trading, although I reckon it will still take time and experience to get the hang of stock trading. I was interested in the math so I&amp;rsquo;m happy that the book discussed the formulas for most of the indicators used (with the exception of the ADX)

Some good stuff by Gaiman. Generally what you&amp;rsquo;d expect: ghosts and aliens and magic creatures and strange stories and such. There&amp;rsquo;s an American Gods-related novella at the end.

My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1647720616&#34;&gt;4 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The book is literally a collection of journal entries detailing young Jordan Mechner&amp;rsquo;s days as a university student at Yale at the same time working on what would be his first published game. I found it both inspiring (though some might consider me the wrong age to be inspired by it) and amusing as a look into the life of a young man in the early 80s. As a set of journal entries, the writing isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly spectacular, but it is an easy enough read, especially for someone with an interest in game development. You are not likely to learn anything for practical use for game development, unless of course you were planning to develop games for old-school Apple II or Commodore 64 platforms with limited amounts of memory to work with. I found it interesting mostly because the stories harken back to a bygone-era of game development, when the norm was the single developer working on all aspects of the game by himself all the while being a full-time student, and eventually getting published and making it to the top of the sales charts. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to reading the second book where he covers the creation of his second hit Prince of Persia

I&amp;rsquo;ve been following and reading Scott Berkun&amp;rsquo;s blog on and off for the past 5 years or so, so I already have a passing familiarity with this work. Mindfire collects some of the best essays from his blog into an easy-to-read format that you can digest in one-to-two sittings. Berkun writes about a number of diverse topics such as how to think critically and how to interact with other people and how to spend your attention. Maybe &amp;ldquo;Big Ideas&amp;rdquo; is a bit grandiose, as many of these essays tackle things that seem more like they should be common sense but aren&amp;rsquo;t. But as Berkun himself states in one of the essays, the size of the idea isn&amp;rsquo;t indicative of its quality - smaller ideas can generate a lot of value too. Pretty good read.

Cat&amp;rsquo;s Cradle is only the second Vonnegut book I&amp;rsquo;ve read, after Slaughterhouse Five. I find myself fascinated with how he unveils his narrative in short, seemingly disconnected bursts, something much more obvious in this book. Like S5, CC&amp;rsquo;s plot starts close to normal ordinary fiction and ends in a completely different place that&amp;rsquo;s strictly in the realm of sci-fi. A great read, and very easy too given the structure of ridiculously short chapters

This book was painful to read really. I might have received it better had I read it when I was younger, but reading it now, Holden just feels like this whiny entitled angry kid that has no idea what he&amp;rsquo;s doing or how the world works. The story doesn&amp;rsquo;t really go anywhere interesting; I understand that it&amp;rsquo;s not that kind of book, but what it is doesn&amp;rsquo;t really appeal to me too much.

After reading this book, I&amp;rsquo;m quite envious of Feynman&amp;rsquo;s life haha. He&amp;rsquo;s lived a very interesting life and the stories are told with a general down-to-earth tone despite the fact that he often has to explain the math and theoretical physics which may be less accessible for laymen. For science-oriented people, this may be one of the best biographies to read

I&amp;rsquo;ve restarted reading this book (and the original) a few times since I was still in school. In fact, when I opened my iBooks copy that I&amp;rsquo;ve left alone over the past few years, it was at around halfway through. I started over again and managed to finish it this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why I had trouble finishing it before, it&amp;rsquo;s a fairly short book and the subject matter is interesting to anyone who has even a passing interest in science. The book covers the fundamental development of the physical sciences through the years, from early ruminations about the nature of the universe through Galileo and Newton and Einstein up to modern discussions on wormholes, time travel and string theory. The discussion is simplified to make it more palatable to laymen but still technical enough to be interesting to the science-oriented reader. It&amp;rsquo;s actually quite fascinating how each chapter of the book and each era of science builds upon the foundations of the previous chapter/era to get where we are today. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With recent developments in physics, I wonder how soon it will be until a new, updated edition is called for (hopefully Stephen Hawking sticks around for it!)

My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1594067798&#34;&gt;3 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Perdido Street Station is a difficult book to read, which is why it took me a lot of time to get through it (and this was my second attempt too! I had to restart because I did not even get very far the last time and did not retain anything). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not because the plot is convoluted or anything like that. If anything, it&amp;rsquo;s kind of straightforward. Rogue scientist accidentally sets loose terrible evil and must fix things and save everybody before the government and the gangsters and everyone else hunt him down. Somewhere in between there are themes of interspecies relationships, authoritarian governments, being ostracized, rogue AIs, revolutionary discoveries, etc. Basically, more or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, the problem with the novel is that the setting is ridiculously out of this world, there is literally nothing like it out there. So much so that you crawl through the novel at a slow pace, dissecting the author&amp;rsquo;s vivid descriptions and trying to piece them together into something you can reasonably visualize in your imagination. From the very first chapter which describes Isaac and Lin&amp;rsquo;s unusual relationship you can easily see that this book is very unusual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreso than the characters or the plot, the book is centered around the city in which it takes place, the city of New Crobuzon in the fictional world of Bas-Lag. This is made obvious by the way the author painstakingly details the ins and outs of the grimy, crowded, kind-of-steampunk metropolis as the characters weave through it, and every major event comes with it a few pages of how the multispecies denizens are affected. Thus, the plot itself moves with a sluggish pace that some may give up on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a fantastic work of fiction, to be sure. But it may be too different for some, with too many new things to imagine and to visualize.

2016 book #12: John Dies at the End by David Wong. This book is all kinds of weird. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like the author tried to think of as many weird things as he possible could then ties them together with an impossible plot that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t even fully resolved. It&amp;rsquo;s like the author was on crack while he was writing most of this (apt, since he&amp;rsquo;s apparently and editor at cracked.com). Not for everybody, and at some point your eyes may glaze over at one too many levels of weirdness.

2016 Book #10: Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond. I actually started this a few years back, thought I&amp;rsquo;d actually get around to finish it. The book is an analysis of history, of what geographical advantages certain civilizations had that allowed them to triumph over others. He presents a lot of interesting topics covering linguistics, animal/plant domestication and food production that may explain these differences. Given my poor geography knowledge, I would have appreciated more maps in the book. There are some topics here I enjoyed more than others, such as how Pizarro conquered the Incans. But a lot of the topics are presented a bit dryly, in an academic fashion. Making academic topics interesting is tough, I found myself having difficulty reading some of the later chapters. The book overall is very informative though, I learned a lot about the sort of things historians analyze to understand the particulars of human civilization.

2016 Book #9: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The book starts off with a lot of action before settling into a phase where the three protagonists wander around a lot and sleep in tents and finally into a big showdown at Hogwarts with virtually every character in the series showing up for one big brawl. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to read, but I&amp;rsquo;d love to see it in the film too (soon!). I&amp;rsquo;m a bit ambivalent about how Severus Snape was handled, with the author basically treating him as a bad guy the entire series only to flip him at the last minute. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that Alan Rickman died before I finished the series - before Alan Rickman&amp;rsquo;s death I was unaware that Snape was a beloved character and being aware meant I knew he had to do a face turn at some point. The ending was satisfying enough, pretty good for a fantasy series actually; but I would&amp;rsquo;ve hoped for more details on what happened to the rest of the cast nineteen years later. We basically only got endings for Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione and Draco. Overall the series was pretty good, and covered some ground I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have expected for a children&amp;rsquo;s/young adult series.

2016 Book #8: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Someone had already spoiled me ahead of time about the death at the end of this book, although I hadn&amp;rsquo;t known when it would happen. But it started to become obvious as the book went on, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too surprised by the end. This book fleshes out the back story of the series&amp;rsquo; villain Voldemort and finally tries to make Draco Malfoy do something of consequence. The book feels a lot like Empire Strikes Back with the young protagonist learning more about the villain and the bad guys finally dealing a heavy blow. One more book to go!

This is a long book, roughly three times as long as the first Harry Potter book was. That wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so bad if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t so painful to read. Harry here is like a completely different character compared to the previous books, he&amp;rsquo;s irritable and whiny and keeps worrying about how other people aren&amp;rsquo;t treating him well. It&amp;rsquo;s not really teenage angst (since Ron and Hermione seem fine), but rather the character&amp;rsquo;s response to the end of the last book. I hope he&amp;rsquo;s less so in the last two books. Dolores Umbridge made for a great villain here.

I read the first two books of this trilogy back in high school, and I recently decided to get a used copy from Amazon. I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to dive into the third book without having to re-read the first two, with a general recollection of the events from the first book still intact. I found it a bit heavy-handed with the prose, as the writers spend a couple of paragraphs in each scene for each character to ponder in self-doubt, fear or despair. I forget if that&amp;rsquo;s something they did in the Dragonlance books as well. The plot of this book went in a direction that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been able to predict, but I guess the ending was satisfying enough, although I don&amp;rsquo;t know what the hell they were thinking with Simkin towards the last third of the book.

The series started off a with rather straightforward stories that made obvious that JK Rowling was new to this business at the time, but Prisoner of Azkaban kicks off the world-building to a larger degree. Many elements of the world are expanded upon and added to and by now we get a better sense of the sort of wonders the world of Harry Potter represents. The plot is starting to get more complex, with more Chekov&amp;rsquo;s gun-type elements firing off as the story spins its plot twists near the book&amp;rsquo;s conclusion. It&amp;rsquo;s easily my favorite book of the series so far

I had next to no Harry Potter knowledge before reading this book, save what I read in passing on the internets. Yup, I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the movies either. Finished reading this in under 3 hours; I had been told ahead of time that it was a light read and that I can confirm. A welcome respite from the last book I read, this book has a straightforward plot, nothing too deep here, it&amp;rsquo;s very much meant for kids/young adults. In fact it reminds me of one of those Hardy Boys books I used to read when I was young, except with a lot more dragons. I wonder what age I can encourage my niece to read this&amp;hellip;

My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1537966035&#34;&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The first book I read for 2016 was Words of Radiance by Brandon Sanderson second book of the Stormlight Archive. It&amp;rsquo;s a huge book, and the first half took me more or less three weeks to slog through (I started it in late December), but by the time I got to the middle of the book, a lot of exciting things were happening and my pace improved considerably. I finished the second half of the book in around 2-3 days. The great thing is that the book resolves a lot of the dangling plot lines from Way of Kings, rewarding the reader with serious payoffs for the stories of Kaladin and Dalinar and a deeper look at Shallan&amp;rsquo;s back story. The first half builds up to a second half full of great action sequences that the reader is anticipating. Interspersed with Kaladin and the Kholin family&amp;rsquo;s action is Shallan&amp;rsquo;s back story and her dangerous forays into studies and investigations that dig up even more plot lines left to be resolved for later books. Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s world-building is again top notch as he introduces us into new exotic locales in this world and constructs an interesting mythology around the spren and the Parshendi. The book ends on a satisfying note at the same time leaving some threads hanging and the greater plot looming on the horizon. It&amp;rsquo;s too bad the next book isn&amp;rsquo;t scheduled until 2017

My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1443874359&#34;&gt;4 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is my second Sanderson book after The Way of Kings, which made me a fan of his world-building. Given that this book is set in a dystopian near-future, the scale of the world-building here isn&amp;rsquo;t as large as that fantasy epic, but still gives Sanderson enough room to carve out a unique setting in the city of Newcago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newcago, yes, that name is ridiculous. A lot of the Epic names are ridiculous actually, and the protagonist himself points that out at some point. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is fairly straightforward, with a couple of somewhat predictable plot twists thrown at us towards the end. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The outstanding parts of the book for me were the big action scenes where the Reckoners confront the Epics to try to take them down, with big complicated plans set up and things eventually go awry. It&amp;rsquo;s almost like the book combines multiple heist movies, which is a good thing as I enjoy heist movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the main plot, the protagonist&amp;rsquo;s character is kind of straightforward. &amp;ldquo;You killed my father, prepare to die&amp;rdquo;, that sort of thing. He&amp;rsquo;s not exactly too charismatic, but he is insanely clever and reacts well to the bad situations they find themselves in. His penchant for poor analogies isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly endearing either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all an above average book, although not nearly as engrossing as War of Kings was, still quite a page turner once you get to the third and fourth parts.
