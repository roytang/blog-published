            Reply to &amp;#39;Hindi pa ba ito treason worthy statement?&amp;#39; on /r/Philippines at https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/n5tnoy/hindi_pa_ba_ito_treason_worthy_statement/:

            &lt;p&gt;This mindset reflects someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t respect institutions or the  law or civilized agreements, and basically respects only one thing:  power. That&amp;rsquo;s why he thinks people who oppose China want war and why he  doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to offend China, power is all he sees and values, like the thug that he is.  For this kind of person, you can&amp;rsquo;t be right because of the law or  because of principle, or because of justice, you can only be right if you had the ability to  enforce that right. Basically the type of leader who would just  collaborate with any invaders who managed to overpower us and would say wag na lang tayo gumawa ng gulo, andyan na e.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;  Hold the power button for 10 seconds and plug in the mag safe connector  while you keep holding down the power button for another 10 seconds at  least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was I supposed to do this while the laptop was off? because of course it started turning on in the middle of the first 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tried it while the laptop was on, in which case it shutdown during the first 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, it does not seem to have changed anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;  Have you thought about switching out the battery?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you mentioned, macbook airs dont have removable batteries. Also, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t the fact that I am sometimes able to charge it, depending on how I place the magsafe connector, imply the problem is with the connector or port and not the battery itself?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;ve tried this before; unsure as I&amp;rsquo;ve had this problem for a while and have been looking around for solutions for a while. Regardless, I tried it again today a couple of times, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a 2017 Macbook Air. This one still has the Magsafe charger. My problem with it is that connecting the charger to the device via the Magsafe port is super finicky, most of the time if I just plug it in straight, the device won&amp;rsquo;t charge (the battery status indicator will have the lightning bolt symbol, but if you click on it, the dropdown will say &amp;ldquo;not charging&amp;rdquo;) and the magsafe connector won&amp;rsquo;t light up (if it&amp;rsquo;s charging it will light up either red or green).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I&amp;rsquo;m usually able to get it to charge. But it takes me some number of tries disconnecting and reconnecting the charger, turning the wire or the connector every which way trying to find the proper angle where it will charge. Sometimes it takes me hours or even days to be able to get it to charge again. Obviously not very practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s a problem with the charger itself; I&amp;rsquo;ve tried borrowing another working magsafe charger from someone else and the same problems arise. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried blowing into the connector ports or using toothpicks to clean out any dust, and still the situation persists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone else encountered this kind of issue? Any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h4 id=&#34;posted-on-rglobaltalk-question-what-are-the-police-like-in-your-countryhttpsredditcomrglobaltalkcommentsmvsss1question_what_are_the_police_like_in_your_country&#34;&gt;Posted on r/GlobalTalk: &lt;a href=&#34;https://reddit.com/r/GlobalTalk/comments/mvsss1/question_what_are_the_police_like_in_your_country/&#34;&gt;[Question] What are the police like in your country?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following recent events in the US (disclaimer: I&amp;rsquo;m not an American), police brutality is a big, controversial topic over there, leading to protests and calls to defund the police and such, popularizing the phrase ACAB (meaning &amp;ldquo;all cops are bastards&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my own country (the Philippines), cops don&amp;rsquo;t have a very good reputation either; they are often seen as corrupt extortionists and some may be complicit in extrajudicial killings in Duterte&amp;rsquo;s drug war; recently they have done some bad moves such as attempting to interfere with community pantries that popped up to help the poor during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that left me wondering what police are like in other countries. Are there countries where the police have a generally good reputation (maybe my country or the US can learn something from those places)? Or are they generally just tools for enforcing the (often unequal) status quo?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;So what does that mean? Are we never getting iOS/Android versions in SEA? Will they (Tencent) release it later? Or there&amp;rsquo;s no word at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone in SEA been able to get the mobile versions? I&amp;rsquo;m from the Philippines, me and my friend in Singapore both can&amp;rsquo;t find the app on the stores. Even when using a direct link, the stores will just say Arena isn&amp;rsquo;t available in the country/region. Any others from SEA countries have any luck?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have they released any official word on this? Or is there any WOTC staff here who can shed some light on why it&amp;rsquo;s not available in SEA?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So annoyed that the MTG twitter accounts have the audacity to claim Arena is now available &amp;ldquo;everywhere&amp;rdquo; on mobile when it&amp;rsquo;s definitely not.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Oh wow, when people joke about not having seen the homepage, I thought they meant the logged in home page with the Top Questions list. I really have never seen this before!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;They should release the 3 Kaldra equipment into historic one at a time, one every three years or so&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a one-off night of no matches found that prompted me to post, this has been the general case for me for about the past two years/seasons, I think. I&amp;rsquo;m occasionally able to fight a match, but most of the time it takes me a long time to look for one, then I just give up out of frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time last night, but I did actually manage to fight *one* guy (well, best of 3). Took me ten minutes to find that match, and after playing our 3 matches, I tried waiting another 10 minutes or so, couldn&amp;rsquo;t find another so I gave up. I did lower my settings to 3-5 for this one, so maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll just try that for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the advice!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I lent out my PS4 copy a while back and can&amp;rsquo;t get it back easily now due to some kind of pandemic lol. Also, most of my unlocked last DLC from the last 2 seasons is on Steam now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would streaming (Netflix, Youtube, etc) interfere with the matching? I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;m the only one who&amp;rsquo;d be doing large downloads in the household, so I can certainly avoid that, but other people are almost always streaming video when I&amp;rsquo;d want to be playing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I have a decent fiber connection, something like 60 Mbps down, 45 down, I know that&amp;rsquo;s not as good as some countries, but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty good for where I am. I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll just try lowering my settings though, since the other replies here imply I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be having trouble finding a match. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filthy casual here. I haven&amp;rsquo;t booted up the game in a while, I play on Steam (though I also have the PS4 copy&amp;hellip; somewhere). Tried to find a match (ranked) last night, around 10pm. My settings are connection 4-5, platform any. Waited for 10 mins, couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a match. Not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;m low ranked (ultra bronze i think) while everyone&amp;rsquo;s already silver and up or something? Or are there so few people playing nowadays that it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to find matches. Or is it because I&amp;rsquo;m in southeast asia? Is it harder to find matches here? Or is my connection terrible? Or should I try various times of the day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the reason I haven&amp;rsquo;t played in a while anyway, I always find it difficult to find matches. The whole reason I booted up was I was tempted by the s5 character pass, since the idea of queueing with random select via Eleven was appealing to me. But if it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to find matches, there&amp;rsquo;s no point.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I followed the Sporza feed that was the result of pasting that url, and it looks like it&amp;rsquo;s the correct one:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Fun use of the counters to get around memory issues in paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it only has the flying counter -&amp;gt; it&amp;rsquo;s a 4/4 Spirit Warrior Angel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it has the flying counter and the 2 +1/+1s -&amp;gt; It has the Ophidian ability&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If the +1/+1s get removed, you start to get confused.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no counter to help with the 2/3 mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m wondering how Arena will handle using Foretell when some of the cards in the opponent&amp;rsquo;s hand are revealed to you, since the card you exile with foretell should be hidden information. i.e., if I thoughtseize you and you&amp;rsquo;re holding 3 different foretell cards, then during your turn you pay 2 and exile one of them, the other 2 should no longer be revealed to me, since I would be able to deduce which card was exiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have they made any statement about this? I&amp;rsquo;m not super confident they&amp;rsquo;d handle it well lol.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Philippines. Very little impact as few people use it here. The dominant messaging apps here are Messenger and Viber&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I can’t relate to this request (I guess because I’m spiky), but I’m always curious whenever this comes up: are there other ccgs that do this (having systems that reward things other than winning, aside from daily quests)?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;For people like me who dislike watching videos: Before you start drafting a set, craft all the common/uncommon cards from the new set, so that each common/uncommon you open in draft adds to the vault percentage.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Did this population number only happen during Hickman&amp;rsquo;s run? I forget if there was a mass resurgence of mutants post-decimation&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The only bug I encountered was that I lost the first game and it awarded me the prize for the win anyway lol. I won the second game, so I only needed to play twice.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I got a bunch of Zendikar cards already (not sure if I also retained the stuff I got from the buggy renewal gift earlier)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Dont both triggers go on the stack regardless of the order of the triggers? i.e. even if you sac the pact to doom foretold before the pact trigger resolves, youre still losing the game&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;As I recall, the artwork of Finest Hour portrayed a knight fighting some kind of zombie horde? So there&amp;rsquo;s probably some level of monsters on the shard&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Very regular occurrence here in the Philippines unfortunately. After a presidential election, it’s not uncommon that most of the legislators jump ship to the president’s party (or their allies), presumably so they can partake of the spoils of the majority.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Sorry if this is dumb: you know sometimes when you build a district but placing it has a warning like “this will remove woods” or such, does doing this have a chopping bonus too? or it has to be chopped with a builder first?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;In the Philippines, a lot of people like having the so-called &amp;ldquo;silog&amp;rdquo; meals - &amp;ldquo;silog&amp;rdquo; stands for &amp;ldquo;sinangag&amp;rdquo; (garlic fried rice) + &amp;ldquo;itlog&amp;rdquo; (egg). Basically rice meals usually with a meat viand. Examples are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;tapsilog&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;tapa&amp;rdquo; (dried or cured thinly-sliced beef or similar meat) + silog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;tocilog&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;tocino&amp;rdquo; (sweetened and cured pork belly) + silog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;longsilog&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;longganiza&amp;rdquo; (sausages flavoured with indigenous spices) + silog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;hotsilog&amp;rdquo; - hotdogs + silog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silog&#34;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also a bread roll called &amp;ldquo;pandesal&amp;rdquo; (literally salted bread from Spanish), commonly consumed for breakfast, usually with some spread or some meat filling, sometimes you dip it in coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do Miles, Ganke, Miles&amp;rsquo; family etc remember the Ultimate universe? Or Ultimate Peter Parker dying? Or were their histories &amp;ldquo;re-written&amp;rdquo; and merged into the main universe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not up-to-date with the Miles comics, but I don&amp;rsquo;t remember this being explained after Secret Wars&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Hey, in case you still need this: I was able to resolve the issue by going to &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.playstation.com&#34;&gt;store.playstation.com&lt;/a&gt; on my web browser, trying to log in, then telling it to resend the verification code. The new verification email had a link that goes to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://sony.com&#34;&gt;sony.com&lt;/a&gt; subdomain instead of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://playstation.com&#34;&gt;playstation.com&lt;/a&gt; subdomain, and that one didn&amp;rsquo;t have the SSL certificate problem.&lt;/p&gt;
