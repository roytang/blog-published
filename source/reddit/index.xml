            &lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a one-off night of no matches found that prompted me to post, this has been the general case for me for about the past two years/seasons, I think. I&amp;rsquo;m occasionally able to fight a match, but most of the time it takes me a long time to look for one, then I just give up out of frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time last night, but I did actually manage to fight *one* guy (well, best of 3). Took me ten minutes to find that match, and after playing our 3 matches, I tried waiting another 10 minutes or so, couldn&amp;rsquo;t find another so I gave up. I did lower my settings to 3-5 for this one, so maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll just try that for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the advice!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I lent out my PS4 copy a while back and can&amp;rsquo;t get it back easily now due to some kind of pandemic lol. Also, most of my unlocked last DLC from the last 2 seasons is on Steam now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would streaming (Netflix, Youtube, etc) interfere with the matching? I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;m the only one who&amp;rsquo;d be doing large downloads in the household, so I can certainly avoid that, but other people are almost always streaming video when I&amp;rsquo;d want to be playing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I have a decent fiber connection, something like 60 Mbps down, 45 down, I know that&amp;rsquo;s not as good as some countries, but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty good for where I am. I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll just try lowering my settings though, since the other replies here imply I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be having trouble finding a match. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Wait, so having the icon is good, right? I checked just now and I do have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filthy casual here. I haven&amp;rsquo;t booted up the game in a while, I play on Steam (though I also have the PS4 copy&amp;hellip; somewhere). Tried to find a match (ranked) last night, around 10pm. My settings are connection 4-5, platform any. Waited for 10 mins, couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a match. Not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;m low ranked (ultra bronze i think) while everyone&amp;rsquo;s already silver and up or something? Or are there so few people playing nowadays that it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to find matches. Or is it because I&amp;rsquo;m in southeast asia? Is it harder to find matches here? Or is my connection terrible? Or should I try various times of the day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the reason I haven&amp;rsquo;t played in a while anyway, I always find it difficult to find matches. The whole reason I booted up was I was tempted by the s5 character pass, since the idea of queueing with random select via Eleven was appealing to me. But if it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to find matches, there&amp;rsquo;s no point.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;No, I only got the one search result and that was the matching one&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I followed the Sporza feed that was the result of pasting that url, and it looks like it&amp;rsquo;s the correct one:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Fun use of the counters to get around memory issues in paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it only has the flying counter -&amp;gt; it&amp;rsquo;s a 4/4 Spirit Warrior Angel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it has the flying counter and the 2 +1/+1s -&amp;gt; It has the Ophidian ability&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If the +1/+1s get removed, you start to get confused.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no counter to help with the 2/3 mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m wondering how Arena will handle using Foretell when some of the cards in the opponent&amp;rsquo;s hand are revealed to you, since the card you exile with foretell should be hidden information. i.e., if I thoughtseize you and you&amp;rsquo;re holding 3 different foretell cards, then during your turn you pay 2 and exile one of them, the other 2 should no longer be revealed to me, since I would be able to deduce which card was exiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have they made any statement about this? I&amp;rsquo;m not super confident they&amp;rsquo;d handle it well lol.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Philippines. Very little impact as few people use it here. The dominant messaging apps here are Messenger and Viber&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Best is probably to call a judge.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I can’t relate to this request (I guess because I’m spiky), but I’m always curious whenever this comes up: are there other ccgs that do this (having systems that reward things other than winning, aside from daily quests)?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;For people like me who dislike watching videos: Before you start drafting a set, craft all the common/uncommon cards from the new set, so that each common/uncommon you open in draft adds to the vault percentage.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Did this population number only happen during Hickman&amp;rsquo;s run? I forget if there was a mass resurgence of mutants post-decimation&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The only bug I encountered was that I lost the first game and it awarded me the prize for the win anyway lol. I won the second game, so I only needed to play twice.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Dont both triggers go on the stack regardless of the order of the triggers? i.e. even if you sac the pact to doom foretold before the pact trigger resolves, youre still losing the game&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;As I recall, the artwork of Finest Hour portrayed a knight fighting some kind of zombie horde? So there&amp;rsquo;s probably some level of monsters on the shard&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Very regular occurrence here in the Philippines unfortunately. After a presidential election, it’s not uncommon that most of the legislators jump ship to the president’s party (or their allies), presumably so they can partake of the spoils of the majority.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Sorry if this is dumb: you know sometimes when you build a district but placing it has a warning like “this will remove woods” or such, does doing this have a chopping bonus too? or it has to be chopped with a builder first?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;In the Philippines, a lot of people like having the so-called &amp;ldquo;silog&amp;rdquo; meals - &amp;ldquo;silog&amp;rdquo; stands for &amp;ldquo;sinangag&amp;rdquo; (garlic fried rice) + &amp;ldquo;itlog&amp;rdquo; (egg). Basically rice meals usually with a meat viand. Examples are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;tapsilog&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;tapa&amp;rdquo; (dried or cured thinly-sliced beef or similar meat) + silog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;tocilog&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;tocino&amp;rdquo; (sweetened and cured pork belly) + silog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;longsilog&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;longganiza&amp;rdquo; (sausages flavoured with indigenous spices) + silog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;hotsilog&amp;rdquo; - hotdogs + silog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silog&#34;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also a bread roll called &amp;ldquo;pandesal&amp;rdquo; (literally salted bread from Spanish), commonly consumed for breakfast, usually with some spread or some meat filling, sometimes you dip it in coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandesal&#34;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandesal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do Miles, Ganke, Miles&amp;rsquo; family etc remember the Ultimate universe? Or Ultimate Peter Parker dying? Or were their histories &amp;ldquo;re-written&amp;rdquo; and merged into the main universe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not up-to-date with the Miles comics, but I don&amp;rsquo;t remember this being explained after Secret Wars&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Hey, in case you still need this: I was able to resolve the issue by going to &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.playstation.com&#34;&gt;store.playstation.com&lt;/a&gt; on my web browser, trying to log in, then telling it to resend the verification code. The new verification email had a link that goes to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://sony.com&#34;&gt;sony.com&lt;/a&gt; subdomain instead of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://playstation.com&#34;&gt;playstation.com&lt;/a&gt; subdomain, and that one didn&amp;rsquo;t have the SSL certificate problem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Same issue, I was updating the email used for my account. Some kind of problem with the certificate their email verification system is using.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I would just word it with a keyword, the same way other games like Hearthstone or Eternal do. Something like &amp;ldquo;Arrives - Draw a card&amp;rdquo;. Same thing for death triggers. &amp;ldquo;Dies - Deal 2 damage to any target&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Arrives&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t too great, but in my head it evokes the &amp;ldquo;oh, it happens when he&amp;rsquo;s already here&amp;rdquo; feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Saga wording is actually reminder text, the actual Saga rules text should be the same as normal ETB triggers and draw step triggers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h4 id=&#34;posted-on-rpsych-questions-about-s7s8-shawn-and-juliethttpsredditcomrpsychcommentsgdf6g0questions_about_s7s8_shawn_and_juliet&#34;&gt;Posted on r/psych: &lt;a href=&#34;https://reddit.com/r/psych/comments/gdf6g0/questions_about_s7s8_shawn_and_juliet/&#34;&gt;Questions about S7/S8 Shawn and Juliet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I binged the entire series recently. I had only seen a few episodes on and off before, so I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really followed the whole Shawn and Juliet relationship before too closely. My question is about Jules and Shawn taking a break after Jules learns The Truth (TM) during Lassiter&amp;rsquo;s wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the show made a big deal of how Jules couldn&amp;rsquo;t trust Shawn and even after Jules stops Shawn from confessing to the chief, she still says there&amp;rsquo;s an issue of trust. Yet the very next episode, Shawn is sleeping at Jules&amp;rsquo; place again, and a couple of episodes later he just randomly tells Gus at the end of the episode that he and Jules are officially back together again, without giving us any indication of what happened in between for Shawn to earn back that trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just feels totally unearned compared to the big deal Juliet made about it after the wedding. Did they just run out of episodes to resolve things (the season ends the episode after Shawn says they are back together). I was just wondering if it was just me, or did the community feel this way about it at the time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also wondering if it had something to do with Roday and Lawson splitting up as a couple IRL sometime in 2013? It&amp;rsquo;s noticeable that from that point onwards, the show places much less emphasis on them as a couple, did they decide to just quickly wrap up the focus on Shawn/Juliet because of their IRL status?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I overthinking this? Lol.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Thanks man, I had my own script to export everything a while back but it was way messier and had far too many manual steps, yours is a lot cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Does Netflix have an open API? I remember looking around for it before but couldnt find any details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also any chance you could also serve rss feeds for new netflix shows/movies added per country?&lt;/p&gt;
