            &lt;p&gt;Fun use of the counters to get around memory issues in paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it only has the flying counter -&amp;gt; it&amp;rsquo;s a 4/4 Spirit Warrior Angel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it has the flying counter and the 2 +1/+1s -&amp;gt; It has the Ophidian ability&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If the +1/+1s get removed, you start to get confused.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no counter to help with the 2/3 mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m wondering how Arena will handle using Foretell when some of the cards in the opponent&amp;rsquo;s hand are revealed to you, since the card you exile with foretell should be hidden information. i.e., if I thoughtseize you and you&amp;rsquo;re holding 3 different foretell cards, then during your turn you pay 2 and exile one of them, the other 2 should no longer be revealed to me, since I would be able to deduce which card was exiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have they made any statement about this? I&amp;rsquo;m not super confident they&amp;rsquo;d handle it well lol.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Philippines. Very little impact as few people use it here. The dominant messaging apps here are Messenger and Viber&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Best is probably to call a judge.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I can’t relate to this request (I guess because I’m spiky), but I’m always curious whenever this comes up: are there other ccgs that do this (having systems that reward things other than winning, aside from daily quests)?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;For people like me who dislike watching videos: Before you start drafting a set, craft all the common/uncommon cards from the new set, so that each common/uncommon you open in draft adds to the vault percentage.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Did this population number only happen during Hickman&amp;rsquo;s run? I forget if there was a mass resurgence of mutants post-decimation&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The only bug I encountered was that I lost the first game and it awarded me the prize for the win anyway lol. I won the second game, so I only needed to play twice.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I got a bunch of Zendikar cards already (not sure if I also retained the stuff I got from the buggy renewal gift earlier)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Dont both triggers go on the stack regardless of the order of the triggers? i.e. even if you sac the pact to doom foretold before the pact trigger resolves, youre still losing the game&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;As I recall, the artwork of Finest Hour portrayed a knight fighting some kind of zombie horde? So there&amp;rsquo;s probably some level of monsters on the shard&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Very regular occurrence here in the Philippines unfortunately. After a presidential election, it’s not uncommon that most of the legislators jump ship to the president’s party (or their allies), presumably so they can partake of the spoils of the majority.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;TIL the term “glottal stop”. That’s totally what I meant!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Sorry if this is dumb: you know sometimes when you build a district but placing it has a warning like “this will remove woods” or such, does doing this have a chopping bonus too? or it has to be chopped with a builder first?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;In the Philippines, a lot of people like having the so-called &amp;ldquo;silog&amp;rdquo; meals - &amp;ldquo;silog&amp;rdquo; stands for &amp;ldquo;sinangag&amp;rdquo; (garlic fried rice) + &amp;ldquo;itlog&amp;rdquo; (egg). Basically rice meals usually with a meat viand. Examples are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;tapsilog&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;tapa&amp;rdquo; (dried or cured thinly-sliced beef or similar meat) + silog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;tocilog&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;tocino&amp;rdquo; (sweetened and cured pork belly) + silog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;longsilog&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;longganiza&amp;rdquo; (sausages flavoured with indigenous spices) + silog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;hotsilog&amp;rdquo; - hotdogs + silog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silog&#34;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also a bread roll called &amp;ldquo;pandesal&amp;rdquo; (literally salted bread from Spanish), commonly consumed for breakfast, usually with some spread or some meat filling, sometimes you dip it in coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do Miles, Ganke, Miles&amp;rsquo; family etc remember the Ultimate universe? Or Ultimate Peter Parker dying? Or were their histories &amp;ldquo;re-written&amp;rdquo; and merged into the main universe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not up-to-date with the Miles comics, but I don&amp;rsquo;t remember this being explained after Secret Wars&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Hey, in case you still need this: I was able to resolve the issue by going to &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.playstation.com&#34;&gt;store.playstation.com&lt;/a&gt; on my web browser, trying to log in, then telling it to resend the verification code. The new verification email had a link that goes to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://sony.com&#34;&gt;sony.com&lt;/a&gt; subdomain instead of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://playstation.com&#34;&gt;playstation.com&lt;/a&gt; subdomain, and that one didn&amp;rsquo;t have the SSL certificate problem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Same issue, I was updating the email used for my account. Some kind of problem with the certificate their email verification system is using.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I would just word it with a keyword, the same way other games like Hearthstone or Eternal do. Something like &amp;ldquo;Arrives - Draw a card&amp;rdquo;. Same thing for death triggers. &amp;ldquo;Dies - Deal 2 damage to any target&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Arrives&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t too great, but in my head it evokes the &amp;ldquo;oh, it happens when he&amp;rsquo;s already here&amp;rdquo; feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Saga wording is actually reminder text, the actual Saga rules text should be the same as normal ETB triggers and draw step triggers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h4 id=&#34;posted-on-rpsych-questions-about-s7s8-shawn-and-juliethttpsredditcomrpsychcommentsgdf6g0questions_about_s7s8_shawn_and_juliet&#34;&gt;Posted on r/psych: &lt;a href=&#34;https://reddit.com/r/psych/comments/gdf6g0/questions_about_s7s8_shawn_and_juliet/&#34;&gt;Questions about S7/S8 Shawn and Juliet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I binged the entire series recently. I had only seen a few episodes on and off before, so I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really followed the whole Shawn and Juliet relationship before too closely. My question is about Jules and Shawn taking a break after Jules learns The Truth (TM) during Lassiter&amp;rsquo;s wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the show made a big deal of how Jules couldn&amp;rsquo;t trust Shawn and even after Jules stops Shawn from confessing to the chief, she still says there&amp;rsquo;s an issue of trust. Yet the very next episode, Shawn is sleeping at Jules&amp;rsquo; place again, and a couple of episodes later he just randomly tells Gus at the end of the episode that he and Jules are officially back together again, without giving us any indication of what happened in between for Shawn to earn back that trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just feels totally unearned compared to the big deal Juliet made about it after the wedding. Did they just run out of episodes to resolve things (the season ends the episode after Shawn says they are back together). I was just wondering if it was just me, or did the community feel this way about it at the time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also wondering if it had something to do with Roday and Lawson splitting up as a couple IRL sometime in 2013? It&amp;rsquo;s noticeable that from that point onwards, the show places much less emphasis on them as a couple, did they decide to just quickly wrap up the focus on Shawn/Juliet because of their IRL status?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I overthinking this? Lol.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Thanks man, I had my own script to export everything a while back but it was way messier and had far too many manual steps, yours is a lot cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Does Netflix have an open API? I remember looking around for it before but couldnt find any details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also any chance you could also serve rss feeds for new netflix shows/movies added per country?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I mean, overcrowding shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be allowed regardless of outbreaks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a $5 coupon that&amp;rsquo;s expiring on the 3rd (from the BS region lock on Soul Calibur VI in the previous monthly) that I want to use, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend more than that (I&amp;rsquo;d rather not buy anything on the Humble Store if possible - Steam always gives me better regional pricing). The sort/filter options on the store make it tedious to find all games $5 or below&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Be random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an episode of Futurama, Fry gained the ability to read minds and tried to use it to win a big Poker tournament. In the final table, he was up against Bender, and they were the last two players. For the final hand, Bender didn&amp;rsquo;t even bother looking at his cards and went all-in, giving Fry&amp;rsquo;s mind-reading no chance to work. Clip: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cc.com/video-clips/55yfmj/futurama-the-poker-tournament&#34;&gt;http://www.cc.com/video-clips/55yfmj/futurama-the-poker-tournament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In One Piece, the protagonist Luffy was having trouble fighting bad guy Enel who could read his opponent&amp;rsquo;s intentions. What Luffy did was to bounce his barrage of attacks against a wall, so that neither he nor Enel could predict which way they would go, so that Enel would be unable to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Thanks for your reply, but I&amp;rsquo;m still not clear on the &amp;ldquo;employer-employee relationship part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a contractual part-time service worker in a fast food chain, he is not considered a regular employee is this correct? Is he required to register as a business? (I assume no.) Is he deduced the 8% withholding tax or the regular income tax?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this different from the scenario where you are a consultant working as a contractor for a local (PH) client (say, as a graphic designer or software developer)? Is the consultant considered an employee? Is he required to register as a business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for a number of clients as a consultant under contract, and they always just withhold the 8% and when I ask if there&amp;rsquo;s anything else I need to do for tax purposes, they never advise me that I need a business permit. Should their accountant been telling them otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;  Recurring like, you expect to engage in that particular kind of transaction for more than 1 time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&amp;gt; does that mean if you are only doing this once, it is not considered recurring? i.e. a client asks me to build an application for them and I receive a one-time payment from them upon delivery and afterwards we no longer have a relationship, in this scenario you do not have to register as a business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for all the follow-ups, I just want to clearly understand the scenarios wherein I would or would not be required to register as a business, because honestly I would like to avoid the bureaucracy as much as possible, hence I prefer not to register as a business if it can be avoided. I understand our duty as citizens to pay the right taxes etc and I would like to make sure I comply with any requirements and I don&amp;rsquo;t mind the withholding tax being deducted from me. But I would prefer to know under what conditions I could structure freelance/consultant work without having to register as a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW, I wanted to say I appreciate your answering these questions. I had been planning to look for an accountant to consult on related matters so this thread really helps.&lt;/p&gt;

            Reply to &amp;#39;Ask me anything about Philippine taxation! 13.12.19&amp;#39; on /r/Philippines at https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/e9vh59/ask_me_anything_about_philippine_taxation_131219/:

            &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;1. Should I register as a self-employed /business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Only if you are earning recurring income not earned under an employer-employee relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please explain &amp;ldquo;recurring income&amp;rdquo; here? What if I am earning money not on a full-time basis, with no guarantee of recurring income? For example, a company consults with me and I get paid an hourly fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please also explain &amp;ldquo;employer-employee relationship&amp;rdquo;. I was previously working as a consultant with a company, and they were deducting the withholding tax from me (I think it was 8%). My understanding is I was not an actual employee here since I was a consultant, should I have been registered as a business in this instance? It&amp;rsquo;s just weird since this withholding tax was already reported to the BIR and it seems there was no issue.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Are there any region restrictions for these? I&amp;rsquo;m still bitter over not getting SOULCALIBUR VI&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure my Gruul list is optimal either, but I do enjoy it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deck&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Stomping Ground (RNA) 259&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Rootbound Crag (XLN) 256&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Llanowar Elves (DAR) 168&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 Mountain (ANA) 64&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Paradise Druid (WAR) 171&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Gruul Spellbreaker (RNA) 179&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 Forest (ANA) 65&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Zhur-Taa Goblin (RNA) 215&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Burning-Tree Emissary (GTC) 216&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Embercleave (ELD) 120&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Questing Beast (ELD) 171&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Once Upon a Time (ELD) 169&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Pelt Collector (GRN) 141&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Domri&amp;rsquo;s Ambush (WAR) 192&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Castle Garenbrig (ELD) 240&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sideboard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Veil of Summer (M20) 198&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Cindervines (RNA) 161&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Lava Coil (GRN) 108&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Rekindling Phoenix (RIX) 111&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Shifting Ceratops (M20) 194&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Flame Sweep (M20) 139&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Collision // Colossus (RNA) 223&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re facing a lot of aggro, I do like bant scapeshift better.&lt;/p&gt;
