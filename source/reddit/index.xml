            &lt;p&gt;Did this population number only happen during Hickman&amp;rsquo;s run? I forget if there was a mass resurgence of mutants post-decimation&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The only bug I encountered was that I lost the first game and it awarded me the prize for the win anyway lol. I won the second game, so I only needed to play twice.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Super annoyed that I have exactly 1340 gems rn lol. (I also have only 5kish gold, so that&amp;rsquo;s not an option either)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I got a bunch of Zendikar cards already (not sure if I also retained the stuff I got from the buggy renewal gift earlier)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Dont both triggers go on the stack regardless of the order of the triggers? i.e. even if you sac the pact to doom foretold before the pact trigger resolves, youre still losing the game&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;As I recall, the artwork of Finest Hour portrayed a knight fighting some kind of zombie horde? So there&amp;rsquo;s probably some level of monsters on the shard&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Very regular occurrence here in the Philippines unfortunately. After a presidential election, it’s not uncommon that most of the legislators jump ship to the president’s party (or their allies), presumably so they can partake of the spoils of the majority.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Sorry if this is dumb: you know sometimes when you build a district but placing it has a warning like “this will remove woods” or such, does doing this have a chopping bonus too? or it has to be chopped with a builder first?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Can someone do the odds for a set booster with signed art card, foil land, 6 uncommons, 4 mythics (one of which is foil) and a card from the list? lol&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;In the Philippines, a lot of people like having the so-called &amp;ldquo;silog&amp;rdquo; meals - &amp;ldquo;silog&amp;rdquo; stands for &amp;ldquo;sinangag&amp;rdquo; (garlic fried rice) + &amp;ldquo;itlog&amp;rdquo; (egg). Basically rice meals usually with a meat viand. Examples are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;tapsilog&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;tapa&amp;rdquo; (dried or cured thinly-sliced beef or similar meat) + silog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;tocilog&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;tocino&amp;rdquo; (sweetened and cured pork belly) + silog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;longsilog&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;longganiza&amp;rdquo; (sausages flavoured with indigenous spices) + silog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;hotsilog&amp;rdquo; - hotdogs + silog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silog&#34;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also a bread roll called &amp;ldquo;pandesal&amp;rdquo; (literally salted bread from Spanish), commonly consumed for breakfast, usually with some spread or some meat filling, sometimes you dip it in coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandesal&#34;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandesal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do Miles, Ganke, Miles&amp;rsquo; family etc remember the Ultimate universe? Or Ultimate Peter Parker dying? Or were their histories &amp;ldquo;re-written&amp;rdquo; and merged into the main universe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not up-to-date with the Miles comics, but I don&amp;rsquo;t remember this being explained after Secret Wars&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Hey, in case you still need this: I was able to resolve the issue by going to &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.playstation.com&#34;&gt;store.playstation.com&lt;/a&gt; on my web browser, trying to log in, then telling it to resend the verification code. The new verification email had a link that goes to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://sony.com&#34;&gt;sony.com&lt;/a&gt; subdomain instead of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://playstation.com&#34;&gt;playstation.com&lt;/a&gt; subdomain, and that one didn&amp;rsquo;t have the SSL certificate problem.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Same issue, I was updating the email used for my account. Some kind of problem with the certificate their email verification system is using.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I would just word it with a keyword, the same way other games like Hearthstone or Eternal do. Something like &amp;ldquo;Arrives - Draw a card&amp;rdquo;. Same thing for death triggers. &amp;ldquo;Dies - Deal 2 damage to any target&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Arrives&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t too great, but in my head it evokes the &amp;ldquo;oh, it happens when he&amp;rsquo;s already here&amp;rdquo; feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Saga wording is actually reminder text, the actual Saga rules text should be the same as normal ETB triggers and draw step triggers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h4 id=&#34;posted-on-rpsych-questions-about-s7s8-shawn-and-juliethttpsredditcomrpsychcommentsgdf6g0questions_about_s7s8_shawn_and_juliet&#34;&gt;Posted on r/psych: &lt;a href=&#34;https://reddit.com/r/psych/comments/gdf6g0/questions_about_s7s8_shawn_and_juliet/&#34;&gt;Questions about S7/S8 Shawn and Juliet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I binged the entire series recently. I had only seen a few episodes on and off before, so I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really followed the whole Shawn and Juliet relationship before too closely. My question is about Jules and Shawn taking a break after Jules learns The Truth (TM) during Lassiter&amp;rsquo;s wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the show made a big deal of how Jules couldn&amp;rsquo;t trust Shawn and even after Jules stops Shawn from confessing to the chief, she still says there&amp;rsquo;s an issue of trust. Yet the very next episode, Shawn is sleeping at Jules&amp;rsquo; place again, and a couple of episodes later he just randomly tells Gus at the end of the episode that he and Jules are officially back together again, without giving us any indication of what happened in between for Shawn to earn back that trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just feels totally unearned compared to the big deal Juliet made about it after the wedding. Did they just run out of episodes to resolve things (the season ends the episode after Shawn says they are back together). I was just wondering if it was just me, or did the community feel this way about it at the time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also wondering if it had something to do with Roday and Lawson splitting up as a couple IRL sometime in 2013? It&amp;rsquo;s noticeable that from that point onwards, the show places much less emphasis on them as a couple, did they decide to just quickly wrap up the focus on Shawn/Juliet because of their IRL status?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I overthinking this? Lol.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Thanks man, I had my own script to export everything a while back but it was way messier and had far too many manual steps, yours is a lot cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Does Netflix have an open API? I remember looking around for it before but couldnt find any details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also any chance you could also serve rss feeds for new netflix shows/movies added per country?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a $5 coupon that&amp;rsquo;s expiring on the 3rd (from the BS region lock on Soul Calibur VI in the previous monthly) that I want to use, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend more than that (I&amp;rsquo;d rather not buy anything on the Humble Store if possible - Steam always gives me better regional pricing). The sort/filter options on the store make it tedious to find all games $5 or below&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Be random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an episode of Futurama, Fry gained the ability to read minds and tried to use it to win a big Poker tournament. In the final table, he was up against Bender, and they were the last two players. For the final hand, Bender didn&amp;rsquo;t even bother looking at his cards and went all-in, giving Fry&amp;rsquo;s mind-reading no chance to work. Clip: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cc.com/video-clips/55yfmj/futurama-the-poker-tournament&#34;&gt;http://www.cc.com/video-clips/55yfmj/futurama-the-poker-tournament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In One Piece, the protagonist Luffy was having trouble fighting bad guy Enel who could read his opponent&amp;rsquo;s intentions. What Luffy did was to bounce his barrage of attacks against a wall, so that neither he nor Enel could predict which way they would go, so that Enel would be unable to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Thanks for your reply, but I&amp;rsquo;m still not clear on the &amp;ldquo;employer-employee relationship part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a contractual part-time service worker in a fast food chain, he is not considered a regular employee is this correct? Is he required to register as a business? (I assume no.) Is he deduced the 8% withholding tax or the regular income tax?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this different from the scenario where you are a consultant working as a contractor for a local (PH) client (say, as a graphic designer or software developer)? Is the consultant considered an employee? Is he required to register as a business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for a number of clients as a consultant under contract, and they always just withhold the 8% and when I ask if there&amp;rsquo;s anything else I need to do for tax purposes, they never advise me that I need a business permit. Should their accountant been telling them otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;  Recurring like, you expect to engage in that particular kind of transaction for more than 1 time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&amp;gt; does that mean if you are only doing this once, it is not considered recurring? i.e. a client asks me to build an application for them and I receive a one-time payment from them upon delivery and afterwards we no longer have a relationship, in this scenario you do not have to register as a business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for all the follow-ups, I just want to clearly understand the scenarios wherein I would or would not be required to register as a business, because honestly I would like to avoid the bureaucracy as much as possible, hence I prefer not to register as a business if it can be avoided. I understand our duty as citizens to pay the right taxes etc and I would like to make sure I comply with any requirements and I don&amp;rsquo;t mind the withholding tax being deducted from me. But I would prefer to know under what conditions I could structure freelance/consultant work without having to register as a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW, I wanted to say I appreciate your answering these questions. I had been planning to look for an accountant to consult on related matters so this thread really helps.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;1. Should I register as a self-employed /business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Only if you are earning recurring income not earned under an employer-employee relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please explain &amp;ldquo;recurring income&amp;rdquo; here? What if I am earning money not on a full-time basis, with no guarantee of recurring income? For example, a company consults with me and I get paid an hourly fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please also explain &amp;ldquo;employer-employee relationship&amp;rdquo;. I was previously working as a consultant with a company, and they were deducting the withholding tax from me (I think it was 8%). My understanding is I was not an actual employee here since I was a consultant, should I have been registered as a business in this instance? It&amp;rsquo;s just weird since this withholding tax was already reported to the BIR and it seems there was no issue.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Are there any region restrictions for these? I&amp;rsquo;m still bitter over not getting SOULCALIBUR VI&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure my Gruul list is optimal either, but I do enjoy it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deck&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Stomping Ground (RNA) 259&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Rootbound Crag (XLN) 256&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Llanowar Elves (DAR) 168&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 Mountain (ANA) 64&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Paradise Druid (WAR) 171&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Gruul Spellbreaker (RNA) 179&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 Forest (ANA) 65&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Zhur-Taa Goblin (RNA) 215&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Burning-Tree Emissary (GTC) 216&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Embercleave (ELD) 120&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Questing Beast (ELD) 171&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Once Upon a Time (ELD) 169&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Pelt Collector (GRN) 141&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Domri&amp;rsquo;s Ambush (WAR) 192&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Castle Garenbrig (ELD) 240&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sideboard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Veil of Summer (M20) 198&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Cindervines (RNA) 161&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Lava Coil (GRN) 108&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Rekindling Phoenix (RIX) 111&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Shifting Ceratops (M20) 194&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Flame Sweep (M20) 139&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Collision // Colossus (RNA) 223&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Bonecrusher Giant (ELD) 115&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re facing a lot of aggro, I do like bant scapeshift better.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Sorry, after I posted the comment above, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time to grind Arena that month so I don&amp;rsquo;t have much more input. The deck is sweet but it fares much better against aggro decks than the various ramp and control decks that become more prevalent once you&amp;rsquo;re in Diamond or higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this month, I&amp;rsquo;ve switched to Gruul aggro for Historic BO3, the games tend to go a lot faster :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was looking forward to playing Soul Calibur VI in the December early unlocks, but today I find out it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;unavailable in my region&amp;rdquo; and all I get is a $5 coupon for my trouble. =/ They could have indicated that in the promotional materials they kept sending me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish they had an option for me to just gift the code to someone who is in the correct region (that way I can at least set up a trade maybe?). Instead I get a $5 coupon that IDK if I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to use; I never purchase stuff from the Humble store because Steam gives me better regional pricing. It would be nice if I could apply the coupon to one of their other bundles instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that this isn&amp;rsquo;t just a rant, can I ask if purchases off the Humble store always give a Steam key?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: I found out that Soul Calibur VI is actually purchasable for me on both Steam and the Humble Store, so IDK what&amp;rsquo;s up with that &amp;ldquo;unavailable in my region&amp;rdquo; thing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Gave this a quick run and won 5 consecutive BO3 matches easily, barely any struggle. And I never even cast scapeshift! The one close match was vs Fires; Game 1 I almost ran out of cards before I closed the game with a huge krasis, Game 2 he hit me with Unmoored Ego, but I responded with Growth Spiral to play the 2nd Field so it was fine (I never seem to have the Veils when I want them). Granted, this was in Gold, but I look forward to trying to use this deck to grind as far up as I can til end of month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I never got the chance to cast scapeshift, I&amp;rsquo;d like to confirm that if I sacrifice exactly 7 lands and search for 7 uniques including field of the dead, I get 7 zombie triggers yes? (I assume if I have more than 7 and at least one of them is field, I shouldnt sac the field so that I get more triggers)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;No one can answer this because no law, ordinance or executive order has been released detailing the rules. Basically its the whim of the authorities&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Decision trees like &amp;ldquo;which starter pokemon do you pick&amp;rdquo; aren&amp;rsquo;t things that should be embedded into your code as if/else statements. These should be data that your code loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this specific example, you could have a data file that has a list of all the available starter pokemon. How many are available to choose from? Your code will read these data files and present them as choices. The data files could include the dialog text and say, an ID string to indicate which pokemon would then be added into your party, something like this (JSON format, because it&amp;rsquo;s easier for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;starters: [&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;{ &amp;quot;dialog&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;I choose Charmander!&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;pokemon_id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;0001&amp;quot;},&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;{ &amp;quot;dialog&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;I want Bulbasaur!&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;pokemon_id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;0002&amp;quot;},&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;{ &amp;quot;dialog&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;I want Pikachu!&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;pokemon_id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;0003&amp;quot;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I forgot who the 3rd starter was supposed to be, I&amp;rsquo;m not big on Pokemon. Also I&amp;rsquo;m guessing those aren&amp;rsquo;t the actual pokedex IDs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each item on the list could also contain some other info. For example in dialogue trees, you might have NPCs react differently depending on what you say, so in that case each node would have an id pointing to the specific NPC response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to separate the data from your code, since those are totally separate concerns. This is a general programming principle not specific to game development. In this way, you make it easier to modify your data (like decision trees) without necessarily having to rebuild your code. For example, you could change the dialog message for each pokemon starter choice, or maybe you could add more choices, or make the starter pokemon be Snorlax, MewTwo and Ekans for some reason (those are pokemon right? Lol). Bigger game studios will have separate tools to maintain those data files so that even nonprogrammers can help change those kinds of things in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;extract your decision trees into data files outside of the code.&lt;/p&gt;
