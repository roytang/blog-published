<p>As someone with sweaty hands especially over a long tournament, I appreciate any effort to reduce the amount of shuffling that needs to be done</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1w6kxn/probably_a_dumb_question_about_rakdos_lord_of/">&#39;Probably a dumb question about Rakdos, Lord of Riots, by a noobie building his first Standard deck.&#39; on /r/magicTCG</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>That last ability isn&rsquo;t like a spell effect that is only determined when the creature spell resolves. It&rsquo;s a static continuous effect that is in effect all the time as long as Rakdos, LOR is on the battlefield. The expression &ldquo;life your opponents have lost this turn&rdquo; is thus evaluated continuously, instead of based on a fixed time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this wording is not addressed directly in the comprehensive rules, mostly because the term &ldquo;this turn&rdquo; is most commonly used on spells and abilities instead of continuous effects. I suggest trying the Judge chat (<a href="http://chat.magicjudges.org/mtgrules/">http://chat.magicjudges.org/mtgrules/</a>) to see if they could cite any gatherer rulings from similar cards (the gatherer page for Rakdos, LOR does not have anything relevant)</p>
<p>It should be noted that the alternative (that the reduction is only determined at casting time) would probably be implemented using counters, i.e. something like &ldquo;Rakdos, Lord of Riots enters the battlefield with X evil counters, where X is the amount of life your opponents lost this turn. Creature spells you cast cost 1 less to play for each evil counter on Rakdos, Lord of Riots.&rdquo; The counters are needed because without them, there would be memory issues with such an effect.</p>

<p>Well, my first thought was: what are you watching on local tv that is so important to be on time? I&rsquo;m not trolling or anything, I literally don&rsquo;t watch any local tv except maybe news if I catch it while it&rsquo;s on, so I have no idea if there&rsquo;s anything people watch except for crappy telenovelas</p>

<p>Not only that, but the traffic situation gets a lot better in Manila, there are hardly any cars on the road. If only Pacquiao had fights every day&hellip;</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ufzj5/question_about_the_true_chronology_of_orson_scott/">&#39;Question about the &#39;true&#39; chronology of Orson Scott Card&#39;s &#39;Ender&#39;s Game&#39; series.&#39; on /r/books</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>The biggest jump is between Ender&rsquo;s Game and Speaker of the Dead, not only in terms of time (since Speaker takes place way in the future where only Ender and Val are carried over from Ender&rsquo;s Game&rsquo;s cast), but also in terms of story style.</p>
<p>I would recommend reading first Ender&rsquo;s Game, then Ender&rsquo;s Shadow. After that, decide whether you want to follow Ender branch (this is far future space exploration, dealing with aliens stuff) or Bean branch (this is more of post-Ender&rsquo;s Game earth politics/warfare)&hellip; I would guess that if you liked the battle school aspect of Ender&rsquo;s Game with the kids being all smart and tactical, you would prefer Bean branch first. if you prefer the sci-fi aspect of it all, then you would probably prefer the Ender branch.</p>
<p>Ender branch is (in order of the story timeline): Ender&rsquo;s Game -&gt; Ender in Exile -&gt; Speaker for the Dead -&gt; Xenocide -&gt; Children of the Mind</p>
<p>Bean branch is Ender&rsquo;s Shadow -&gt; Shadow of the Hegemon -&gt; Shadow Puppets -&gt; Shadow of the Giant -&gt; Shadows in Flight</p>

<p>Wild Ricochet is a legal target while it is resolving. The last step of spell resolution is:</p>
<p>608.2k As the final part of an instant or sorcery spell&rsquo;s resolution, the spell is put into its owner&rsquo;s graveyard. As the final part of an ability&rsquo;s resolution, the ability is removed from the stack and ceases to exist.</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1u59mm/i_made_a_20_standard_deck_including_sideboard/ceeqen7/">a comment by SlairStyle on &#39;I made a $20 Standard deck (including sideboard) that doesn&#39;t suck. 5-0 @ FNM&#39; on /r/magicTCG</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>The next standard daily was like six hours away so I just played a few games in the tournament practice room instead. I used the same decklist with minor changes (Guildgates -&gt; Temples and Thoughtseizes instead of Duress in the SB; SB Celestial Flare -&gt; SB Hero&rsquo;s Downfall because I didnt have the flares oddly enough)</p>
<p>I only played single games since I wanted to get a hang of the deck. I lost the first two due to poor handling (played a High Priest into an empty board, wasting it, and thinking the newt did -4/-4 when I only had the cauldron and not the witch), but won the next 3.</p>
<p>Some comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Grim return seems poor/situational, I never got to use it once. Though, it can hit opponent GYs right? I guess an upside would be he could animate the discard off that rat guy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have trouble/a slow start if you don&rsquo;t have an early newt; your only way to tutor him comes out turn 4 at the earliest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seem to have trouble/no way to recover if the opp gets into an early creature advantage. My two losses had 4+ creatures on the other side</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>James Clavell&rsquo;s Shogun was the first full-length novel I ever read (unless you count Hardy Boys books or something), I&rsquo;ve probably gone through the whole book around 8-10 times now, that&rsquo;s not counting times I went back and just re-read some chapters I liked</p>
