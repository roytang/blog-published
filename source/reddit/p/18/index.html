<div class="content e-content">

<p>There is an incursion point that will destroy one of two earths (this is on the parallel earth). Only one Earth can survive. The New Avengers meet up with that world&rsquo;s superheroes to see if they have any options, but they have less than an hour to figure a way out. The New Avengers have a unthinkable backup plan - an antimatter bomb that would destroy the parallel earth and make them mass murderers. Namor is tired of the discussions and knows where it&rsquo;s all headed&hellip;</p>

<p>I dunno about you guys, but I reckon I&rsquo;ll still be using my Vita at least a year or two from now.</p>
<p>I still have a decent Vita backlog&hellip;and I&rsquo;m still looking forward to Tales of Hearts R and probably Freedom Wars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not even counting the additional playtime it&rsquo;s going to get when I get a PS4</p>
<p>Edit: And also Gravity Rush 2! And Disgaea 4 (best on handheld~)!</p>

<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m looking to get into Modern (mostly because we have a PTQ in a few weeks), and I&rsquo;ve been checking some decklists and I already have most of the cards for UWR Geist (based on some decklists off the Top Modern Decks from PT:BOTG)</p>
<p>Is this deck currently well-positioned? Looking at recent MTGO event results, most of the UWR decks are the more controllish types without Geist.</p>
<p>Is there a good primer I can read somewhere, something that tells me what are the good/bad matchups, sideboard choices, etc?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a big Street Fighter fan since forever, but I&rsquo;m not too good at the game because of super-tight timings with one-frame links and stuff like that and not having enough time to practice my execution religiously. I&rsquo;m planning to get Smash on 3ds, but I&rsquo;ve never played the series before. Do you have any idea if it&rsquo;s generally as unforgiving as Street Fighter execution-wise?</p>

<p>I used to follow mulldrifting&rsquo;s MTGPlayers list, but that seems to have been removed, does anyone have any suggestions?</p>
<p>Edit: To be clear, I don&rsquo;t want to follow them one by one, I want to use Twitter&rsquo;s existing lists feature where I can subscribe to a list maintained by someone else.</p>

<p>Do any of the answers here carry large sizes? (3X or preferably 4X) it&rsquo;s always been my problem when looking for themed shirts that the ones sold locally are usually too small for me</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to reply Alison. Wizards has always been very good in engaging the community, so hopefully at some point there can be a more open dialogue to discuss the feedback with the community and the perceived problems with the new client.</p>
<p>I personally do not mind using the new client, but some of the reports here like slower machines being unable to run it at all are worrying; if enough of the population have a problem with the new client, it may negatively affect the user base.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Okay, the sale has been up for a few days, but I still can&rsquo;t decide what to get, if any. I have $20 available in the PSN wallet to spend, but I already have a ridiculously long backlog and next to no free space on my Vita memcard.</p>
<p>Here are the games I&rsquo;m considering:</p>
<p>Tales of Symphonia Chronicles - the price is really good, but I can borrow this from a friend</p>
<p>MGS HD Collection (Vita) - I can borrow the PS3 version from a friend, however I generally have more time/am more inclined to play on a Vita</p>
<p>Muramasa - looks interesting, but I&rsquo;m worried it will be free on Plus soon</p>
<p>Ys: Memories of Celceta - a lot of people recommend it, but it looks like I might be able to get a used physical copy at around the sale price</p>
<p>Tactics Ogre - it seems like it would be nice to have this on Vita, but I have it on PSP (I think my PSP is still working&hellip;haven&rsquo;t touched it in a while)</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Very true, the man likes to draw the extra cards, that&rsquo;s not too much of a bad thing though.</p>
<p>Blue is very good in Theros as well, so I wouldn&rsquo;t mind recommending it for the prerelease anyway (a lot of people I know seem to prefer White, which is cool too)</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Now that all of LSV&rsquo;s limited reviews are up, here&rsquo;s some stats for JOU:</p>
<p>Total score of commons in each color:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>W - 29.5</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>U - 30.5</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B - 29</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R - 28</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>G - 28.5</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Total score of uncommons in each color:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>W - 28</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>U - 30</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B - 24</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R - 26</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>G - 23.5</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, these stats could mean nothing and don&rsquo;t take into account how individual cards stack against each other and you should still use your best judgment, and LSV isn&rsquo;t always right/accurate, but if you have no time at all to study up on the set and don&rsquo;t know what color to pick for the prerelease, I&rsquo;d go with Blue, with White as a second choice.</p>
<p>Have fun at the prerelease everyone!</p>
