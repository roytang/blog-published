<p>It&rsquo;s a 300Gb PS3 slim, I think it&rsquo;s the latest model. This is kind of a long story, so bear with me.</p>
<p>So a few days ago, my brother left the PS3 on overnight to download the Destiny Beta. When he woke up, the PS3 had hanged and he had to do the thing where he holds down the power button until it turns off. Then he reboots and there&rsquo;s a screen where he&rsquo;s asked to connect a controller via wire and then press the PS button, then we get the ff message:</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/hcDiDer">http://imgur.com/hcDiDer</a></p>
<p>Okaaaay. After pressing the PS button again, it proceeds to boot, but VERY SLOWLY, it takes a long time (5-10 minutes) at the wavy blue screen before finally booting up (the wavy blues lines are moving though). And the PS3 can be used normally at this point, but sometimes the XMB menu lags so badly (like 20-30 seconds to switch menu items)</p>
<p>When we tried to shut it down, it took a long to shut down as well. The display turned off promptly then the green light kept blinking for a couple of minutes before finally going red.</p>
<p>Then we start it up again, and the same error happens on startup and same problems observed.</p>
<p>Then my brother tried reinstalling the 4.60 update (as per the error message), but the error still persisted after that.</p>
<p>After a few reboots still didn&rsquo;t help, I went ahead into the safe mode/recovery menu and started with &ldquo;Rebuild file system&rdquo;&hellip;that went fairly quickly (15-20 mins) but after rebooting, same problem.</p>
<p>So I took the next step: &ldquo;Rebuild database&rdquo;; this one took forever, I started it before lunch and when it was time to sleep it was at around 11%; when I woke up the next day it was at 19% then it seemed to stay that way the rest of the day. I figured it was stuck so I turned it off again (by holding down the power button) and attempted a second rebuild database.</p>
<p>The second attempt got a bit farther, 29% but still really slow and it looked like it was stuck again by next morning, so I shut it off again.</p>
<p>And I was like ok, screw it, I&rsquo;ll reformat the PS3 (I didn&rsquo;t mind losing the data too much, cloud saves, etc). So I reboot it again, but I forget to go into the recovery menu, and it has the error message again and it attempts to boot normally, and then detects a problem with the file system and says it&rsquo;s going to rebuild the file system and I&rsquo;m like &ldquo;Ok!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But then I realize that&rsquo;s not what I wanted to do (and here&rsquo;s where I probably screwed up - or maybe we&rsquo;re already past that point?), so I force turned off the machine while it was in the middle of file system recovery. After that when I tried to reformat the PS3, it said it couldn&rsquo;t access the system storage.</p>
<p>Okaaaay. So I went into safe mode and tried rebuild file system again, but after choosing the option this time I got a completely blank screen; I left it alone for like 30 minutes to an hour but still no action. It took a couple of reboots and retries with similar problems, but finally I managed to start the reformat.</p>
<p>Okay, reformat succeeds and I have to input my settings again and stuff, then okay, the XMB boots and loads, etc. Then I try shutting down the PS3, and this time the shutdown takes forever - the green light is blinking continuously for a LONG TIME. (I switched to WiiU and managed to finish a Twilight Princess dungeon during that time)</p>
<p>Eventually I decided to hold down the power button again until it shuts off then restart the system. On startup, same error again (the one in the image), and then it won&rsquo;t even boot, it says the file system is corrupted and wants to rebuild.</p>
<p>I leave it overnight rebuilding the file system (it&rsquo;s much slower this time) and when I wake up in the morning the PS3 is already off so i just assumed it finished. Tried starting up again - same error.</p>
<p>I did the file system rebuild 2 more times (once during the day while I was at work, and one more time last night and I another one just now); the last 3 cases were all the same: same error on startup, did not want to boot, PS3 off by the time I came back (except for the ongoing one of course)</p>
<p>Okaaay, that was a long story. Hopefully some of you stuck around to help. What are my options now? I doubt this current rebuild file system is going to work.</p>
<p>Should I attempt to repair or replace the hard drive? Should I take it to a shop to be looked at? Is there some other option I can try first? (I&rsquo;m hesitant to take it to a shop because the nearest shop is a bit inconveniently out of the way)</p>
<p>Thanks very much for anyone who can help or offer advice!</p>
<p>TLDR; PS3 doesn&rsquo;t want to boot anymore, keeps wanting to rebuild file system.</p>
<p>Edit: I took the HDD out and scanned it on a PC, there&rsquo;s a bunch of errors that I can&rsquo;t repair. Ended up having to replace the HDD. On the upside, more space! Thanks for reading!</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>When I was growing up, I was acutely aware of how much my parents worked hard and sacrificed to not only get me and my brothers through school but also buy us nice toys and other things on occasion. They would spend overtime at work, commute every day for hours at a time, sometimes even pull some extra work on the side when the family needed extra money. I promised myself that when I graduated I would try to ease their burden as much as possible, and I put in my share - paying some of the bills and putting my youngest brother through college, especially once my mother retired (my father is still working). And my parents are certainly very grateful for any help that I do provide, and never ask anything of me unless there is no alternative (usually ako na ang nagvovolunteer)</p>
<p>Everyone has a different situation; maybe you are not as grateful to your parents for some reason; maybe they can easily support themselves and your siblings without your help; maybe you have nothing to spare even for yourself. You are certainly not obliged to take on their burdens (especially if they are more than capable of doing so), but there is no harm in showing gratitude for the life they have given you, if you can spare it.</p>

<p>Not sure if this is the best place to ask this, feel free to suggest any other subreddit where it would be more appropriate</p>
<p>Developer productivity isn&rsquo;t exactly an easy thing to measure, do performance evaluations of developers tend to be more subjective?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that some companies evaluate by setting set objectives at the start of the year/evaluation period. How does that work for senior developers whose responsibilities shift a lot?</p>
<p>How do the big companies (Google, MS, Amazon, etc) do it?</p>

<p>My only gripe might be that the parallel earth heroes seem a bit too DC-inspired. I mean, they have a Superman, a Doctor Fate, and that lady with the lightning garb looks a bit like the New 52 Jay Garrick from Earth-2</p>

<p>There is an incursion point that will destroy one of two earths (this is on the parallel earth). Only one Earth can survive. The New Avengers meet up with that world&rsquo;s superheroes to see if they have any options, but they have less than an hour to figure a way out. The New Avengers have a unthinkable backup plan - an antimatter bomb that would destroy the parallel earth and make them mass murderers. Namor is tired of the discussions and knows where it&rsquo;s all headed&hellip;</p>

<p>I dunno about you guys, but I reckon I&rsquo;ll still be using my Vita at least a year or two from now.</p>
<p>I still have a decent Vita backlog&hellip;and I&rsquo;m still looking forward to Tales of Hearts R and probably Freedom Wars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not even counting the additional playtime it&rsquo;s going to get when I get a PS4</p>
<p>Edit: And also Gravity Rush 2! And Disgaea 4 (best on handheld~)!</p>

<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m looking to get into Modern (mostly because we have a PTQ in a few weeks), and I&rsquo;ve been checking some decklists and I already have most of the cards for UWR Geist (based on some decklists off the Top Modern Decks from PT:BOTG)</p>
<p>Is this deck currently well-positioned? Looking at recent MTGO event results, most of the UWR decks are the more controllish types without Geist.</p>
<p>Is there a good primer I can read somewhere, something that tells me what are the good/bad matchups, sideboard choices, etc?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a big Street Fighter fan since forever, but I&rsquo;m not too good at the game because of super-tight timings with one-frame links and stuff like that and not having enough time to practice my execution religiously. I&rsquo;m planning to get Smash on 3ds, but I&rsquo;ve never played the series before. Do you have any idea if it&rsquo;s generally as unforgiving as Street Fighter execution-wise?</p>
