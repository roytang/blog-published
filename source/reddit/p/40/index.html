</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>The damage is removed and the giant growth is removed, both at the same time. The important thing is state-based effects (including the thing that checks whether your creature is dead due to damage &gt; toughness) do not check in between; once all end of turn effects are cleaned up, that&rsquo;s the only time things are checked to see if they are alive or dead. So, the correct answer is (1)</p>

Or any other way to get Mass Effect 2 DLC?</a></h4>
<p>So I got Mass Effect 2 via a Steam sale a while back, but I don&rsquo;t have the DLC like Overlord, Kasumi, etc. Is purchasing Bioware points the only way to buy them on PC? If so, do they at least have sales at any time? Or can we expect a price drop at least when ME3 comes out?</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fxbd5/im_sick_of_this_entire_dlc_scam_cutting_content/">&#39;I&#39;m sick of this entire DLC scam - cutting content out of a game to re-sell it is wrong in so many ways. So So how easy and cohesive is it to pirate DLC for games?&#39; on /r/gaming</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>What if they didn&rsquo;t bundle DLC separately and just straight-up sold the game for a higher price (and with a slightly later release date), would you prefer it? Or if the game was released with the same price but no additional DLC at all? Or the game is released with no DLC but six months later a new full version of the game is released with slightly more content that could have been released as DLC but instead you now have to buy a full game again?</p>
<p>Personally, I find that DLC is a good idea as it allows customers to pick and choose which content they want. I&rsquo;m not going to bitch about it, I don&rsquo;t have to buy the DLC if I don&rsquo;t want to. In fact for longer games like RPGs I just wait for the GOTY to come out later.</p>
<p>Also, the phrase &ldquo;cutting content out of the game&rdquo; shows misunderstanding of how software development in general works. Like all other software development gigs, game development is largely constrained by schedules and real-world budget and resource constraints. And most of the time they&rsquo;re going to fall short of those schedules and have to decide what features to cut so they can make it on time. Having the option of releasing them as DLC creates less pressure on the team and creates an opportunity for content that would otherwise have been cut or saved for a larger expansion disc to be made available. And please don&rsquo;t take at face value the rantings that because 90% of a DLC&rsquo;s content is already on the disc that it should have been included at release - you haven&rsquo;t considered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-ninety_rule">the other 90%</a> yet.</p>

<p>The medium(Normal) computer isn&rsquo;t very good as a gauge of your abilities as it isn&rsquo;t very difficult at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a particularly good MvC3 player, but here&rsquo;s some ideas: Are you able to block correctly? Do you use assists to create openings? If you have trouble doing hypers on the fly, have you tried doing them in training? Completing a few missions?</p>
<p>Actually I think Wolverine can do Berserker Barrage X (QCF + AA) off most light or medium attacks, so you should be able to practice like Light into Medium into down-forward + Light + Medium at least. I find this easier on an arcade stick instead of a controller though due to the button layout.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Yes it will. I have literally had this happen at a Regionals with a judge ruling and all, so I am sure. Just make sure to note that the &ldquo;untap&rdquo; part of the effect happens as the effect resolves, so even though you get two extra combat phases, the untaps still happen at the start of the first combat phase when both triggers resolve (i.e. you will not get to untap for the 2nd additional combat phase)</p>

<p>The stylus is a Targus one&hellip;I plan to use the iPad for drawing/random doodling, but the only drawing app I have at the moment is Adobe Ideas. Any suggestions for good drawing/doodling apps (preferably free ones)?</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m using the official Apple case, but I&rsquo;d like to be able to attach the stylus to the ipad somehow to avoid losing it&hellip;any ideas?</p>

<p>If the damage is prevented, it can&rsquo;t be redirected.</p>
<p>You can target a planeswalker as long as your spell says &ldquo;target planeswalker&rdquo; or maybe &ldquo;target permanent&rdquo;. Lightning bolt can only target creatures or players.</p>

<p>Really? Did you get that from the multiple game of the year awards it garnered? :p</p>
<p>Dunno whether bnet is &ldquo;shitty&rdquo; or not but I&rsquo;ve personally logged more than 500 games online, and I&rsquo;m no pro just a casual player mostly. Hundreds of games are ongoing at any one time on bnet, I&rsquo;m not sure under what definition of shitty that qualifies.</p>
<p>Tldr sc2 is an awesome game</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ey888/so_what_is_the_appropriate_way_to_present_a/">&#39;So, what is the appropriate way to present a website idea to a programmer?&#39; on /r/AskReddit</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>What is your purpose in presenting the website idea? Are you hiring the programmer to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Design the website? (Not just graphic design, but to flesh out the details of how your requirements can be met, like what screens will be needed, what sort of data will be stored)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement a design you already have? (In which case the design better be thorough! You wouldn&rsquo;t come up to a carpenter and just say &ldquo;Build me a shelf!&rdquo; without any details)</p>
</li>
</ul>
