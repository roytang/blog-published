<p>In real life, you cannot ask infinite numbers of soldiers or tanks or whatever to occupy the a finite area.</p>
<p>A single unit in civ represents just enough numbers of that unit that can fully occupy whatever amount of area a single hex represents.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Your old cards might still be relevant in Eternal formats called Vintage and Legacy. These are formats that allow cards from any period of MTG, with some exceptions.</p>
<p>Do you prefer playing online or IRL? If you collect cards on Magic Online, they can be &ldquo;redeemed&rdquo; in full sets, i.e. if you have one of each card from the set Zendikar on Magic Online, they can be redeemed for one of each Zendikar card IRL. However, redemptions are not always available, it depends on whether they have paper cards in stock to redeem the online cards. I have personally never redeemed MtgO cards.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a lot of resources (i.e., don&rsquo;t have a lot of money) and want to play IRL, I suggest you look for a group of friends that you can play with casually at first. Depending on your experiences with them you may be able to transition into more serious play by borrowing cards, etc.</p>

<p>I think there&rsquo;s a wonder that halves the amount of unhappiness generated by the number of cities. Combine that with keeping per-city population low (to reduce unhappiness from total population), it should work.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re welcome. I think it&rsquo;s happened to me twice now that I got free wins at a prerelease due to my opponent using the promo card.</p>
<p>Actually, if you get a non-promo Wurmcoil Engine, you should almost certainly play it, no matter what deck you have. :D</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>When you get your promotional prerelease card (Wurmcoil Engine) do NOT include it in your deck, you will get a game loss for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine if you play a non-promo Wurmcoil Engine from your sealed pool.</p>

<p>Are these as good as the first two Monkey Island games? I enjoyed them as a kid but haven&rsquo;t played the newer ones.</p>
<p>Also, is Telltale Games ok? Do they work like Steam?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>It is not like Age of Empires, the gameplay is turn-based instead of real-time, and much more massive scale.</p>
<p>Reading through the manual might help you decide whether to buy or not. Or maybe look for videos of Civ 4 gameplay (I remember seeing some introductory videos to Civ 4 on youtube) to get an idea of what a Civ game is like.</p>

<p>I live in a country where criminal defendants often retract confessions saying they were tortured or coerced into making those confessions. So I was thinking: why not require that the suspect have a lawyer present during any police interrogation, otherwise any statements made during such interrogation would not be admissible in court?</p>
<p>I remember there was an online video being passed around where even if you were innocent you should not talk to the police; if this view is recognized and the general consensus is that you should never talk to the police without a lawyer anyway, why not formalize it so that ignorant people are automatically protected and police are not tempted to coerce confessions out of suspects?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of reasons to try out a tournament-level deck in the casual room. Maybe you&rsquo;re tweaking it and want to try out a few draws or learn how it works before going to the Tournament Practice room. Maybe you don&rsquo;t have a sideboard yet. Maybe you want more varied opponents.</p>
