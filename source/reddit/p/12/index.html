<p>The first post remains neutral. The additional info I put in a separate post. I only put cons here because that&rsquo;s the info I have. The whole point of the exercise is for people to provide any info they have also, so if you have additional info (whether pro or con), you can comment them also.</p>

[2021.04.08] This was originally a huge reddit thread where I had more than 100 comments, which resulted in so many posts to this site. I decided to merge most of the top level content into this large single post.
Posted on r/Philippines: 2016 Senatorial Candidates Information Megathread Hello /r/Philippines!

<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s already an abundance of information on the presidential candidates. People just need to decide which flaws they are willing to overlook. That being said, I do have a spreadsheet I&rsquo;ve been using to help decide, but it is quite specific to my own stand on the issues. If you are still undecided you may find it useful: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MTPMAhGCiG_7jWC0vLNnJNQLPXGbBBLlfHri8-RqgaI/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MTPMAhGCiG_7jWC0vLNnJNQLPXGbBBLlfHri8-RqgaI/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>For VP, I have no inputs as I have already made my choice.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I understand the theory behind it, and will try these things to practice my own meaty setups, but one of my concerns right now when playing ranked (I&rsquo;m only in Super Bronze so I&rsquo;m not particularly good) is that against higher-ranked players, I often find myself helpless on waking up because of meaty attacks in particular. So I&rsquo;m a bit more interested in what one can do when the opponent knows these setups inside and out. Do I just try to predict whether he is going for the meaty and block then punish?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>If it&rsquo;s a meaty attack, does that mean any wakeup by the opponent will get snuffed? The opponent must block to avoid getting hit (leaving himself open to a throw)?</p>
<p>Also, some of these setups are different depending on whether the opponent quick rises or not. Will I be able to tell ahead of time if he is quick rising, or I need to decide which setup to use on reaction (i.e. if I see him rising quickly, I switch to the quick rise setup)?</p>
<p>Sorry if noob questions!</p>

<p>This thread is great because I knew nothing about this guy except the positives spreading on social media, and now I know he&rsquo;s anti-RH, strongly religious, etc</p>
<p>How about we have similar threads for each of the other 50 senatoriables? Some of them are hard to find info on</p>

<p>No, it is not inappropriate. It&rsquo;s your LinkedIn, you can do whatever you want.</p>
<p>Mine has a statement that any recruiters who want to connect with me must include the word PINEAPPLE (all caps) in their invite. No one has ever complied haha</p>

<p>Anonimized to protect the guilty lol</p>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;We should vote for candidate A, his platform promises X, Y and Z!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Have you listened to the speech by candidate B?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just empty promises!&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;Candidate A said [something stupid]&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Ungas talaga yang si candidate A, ang kapal ng mukha! Bakit ba may boboto jan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;Candidate B said [some other stupid thing]&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Wala namang perpektong kandidato&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;People say candidate A is involved in [something illegal]&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Grabe talaga si candidate A! Dapat ikulong na yan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;People also say candidate B is involved in [something else also illegal]&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Wala naman silang ebidensya, bakit nde sya kasuhan sa korte!&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;May nagkakalat na maling kwento tungkol kay candidate B mula sa supporter ni candidate A!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Kagagawan yan malamang ni candidate A!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;May nagkakalat na maling kwento tungkol kay candidate A mula sa supporter ni candidate B!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Aba, hindi siguro tunay na candidate B supporter yan, malamang binayaran lang ni candidate A para magmukha kaming masama!&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;Inendorse daw ni Celebrity X si candidate B!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Idol ko talaga yang si Celebrity X! May integridad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;Inendorse daw ni Celebrity Y si candidate A!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Grabe, idol ko pa naman yang si celebrity Y, mukhang nabayaran!&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Comment if you have your own examples :p</p>
<p>Edit: Most of these are from FB btw. I&rsquo;ve found that this sub is slightly more rational compared to FB threads when it comes to politics discussion (although meron pa din trolls)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d do more of these trials if I could wait for fight requests while doing them</p>
<p>Does finishing them unlock something? Fight Money, or characters gain EXP or Titles?</p>
