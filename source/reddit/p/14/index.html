<div class="content e-content">

<p>I understand the theory behind it, and will try these things to practice my own meaty setups, but one of my concerns right now when playing ranked (I&rsquo;m only in Super Bronze so I&rsquo;m not particularly good) is that against higher-ranked players, I often find myself helpless on waking up because of meaty attacks in particular. So I&rsquo;m a bit more interested in what one can do when the opponent knows these setups inside and out. Do I just try to predict whether he is going for the meaty and block then punish?</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>If it&rsquo;s a meaty attack, does that mean any wakeup by the opponent will get snuffed? The opponent must block to avoid getting hit (leaving himself open to a throw)?</p>
<p>Also, some of these setups are different depending on whether the opponent quick rises or not. Will I be able to tell ahead of time if he is quick rising, or I need to decide which setup to use on reaction (i.e. if I see him rising quickly, I switch to the quick rise setup)?</p>
<p>Sorry if noob questions!</p>

<p>This thread is great because I knew nothing about this guy except the positives spreading on social media, and now I know he&rsquo;s anti-RH, strongly religious, etc</p>
<p>How about we have similar threads for each of the other 50 senatoriables? Some of them are hard to find info on</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>No, it is not inappropriate. It&rsquo;s your LinkedIn, you can do whatever you want.</p>
<p>Mine has a statement that any recruiters who want to connect with me must include the word PINEAPPLE (all caps) in their invite. No one has ever complied haha</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing too expensive there. Signal Pest is the only card in that list still being played competitively. Splinter Twin used to be a big deal until it got banned a few months ago. You can check the dollar price of the cards on tcgplayer.com</p>
<p>Edit: I would guess maybe P400-500 at best.</p>
