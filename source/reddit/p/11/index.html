<div class="content e-content">

<p>The answer will be different for each person. Starting a business is more stressful and has a lot of risks but is potentially more rewarding. Taking a regular job is &ldquo;safer&rdquo; in the traditional sense, the risk here is mostly of possible future regret - in the future you may wish you had tried out riskier things when you were young.</p>
<p>There are people who will argue that having a job is still a risk since you are dependent on the competence and good will of other people to earn a living, that your safe job may not actually be as safe as you imagine since you could get fired or the company could go under at any time. But truthfully, you run the same risks when running a business, except that you do more of the work yourself, so whether you are able to overcome those risks or not is more dependent on your own effort.</p>

<p>It means what the reminder text says. You can choose to cast Murderous Cut for a reduced cost (as little as one black mana!) by exiling cards from your graveyard. Each card you exile reduces the cost by (1)</p>
<p>Some decks will use the graveyard as a resource, so they will have cards that allow you to move cards directly from your own library to graveyard (often called &ldquo;milling&rdquo;). The idea is to win before running out of cards in the library, taking advantages of the additional bonuses provided by having more cards in the graveyard (for Murderous Cut, the bonus is having the choice to play it at a lower cost)</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Obviously this practice is deplorable. But just curious, where do we draw the line on asset flips. If someone takes these &ldquo;starter kits&rdquo; and reuses the assets but puts in some amount of work: maybe new story or mechanics, but basically still reusing the art and other assets, would that be acceptable?</p>

<p>As long as you&rsquo;re not in a hotspot area (the Comelec takes over such areas), it should be fine. Traffic will probably be weekend-bad in Metro Manila.</p>

<p>Polls open in 3 hours. I find myself unable to sleep.</p>
<p>The past few days I&rsquo;ve toned my social media posts and tried to tell myself that I can live with whoever the public decides to elect. That I will think positively, and support him when he does well, and call him out when he does not. But now I find my guts feel sick when I think about who the public is likely to elect.</p>
<p>The man stands for violence and authoritarianism. Not only is change coming, change is already here. The campaign period has changed our country, and the change is for the worse. His supporters openly and proudly threaten violence against anyone who disagrees with their opinion. There are even reports of others being threatened or harassed in real life simply for harassing other candidates. They either knowingly spread misinformation and half-truths, or can&rsquo;t be bothered to verify the information they&rsquo;re spreading. Forget about being a good example for kids, he&rsquo;s not even a good example for adults.</p>
<p>I know I shouldn&rsquo;t judge other people for the choices they make, but I can&rsquo;t help but be disappointed when people I know come out in support for the man, people who I believe should know better, who should hold better values. I don&rsquo;t understand how they could justify supporting him in spite of his violent rhetoric and the significantly good chance that he&rsquo;s a murderer. It changes how I see these people</p>
<p>I would like to remain hopeful. I would like to hope that one of the other candidates manages some sort of miracle (hopefully of the legal kind) and overcomes the odds. Barring that, I would like to hope that I am wrong about him and that the worst-case scenario does not come to pass. I would like to hope that he would not push our society further in the direction of violence and authoritarianism. I would like to hope that the supporters do not become even more insufferable in the wake of victory. I would like to hope that we can move past the level of vitriol and toxicity throughout this campaign peri</p>

<p>So I have the option of assembling either jeskai control or grixis control. What are the differences to consider? Do they have different bad matchups? I like having lightning helix to help stabilize vs burn but I&rsquo;m not sure if jeskai is better positioned than grixis atm</p>

<p>Some stuff:</p>
<p>Spidey was great, but TBH it felt a bit random that Tony went back to the US to recruit a kid (he was that desperate?) AND make him a new suit when he only had 36 hours to catch Cap and friends. At least Cap got Hawkeye to do his stateside work, so their flight was only one way :p I feel like they probably had to work the Spidey part into the script after the deal with Sony.</p>
<p>I had known there would be a Giant Man appearance since there was a lego set that spoiled it, but luckily I completely forgot about it and only remembered when Scott said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only tried this once in a lab and it almost tore me apart!&rdquo; Fun moment</p>
<p>When Zemo shows the three guys the video of Bucky taking out Howard and wife, Tony asks Steve &ldquo;Did you know?&rdquo; and Steve replies, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it was him&rdquo;. What exactly did Steve know? Did he know that Howard and wife were assassinated, but did not know that Bucky was the assassin? If so, how does he know that? These events happened while he was in the ice. My brother thought it meant that Steve knew that Bucky assassinated someone (since Bucky told him about the incident he discussed with Zemo during the blackout), but that Steve did not know it was Howard. But then it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to reply to Tony that way?</p>
<p>Random: the endings for both Civil War and BvS were both about someone&rsquo;s mother. Okay, not really haha</p>
<p>The Raft: Didn&rsquo;t they also have a Raft in Agents of SHIELD? Then again, the movie guys probably don&rsquo;t care about that show anymore&hellip;</p>
<p>During the airport fight sequence, I was expecting someone to switch sides at some point and thought it would be Spidey (since you know, Civil War), but happy to be surprised it was Natasha.</p>
<p>Some minor airport fight nitpicks: after they square off in the middle of the airport they break off into pairs but Vision is conspicuously absent. I don&rsquo;t think he does anything significant until Giant-Man, which is weird given he&rsquo;s the most powerful guy there. Also, at some point Falcon and Bucky ge</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m 37, thanks for saying na bata pa ako.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re saying is that it takes more than 3 terms to make things better in the long term right? Kung magsalita kasi si Mayor parang isang pitik nya lang maayos na lahat e. In 3-6 months nga mawawala na ang krimen. Pagkahalal nga nya kakausapin nya lang ang senado&rsquo;t kongreso ng kung anong gusto nyang batas, in one week meron na agad</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a testament to how poor his management of Davao City actually was that he goes away for 3 years and things go to shit. Good management means things get better regardless of who is in power, which means strengthening institutions. If Davao City goes to shit whenever he&rsquo;s not mayor, what happens to Davao City when he dies?</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s one of those guys who works hard but isn&rsquo;t too noisy, so people don&rsquo;t really have strong opinions about him either way.</p>
<p>He only really got involved in government service in the 90s, before that it was mostly business.</p>
<p>His martial law experience (from wikipedia):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a son of Marcos&rsquo; political rival, Osmeña was imprisoned in 1972. In November 1974, he embarked on a hunger strike along with his cellmate &ndash; ABS-CBN&rsquo;s Eugenio &ldquo;Geny&rdquo; Lopez, Jr. &ndash; to protest the unjust detention of thousands of innocent Filipinos. This resulted in the release of 1,022 political prisoners in December 1974. Defiant to the very end, Osmeña and Lopez escaped from their maximum security prison cell in Fort Bonifacio in 1977. This exploit was enacted in the 1995 movie, Eskapo.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>This was for the Dacer-Corbito double murder case. He was cleared of it by the SC in 2011 so he was able to return home.</p>
<p>However, I think it speaks a bit ill of him that he chose to evade the law until he was cleared. (I guess some would say it&rsquo;s justifiable given our justice system, but as a lawmaker and police officer maybe he should be one of the first to abide by the rules)</p>
