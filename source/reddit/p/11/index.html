<div class="content e-content">

<p>Obviously this practice is deplorable. But just curious, where do we draw the line on asset flips. If someone takes these &ldquo;starter kits&rdquo; and reuses the assets but puts in some amount of work: maybe new story or mechanics, but basically still reusing the art and other assets, would that be acceptable?</p>

<p>Polls open in 3 hours. I find myself unable to sleep.</p>
<p>The past few days I&rsquo;ve toned my social media posts and tried to tell myself that I can live with whoever the public decides to elect. That I will think positively, and support him when he does well, and call him out when he does not. But now I find my guts feel sick when I think about who the public is likely to elect.</p>
<p>The man stands for violence and authoritarianism. Not only is change coming, change is already here. The campaign period has changed our country, and the change is for the worse. His supporters openly and proudly threaten violence against anyone who disagrees with their opinion. There are even reports of others being threatened or harassed in real life simply for harassing other candidates. They either knowingly spread misinformation and half-truths, or can&rsquo;t be bothered to verify the information they&rsquo;re spreading. Forget about being a good example for kids, he&rsquo;s not even a good example for adults.</p>
<p>I know I shouldn&rsquo;t judge other people for the choices they make, but I can&rsquo;t help but be disappointed when people I know come out in support for the man, people who I believe should know better, who should hold better values. I don&rsquo;t understand how they could justify supporting him in spite of his violent rhetoric and the significantly good chance that he&rsquo;s a murderer. It changes how I see these people</p>
<p>I would like to remain hopeful. I would like to hope that one of the other candidates manages some sort of miracle (hopefully of the legal kind) and overcomes the odds. Barring that, I would like to hope that I am wrong about him and that the worst-case scenario does not come to pass. I would like to hope that he would not push our society further in the direction of violence and authoritarianism. I would like to hope that the supporters do not become even more insufferable in the wake of victory. I would like to hope that we can move past the level of vitriol and toxicity throughout this campaign peri</p>

<p>So I have the option of assembling either jeskai control or grixis control. What are the differences to consider? Do they have different bad matchups? I like having lightning helix to help stabilize vs burn but I&rsquo;m not sure if jeskai is better positioned than grixis atm</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to try to change your minds, but which of the following views do you hold (EJK = extra judicial killings):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I think there are no EJKs in Davao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think there are EJKs in Davao, but the authorities/the mayor are not involved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think that those allegedly killed by EJKs were killed by authorities in legitimate operations or self-defense</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think there are EJKs in Davao, and the authorities are involved, but it&rsquo;s okay because:
a. They&rsquo;re criminals and they deserve it
b. Going through the judicial system takes too long
c. Hindi naman ako affected
d. It is an acceptable price to pay for peace and order/progress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit: I don&rsquo;t want to think about it kasi wala naman akong first-hand info</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something else (feel free to explain)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are uncomfortable giving your answer in public, feel free to PM me</p>

<p>Some stuff:</p>
<p>Spidey was great, but TBH it felt a bit random that Tony went back to the US to recruit a kid (he was that desperate?) AND make him a new suit when he only had 36 hours to catch Cap and friends. At least Cap got Hawkeye to do his stateside work, so their flight was only one way :p I feel like they probably had to work the Spidey part into the script after the deal with Sony.</p>
<p>I had known there would be a Giant Man appearance since there was a lego set that spoiled it, but luckily I completely forgot about it and only remembered when Scott said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only tried this once in a lab and it almost tore me apart!&rdquo; Fun moment</p>
<p>When Zemo shows the three guys the video of Bucky taking out Howard and wife, Tony asks Steve &ldquo;Did you know?&rdquo; and Steve replies, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it was him&rdquo;. What exactly did Steve know? Did he know that Howard and wife were assassinated, but did not know that Bucky was the assassin? If so, how does he know that? These events happened while he was in the ice. My brother thought it meant that Steve knew that Bucky assassinated someone (since Bucky told him about the incident he discussed with Zemo during the blackout), but that Steve did not know it was Howard. But then it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to reply to Tony that way?</p>
<p>Random: the endings for both Civil War and BvS were both about someone&rsquo;s mother. Okay, not really haha</p>
<p>The Raft: Didn&rsquo;t they also have a Raft in Agents of SHIELD? Then again, the movie guys probably don&rsquo;t care about that show anymore&hellip;</p>
<p>During the airport fight sequence, I was expecting someone to switch sides at some point and thought it would be Spidey (since you know, Civil War), but happy to be surprised it was Natasha.</p>
<p>Some minor airport fight nitpicks: after they square off in the middle of the airport they break off into pairs but Vision is conspicuously absent. I don&rsquo;t think he does anything significant until Giant-Man, which is weird given he&rsquo;s the most powerful guy there. Also, at some point Falcon and Bucky ge</p>

<p>Legit (mostly). The thing is, there are 5 candidates running and no one has majority support, but it&rsquo;s first-past-the-post so there&rsquo;s a good chance of Duterte winning with around 30% of the vote</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m 37, thanks for saying na bata pa ako.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re saying is that it takes more than 3 terms to make things better in the long term right? Kung magsalita kasi si Mayor parang isang pitik nya lang maayos na lahat e. In 3-6 months nga mawawala na ang krimen. Pagkahalal nga nya kakausapin nya lang ang senado&rsquo;t kongreso ng kung anong gusto nyang batas, in one week meron na agad</p>

<p>Pakisabi na lang yan kay mayor</p>

His son Paolo is the Vice Mayor. And his daughter in law is city councilor. Why do people think he is the CHANGE candidate?&#39; on /r/Philippines</a>:

<div class="content e-content">

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a testament to how poor his management of Davao City actually was that he goes away for 3 years and things go to shit. Good management means things get better regardless of who is in power, which means strengthening institutions. If Davao City goes to shit whenever he&rsquo;s not mayor, what happens to Davao City when he dies?</p>
