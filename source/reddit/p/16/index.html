<p>The country&rsquo;s name in the local language is &ldquo;Pilipinas&rdquo;. The citizens are &ldquo;Pilipinos&rdquo;</p>
<p>The national language is called &ldquo;Filipino&rdquo; (in English) and &ldquo;Pilipino&rdquo; (in Filipino).</p>
<p>It used to be that the official Filipino alphabet did not include the letter F. This is no longer the case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipino_alphabet">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipino_alphabet</a></p>
<p>Also, in English, the correct adjective to use is &ldquo;Philippine&rdquo;, i.e. the Philippine population.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>They don&rsquo;t feel out of vogue. Off the top of my head, turn-based games I played within the last year: Persona Q, Disgaea 4, Divinity:OS. Bravely Default, Fire Emblem: Awakening, X-Com, Civ 5 (okay, I play Civ every year). I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s more I&rsquo;m forgetting.</p>
<p>Edit: I also played Banner Saga and Shadowrun Returns Dragonfall, thanks to the replies for reminding me</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t need further convincing on his platforms. Most are ok, some might not scale or be practical on a nationwide level but are worth a try.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not going to vote for him unless he categorically states he has never been involved in nor does he condone any illegal killings and will bring such perpetrators/vigilantes to justice</p>

<p>I have both Smash for WiiU and 3ds but I find it difficult to get into it (even though I like the characters and stages and stuff) because It&rsquo;s so different from the fighting games I usually play. I&rsquo;m not a competitive Street Fighter player or anything (poor on execution) but I do enjoy playing that style of game. It&rsquo;s not that I want to get competitive with Smash, but I&rsquo;d like a fairly decent chance when I play online</p>
<p>One thing that gets me a lot is that there&rsquo;s a difference in input when I slightly tilt the stick or flick it quickly, In the heat of battle I never seem to get the right one to come out</p>
<p>Another thing is that it&rsquo;s easy for me to get confused when there&rsquo;s so much stuff happening on the screen - it&rsquo;s hard to keep track of everything. I did manage to win an 8-man smash once, but that was with friends who don&rsquo;t really game that often :)</p>
<p>Any tips?</p>

Or anyone here from Cebu Pacific?</a></h4>
<p>I have an international Cebu Pacific flight out of NAIA early morning on Nov 20 (4:50am). I&rsquo;m from QC and plan to leave for the airport around 12mn-1am. I&rsquo;ve just done the web check-in. My flight is <em>not</em> on Cebu Pacific&rsquo;s list of cancelled flights found here: <a href="https://www.cebupacificair.com/Pages/travel-advisory.aspx?id=110">https://www.cebupacificair.com/Pages/travel-advisory.aspx?id=110</a></p>
<p>Does anybody know:</p>
<ul>
<li>if there&rsquo;s any chance that my flight could still be affected despite not being on the list above? There&rsquo;s supposedly a no-fly zone, but I couldn&rsquo;t find any information on whether that&rsquo;s applicable 24 hours or what.</li>
<li>if I&rsquo;ll even be able to make it to the airport? There&rsquo;s some road closures on Airport Road I think? I&rsquo;m not sure how my taxi would be able to get into NAIA T3.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried calling the Cebu Pacific hotline to ask, but it seems their call center is always busy and I just end up spending a lot of time on hold. If anyone else here is successfully able to fly out of NAIA during the APEC days, that would help assuage my worry :p</p>

<p>Trying to decide between splurging on a GTX970 or just settling for a GTX750Ti for now and possibly upgrading in the future. I&rsquo;m not one of those guys who plans to play at really high resolutions or need to have ultra settings all the time, so I&rsquo;m not sure if the high end one will be worth it. Thoughts?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Because I can afford to pay other people to do it? I&rsquo;ve already assembled enough desktops when I was young and had a lot of free time. It&rsquo;s an easy waste of half a manday, maybe more if you make mistakes. If you have it assembled right there in the shop they&rsquo;ll spot any problems right away and you can replace any problematic parts immediately</p>

<p>I have been playing Shadownrun Dragonfall DC on a laptop I borrowed, with Steam cloud synchronization enabled. But now I have to give back the laptop and haven&rsquo;t finished it yet. If I uninstall Steam from this laptop (and all the games of course) then go back to my desktop which doesn&rsquo;t have have Shadowrun Dragonfall DC installed yet and install it there, will it get the saves I had from the laptop?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been travelling for a few months and have been playing Civ V on my laptop where I already sunk 300+hours into my desktop back home. Will any mines I built/forests I chopped/etc count towards my totals back home?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Answers to common responses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bongbong isn&rsquo;t his father</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but he and his family refuse to acknowledge the sins of his father and refuse to return the money they stole</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Move on na from martial law</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can move on once the Marcoses atone and give reparations</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re free to vote someone else for VP</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The choice of Marcos and the political compromise by itself speak towards Miriam&rsquo;s character. What compromises will she make if she gets elected?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a strategic/political choice to increase the chance to win</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ends don&rsquo;t justify the means. And I think the pro-Marcos crowd vastly overestimates their numbers. I think strategically this is a net negative</p>

<p>I am looking for a platformer with the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>preferably 2D</li>
<li>focus on exploration and collecting hidden items, instead of on difficult platforming (i.e. not Super Meat Boy)</li>
<li>with achievements</li>
<li>on Steam, PS3, PS4 or Vita</li>

<p>I&rsquo;m in the UK for a few months so I thought I&rsquo;d try Netflix, which we don&rsquo;t have where I live. I created a UK apple account so that I could download Netflix from the app store, but apparently I must enter payment info first and of course I don&rsquo;t have a UK credit card to use.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have access to a PC during the trip so I can&rsquo;t do anything that requires the use of anything other than my iPad. Am I shit out of luck?</p>
<p>Edit: After a chat with apple support, I was able to create a new account with no payment details, as explained by /u/anchorboi</p>

<p>Erase works as well as Revoke against Ensoul, I think the only problem is that Erase doesnt hit hangarback.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m leaning towards Revoke since it hits more things, but the sorcery-ness worries me&hellip;</p>

<p>Something I originally shared over Twitter/FB:</p>
<p>Any friends here who are graphic designers and are anti-Binay? Just an idea: instead of just of sharing stuff on social media, how about someone designs an easy to print flyer with quick bullet points that are easy to understand why he should not be supported? Then any of us anti-Binay middle class folks can print a few copies and give them to drivers or vendors or whatever other common people we encounter, or leave them behind in buses or carinderias. The flyers can have English and Tagalog versions, and we can leave copies somewhere on the internet (the flyer itself can have the link) and also encourage other people to design and distribute their own flyers</p>
<p>Some bullet points I would include are:</p>
<ul>
<li>supports political dynasties</li>
<li>wants to get rid of term limits</li>
<li>thinks he shouldnt be held liable for contracts he signs off on</li>
<li>encourages his supporters to defy the law (re: suspension of junjun)</li>
<li>wants us to give up our claim vs China
etc</li>
</ul>
<p>maybe other people can suggest things that would have more impact on the masses. I would avoid anything outright libelous though (all of my examples above are from known articles)</p>
<p>Sharing stuff on social media is easy, and it&rsquo;s great, but we really only reach the people who are already smart enough to be against Binay. The aim of this idea is to get a grassroots-type thing going that can reach even common people. What do you think? Is it doable? Is it a terrible idea?</p>
<p>Share if you think it&rsquo;s a good idea</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the point of the post! :D</p>
<p>To ask the online crowd to come up with materials that we can print out and try to distribute to locations where people who aren&rsquo;t online can have access to them and get more information about why they shouldn&rsquo;t vote for Binay</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>If there is a more appropriate subreddit for this, feel free to advise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m travelling for work and will be in London for a few months. I get to play in a GP while I&rsquo;m here, yay!</p>
<p>However, i need a few more cards to fill out my standard deck. Can some kind London MTG&rsquo;er tell me where is a good place to buy singles? Either a brick and mortar store or a good online place that can deliver within London.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in East London near Stratford, if that matters. Thanks!</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I understand where you&rsquo;re coming from, but to claim that Marvel doesn&rsquo;t make new heroes is maybe just a little bit disingenuous.</p>
<p>Characters on these covers that were introduced since the year 2000:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>America Chavez (2011)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Silk (2014)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spider-Gwen (2014)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fantomex (2002)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hulkling (2005)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wiccan (2005)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agent Coulson (2008)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nico Minoru (2003)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kamala Khan (Ms Marvel) (2013)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Half the people on the Web Warriors cover</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not counting Miles since you don&rsquo;t seem to like that he&rsquo;s also &ldquo;Spider-Man&rdquo; even though that shouldn&rsquo;t really matter. There&rsquo;s also two people I don&rsquo;t recognize on the Uncanny Inhumans cover, IDK if they&rsquo;re new.</p>

<p>I think the whole point of the new series and renumbering is that they&rsquo;d be good jumping-on points</p>
