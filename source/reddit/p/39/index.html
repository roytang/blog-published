<p>Currently my savings are mostly in fixed-interest time deposits (low interest rates around here though) and in personal loans to well-trusted people who repay me on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I would like to branch out my investments to stuff like mutual funds or whatever, but I am a bit ignorant on these matters. I&rsquo;m just looking for more growth opportunities since some people have told me that I should be growing my money more. Because I&rsquo;m ignorant, I&rsquo;m a bit risk-averse, especially with stuff like the stock markets that seem so swingy to me. Any advice on where to start or what stuff I should read first?</p>
<p>Note: I am not an American!</p>

<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t be petty to complain. You&rsquo;ve worked with these people for 3 years, and typically in a startup you&rsquo;re a small tight-knit group; why aren&rsquo;t you comfortable enough with them to confide your concerns?</p>

<p>If you feel like you have too much money, the reasonable options are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Save it for a rainy day (or invest to make it grow)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help out someone else in need, especially those who might not have everything during the holday season.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That being said, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind being gifted a copy of Fallout: New Vegas on Steam :D</p>

<p>I love playing sealed, but to be honest if you want to be finishing competitively you pretty much have to try to play perfectly and build your sealed pool perfectly. There are so many things outside your control (sealed pool, pairings, luck of the draw) that you have to maximize the things you do have control over. I usually assume I&rsquo;m going to lose at least one match to mana screw, so the rest of the games I have to play perfectly since x-2 will usually not top8</p>
<p>It is also easy to look at the players at the top table and just assume they were so lucky with what they got with their sealed pools, but the truth is there are equally as many people with awesome sealed pools who fall to imperfect builds or plays.</p>

<p>Apparently I am already qualified to get something called a Bounty Hat, but I do not have Team Fortress 2. I would like to see what the fuss is about and why there are hats, so if anyone could spare the cash to gift me TF2, it would be great! My steam id is same as my reddit username :D</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using my iPad for a bit more than a month now, and I&rsquo;m mostly satisfied. I use it for browsing, social networking, ebook reading and s few games. Several people are telling me however that I&rsquo;m not getting the most out of the device uless I jailbreak it. How true is this, especially for an engineer type who likes to tinker with stuff? Are there any risks or disadvantages to jail breaking? Will I lose my warranty?</p>

<p>Basically, I just installed iTunes on this machine (had to reformat/reinstall the PC), and downloaded a few apps (using the same iTunes account as the one on my iPad). But when I try to sync the apps with the iPad, iTunes seems to want to delete all the other apps on the iPad. How do I &ldquo;merge&rdquo; the libraries?</p>

<p>So, I have a non-US billing address so I don&rsquo;t have access to the US app store. Can I create an account for the US app store, then download an app from there and put it on my iPad, together with apps from my main account?</p>
<p>Sorry for being noobish, I&rsquo;m new to this Apple thing. :D</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions!</p>
<p>The iPad was purchased for me by a friend, so I did not have any choice with the model. I don&rsquo;t have Wifi ubiquitously where I am, so the 3G is cool with me anyways. :D</p>

<p>In real life, you cannot ask infinite numbers of soldiers or tanks or whatever to occupy the a finite area.</p>
<p>A single unit in civ represents just enough numbers of that unit that can fully occupy whatever amount of area a single hex represents.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Your old cards might still be relevant in Eternal formats called Vintage and Legacy. These are formats that allow cards from any period of MTG, with some exceptions.</p>
<p>Do you prefer playing online or IRL? If you collect cards on Magic Online, they can be &ldquo;redeemed&rdquo; in full sets, i.e. if you have one of each card from the set Zendikar on Magic Online, they can be redeemed for one of each Zendikar card IRL. However, redemptions are not always available, it depends on whether they have paper cards in stock to redeem the online cards. I have personally never redeemed MtgO cards.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a lot of resources (i.e., don&rsquo;t have a lot of money) and want to play IRL, I suggest you look for a group of friends that you can play with casually at first. Depending on your experiences with them you may be able to transition into more serious play by borrowing cards, etc.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re welcome. I think it&rsquo;s happened to me twice now that I got free wins at a prerelease due to my opponent using the promo card.</p>
<p>Actually, if you get a non-promo Wurmcoil Engine, you should almost certainly play it, no matter what deck you have. :D</p>

<p>When you get your promotional prerelease card (Wurmcoil Engine) do NOT include it in your deck, you will get a game loss for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine if you play a non-promo Wurmcoil Engine from your sealed pool.</p>

<p>Are these as good as the first two Monkey Island games? I enjoyed them as a kid but haven&rsquo;t played the newer ones.</p>
<p>Also, is Telltale Games ok? Do they work like Steam?</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>It is not like Age of Empires, the gameplay is turn-based instead of real-time, and much more massive scale.</p>
<p>Reading through the manual might help you decide whether to buy or not. Or maybe look for videos of Civ 4 gameplay (I remember seeing some introductory videos to Civ 4 on youtube) to get an idea of what a Civ game is like.</p>

<p>I live in a country where criminal defendants often retract confessions saying they were tortured or coerced into making those confessions. So I was thinking: why not require that the suspect have a lawyer present during any police interrogation, otherwise any statements made during such interrogation would not be admissible in court?</p>
<p>I remember there was an online video being passed around where even if you were innocent you should not talk to the police; if this view is recognized and the general consensus is that you should never talk to the police without a lawyer anyway, why not formalize it so that ignorant people are automatically protected and police are not tempted to coerce confessions out of suspects?</p>
