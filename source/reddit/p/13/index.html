<p>BTW thank you for your responses. I understand you aren&rsquo;t a high-ranking member or anything and I fundamentally disagree about socialism, but still the perspective is educational.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<blockquote>
<p>Tanggalin ang LAPIDA or Liberalization, Privitization, and Deregulation of social services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which social services are currently in the most need of these changes? Isn&rsquo;t it a problem that the government has insufficient resources to provide social services which is why some need to be augmented by the private sector? Also, how does that acronym even make sense</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mass-oriented, nationalist, and scientific education system</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What exactly does mass-oriented mean here? Does nationalist mean dapat may communist propaganda sa curriculum?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Address the landlessness of many farmers by enacting GARB or Genuine Agrarian Reform</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t the movement have lawmaker allies? Have they introduced any legislation towards this end?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pantay na karapatan sa mga kababaihan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which rights specifically are a problem right now? I understand that society still doesn&rsquo;t treat women equally, but that seems to me to be primarily a cultural problem and not of policy. I mean, in terms of policy I believe women already basically share the same rights as men in this country (suffrage, etc). There are probably still some outliers, but maybe not being a woman I&rsquo;m not aware</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More investments ng gobyerno sa scientific sector</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this something the movement is a strong advocate of? I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever heard of NPA spokespersons discussing this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So far yan lang ang nakikita ko.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are your personal suggestions right? Is there nothing like a central leadership that establishes such policies? Like some sort of quarterly announcement &ldquo;Guys, eto yung mga gusto natin mangyari ok?&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the socialist revolution, which comes after enacting genuine national democracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What exactly does that mean? No propaganda BS. Like if someone came up to your leadership and said, sige ano yung top 10 action items na kelangan gawin para matapos na ito?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The business investments themselves are taking advantage of the workforce surplus in an impoverished setting through cheap labor. Papasok diyan yung &ldquo;at least [insert statement here]. We should not settle for less. As Filipino citizens, we should be entitled to the same rights and opportunities, regardless of socio-economic status.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, what exactly does that mean? What exactly should a business be doing to not be victimized by the NPA? If ako business owner ako, and I want to bring jobs to the people, why should I bother going to regions where there is a strong NPA presence?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That I don&rsquo;t know. Sa unit ko, walang ganyan. Cliche na pero, each unit in different areas operate independently from one another, so kung majajustify nila yun, sila na yun.</p>

<p>What exactly is the endgame of your movement? What are the conditions where you get to say &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, we did it guys, quitting time&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think NPA activities in the poorest provinces act as a hindrance to business investment and development in those regions?</p>
<p>How does bombing cell sites and power plants (thus depriving the area of infrastructure) help improve the lives of the people?</p>

<h4 id="posted-on-randroidquestions-problems-with-asus-memopad-7httpsredditcomrandroidquestionscomments4bh3waproblems_with_asus_memopad_7">Posted on r/AndroidQuestions: <a href="https://reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/4bh3wa/problems_with_asus_memopad_7/">Problems with ASUS Memopad 7</a></h4>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>So my mom has been using an ASUS Memopad 7 for a while now, and she&rsquo;s been having some trouble with it lately. Namely, many of the apps are now basically unusable and almost always crash with &ldquo;Unfortunately, [app] has stopped&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve tried checking it before but couldn&rsquo;t find any obvious problems (like lack of disk space, etc). I also tried installing an app to check the system logs (I believe it was named CatLog) but couldn&rsquo;t find anything relevant.</p>
<p>During the past couple of days, the problem became significantly worse. The tablet would always pop an alert &ldquo;Unfortunately, Contacts has stopped&rdquo;, and after you dismiss it with [OK], the alert pops up again, repeat ad infinitum. The tablet is practically unusable now.</p>
<p>Complicating things is that it&rsquo;s difficult to get the thing to even boot. If I restart it, it loads into a black screen with the Asus logo and a spinning loading icon and stays there forever. Image for reference: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/NBhvZ2T.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/NBhvZ2T.jpg</a>. My mom says she can get it to boot sometimes but only after restarting several times (I don&rsquo;t have the patience for it, I&rsquo;ve never gotten it to boot)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already managed to back up her relevant data, so I suggested that I do a factory reset. So I hold Power and Volume Up during startup and boot into the following menu: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Anb5Kjl.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/Anb5Kjl.jpg</a> There&rsquo;s an error message there, IDK if it&rsquo;s relevant.</p>
<p>From the Droidboot Menu, I choose &ldquo;Recovery&rdquo; and it reboots again. This time it boots into a screen with a dead Android mascot and the text &ldquo;No command&rdquo;. Here&rsquo;s a shitty cameraphone image for reference: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/QgOvHkm.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/QgOvHkm.jpg</a> At this point, I&rsquo;m not sure how to proceed. The Volume buttons are unresponsive. Tapping Power does nothing. If I leave it in this state for a while, it proceeds to try to boot and gets stuck again at the loading icon I showed in the first image.</p>
<p>Any advice as to how I can get this tablet back into a usable state?</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean to imply that they are good candidates (I agree my wording was poor here, IDK about Sanders, but Trump certainly isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;good&rdquo; candidate), but rather that they are taking advantage of a subset of voters that is known to be previously not participating in the elections by offering something significantly different from the establishment candidates.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re ignoring the fact that this election is not just about the president.</p>

<p>Er, didn&rsquo;t I say that even if abstaining for president you should consider voting for VP and senators?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While I personally don&rsquo;t have a problem with people not voting for a president, the least evil argument is pretty valid here. Heck, look at the anti-Binay sentiments you see all over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to vote for someone just so Binay doesn&rsquo;t win, that&rsquo;s fine. But the last time people voted for a candidate just so the supposed terrible candidate would not win, we got GMA as president, so there&rsquo;s that to consider. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m considering as well</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I think the mandate by which the president wins matters, which means abstention matters, since it informs the strength of the president&rsquo;s mandate.</p>
<p>One of the reasons PNoy was able to push through many of his initiatives early on during the presidency was that he was elected with a relatively strong 42% mandate. A president elected with a relatively weaker mandate (say, 25-30%) will have a much tougher time with controversial issues and will be facing a much more independent senate (many of whom will be elected by more voters than the president)</p>
<p>The strength of the mandate even affects those who don&rsquo;t win - Erap placed second in 2010 showing himself to still be a strong political force which leads to his still being influential today</p>
<p>The comparison to the US low voter turnout is interesting, since the voter turnout for their primaries this year is significantly higher compared to 2012 mainly because both parties have significant anti-establishment candidates (Sanders for the Dems, Trump for the Reps) which would lead one to believe that their historically low voter turnout is precisely due to a lack of good candidates, an opportunity which Sanders and Trump can potentially take advantage of. That is the same message that a significantly large abstention (although unlikely) could send - not saying it will, but it&rsquo;s a possibility.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying abstention is some magic thing that will send a message (although it&rsquo;s a possibility if enough people do so), but that people shouldn&rsquo;t be ashamed to abstain if they don&rsquo;t find the options palatable. Even if your reason is something as simple as &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t decide&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s fine, your abstention still has meaning since it indicates that you consider none of the candidates outstanding enough to support</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>If you feel that there is a candidate worthy of your support, go ahead and vote for him/her. I encourage you to do so. I&rsquo;m not saying people should abstain, I&rsquo;m saying people can. It&rsquo;s a valid choice and every voter has the right to withhold his vote if he so chooses. There&rsquo;s no need to downvote if you disagree</p>
<p>I understand that we would prefer high voter turnout so that the will of the people is more accurately reflected, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we should lower our standards and just vote anyone into power. If there were 5 Binays running for president, choosing one at random is the same as not voting.</p>
<p>Even choosing a &ldquo;least evil&rdquo; candidate is still a choice and can be spun into support. If you decide to vote for say, Mar Roxas because you consider him the least evil choice, if Mar Roxas wins with like 30% of the vote (unlikely at this point, but whatever), he&rsquo;s going to be able to point to that and say, &ldquo;this is my voter base, these people support me. If you are against me, you disenfranchise them&rdquo;. You will be tacitly endorsing his incompetence and saying you&rsquo;re fine with that, it&rsquo;s acceptable for you. (Not dissing on Roxas in particular, I can make an example of any of the other candidates). If that&rsquo;s not something you want to be part of, you shouldn&rsquo;t be forced to.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I have a number of otherwise intelligent friends who often post things in favor of certain candidates that are obviously biased. And if you call them out on their bias they will just be all defensive and ask if you have a better idea, etc.</p>
<p>Like literally, one of my friends posted something along the lines of:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Candidate A - lists negative points; Candidate B - lists negative points; Candidate C - lists positive points. Easy decision right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not even pretending to be fair or anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s normal to be turned off by such things, especially for people who are truly undecided and trying to weigh pros and cons of the candidates. I try to stay informed and read everything even the biased ones post, but I tend to give more weight to those who I know to be undecided and are trying to be objective.</p>
<p>I have to agree that none of the presidential candidates look good enough (at the moment, at least), and I wouldn&rsquo;t object to abstaining the presidential slot. Abstaining is a vote too, in and of itself.</p>
<p>Edit: If you also find that none of the candidates meet your standards and are considering abstaining, you might want to read this: <a href="http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/abstain4president2016/">http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/abstain4president2016/</a></p>
<p>But at the very least consider voting for the other positions. There is (in my opinion) at least one worthy candidate in the VP slot, and your vote could help some of the more worthy senators get past the cringe-worthy ones in the bottom half (sadly, I think we&rsquo;re going to have to live with another term of Senator Sotto)</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I sorted all my commons/uncommons a while back, somewhere between 20-25k cards all in all (a good number from pre-Modern sets). Booster boxes can hold like 2-3 letters at a time, i.e. one booster box is enough for all As, Bs and half of Cs. All the Ss needed more than two booster boxes =/</p>
<p>Also, I probably need better storage than booster boxes</p>

<p>The country&rsquo;s name in the local language is &ldquo;Pilipinas&rdquo;. The citizens are &ldquo;Pilipinos&rdquo;</p>
<p>The national language is called &ldquo;Filipino&rdquo; (in English) and &ldquo;Pilipino&rdquo; (in Filipino).</p>
<p>It used to be that the official Filipino alphabet did not include the letter F. This is no longer the case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipino_alphabet">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipino_alphabet</a></p>
<p>Also, in English, the correct adjective to use is &ldquo;Philippine&rdquo;, i.e. the Philippine population.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>They don&rsquo;t feel out of vogue. Off the top of my head, turn-based games I played within the last year: Persona Q, Disgaea 4, Divinity:OS. Bravely Default, Fire Emblem: Awakening, X-Com, Civ 5 (okay, I play Civ every year). I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s more I&rsquo;m forgetting.</p>
<p>Edit: I also played Banner Saga and Shadowrun Returns Dragonfall, thanks to the replies for reminding me</p>
