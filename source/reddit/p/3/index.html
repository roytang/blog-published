<p>I had a bunch of old coins from different countries and they were stored in a rusty metal container that was also exposed to water at some point. I checked it recently and many of the coins inside are covered in rust and grime and some of them are even stuck toģether. Any recommendations for cleaning them?

<div class="content e-content">

<p>i’m not a serious collector or anything; these are mostly just leftover coins from foreign trips. so i’m not looking so much to preserve value, more like in the future i’d like to be able to pull them out and go “ah these are from my trip to so-and-so country, etc” i hope that makes sense</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy there&rsquo;s an oldschool Grixis Shadow list there because I haven&rsquo;t played Modern for a while and that&rsquo;s the last deck I had and I was looking at MC Barcelona and I didn&rsquo;t recognize the landscape at all and no more Grixis Shadows. IDK if I want to spend on the Knight-Captains right now to transition to Esper or Mardu. If I take my old Grixis Shadow list to a local modern tourney, how bad are the matchups with the current meta decks?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be visiting Seattle for a few days later this month, a couple of questions, possibly noobish:</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>- I want to visit the museum of pop culture, but due to logistics and scheduling, I can only do this during a time when I need to be bringing around a small piece of luggage (on wheels), in addition to my backpack. Will they let me into the museum with the luggage? Or is it not a good idea to try this?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>- my flight out of SeaTac is Southwest at 5am on a Tuesday. I plan to be at the airport maybe 9pm-10pm the night before, will they let me check in my luggage that early so that I can just hang out/sleep near the gate? (I guess this isn&rsquo;t really a Seattle-specific question, but more of I&rsquo;m not sure if a US airport will let me do this. Where I&rsquo;m from they typically won&rsquo;t let me check baggage more than 3 hours before my flight)</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/burn1c/filipinos_who_owned_a_famicomnes_how_much_was_it/">&#39;Filipinos who owned a Famicom/NES, how much was it back then and what games did you played on it?&#39; on /r/Philippines</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>We had a NES, my parents bought it when my mom&rsquo;s work sponsored a US trip for them. IDK what the price was. Problematic lang was that NES games were harder and more expensive to buy locally, and all your friends had Famicoms so mahirap ang gamesharing. Yung mga bootleg collections pati na &ldquo;1000 in 1&rdquo; etc available only as Famicom cartridges. Luckily, nagkaron ng binebenta na &ldquo;Honeybee&rdquo; adapter that let you use Famicom cartridges in a NES. I played a lot of the NES classics, all the legit Marios (there some random BS bootleg &ldquo;Super Mario 4&rdquo; that sometimes appeared), Castlevanias, Legend of Zelda (I had to borrow a NES original for this one, mahirap maghanap ng original Famicom cartridge kasi the cart needed its own battery for saving), Contra 1 and 2, Adventure Island etc etc. Kahit yung mga small games na nasa mga 16-in-1/100-in-1/etc like Popeye, Baseball, etc naging expert din ako lol. Pag bata ka madami kang time e</p>

<p>Um, that&rsquo;s not true. Accepting the results of a democratic vote is different from supporting it. i.e. Even if 99% of the country voted for the death penalty to be reinstated, you are still allowed to object to it (even though that may have little use) and to work to change the public opinion.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget who controls the police and military back then.. wasn&rsquo;t it Fidel Marcos and JPE?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, Fabian Ver was in charge of the military. From wikipedia: &quot; As Marcos disregarded the authority of then Defense Minister <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Ponce_Enrile">Juan Ponce Enrile</a> in the 1980s, he changed the military <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_hierarchy">chain of command</a>.  Under the new chain of command, the authority would evolve from Marcos  as president and commander-in-chief of the armed forces up to Ver, the  chief of staff of the armed forces. &quot;</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Re: Marcoses, do you mean that you don&rsquo;t think they are corrupt? You don&rsquo;t think that Imee Marcos had Archimedes Trajano killed for speaking up against her? (There is already a court judgment on this)</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>&gt;  People get fired and cases were filed iirc. Do you have anyone in mind? I have some means to get information.</p>
<p>Yung example ko above were the Tulfos? Is there any case against them now? I think the former sec of justice was also removed for some shenanigans, I forget his name, yung may wig? Ano nangyari sa kanya? Yan lang mga examples. Meron pa mga iba na tatanggalin nya for issues supposedly tapos irerecycle lang sa ibang position, like Faeldon or La Vina.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>&gt;  They don&rsquo;t offer alternative solution. And if they did, I didn&rsquo;t hear about it.</p>
<p>Si Chel Diokno primarily judicial reform ang focus nya, since he is a lawyer. It is easy to search for it, here&rsquo;s the first article I found: <a href="https://www.bworldonline.com/why-everyone-should-vote-for-chel-diokno/">https://www.bworldonline.com/why-everyone-should-vote-for-chel-diokno/</a></p>
<p>​</p>
<p>&ldquo;From his diagnostics, Chel has offered a coherent set of policy and institutional reforms. The reforms he champions include the following:</p>
<p>• The insulation of justices, judges, and prosecutors from partisan politics;</p>
<p>• The filling up of vacancies in the trial courts and prosecution agency by recruiting the most competent lawyers who possess integrity;</p>
<p>• The simplification of the rules on evidence and procedure;</p>
<p>• The reorientation of performance standard for the police and prosecution toward achieving high conviction rates;</p>
<p>• The creation of transparent information and monitoring system to track cases and convictions;</p>
<p>• The transfer of police’s disciplinary jurisdiction to the Civil Service Commission;</p>
<p>• The expansion of the Ombudsman’s scope to investigate justices and judges;</p>
<p>• The strengthening of the law on witness protection by allowing the perpetuation of testimonies of whistleblowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I largely agree with this because I believe problems with the judicial system are one of the primary systemic problems in the country, facilitating corruption and delaying or outright denying justice especially to those with fewer resources. My impression is that this admin has shown little interest in improving judicial processes at all (despite the President being a former prosecutor who supposedly knows all the problems in the processes). Imagine if the so-called &ldquo;intelligence fund&rdquo; and/or political will was applied not just to identifying supposed drug users but instead to identifying corrupt judges, prosecutors, law enforcers, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, I would suggest that you watch the full speech for all the instances the president expressed support for all the topics listed above. Again, half truths are the best lies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pinapanood ko naman lahat. Are you saying hindi naman yun sinasabi nung president? Also, I&rsquo;m not clear whether you are saying the media is engaged in half truths/lies or the president is?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t trust the media too much.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same vein, I think we should not trust any politician too much, whether we supported them or not. Discernment should apply to all sources, and even in cases where you trust someone, &ldquo;Trust, but verify&rdquo; should apply.</p>
<p>Thank you for responding!</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Hello! Thank you for responding!</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Re: China, I don&rsquo;t think there are only two options where it is either war or bilateral relations. We can maintain bilateral relations while at the same time asserting our rights. I believe Indonesia has blown up Chinese fishing boats they have caught illegally fishing in their claimed territories, yet there is no talk of war being declared there. China will not go into a war with us over the WPS, this is an unfounded fear; they have not even started any hostilities over Taiwan despite decades of saber-rattling. I think the main reason this admin is afraid to piss off China is that their programs have become dependent on Chinese loans since Duterte dislikes loans from western countries that come with silly conditions like needing to abide by human rights etc</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Re: Rappler, I agree they have a particular style of journalism, but I think this is more of the nature of people online being more attracted to clickbait-y articles than any actual bias against Duterte specifically. Even during the time of PNoy, they would have various articles criticizing him. It is the nature of the press to highlight problems and scandals, since this acts as a check on power. I think also the admin supporters have some level of selective bias as well in that they only see or remember those articles critical of the administration. The top article on the <a href="https://Rappler.com">Rappler.com</a> frontpage right now is &ldquo;Philippines recalls envoys after Canada misses deadline for garbage shipment&rdquo; which is surely positive for the admin. I think you would also agree that compared to the past admin, the current admin also tends to say more controversial things/statements which are more likely to make the news cycle, which furthers the sense of &lsquo;bias&rsquo;.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Thank you again for the discussion. What I generally see is that there is some sort of divide over idealistic/morally-driven views vs more pragmatic/&ldquo;we need to get things done&rdquo; views. Ultima</p>

<p>How do you feel about the liberal party? If you hate them, why? I personally feel they are no more worse than other poltical parties like the NPC, Lakas-CMD, PDP-LABAN etc</p>
<p>In what timeline of the liberal party&rsquo;s existence are you referring to?</p>

<p>Sorry, I missed this one. I mean more like moving forward. Would you automatically reject any candidate backed by the liberal party or something like that? Is it mainly because of what you perceive as involvement with &ldquo;the Reds&rdquo; as you say</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Thank you for replying! Some follow-ups, if I may:</p>
<p>​</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three words. Geopolitical Power Play</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Should I take this to mean you are okay with his tolerance of China&rsquo;s taking over our islands?</p>
<p>​</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why the hell would I convince you to support him? I can only present from my own perspective and that&rsquo;s about it. It&rsquo;s you who should decide whether you support him or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not expecting you to be able to convince me. For me, the purpose of this exercise is to foster more understanding across divides; maybe you have something you can say that would be able to convince the skeptics to support the president or at least improve their appreciation of him. It&rsquo;s okay if you don&rsquo;t have any such statement. But would you not think it&rsquo;s important for Filipinos to have a better understanding of where our fellow citizens are coming from? Or convincing other people to understand your perspective better is not a priority for you? This part is not a criticism - you have certainly been generous with your replies; but I have observed that few people are willing to reach out to those they tag as &ldquo;dilawan&rdquo; etc to explain their POV, so I wonder if people just don&rsquo;t care about that kind of thing.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>&gt;  What would be a dealbreaker for you</p>
<p>Would you have a response for this part?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>&gt;  Ugh. As I said. Everyone is in cahoots for political favors. It always has been.</p>
<p>Given this and some other things in your response, my main takeaway is that you believe that Duterte is just being honest with how things are in reality, and that the issues people have with him are issues that would be true regardless of whoever is in power. Would this be accurate?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>If the above is accurate, do you think we (as a country) deserve better? Would it be better to have leadership that does not use rhetoric to glorify the bad things about our reality?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Thanks for indulging us. May I ask (pasensya na, medyo madami, thanks in advance if you choose to respond!):</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>- how do you feel about the way the admin is handling our relationship with China?</p>
<p>- how do you feel about the alliances with known or perceived corrupt politicos/families like the Marcoses or GMA?</p>
<p>- how do you feel about the way the president plays fast and loose with the facts, pulls out allegations out of nowhere without explanation, attacks the press, the church, etc</p>
<p>- how do you feel about the death of Kian? do you think such abuses by the cops are common or rare?</p>
<p>- &quot; I hope a REAL opposition will be formed in the senate roster for check and balance. Not the 8D type of opposition. &quot; What does this mean? What makes 8D not &ldquo;REAL opposition&rdquo;?</p>
<p>- you mentioned opposing corruption, what about his appointees who had stolen from the public and have never been punished, like the Tulfos? I am not aware of any significant anticorruption successes by this administration (which means prosecution, cases filed etc), forgive my ignorance. I know he has removed some officials for corruption, but have they been prosecuted?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>- In spite of all the negatives you mentioned, you still feel like this admin is a net positive?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>- My top 3 issues with Duterte are: (a) encouragement of a culture of violence; and (b) support for GMA and the Marcoses; (c) apparent willingness to submit to the Chinese govt. For me the vast number of killings (including those done by vigilantes and those of cops trying to fill quotas, imagined or otherwise, and those of innocents) is completely unacceptable. Is there something you can tell me to convince me to support him?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>- Have there been instances that made you doubt your support for the administration?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>- What would be a dealbreaker for you, i.e. something this administration would do that would end your support? In my opinion, the president has personally expressed support and/or</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Thanks for indulging us. May I ask (pasensya na, medyo madami, thanks in advance if you choose to respond!):</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>- how do you feel about the way the admin is handling our relationship with China?</p>
<p>- how do you feel about the alliances with known or perceived corrupt politicos/families like the Marcoses or GMA?</p>
<p>- how do you feel about the way the president plays fast and loose with the facts, pulls out allegations out of nowhere without explanation, attacks the press, the church, etc</p>
<p>- how do you feel about the death of Kian? do you think such abuses by the cops are common or rare?</p>
<p>- do you think the senate should remain independent? do you think it will?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>- My top 3 issues with Duterte are: (a) encouragement of a culture of violence; and (b) support for GMA and the Marcoses; (c) apparent willingness to submit to the Chinese govt. For me the vast number of killings (including those done by vigilantes and those of cops trying to fill quotas, imagined or otherwise, and those of innocents) is completely unacceptable. Is there something you can tell me to convince me to support him?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>- How do you feel about the liberal party? If you hate them, why? I personally feel they are no more worse than other poltical parties like the NPC, Lakas-CMD, PDP-LABAN etc</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>- do you feel like the opposition candidates were not qualified to be senators?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>- Have there been instances that made you doubt your support for the administration?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>- What would be a dealbreaker for you, i.e. something this administration would do that would end your support? In my opinion, the president has personally expressed support and/or tolerance for murder, lying, planting evidence, suppressing the press, political dynasties, vote-buying, making allegations without proof, and so on, so I find it difficult to imagine what could be worse than all of these.</p>

He woke up like normal and adrenaline kept him up as he did his routine. He used the sink,did dishes and made breakfast while bleeding out. He was locked out while picking the newspaper and died trying to find the spare key&#39; on /r/todayilearned</a>:

<p>GDS is an grindy, interactive deck that requires a lot of Modern matchup knowledge (so you know what to thoughtseize, what hands are safe, when to push your life total, how to sequence your fetches and land drops, etc), I wouldn&rsquo;t have recommended it as a first time Modern deck. You will probably be playing suboptimally until you have quite a few competitive matches under your belt.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>On the upside, the deck has been around for a while, so it&rsquo;s well understood - meaning there&rsquo;s a ton of resources available for it. One I read recently was <a href="https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/grixis-deaths-shadow-guide-first-place-at-grand-prix-toronto/">https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/grixis-deaths-shadow-guide-first-place-at-grand-prix-toronto/</a></p>
