<p>Some info:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The giveaway games are all minis: Velocity, Breakquest, Canabalt, Wizorb</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The codes will only work on the Europe store (you can just create a EU account if you really want them)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 of my codes worked fine; but for Canabalt, the store said the code was already used =/</p>

<p>Nah, I feel that way too. This year&rsquo;s sale isn&rsquo;t too exciting really. Or maybe it&rsquo;s just that there aren&rsquo;t many games I&rsquo;d want to buy anymore.</p>
<p>I miss those great achievement hunts they used to have.</p>

<p>Is there something that makes this easy? Like say I&rsquo;m browsing something on my PC and I see an image that could be a good ipad wallpaper so I want to send it to my ipad somehow. Or maybe I see something on my ipad and think &ldquo;I want to view this on my desktop&rdquo; so I want to send the link there. I don&rsquo;t want to have to do something like send it out via an email, I&rsquo;m hoping /r/ipad has some sort of mindblowing magic for me.</p>
<p>Edit: probably should have mentioned i dont use a mac</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Sorry, it&rsquo;s just not as good as you think it is. The bar is set pretty high in order for creatures to be playable in constructed. They either have to have really, really good stats (power, toughness, combat abilities) for their casting cost or be able to generate card advantage (not just 1-for-1)</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about it, this is what happens to 90% of steam-using redditors  after the steam sales. The other 10% already own all the steam games.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>The stories in the books always take place at the time they were written. Older stories adjust to the timeline of the book you&rsquo;re reading as needed.</p>
<p>When the original x-men were introduced, their story took place in the 60s and that&rsquo;s still true if you&rsquo;re reading uncanny x-men v1 #1.</p>
<p>But when you read all new xmen #1 which takes place in 2012, the story of the original xmen happened 15-20 years ago. This means that their story doesnt have exactly the same setting as it did in uxm#1, although the details remain more or less the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit weird. Best not to take comic book timelines too seriously lol.</p>

<h4 id="posted-on-rhardware-looking-for-a-replacement-video-card-around-100-120-budget-suggestionshttpsredditcomrhardwarecomments14y3fzlooking_for_a_replacement_video_card_around">Posted on r/hardware: <a href="https://reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/14y3fz/looking_for_a_replacement_video_card_around/">Looking for a replacement video card, around $100-$120 budget, suggestions?</a></h4>
<p>My GTX460 vid card just died and I&rsquo;m looking to buy a replacement tomorrow. I can&rsquo;t buy online, so I&rsquo;ve been looking at price lists of some local stores.</p>
<p>I was planning to get an Inno3d GTX650, but the store I plan to buy from is out of stock of those. They have an Asus GTX650, but it&rsquo;s like 50% more expensive =/ (Not sure if there&rsquo;s a large difference between the brands). What alternatives should I be considering before I go out to the mall tomorrow?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a gamer, but I&rsquo;m not really the &ldquo;play on ultra-high settings&rdquo; kind of guy. The most graphically intensive game I&rsquo;ve bought recently is probably Skyrim.</p>
<p>I prefer Nvidia, but aside from preference, not many Radeon cards are being sold around here. Here&rsquo;s a sample price list from one of my local stores: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/onK51.png">http://i.imgur.com/onK51.png</a> - prices are not in USD, they&rsquo;re in PHP, but roughly my budget should be around 5000+ or less in local prices. There&rsquo;s not many choices if I can&rsquo;t find an Inno3d GTX650&hellip;I&rsquo;m willing to spend a little bit more if it will be more &ldquo;future proof&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;m not sure which of these cards would be a good buy at higher prices.</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/14mqng/lets_talk_about_triggers_part_two/c7epzse/">a comment by ubernostrum on &#39;Let&#39;s talk about triggers, part two&#39; on /r/magicTCG</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>In that case, do you know what were the circumstances leading to the ruling that the player forgot the trigger? Is it because the attacking player made no sign of any sort to acknowledge the trigger?</p>
<p>I would think swinging a Pyreheart Wolf into an Augur of Bolas that could block and kill it without the trigger means he was expecting to get through with damage. I guess that&rsquo;s what bothering a lot of people, such an attack seems to indicate that you assume you&rsquo;re getting through and therefore are aware of the trigger.</p>
<p>How about the story the other day of a craterhoof player saying he was attacking for lethal, and the opponent later claiming that the craterhoof trigger had been missed. (I believe this was from the Melissa deTora article). Is this also &ldquo;not a great example&rdquo;?</p>
<p>BTW, I fully support this discussion and agree that on its face the current trigger rules are probably better than earlier incarnations, I just want a clearer guideline of when I would be considered to have forgotten my trigger.</p>
<p>Edit: Fixed some words</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>These are all very different games. Super Meat Boy and VVVVV focus on difficulty and twitch-gaming, while Braid and Trine are more of puzzle platformers. AYIM I didn&rsquo;t like at all lol.</p>
<p>When I say a Mario-like game, I mean something that focuses on exploration I guess? Trine is probably the closest among the ones you mentioned.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>For me it&rsquo;s not. I haven&rsquo;t really cared about Pacquiao that much; I&rsquo;m not the type of person that would be proud of someone just because we randomly happened to be born in the same country.</p>
<p>That being said, he really should have quit his game when he went into politics. His being in politics annoys me more than this loss.</p>
<p>Fun story, I was playing a game on my PC (Saints Row the Third if you&rsquo;re curious) and my dad was like &ldquo;Wala pa bang balita kay Pacquiao&rdquo;, and I was like &ldquo;nagstart na ba? I&rsquo;ll check later&rdquo;, but by the time I was finished playing (about 2 hours later) the fight was already done. Lol hindi ko man lang naramdaman. How long did that fight last anyway</p>

<p>Yeah I get that, but the effect doesn&rsquo;t seem to be big enough to be worth it; I can understand how big it would be if there were multiples, but he only has 1 in the main, and they really only pump up the Staticasters for a single attack (the rest won&rsquo;t be able to attack on the same turn)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m asking about this because I have friends who got the WiiU simply because none of the other consoles has a Mario game. Sony has Little Big Planet trying to be the platformer of choice for the PS3/Vita, but that doesn&rsquo;t really seem to come close to the Mario experience. Xbox has&hellip;well I don&rsquo;t even know if there are platformers on Xbox. If you really want to play Mario or something that provides a reasonably close experience, are you really forced to go Nintendo?</p>

<p>How is that relevant to the question? The same thing can be said for franchises like Call of Duty, Madden, etc.</p>
<p>I <strong>like</strong> Mario games, I&rsquo;d love if it something similar came out on the PS3/Vita</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>That ability&rsquo;s still going to resolve though, it&rsquo;s just that the negative power makes use it useless. If the Elder was killed by some other means (Lightning Bolt), the damage would still go through using the last known information about the Elder&rsquo;s power</p>

<p>I dont follow him on twitter or read his articles so when people talked about him i always visualized him looking like owen wilson. So yes, i&rsquo;ve imagined owen wilson single-blocking a pyreheart wolf. Also, owen is totally in the right here. The rules may be terrible at the moment, but until a better solution is found one should follow the rules as given</p>
