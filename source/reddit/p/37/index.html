    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/h88oz/new_us_blog_update_from_sony/">&#39;New US blog update from Sony&#39; on /r/PS3</a>:

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I can only sympathize with the Sony developers who are probably putting in massive overtime because of all the public pressure (including from places like reddit) that makes their manages push hard on them. They&rsquo;re probably being given impossible deadlines/targets too, and when they inevitably slip, Sony has to give an update like this. Estimation isn&rsquo;t easy people, especially under pressure!</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I have no idea about microfinance or Kiva or Rwanda (and probably some other people are as ignorant as me), can you give us a lowdown?</p>
<p>How much life savings did you set aside before going on your world tour? Do you still earn money while travelling?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always fantasized about going off to travel the world but I feel like it would be terribly difficult to leave behind my roots even for a shortish amount of time. How did you overcome that sort of thing?</p>

<p>I already have Mount and Blade, but it&rsquo;s still a couple of games from the top of my to-play list (still haven&rsquo;t finished going through everything I bought at the last Steam sale :p) What about Fire and Sword? Should I get it? There&rsquo;s a 10% off preorders at the moment.</p>

<p>When we were young we were only allowed to play on the NES for one hour at a time. It seemed like a reasonable restriction on kids&rsquo; play time I guess, but it meant I got into a lot of trouble when I tried to finish Super Mario 3 without warping in one sitting</p>

<p>Maybe she prepares everything ahead of time and just has shell scripts to run. That way she impresses all the noobs who have no idea how she does all this so fast. Do I get a no-prize?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s about as bad as Garcia from Criminal Minds, who can basically search for any information in no time flat unless the plot gods say it&rsquo;s too difficult.</p>
<p>Most of the time it doesn&rsquo;t bother me though. It&rsquo;s just TV.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>The damage is removed and the giant growth is removed, both at the same time. The important thing is state-based effects (including the thing that checks whether your creature is dead due to damage &gt; toughness) do not check in between; once all end of turn effects are cleaned up, that&rsquo;s the only time things are checked to see if they are alive or dead. So, the correct answer is (1)</p>

Or any other way to get Mass Effect 2 DLC?</a></h4>
<p>So I got Mass Effect 2 via a Steam sale a while back, but I don&rsquo;t have the DLC like Overlord, Kasumi, etc. Is purchasing Bioware points the only way to buy them on PC? If so, do they at least have sales at any time? Or can we expect a price drop at least when ME3 comes out?</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fxbd5/im_sick_of_this_entire_dlc_scam_cutting_content/">&#39;I&#39;m sick of this entire DLC scam - cutting content out of a game to re-sell it is wrong in so many ways. So So how easy and cohesive is it to pirate DLC for games?&#39; on /r/gaming</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>What if they didn&rsquo;t bundle DLC separately and just straight-up sold the game for a higher price (and with a slightly later release date), would you prefer it? Or if the game was released with the same price but no additional DLC at all? Or the game is released with no DLC but six months later a new full version of the game is released with slightly more content that could have been released as DLC but instead you now have to buy a full game again?</p>
<p>Personally, I find that DLC is a good idea as it allows customers to pick and choose which content they want. I&rsquo;m not going to bitch about it, I don&rsquo;t have to buy the DLC if I don&rsquo;t want to. In fact for longer games like RPGs I just wait for the GOTY to come out later.</p>
<p>Also, the phrase &ldquo;cutting content out of the game&rdquo; shows misunderstanding of how software development in general works. Like all other software development gigs, game development is largely constrained by schedules and real-world budget and resource constraints. And most of the time they&rsquo;re going to fall short of those schedules and have to decide what features to cut so they can make it on time. Having the option of releasing them as DLC creates less pressure on the team and creates an opportunity for content that would otherwise have been cut or saved for a larger expansion disc to be made available. And please don&rsquo;t take at face value the rantings that because 90% of a DLC&rsquo;s content is already on the disc that it should have been included at release - you haven&rsquo;t considered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-ninety_rule">the other 90%</a> yet.</p>
