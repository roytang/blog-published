<p>Thor: GOT is very good.</p>
<p>Cable and X-force is a bit meh. Uncanny X-Force is better IMHO</p>
<p>Look into X-Men #1 coming out this week.</p>
<p>Consider: Daredevil, Captain Marvel, Young Avengers</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>The characters are all owned by Marvel. Marvel is owned by Disney.</p>
<p>Sony doesnt &ldquo;own&rdquo; the Spider-man franchise. Sony has an exclusive license from Marvel to use Spider-man in movies; that means only they can produce Spider-man movies. The license is from before Marvel had their own movie studio.</p>
<p>Fox also has a similar license for the X-Men/Fantastic Four.</p>
<p>For any characters where Marvel hasn&rsquo;t given anyone else an exclusive movie license, they can use those characters in their own movies.</p>

<p>I sunk some 2-300 hours into Crusaders of the Dark Savant back in the day, but never managed to finish it, although I think I got rather close. I remember that it was always troublesome to find those maps off the randomly wandering NPCs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have time to play it again though :p</p>

<p>You can get what is currently free. As long as you have &ldquo;purchased&rdquo; a free game, it stays in your download list and you can redownload it any time as long as your subscription is active, even after it rotates from the IGC.</p>

<p>While I have fond memories of it (and still have a copy at home), it kind of bothers me that late game always devolved to having one uber-hero with a stack of doom and a bunch of other heroes to assist him by moving troops and items and resources around. I&rsquo;m not sure if this has changed in 5 or 6.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Physical purchases (vita cartridges/ps3 discs) are not region locked, you can play games you bought from any physical store anywhere.</p>
<p>For PS+, you&rsquo;ll need a Sony Entertainment Network (SEN) account. Your account will have a country associated with it at creation time and this cannot be changed later.</p>
<p>Online purchases made through the PSN store are tied to your SEN account and the Vita can only have one account active. If you will be in Canada long-term, I suggest that you get a North American PS+ code with your Vita and create a North American (Canada or US) account. However, I don&rsquo;t know if the NA Plus offerings are better than whatever Australian accounts get.</p>
<p>Additionally, I think the PSN stores will only accept credit cards from the same region (this is true for the US store), so it if you plan to make online purchases, take this into account.</p>
<p>DLC for some games is region-locked. For example: a region 1 (North America) copy of Street Fighter x Tekken will only work with DLC downloaded/purchased from a US or Canada PSN store.</p>

<p>Turn-based RPGs, for example, really have nothing to show in terms of gameplay. I suppose responsive menus and quick responses to button presses, but past that it gets pretty hard to improve the gameplay aspect of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wat. I take it these type of games aren&rsquo;t really your style. Skill trees and builds, ability choices, enemy balancing, equipment choices are all gameplay elements.</p>

<p>My Vita uses a US account; Can I buy an R3 SFxT and use the extra characters DLC on my R3 SFxT PS3 copy? I&rsquo;m not sure whether the SFxT character DLC comes as a code with the game (in which case there wouldnt be any problem), or if I somehow need to login the Vita with my R3 account.</p>
<p>To be clear:</p>
<p>PSN account on my Vita - US</p>
<p>SFxT PS3 copy - R3 (Asia) (I already have this)</p>
<p>SFxT Vita copy - R3 (Asia) (I plan to buy this)</p>
<p>I already know the DLC from the Vita copy will work with the PS3 copy (since they&rsquo;re both R3); what I don&rsquo;t know is whether</p>
<p>(a) the SFxT Vita copy will come with a redemption code for the character DLC that I can just redeem in the PSN Store on my PS3 (I have R3 accounts for this- HK and SG); or</p>
<p>(b) I would need to have an R3 account on my Vita to be able to get the DLC</p>

<p>While in an ideal world this sounds like it might be a good idea, I feel like it is likely to be corrupted over here. i.e. whoever reviews the reports is going to get bribed by prisoners who won&rsquo;t even do the work.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>You are confused. The bonus from giant growth does not yet exist at the time your thaumaturgist ability resolves (since the giant growth has not yet resolved). Therefore the creature dies.</p>
<p>Layering does not interact with the stack at all; the stack if for spells and effects currently being played to determine in what order their effects happen. Layers determine how different type of effects combine.</p>
<p>To put it another way: The stack resolves effects one at a time so that they can change the current state. Layering tells you what the current state it when multiple effects have changed it in conflicting ways.</p>

<p>I keep waiting for this announcement. I love Disgaea, but I never get anywhere playing them when I&rsquo;m stuck on a console. Handheld is great so that I can just play it when I&rsquo;m somewhere waiting for something.</p>

<p>Hey, while you&rsquo;re here: Any chance of DOTP providing something extra for buyers of the previous version(s)? Maybe make some of the decks from older versions available in the new one?</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1dq2s4/one_of_my_favorite_blocks_is_time_spiral_purely/">&#39;One of my favorite blocks is Time Spiral, purely based on the references to older sets. Lately I&#39;ve found that these subtleties are lost on many players, so I&#39;ve thrown together a gallery that calls out these allusions in text, art, and flavor. Enjoy!&#39; on /r/magicTCG</a>:

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Some people I know (big comic fans) were disappointed at the Mandarin build-up then the let-down reveal. I dunno, I was kinda fine with the deception.</p>
<p>I felt like the second half of the movie was way too predictable.</p>
<p>Did Tony Stark just utter a bunch of gibberish to get Happy Endings Max to climb to the top of the van and tweak a screw on a satellite dish?</p>
<p>Apparently it&rsquo;s all right for Pepper to wear the armors (one of them at least, and a hand or two), but Tony can&rsquo;t spare one for Rhodes because &ldquo;they&rsquo;re all coded for me&rdquo;</p>
<p>How did two Mark 42 parts make it out of the garage while the rest had to bang against the door to get a kid&rsquo;s attention?</p>
<p>I watched this movie more than a week ago, so those are all I could remember right now. I thought it was okay, but not &ldquo;best in the trilogy okay&rdquo;.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;m a bit annoyed when they do variant covers that are not at all related to the book they&rsquo;re in. I mean, this one doesn&rsquo;t even have any of the cast on the cover. Wait, the first X-Men story arc isn&rsquo;t about zombies, is it?</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/1de48x/weekly_pull_list_for_512013/c9ph49q/">a comment by MorganFreemann on &#39;Weekly Pull List for 5/1/2013&#39; on /r/comicbooks</a>:

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Most books are released on a monthly basis, but they don&rsquo;t all come out on the same week, so usually a different set of books comes out every week.</p>
<p>For Marvel, some of their books double-ship, meaning they come out twice a month (sometimes more). I think DC is fairly regular with their monthly schedule. You can check the links in the OP for a list of what books are expected to come out this week and most of those sites will have schedules for the next few weeks/months as well.</p>
