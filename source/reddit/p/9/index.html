<p>Bus and plane rides can be uncomfortable due to both lack of leg room and seat backs being too low to comfortably rest head/neck on</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Worth means something different to every person, so it depends on what definition you use and what priorities you think society should have. There are a number of priorities to choose from: survival, advancement of knowledge, expansion of territory, etc.</p>
<p>If you judge based on a priority of survival, then I guess you would give greater worth to food producers (farmers, etc). If you judge based on advancement, perhaps scientists would be ranked highly. I would also imagine that all other things being equal, younger people would be worth more than older people as they have more potential</p>
<p>Regardless of what priority you choose, a precise measurement of a person&rsquo;s worth or ranking will be very difficult, if not impossible, given all the nuances of human life and the inherent potential that any human life possesses</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t played the game since before the first patch (Asimov?), am I in for a treat/different game altogether?</p>
<p>Do we have a release window for Heinlein? I read that savegames will be incompatible after the patch so I&rsquo;ll wait until that comes out before playing Stellaris again</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;m referring to the House of M universe where Logan was a shield agent and Magneto was some kind of royalty etc. Obviously the stuff in the first issue where they had Scarlet Witch in Genosha and the resulting consequences of the story arc (&ldquo;No more mutants&rdquo;) took place in 616, so I didn&rsquo;t bother specifying</p>
<p>Arguably, since it &ldquo;replaced&rdquo; 616 for a bit, you might not consider it an alternate reality, but it&rsquo;s as much alternate reality as Age of Apocalypse was. AoA happened the same way - it replaced 616 for a bit until they did the Bishop going into the M&rsquo;Kraan crystal thing to restore 616, but they later showed AoA universe to continue as an &ldquo;alternate reality&rdquo;</p>
<p>In any case, whether you consider it an alternate reality or not, it&rsquo;s definitely not a reboot in any way, shape, or form</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>The API is pretty inconsistent and poorly designed. There&rsquo;s a lot of articles out there, here&rsquo;s one: <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/</a> It&rsquo;s not very elegant, and features seem to be added willy-nilly. Compare to languages like Python and Ruby, where new additions are reviewed with a focus on being &ldquo;Pythonic&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ruby like&rdquo; so that the entire language has a certain consistency</p>
<p>PHP is also the most common introductory web development language (since most Apache installations support it by default), so there is a lot of poorly written beginner code in the wild, leading to more hate against the language</p>
<p>That being said, if that&rsquo;s what you know, there&rsquo;s no problem with that, as long as you use it well. But it&rsquo;s also good to expose yourself to other languages so you can see if there are others that you will prefer</p>

<p>As a Filipino living in the Philippines, I can tell you he&rsquo;s not exactly the most consistent person spewing out reliable statements. Even during the campaign period he had a tendency to flip-flop especially when people call him out, and even his own spokespeople often give different &ldquo;interpretations&rdquo; of his nonsenical ramblings. If you believe he doesn&rsquo;t want to stay in power, you should also believe his threat to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to declare martial law if she doesn&rsquo;t toe the line, or his threat to leave the UN if they aren&rsquo;t more polite or something</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Sketchbook Pro since that&rsquo;s what I use for my sketching, but I find that my hands are very uneven at drawing the speech bubbles, so I&rsquo;m hoping for something that includes a smoothing process for the lines, and also a way to input multiple lines of text easily</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s better to build trust in the PNP if the organisation itself is able to promote transparency within its own ranks, but I guess it could be anybody</p>

<p>For example, some suggestions I would make:</p>
<ul>
<li>for the president to come out with a strongly worded message enjoining law enforcement to observe proper procedures, rules of engagement and due process</li>
<li>provide regular summary reports, probably weekly of the progress of the &ldquo;drug war&rdquo;: how many buy bust operations, how many drug dealers captured alive, how many died in encounters, how many died while in custody, and so on</li>
<li>provide and publicize a channel/process for family members of people alleged killed unjustly in police operations to air their grievances and file cases. Provide protection and legal counsel (via the PAO?) as needed</li>
<li>related to above, appoint someone to be in charge of investigating extrajudicial killings. that person should provide regular weekly update reports on the cases being investigated and act as a spokesman for the PNP (I assume he would be from the PNP) on this matter and liaise with the senate and the CHR for any investigations</li>
<li>provide regular reports on the status of the vigilante/cardboard killing cases</li>
</ul>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>Edit, some additional:</p>
<ul>
<li>automatically perform autopsy on any alleged criminals killed in a police encounter. Check for powder burns, prints on the weapon, and so on, and regularly release these autopsy reports to promote transparency</li>
<li>conduct re-training for police on how to handle suspects in custody to avoid &ldquo;nang-agaw ng baril&rdquo; even though naka handcuffs. Punish policemen na naagawan pa rin ng baril kahit nakaposas na</li>
</ul>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Play-wise, it&rsquo;s impossible to predict what kind of decks there&rsquo;ll be in March, so just practice general tight play for now.</p>
<p>Aside from that, the biggest difference a large tournament like a GP has compared to an FNM is the sheer length of the tournament. I&rsquo;m not sure how large GPs in your area get, but I would typically expect 9 or 10 rounds on the first day. If you&rsquo;re used to just playing 4-5 rounds of FNM, it can get exhausting. You need to build up both your physical and mental stamina. So what I would suggest is playing at other large tournaments near you to start getting used to it. 7-8 rounds should be fine, if you have trouble looking for something with at least 9 rounds. PPTQs and SCG stuff are your best bet, although some stores might have larger GPT events too if they have a large enough playerbase.</p>

<p>I currently have the 4th generation iPad (the first one with retina display), and I&rsquo;ve tried using third-party styluses with them but am never satisfied, it always feel imprecise. I&rsquo;ve tried drawing with just my fingers and while it&rsquo;s more precise it also feels a bit more tiring</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of getting an iPad Pro next month. How much better would it be to use the Apple Pencil?</p>

<p>Improvement always comes with practice. The improvement may be slow or it may be quick, depending on how focused you are on improving. Even without specifically focusing on improvement, sheer repetition will make you better in some aspect. Maybe your lines will be straighter or your proportions a bit better or you&rsquo;ll draw a bit faster</p>

<p>The main issues are (1) word gender (a concept that exists in neither English nor Filipino), (2) subject-verb agreement (unlike English where the choice is simply between singular and plural, Spanish adds the complication of different verb forms depending on first, second or third person, with variations depending on gender and singular/plural), and (3) object pronouns, that shit is hard. These are the main issues you have to focus on in order to have relatively decent grammar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at 50% Spanish fluency, I started like early 2015. I think I actually got to 60+% fluency but I stopped for a few months so it dropped. When I started I would keep each category at full strength - whenever one of them dropped I would go back and strengthen it again, but that led to slow progress. This time I&rsquo;m going through all the categories first (I&rsquo;m down to the last 10 or so categories), then will go back and reinforce them later. Not sure if this will be more effective, but I figure I would go wide first then strengthen those places where I turn out to be weak</p>
<p>As with all sorts of learning, the key is really to practice, practice, practice. Devote time and energy to it. It would help if you had a Spanish-speaking friend you could talk to regularly</p>

Need some help</a></h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for anyone who has a physical CD copy of their album &ldquo;Time and Chance&rdquo;, specifically the Philippine release. This version has an extra track at the end titled &ldquo;I Remember&rdquo;, which does not appear in most releases in other countries. I am not sure which countries&rsquo; releases had this track, but for sure it is in the Ph version. I would like to get a digital copy of this track. It is not on iTunes, Spotify, torrents, etc, so the best chance is if someone could rip it from the actual CD. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p>RPG/Platformer/Metroidvania</p>

<p>A friend and I played it back in the Famicom days, we had to study katakana/hiragana to figure out how to advance.

<p>I&rsquo;m looking to focus on Modern until maybe end of the year, so I probably won&rsquo;t be using my Jace playset until it rotates out. I like to keep a playset around of mythics I enjoyed using though, but in this case, would it be better to sell them off now (while he still has another set&rsquo;s worth of time in standard legality) and rebuy later?</p>

<p>Hey, looking for some advice. Here&rsquo;s the deck I played at the last tournament: <a href="http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=12828&amp;d=274476&amp;f=MO">http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=12828&amp;d=274476&amp;f=MO</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mostly fine with the main deck (except maybe Tamiyo, a bit weak, if I think of something better in that slot I might swap her out). I&rsquo;m not playing Nahiri because I don&rsquo;t have time to get them before Saturday, and also because I&rsquo;m quite used to this build already and in Modern I prefer piloting the deck I already really know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of tweaking the sideboard. No idea the meta to expect for this weekend&rsquo;s WMCQ so I want to hit as wide a base as possible.</p>
<p>Permission magic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking of changing 1 Negate 2 Dispel to 2 Negate 1 Dispel to give better game against Tron</li>
<li>Counterflux. This slot is really only good vs Storm, is it worth it? I figure vs Storm you just always stop the start of the storm chain instead of the end, so maybe not worth it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Anti-aggro:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Supreme Verdict or 1 Anger of the Gods + 1 Supreme Verdict? Or should I free up another slot and have 1 Anger + 2 Verdict?</li>
<li>is Shatterstorm even good against Affinity or should I have 2 Stony Silence instead? (I don&rsquo;t have the 2nd Stony yet though&hellip;)</li>
</ul>
<p>GY hate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relic or RIP? RIP turns off GY stuff forever while Relic is a one-off, but RIP is symmetrical so it turns off my own Snaps</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, is there some guide somewhere that tells me what&rsquo;s the optimal number to choose for EE in various matchups? I just got this EE, so I&rsquo;m not to used to boarding it in.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions? What matchups should I look out for? Thanks!</p>

<h4 id="posted-on-rmodernmagic-jeskai-sideboard-choiceshttpsredditcomrmodernmagiccomments4rspgdjeskai_sideboard_choices">Posted on r/ModernMagic: <a href="https://reddit.com/r/ModernMagic/comments/4rspgd/jeskai_sideboard_choices/">Jeskai sideboard choices</a></h4>
<p>Hey, looking for some advice. Here&rsquo;s the deck I played at the last tournament: <a href="http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=12828&amp;d=274476&amp;f=MO">http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=12828&amp;d=274476&amp;f=MO</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mostly fine with the main deck (except maybe Tamiyo, a bit weak, if I think of something better in that slot I might swap her out). I&rsquo;m not playing Nahiri because I don&rsquo;t have time to get them before Saturday, and also because I&rsquo;m quite used to this build already and in Modern I prefer piloting the deck I already really know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of tweaking the sideboard. No idea the meta to expect for this weekend&rsquo;s WMCQ so I want to hit as wide a base as possible.</p>
<p>Permission magic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking of changing 1 Negate 2 Dispel to 2 Negate 1 Dispel to give better game against Tron</li>
<li>Counterflux. This slot is really only good vs Storm, is it worth it? I figure vs Storm you just always stop the start of the storm chain instead of the end, so maybe not worth it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Anti-aggro:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Supreme Verdict or 1 Anger of the Gods + 1 Supreme Verdict? Or should I free up another slot and have 1 Anger + 2 Verdict?</li>
<li>is Shatterstorm even good against Affinity or should I have 2 Stony Silence instead? (I don&rsquo;t have the 2nd Stony yet though&hellip;)</li>
</ul>
<p>GY hate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relic or RIP? RIP turns off GY stuff forever while Relic is a one-off, but RIP is symmetrical so it turns off my own Snaps</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: Also, is there some guide somewhere that tells me what&rsquo;s the optimal number to choose for EE in various matchups? I just got this EE, so I&rsquo;m not to used to boarding it in.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions? What matchups should I look out for? Thanks!</p>

<p>My vote goes to Stay Out of My Path by /u/MindInTheClouds, it was the one I most enjoyed reading.</p>
<p>As an aside, I want to say I&rsquo;m very happy I made it to this round of the contest. It&rsquo;s a pleasant surprise since I basically decided to join at the last minute and rushed out an entry on the day of the deadline. This is officially my excuse for any poor editing on my part :D</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fairly new to this sub, so IDK how often contests like these are held, but I look forward to participating in the next one (and I&rsquo;ll try to start earlier next time!). I&rsquo;ve already learned a lot, and I&rsquo;d like to say thanks to everyone who read my entry and who voted for me and gave me feedback, it&rsquo;s been great :D</p>

<p>This happened to me back in the late 90s. I think I passed even less than 23 units :p Yes, you will be in probation for one sem. I don&rsquo;t remember if I wrote a letter of appeal, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard if you need to, just promise to focus more on your studies and to do better (and you really should! Engg won&rsquo;t give you another chance)</p>
<p>I suggest you talk to your adviser before following any advice from this thread.</p>

<p>150k isn&rsquo;t a lot, it can vanish in an instant if you&rsquo;re not careful. Put your money in a savings account first, you&rsquo;ll need it as a buffer for emergency expenses. You only have a year of college left, prioritize finishing that, then look for a decent job.</p>
<p>Try to track your expenses, don&rsquo;t spend too much on unnecessary things until you have stable income. If you have time, take on some part-time work while finishing your studies.</p>
