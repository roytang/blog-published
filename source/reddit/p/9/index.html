<p>A friend and I played it back in the Famicom days, we had to study katakana/hiragana to figure out how to advance. It was some sort of primitive metroidvania-style 2d platformer with exploratory elements. The character was I think some kind of bluish knight kind of person with a sword. This is all I have to go on unfortunately. Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>We serve a McSpaghetti. The first time I tried a McDonald&rsquo;s overseas I tried to order a McSpaghetti and the Chinese lady behind the counter looked at me like I was a madman</p>
<p>Also they are consistently #2 behind a local Bee-themed franchise</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking to focus on Modern until maybe end of the year, so I probably won&rsquo;t be using my Jace playset until it rotates out. I like to keep a playset around of mythics I enjoyed using though, but in this case, would it be better to sell them off now (while he still has another set&rsquo;s worth of time in standard legality) and rebuy later?</p>

<p>Hey, looking for some advice. Here&rsquo;s the deck I played at the last tournament: <a href="http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=12828&amp;d=274476&amp;f=MO">http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=12828&amp;d=274476&amp;f=MO</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mostly fine with the main deck (except maybe Tamiyo, a bit weak, if I think of something better in that slot I might swap her out). I&rsquo;m not playing Nahiri because I don&rsquo;t have time to get them before Saturday, and also because I&rsquo;m quite used to this build already and in Modern I prefer piloting the deck I already really know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of tweaking the sideboard. No idea the meta to expect for this weekend&rsquo;s WMCQ so I want to hit as wide a base as possible.</p>
<p>Permission magic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking of changing 1 Negate 2 Dispel to 2 Negate 1 Dispel to give better game against Tron</li>
<li>Counterflux. This slot is really only good vs Storm, is it worth it? I figure vs Storm you just always stop the start of the storm chain instead of the end, so maybe not worth it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Anti-aggro:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Supreme Verdict or 1 Anger of the Gods + 1 Supreme Verdict? Or should I free up another slot and have 1 Anger + 2 Verdict?</li>
<li>is Shatterstorm even good against Affinity or should I have 2 Stony Silence instead? (I don&rsquo;t have the 2nd Stony yet though&hellip;)</li>
</ul>
<p>GY hate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relic or RIP? RIP turns off GY stuff forever while Relic is a one-off, but RIP is symmetrical so it turns off my own Snaps</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, is there some guide somewhere that tells me what&rsquo;s the optimal number to choose for EE in various matchups? I just got this EE, so I&rsquo;m not to used to boarding it in.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions? What matchups should I look out for? Thanks!</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>My vote goes to Stay Out of My Path by /u/MindInTheClouds, it was the one I most enjoyed reading.</p>
<p>As an aside, I want to say I&rsquo;m very happy I made it to this round of the contest. It&rsquo;s a pleasant surprise since I basically decided to join at the last minute and rushed out an entry on the day of the deadline. This is officially my excuse for any poor editing on my part :D</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fairly new to this sub, so IDK how often contests like these are held, but I look forward to participating in the next one (and I&rsquo;ll try to start earlier next time!). I&rsquo;ve already learned a lot, and I&rsquo;d like to say thanks to everyone who read my entry and who voted for me and gave me feedback, it&rsquo;s been great :D</p>

<p>This happened to me back in the late 90s. I think I passed even less than 23 units :p Yes, you will be in probation for one sem. I don&rsquo;t remember if I wrote a letter of appeal, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard if you need to, just promise to focus more on your studies and to do better (and you really should! Engg won&rsquo;t give you another chance)</p>
<p>I suggest you talk to your adviser before following any advice from this thread.</p>

<p>150k isn&rsquo;t a lot, it can vanish in an instant if you&rsquo;re not careful. Put your money in a savings account first, you&rsquo;ll need it as a buffer for emergency expenses. You only have a year of college left, prioritize finishing that, then look for a decent job.</p>
<p>Try to track your expenses, don&rsquo;t spend too much on unnecessary things until you have stable income. If you have time, take on some part-time work while finishing your studies.</p>

<p>This is already on the second visit to Lignatore. I had already defeated the boss and there was the cutscene and everything, then I realized I didn&rsquo;t get this box and I probably won&rsquo;t be able to get it. I still have this save game that&rsquo;s right before the boss before I go to Mysticete, wondering if whatever is in there is worth re-loading to try to get it :p</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>&ldquo;What? Where?&rdquo; Steve muttered over the cackle of his walkie-talkie. He dropped his fork on the plateful of bacon and started packing up. &ldquo;I’m nearest, I’ll be there ASAP. Have Glen and Lynn follow me as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His companion was looking at him quizzically from across the table. &ldquo;Relax, John. You didn’t screw up this time. In fact, I guess it’s time for your trial by fire.&rdquo; He got up and tossed him the keys. &ldquo;Come on, you’re driving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John just nodded and followed as Steve got up and stepped out of the supply depot. John had been on this internship for three days now and he still had that feeling of awe and majesty whenever he gazed upon the vast expanse. The green grassy fields were bounded to the north by a heavily wooded area and to the southwest by a small mountain range. The sun was on the way down by the mountains; it would be dark soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where we going?&rdquo; John asked as he stepped into the driver’s seat of the open-air off-road jeep they had been using for patrols.</p>
<p>Steve jumped into the passenger seat and gestured. &ldquo;North by northeast. Floor it, we need to be there fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John nodded and soon they were speeding down the grassy plains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we headed into the forest?&rdquo; John asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; Steve was rummaging around in the supplies in the back of the jeep. To John’s surprise, Steve pulled out a scoped hunting rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What’s going on? There’s going to be trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; Steve said, loading and readying the rifle. &ldquo;But best be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before John could ask any more questions, they both heard a loud thunderous roar ring through the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; Steve nodded. &ldquo;It’s Amethyst.&rdquo; Steve pointed to the edge of the forest. &ldquo;There! Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were still some distance away, but the dragon was large enough for John to see. Amethyst was on the ground, her amber-yellow scales glistening in the receding sunlight. Her large wings were pinned to the ground somehow and she seemed to be struggling with some sort of ropes. It was starting to get dark, but John could still see a number of small figures milling around the dragon. &ldquo;What are they doing&ndash;?&rdquo; John wondered aloud as they got closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poachers.&rdquo; A grim look took over Steve’s face as he aimed the rifle and took a shot. It was a warning shot, there was no way he would hit anything at this distance. &ldquo;Hang on Amy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poachers turned at the sound of the warning shot. John saw that there were six of them in all, and they had a large truck nearby, barely large enough to carry a small dragon. Two had trapped Amy in a net of ropes weighted down by what looked like metal drums. One of them, a stocky man with a dark tan and wearing army fatigues was shouting instructions to the others. Three were holding rifles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit, &quot; John said, recognizing the threat. He quickly braked and turned, sending the jeep into a spinning drift. &ldquo;Get down Steve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two of them ducked as shots rang overhead. The jeep skidded to a stop and John and Steve quickly spilled out the passenger side and crouched down, using the vehicle as a cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great instincts kid! Here!&rdquo; Steve tossed the rifle to John as he pulled out the walkie-talkie from his belt. &ldquo;Keep ‘em busy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nodding, John picked up the rifle. Now he understood why weapons training had been a requirement for this internship. He took a peek over the jeep’s side. The poachers were still firing, but keeping their distance. Amethyst struggled uselessly against the weighted ropes and her roars kept echoing. John fired a shot, then sat back to reload. &ldquo;I think the dragon’s wounded Steve! Her left wing looked like it was bleeding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve nodded. &ldquo;Bastards! They probably clipped her wings to force her to land.&rdquo; He spoke into the walkie-talkie again. &ldquo;Glen, Lynn, where are you? These guys are heavily-armed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten minutes out!&rdquo; a voice cackled back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not nearly quick enough,&rdquo; Steve grunted as more shots rang overhead and John managed to fire back a few times. &ldquo;You got any of them yet kid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They’re too far, I can’t get a good shot,&rdquo; John shook his head, &ldquo;I don’t understand, why doesn’t the dragon breathe on them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amy’s too young kid, just like you,&rdquo; Steve replied, &ldquo;You saw her snort out a couple of small fireballs outta her nostrils the other day right? That’s all she can do without getting exhausted.&rdquo; A few more shots rang over their heads. &ldquo;Well, we only got one shot now. Cover me.&rdquo; He reached over back into the jeep again, being careful not to expose his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don’t suppose you have a rocket launcher in there,&rdquo; John said as he fired off a couple more shots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better,&rdquo; Steve said, finally pulling out a weapon only slightly larger than a pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A flare gun? How is that going to help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn’t fire flares kid,&rdquo; Steve aimed the gun upwards. &ldquo;Watch and learn.&rdquo; He pulled the trigger. What shot out certainly looked like a flare to John, as it slowly arced upwards into the sky. At the peak of the shot, where a flare would have exploded into bright light, instead a loud roar pierced the heavens. &ldquo;Gotta hope she’s nearby…&rdquo;</p>
<p>John saw the poachers look up at the sound in alarm. &ldquo;What the heck was that?&rdquo; John asked, &ldquo;Who is nearby…?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was cut off by another roar, seemingly a short distance away, from beyond the woods. He looked to the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There we go,&rdquo; Steve grinned. &ldquo;You’re in for a treat kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A large winged figure was descending towards them quickly. &ldquo;Another dragon!&rdquo; John exclaimed, &ldquo;And she’s a lot bigger too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just any dragon, kid,&rdquo; Steve said, &ldquo;That’s Amy’s mom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her shadow was almost fifty-feet long as she flew over the two of them and circled back towards the poachers. She flew so close to the ground that her scales glistened with the reflections of the fading sunlight, and every flap of her enormous wings sent a strong gust towards John and Steve. John was pretty sure his mouth was agape.</p>
<p>The larger dragon roared again in fury. John looked behind the jeep just in time to see the poachers in a panic, dropping their ropes and guns and making a mad dash for their truck. He looked up and saw the larger dragon take a deep breath and then what seemed like pure hot boiling rage burst forward from her open jaws. The grass seemingly parted way to burnt leaves as the fiery breath scorched the ground, heading straight for the poachers.</p>
<p>The leader of the poachers was already in the truck’s driver seat, willing the engine to start. The others were scrambling into the back of the truck. But it was too late for them. The dragon caught up with them and in a matter of seconds the truck was completely wrapped in flames. With another roar, she swooped back upwards and around for another go, but it wasn’t necessary. As she turned away from the truck, it exploded into a violent ball of fire.</p>
<p>Amy cried out to the skies as her mother circled around and finally landed next to her. The mother’s majestic wings spread out as she landed and she let out another roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on kid,&rdquo; Steve said, finally getting up, &ldquo;Just stick close to me, they know who I am.&rdquo; He started jogging towards the dragons. John shook himself out of his stupor and followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We’re gonna need the water choppers over here,&rdquo; Steve was talking into the walkie-talkie again as they jogged past the burnt grass.</p>
<p>Amy and her mother let out quiet wails as they approached. Not quite roars, but more like cries of… recognition? That’s what it seemed like to John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy there, girls,&rdquo; Steve said in a soothing voice as he slowed down and walked towards the ropes holding Amy to the ground. He kicked one of the barrels the ropes was tied. &ldquo;Must be fifty pounds of rocks in there,&rdquo; he muttered as he pulled out a knife and started cutting off the ropes as the two dragons quietly looked on.</p>
<p>Finally, Amy had been cut loose. She loosed another cry again, perhaps in gratitude. &ldquo;She looks tiny in the shadow of her mother,&rdquo; was all John could say as Amy tried flapping her wings. The left wing was useless, she wouldn’t be able to fly.</p>
<p>The mother let out a subtle roar, and started flapping her wings. Steve held on to his hat as the gusts blew over them. She hovered over the two of them and Amy for a bit, before she finally grabbed the smaller dragon with her hind claws and lifted her up. The two of them took altitude and flew off towards the mountains, into the sunset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow.&rdquo; John said. Then after a while he said it again. &ldquo;Wow. That was… intense. What happens now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve nodded towards the mountains. &ldquo;She has a nest there somewhere. She’ll nurse Amy for a few weeks until the wing heals. Dragons have naturally good healing, so she’ll probably make a full recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John looked back at the charred remains of the poachers’ truck. &ldquo;Does this happen a lot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; Steve shook his head. &ldquo;They don’t often go for the dragons themselves. Couple of times a year, they’ll try raiding the nests for eggs or scales or leavings, that kind of thing. You’ll be surprised what they can get on the black market.&rdquo; He mused. &ldquo;The last time they got a live one must’ve been something like seven or eight years ago. It’s why we only have eight dragons here in the preserve. Used to be nine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No new ones have been born since then?&rdquo; John said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope. Dragon births have been getting rarer and rarer. Not enough males. We haven’t seen our male in a few months,&rdquo; Steve nodded towards the mountains again. &ldquo;Amy’s the most recent birth we know of. No one knows if there’re any in the wild. The older ones are starting to die off too, so there’s a good chance the eight we got might be the last ones ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John shook his head. &ldquo;It’s sad isn’t it, in a few generations, kids might think they’re fairy tales.&rdquo; Steve had no response, so they stood there in silence staring at the charred grass until the sounds of a helicopter started coming in from the east.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, took ‘em long enough,&rdquo; Steve muttered before gesturing John back to the jeep. &ldquo;Cheer up kid, you did good today. Who knows, maybe we make a difference. Maybe soon, dragons will be all over the world again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” Liz said, scratching her head.</p>
<p>“What’s not to understand?” The old man looked at her with a look that was somewhere between condescension and amusement. “There’s simply nothing there.”</p>
<p>“You mean like, no one lives there right? Behind your house? Or is it just a steep cliff that I’d fall off if I tried to walk into whatever that mist is?”</p>
<p>The old man shook his head, “No, no. No cliff. A cliff is something after all. There’s nothing there.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand,” Liz repeated, looking even more confused.</p>
<p>“Tell you what, why don’t you go out back, pick up a stick, and poke it through the “mist”, see what happens,” the old man turned his back to her and started fussing around with the oven again, “After all, this pie will be a few more minutes.”</p>
<p>Liz didn’t really have anything to do but wait, so she decided to satisfy her curiosity.

Beyond the yard and beyond the trees, a swirling black and grey and white shrouded her view, and she could not see anything more than a few dozen meters from the house. The black and grey and white extended in both directions, as far as her eyes could see, interspersing with the trees that dotted the landscape.</p>
<p>Slowly, Liz walked towards the mysterious black and grey and white. She glanced back at the house as she did so, the aging red-bricked walls no different from the facade she had sighted from the distance. The house looked a lot smaller up close, even though it was two stories. It must have been some trick of perspective that made it look like a mansion when she first spotted it not thirty minutes ago. Or perhaps a trick of her mind, deliriously happy to see smoke coming from t</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Philippines.</p>
<p>In the city areas, I think belief in ghosts and the like is comparable to Western countries. It may be more pronounced in the countryside. A lot of people reference local myths of course, but it&rsquo;s not like adults really believe them or anything. There&rsquo;s a lot of old wives tales too but nobody really takes them seriously afaik</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of chinese families here who practice feng shui and the like too</p>

<p>“If you’re going to kill me, then kill me,” the old man said to her without a hint of fear or desperation. “If not, then stand aside.”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding?!?” The young woman in front of him was tall and stocky, her outstretched arm holding the outgun steady not five feet in front of the old man. At this range, she would not miss. “You don’t know how long I’ve been searching for you Scorpion! You don’t deserve a quick death!”</p>
<p>She heard the crowd milling around them start to whisper and murmur. A young man stepped forward, arms raised. “Miss, please. There must be some sort of mistake. This kindly old man is our town doctor.”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “There is no mistake. For years, your little village has hidden a monster!” She addressed the old man again. “Tell them Scorpion!”</p>
<p>All eyes went to the old man and he shut his eyes for a moment. It’s been years now, and that name still haunted him. The memories came back to him easily. The smell of the blood and violence and the poetry in motion. And of course the pride. Always the pride. The Scorpion was the best, which was why he was the most well-known.</p>
<p>Finally, the old man spoke. “I haven’t heard that name in many years… May I ask who sent you?”</p>
<p>“Who sent me?” The young lady sneered. “No one sent me, old man. You probably don’t recognize me. After all, it has been more than twenty years since that night in Albany.”</p>
<p>“Albany… that house on the cliff, wasn’t it?” The old man wasn’t surprised that he could still remember it. The memories don’t really go away. He had scouted the perimeter three times before making his entrance. A sniper bullet took out the man on the balcony, then a quick climb over the fence. Two guards near the back door fell in quick succession seconds after he had drawn his knives. A maidservant was unlucky enough to be in the kitchen. She was a noncombatant, so he made sure she did not suffer. Three more guards in the upper hallway. He had loved it back then, wading into melee with multiple opponents. It was like a dance. A bloody dance as crimson spilled from their necks.</p>
<p>And finally, the bedroom. He had begged for mercy. They’re always so smug while their security was around, but they always beg for mercy in the end. He had pinned the man to the wall and carved his symbol on the man’s chest in blood. The man screamed for all of two minutes before he finally cut his throat. And then a slight noise, a movement nearby, behind him. He spun towards the armoire. He stepped forward and opened the doors wide.</p>
<p>The old man came back to the present. “I see. You were the little girl then.”</p>
<p>“Now you remember!” the woman’s calm exterior started to crumble, the rage building in her voice. “I had to listen to his screams! He was begging for mercy and you made him suffer!” This was it, this was what she had waited for all these years.</p>
<p>Her mind went back as well. All the suffering she had endured. The training she had to go through. The Scorpion was the best, they had told her. Every time she tracked down one of his contacts, it was the same warning. You’ll never get him. She had killed those contacts, but her rage never quelled. Her thirst for vengeance kept her moving forward. If the Scorpion was the best, I would have to be better. She had told herself that time and time again. She had immersed herself in his world. He had vanished off the face of the earth, she was told. But she would find him, and she would make him pay. Following the trail of contacts and clients and assassinations. She took her own contracts, built her own reputation. To earn their respect. The men who knew how to find the Scorpion.</p>
<p>She came back to the present. “They didn’t give you up easily you know. Your old clients. Your contacts. That’s why they all died, slowly. I had to piece together your movements slowly. And finally, where do I find you? Some small backwater village, playing doctor?!?” She sneered again. “I was looking for The Scorpion, the best assassin there ever was! I was ready to show you how I had surpassed you, to make you pay for your sins! And I find you here, this decrepit old man?” She shook her head. “Don’t worry, I’ll make sure you suffer!”</p>
<p>The young man from the crowd turned to the old man. “Doc… is it true, what she’s saying? Are you this… Scorpion?”</p>
<p>“It was a long time ago. I was a different person then…” the old man said.</p>
<p>The woman moved quickly, stepping forward and whipping the old man across the face with the pistol before anyone could react. “A different person? Don’t make me laugh!” she said as the old man staggered back and leaned against the wall. She addressed the crowd. “Murderers don’t change people! He’s a wolf, and he’s been hiding among you sheep for so long, waiting for another chance to bare his fangs!”</p>
<p>The old man spat out some blood and stood up straight again. “You’re a different person too you know,” he said, looking her in the eye. “There was fear in your eyes back then to be sure. But innocence too. And I took it away. I apologize. I may have spared you, but I also condemned you to this life. Your father was not the only life I took in that bedroom that night.”</p>
<p>“Enough!” The woman cocked her gun and aimed it at the old man’s leg. “I don’t need to be told what I’ve lost old man! I’ll blow off your legs, then your arms, then let you bleed out for hours, how does that sound?”</p>
<p>“Please, wait,” the young man said. “He may have been the monster you say, but as our doctor, he’s helped us greatly. He’s a different person now, he’s kind and gentle and&ndash;”
“&ndash;he doesn’t even ask for ourmoney,” one of the old women in the crowd spoke up. “We just pay him in vegetables or invite him over for dinner…”</p>
<p>“&hellip;an’ he took care o’ my ma when she couldn’t work,” a little boy, perhaps no more than twelve was speaking up, “he helped us bring her goods to the merchants, so we could eat…”</p>
<p>Another spoke up, speaking of the old man’s kindness. Then two more, then another. Finally, the woman raised her gun in the air and fired a shot. The bang silenced the crowd and many of them stepped back.</p>
<p>“Shut up, all of you!” the woman said with a quivering voice, “You don’t know this man! He’s killed dozens, maybe hundreds over the years! A few acts of kindness won’t excuse that!”</p>
<p>“B-but,” the young man spoke again, “if he has killed so many people, why did he spare you?”</p>
<p>The woman was silent for a moment. Then she pointed the gun at the old man’s head again. “I don’t know old man, why <em>did</em> you spare me? You’re the Scorpion, you were a merciless killer. Why the moment of weakness?”</p>
<p>“Weakness was it?” The old man spoke again, calmly and softly. “It’s true, I had taken many lives before that night. But I had never killed a child.” He looked her in the eye again. “I told you, I saw the innocence in your eyes. It changed me. And I fled. If you spoke to my clients, you know I never took the payment for that night. And I have never killed again.”</p>
<p>“Never killed again?!? What bullshit is this old man? You expect me to believe that?” She was practically shouting at his face. “Everyone I spoke to, they told me about The Scorpion’s bloodlust, his need to kill. And you expect me to believe you just walked away from that?!?”</p>
<p>He looked at her, this time with pity. “You can’t imagine it, can you? Because you have it now. That bloodlust, that rage. You can’t imagine your heart changing so much that it takes it all away. You’ve lived with this rage for so long, you can’t imagine life without it. I am truly sorry.”</p>
<p>She spun her arm around to pistol-whip him again, but this time the old man caught her arm in mid-air. Her rage momentarily gave way to surprise, then almost immediately to alertness. She quickly wrested her arm and stepped back. “I knew it. Your old instincts, all still there eh?”</p>
<p>He did not answer her but instead pointed towards the far end of the town plaza. “Those two men you shot. They are still alive. Let me tend to their wounds, stabilize them. Afterwards, you can do with me as you wish.”</p>
<p>Her eyebrow went up. “Hah! You’re just going to let me kill you?”</p>
<p>“You said I deserved it, didn’t you? I won’t disagree.” He picked up the small bag he had dropped earlier. “My medical instruments, don’t worry.” He started walking slowly towards the injured men. “As you can see, I could not run from you even if I wanted.”</p>
<p>She looked skeptical, but she let him pass and followed just behind him. The small crowd followed them. The old man knelt beside one of the victims, who had been shot in the shoulder. He began tending the wounds. She watched him silently.</p>
<p>“Perhaps it is fitting that you should be the one to kill me,” the old man spoke finally as he moved on to the second victim. “After all, you were the one who changed me.” She didn’t respond so he kept going. “I tried to kill myself you know. I could never do it. The famous killer, afraid to take his own life. Finally I decided, I could not take back the sins of my past, but perhaps I can balance the scales, even a little bit. I’ve been a doctor here for almost eight years now, but I fear I’m no longer as strong as I used to be. I would not have been of use to them much longer. And so I can at least give you your vengeance. One final act of atonement.” He finished dressing the wound.</p>
<p>He stood up and looked at her. “I can only hope that you too find someone to change you, once you have taken your vengeance. Perhaps you can move on, and this cycle of death can end.”</p>
<p>“Move on?” She finally spoke again, slowly and in a lower voice this time, all trace of rage gone, only bitterness remained. “To what? I don’t have anything, old man.” She raised her gun again. “All I have is vengeance. All I have is the monster I’ve been hunting down all my life. And now I find the monster is gone!”</p>
<p>He stepped towards her slowly. She did not waver, her arm outstretched. “Then there is but one more monster to slay,” the old man said. This time he reached his own hand out and tapped her chest lightly. “The monster you have become.”</p>
<p>She wept, and fell to her knees.</p>

<p>Thank you for the kind words. I have something rolling about in my head about how Alex and Harry&rsquo;s relationship devolve into what it&rsquo;s going to be. I may write it up someday.</p>

<p>So, the current surviving Clark Kent/Superman is supposedly pre-Flashpoint Superman, and New 52 Superman is dead right?</p>
<p>But Pre-Flashpoint Wally West coming out of the speed force and restoring New 52 Barry&rsquo;s memories implies that New 52 Barry is the same as Pre-Flashpoint Barry. Shouldn&rsquo;t this also mean that New 52 Superman should be the same Superman from Pre-Flashpoint? Is this discrepancy something that&rsquo;s been explained somewhere? Or we just accept that Barry and Superman transitioned differently and handwave it away. &ldquo;Comics, everbody!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I like interesting battle systems. Is there some place that documents what are the best things about the Pokemon battle system for someone who doesn&rsquo;t play the games?</p>

<p>The building had a nondescript white exterior, with a single grey metal door on the facade and no other hint of what lie within. I tried the knob and a metallic rattle told me it was locked. I frowned, then remembered, then pulled out the mysterious envelope I had found under my door yesterday. I mean, 93 years from now. Well, not 93 years from now for me. Yesterday for me. God, I need to figure out how to think of time again.</p>
<p>I opened the envelope, equally nondescript as the building exterior, and shook it a bit. The small key fell out of it and I almost miss catching it. Harold would have sneered derisively if he was here. &ldquo;World&rsquo;s clumsiest time traveller!&rdquo; he would have said.</p>
<p>Harold. Harry. Good old Harry. The argument had been gone sour last night. Will have gone sour? &ldquo;Why should we go? We have no idea what this is. No idea!&rdquo; he had exclaimed, gesturing wildly as he was wont to do.</p>
<p>I inserted the small key into the lock on the doorknob, and sure enough it clicked into place. I turned the knob and stepped inside.</p>
<p>Harry was always the smart one. The prudent one. He had all these rules. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t risk collapsing the universe!&rdquo; or some such theoretical physics bullshit. He&rsquo;d be hopping mad if he knew I&rsquo;d actually gone. Well, he doesn&rsquo;t need to know, it&rsquo;s a fucking time machine isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ll be back before he knows it.</p>
<p>Behind the door was a long and dimly lit corridor. The only sound was the subtle whirring of a large ceiling fan overhead. Well, that and the creaking of the metal door as I shut it back into place.</p>
<p>A desk. There was a desk. And behind it, a person. A stocky woman, her hair tied in a bun, wearing spectacles. She looked up from what looked like a sudoku puzzle as I stepped closer. Did they even have sudoku in 1923? I reached into my pocket for the envelope again.</p>
<p>I needn&rsquo;t have bothered. &ldquo;Mr. Reyes, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; She nodded towards the far end of the hallway. &ldquo;Take the elevator at the end. There&rsquo;s only one stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er, I was hoping to ask&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pl</p>
