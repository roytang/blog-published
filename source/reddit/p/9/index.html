<p>As a Filipino living in the Philippines, I can tell you he&rsquo;s not exactly the most consistent person spewing out reliable statements. Even during the campaign period he had a tendency to flip-flop especially when people call him out, and even his own spokespeople often give different &ldquo;interpretations&rdquo; of his nonsenical ramblings. If you believe he doesn&rsquo;t want to stay in power, you should also believe his threat to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to declare martial law if she doesn&rsquo;t toe the line, or his threat to leave the UN if they aren&rsquo;t more polite or something</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Sketchbook Pro since that&rsquo;s what I use for my sketching, but I find that my hands are very uneven at drawing the speech bubbles, so I&rsquo;m hoping for something that includes a smoothing process for the lines, and also a way to input multiple lines of text easily</p>

<p>For example, some suggestions I would make:</p>
<ul>
<li>for the president to come out with a strongly worded message enjoining law enforcement to observe proper procedures, rules of engagement and due process</li>
<li>provide regular summary reports, probably weekly of the progress of the &ldquo;drug war&rdquo;: how many buy bust operations, how many drug dealers captured alive, how many died in encounters, how many died while in custody, and so on</li>
<li>provide and publicize a channel/process for family members of people alleged killed unjustly in police operations to air their grievances and file cases. Provide protection and legal counsel (via the PAO?) as needed</li>
<li>related to above, appoint someone to be in charge of investigating extrajudicial killings. that person should provide regular weekly update reports on the cases being investigated and act as a spokesman for the PNP (I assume he would be from the PNP) on this matter and liaise with the senate and the CHR for any investigations</li>
<li>provide regular reports on the status of the vigilante/cardboard killing cases</li>
</ul>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>Edit, some additional:</p>
<ul>
<li>automatically perform autopsy on any alleged criminals killed in a police encounter. Check for powder burns, prints on the weapon, and so on, and regularly release these autopsy reports to promote transparency</li>
<li>conduct re-training for police on how to handle suspects in custody to avoid &ldquo;nang-agaw ng baril&rdquo; even though naka handcuffs. Punish policemen na naagawan pa rin ng baril kahit nakaposas na</li>
</ul>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Play-wise, it&rsquo;s impossible to predict what kind of decks there&rsquo;ll be in March, so just practice general tight play for now.</p>
<p>Aside from that, the biggest difference a large tournament like a GP has compared to an FNM is the sheer length of the tournament. I&rsquo;m not sure how large GPs in your area get, but I would typically expect 9 or 10 rounds on the first day. If you&rsquo;re used to just playing 4-5 rounds of FNM, it can get exhausting. You need to build up both your physical and mental stamina. So what I would suggest is playing at other large tournaments near you to start getting used to it. 7-8 rounds should be fine, if you have trouble looking for something with at least 9 rounds. PPTQs and SCG stuff are your best bet, although some stores might have larger GPT events too if they have a large enough playerbase.</p>

<p>I currently have the 4th generation iPad (the first one with retina display), and I&rsquo;ve tried using third-party styluses with them but am never satisfied, it always feel imprecise. I&rsquo;ve tried drawing with just my fingers and while it&rsquo;s more precise it also feels a bit more tiring</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of getting an iPad Pro next month. How much better would it be to use the Apple Pencil?</p>

<p>Improvement always comes with practice. The improvement may be slow or it may be quick, depending on how focused you are on improving. Even without specifically focusing on improvement, sheer repetition will make you better in some aspect. Maybe your lines will be straighter or your proportions a bit better or you&rsquo;ll draw a bit faster</p>

<p>The main issues are (1) word gender (a concept that exists in neither English nor Filipino), (2) subject-verb agreement (unlike English where the choice is simply between singular and plural, Spanish adds the complication of different verb forms depending on first, second or third person, with variations depending on gender and singular/plural), and (3) object pronouns, that shit is hard. These are the main issues you have to focus on in order to have relatively decent grammar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at 50% Spanish fluency, I started like early 2015. I think I actually got to 60+% fluency but I stopped for a few months so it dropped. When I started I would keep each category at full strength - whenever one of them dropped I would go back and strengthen it again, but that led to slow progress. This time I&rsquo;m going through all the categories first (I&rsquo;m down to the last 10 or so categories), then will go back and reinforce them later. Not sure if this will be more effective, but I figure I would go wide first then strengthen those places where I turn out to be weak</p>
<p>As with all sorts of learning, the key is really to practice, practice, practice. Devote time and energy to it. It would help if you had a Spanish-speaking friend you could talk to regularly</p>

Need some help</a></h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for anyone who has a physical CD copy of their album &ldquo;Time and Chance&rdquo;, specifically the Philippine release. This version has an extra track at the end titled &ldquo;I Remember&rdquo;, which does not appear in most releases in other countries. I am not sure which countries&rsquo; releases had this track, but for sure it is in the Ph version. I would like to get a digital copy of this track. It is not on iTunes, Spotify, torrents, etc, so the best chance is if someone could rip it from the actual CD. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p>RPG/Platformer/Metroidvania</p>

<p>A friend and I played it back in the Famicom days, we had to study katakana/hiragana to figure out how to advance.

<p>I&rsquo;m looking to focus on Modern until maybe end of the year, so I probably won&rsquo;t be using my Jace playset until it rotates out. I like to keep a playset around of mythics I enjoyed using though, but in this case, would it be better to sell them off now (while he still has another set&rsquo;s worth of time in standard legality) and rebuy later?</p>

<p>Hey, looking for some advice. Here&rsquo;s the deck I played at the last tournament: <a href="http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=12828&amp;d=274476&amp;f=MO">http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=12828&amp;d=274476&amp;f=MO</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mostly fine with the main deck (except maybe Tamiyo, a bit weak, if I think of something better in that slot I might swap her out). I&rsquo;m not playing Nahiri because I don&rsquo;t have time to get them before Saturday, and also because I&rsquo;m quite used to this build already and in Modern I prefer piloting the deck I already really know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of tweaking the sideboard. No idea the meta to expect for this weekend&rsquo;s WMCQ so I want to hit as wide a base as possible.</p>
<p>Permission magic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking of changing 1 Negate 2 Dispel to 2 Negate 1 Dispel to give better game against Tron</li>
<li>Counterflux. This slot is really only good vs Storm, is it worth it? I figure vs Storm you just always stop the start of the storm chain instead of the end, so maybe not worth it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Anti-aggro:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Supreme Verdict or 1 Anger of the Gods + 1 Supreme Verdict? Or should I free up another slot and have 1 Anger + 2 Verdict?</li>
<li>is Shatterstorm even good against Affinity or should I have 2 Stony Silence instead? (I don&rsquo;t have the 2nd Stony yet though&hellip;)</li>
</ul>
<p>GY hate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relic or RIP? RIP turns off GY stuff forever while Relic is a one-off, but RIP is symmetrical so it turns off my own Snaps</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, is there some guide somewhere that tells me what&rsquo;s the optimal number to choose for EE in various matchups? I just got this EE, so I&rsquo;m not to used to boarding it in.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions? What matchups should I look out for? Thanks!</p>

<h4 id="posted-on-rmodernmagic-jeskai-sideboard-choiceshttpsredditcomrmodernmagiccomments4rspgdjeskai_sideboard_choices">Posted on r/ModernMagic: <a href="https://reddit.com/r/ModernMagic/comments/4rspgd/jeskai_sideboard_choices/">Jeskai sideboard choices</a></h4>
<p>Hey, looking for some advice. Here&rsquo;s the deck I played at the last tournament: <a href="http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=12828&amp;d=274476&amp;f=MO">http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=12828&amp;d=274476&amp;f=MO</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mostly fine with the main deck (except maybe Tamiyo, a bit weak, if I think of something better in that slot I might swap her out). I&rsquo;m not playing Nahiri because I don&rsquo;t have time to get them before Saturday, and also because I&rsquo;m quite used to this build already and in Modern I prefer piloting the deck I already really know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of tweaking the sideboard. No idea the meta to expect for this weekend&rsquo;s WMCQ so I want to hit as wide a base as possible.</p>
<p>Permission magic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking of changing 1 Negate 2 Dispel to 2 Negate 1 Dispel to give better game against Tron</li>
<li>Counterflux. This slot is really only good vs Storm, is it worth it? I figure vs Storm you just always stop the start of the storm chain instead of the end, so maybe not worth it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Anti-aggro:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Supreme Verdict or 1 Anger of the Gods + 1 Supreme Verdict? Or should I free up another slot and have 1 Anger + 2 Verdict?</li>
<li>is Shatterstorm even good against Affinity or should I have 2 Stony Silence instead? (I don&rsquo;t have the 2nd Stony yet though&hellip;)</li>
</ul>
<p>GY hate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relic or RIP? RIP turns off GY stuff forever while Relic is a one-off, but RIP is symmetrical so it turns off my own Snaps</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: Also, is there some guide somewhere that tells me what&rsquo;s the optimal number to choose for EE in various matchups? I just got this EE, so I&rsquo;m not to used to boarding it in.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions? What matchups should I look out for? Thanks!</p>

<p>My vote goes to Stay Out of My Path by /u/MindInTheClouds, it was the one I most enjoyed reading.</p>
<p>As an aside, I want to say I&rsquo;m very happy I made it to this round of the contest. It&rsquo;s a pleasant surprise since I basically decided to join at the last minute and rushed out an entry on the day of the deadline. This is officially my excuse for any poor editing on my part :D</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fairly new to this sub, so IDK how often contests like these are held, but I look forward to participating in the next one (and I&rsquo;ll try to start earlier next time!). I&rsquo;ve already learned a lot, and I&rsquo;d like to say thanks to everyone who read my entry and who voted for me and gave me feedback, it&rsquo;s been great :D</p>

<p>This happened to me back in the late 90s. I think I passed even less than 23 units :p Yes, you will be in probation for one sem. I don&rsquo;t remember if I wrote a letter of appeal, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard if you need to, just promise to focus more on your studies and to do better (and you really should! Engg won&rsquo;t give you another chance)</p>
<p>I suggest you talk to your adviser before following any advice from this thread.</p>

<p>150k isn&rsquo;t a lot, it can vanish in an instant if you&rsquo;re not careful. Put your money in a savings account first, you&rsquo;ll need it as a buffer for emergency expenses. You only have a year of college left, prioritize finishing that, then look for a decent job.</p>
<p>Try to track your expenses, don&rsquo;t spend too much on unnecessary things until you have stable income. If you have time, take on some part-time work while finishing your studies.</p>

<p>This is already on the second visit to Lignatore. I had already defeated the boss and there was the cutscene and everything, then I realized I didn&rsquo;t get this box and I probably won&rsquo;t be able to get it. I still have this save game that&rsquo;s right before the boss before I go to Mysticete, wondering if whatever is in there is worth re-loading to try to get it :p</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>&ldquo;What? Where?&rdquo; Steve muttered over the cackle of his walkie-talkie. He dropped his fork on the plateful of bacon and started packing up. &ldquo;I’m nearest, I’ll be there ASAP. Have Glen and Lynn follow me as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His companion was looking at him quizzically from across the table. &ldquo;Relax, John. You didn’t screw up this time. In fact, I guess it’s time for your trial by fire.&rdquo; He got up and tossed him the keys. &ldquo;Come on, you’re driving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John just nodded and followed as Steve got up and stepped out of the supply depot. John had been on this internship for three days now and he still had that feeling of awe and majesty whenever he gazed upon the vast expanse. The green grassy fields were bounded to the north by a heavily wooded area and to the southwest by a small mountain range. The sun was on the way down by the mountains; it would be dark soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where we going?&rdquo; John asked as he stepped into the driver’s seat of the open-air off-road jeep they had been using for patrols.</p>
<p>Steve jumped into the passenger seat and gestured. &ldquo;North by northeast. Floor it, we need to be there fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John nodded and soon they were speeding down the grassy plains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we headed into the forest?&rdquo; John asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; Steve was rummaging around in the supplies in the back of the jeep. To John’s surprise, Steve pulled out a scoped hunting rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What’s going on? There’s going to be trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; Steve said, loading and readying the rifle. &ldquo;But best be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before John could ask any more questions, they both heard a loud thunderous roar ring through the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; Steve nodded. &ldquo;It’s Amethyst.&rdquo; Steve pointed to the edge of the forest. &ldquo;There! Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were still some distance away, but the dragon was large enough for John to see. Amethyst was on the ground, her amber-yellow scales glistening in the receding sunlight. Her large wings were pinned to the ground somehow and she seemed to be struggling with some sort of ropes. It was starting to get dark, but John could still see a number of small figures milling around the dragon. &ldquo;What are they doing&ndash;?&rdquo; John wondered aloud as they got closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poachers.&rdquo; A grim look took over Steve’s face as he aimed the rifle and took a shot. It was a warning shot, there was no way he would hit anything at this distance. &ldquo;Hang on Amy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poachers turned at the sound of the warning shot. John saw that there were six of them in all, and they had a large truck nearby, barely large enough to carry a small dragon. Two had trapped Amy in a net of ropes weighted down by what looked like metal drums. One of them, a stocky man with a dark tan and wearing army fatigues was shouting instructions to the others. Three were holding rifles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit, &quot; John said, recognizing the threat. He quickly braked and turned, sending the jeep into a spinning drift. &ldquo;Get down Steve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two of them ducked as shots rang overhead. The jeep skidded to a stop and John and Steve quickly spilled out the passenger side and crouched down, using the vehicle as a cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great instincts kid! Here!&rdquo; Steve tossed the rifle to John as he pulled out the walkie-talkie from his belt. &ldquo;Keep ‘em busy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nodding, John picked up the rifle. Now he understood why weapons training had been a requirement for this internship. He took a peek over the jeep’s side. The poachers were still firing, but keeping their distance. Amethyst struggled uselessly against the weighted ropes and her roars kept echoing. John fired a shot, then sat back to reload. &ldquo;I think the dragon’s wounded Steve! Her left wing looked like it was bleeding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve nodded. &ldquo;Bastards! They probably clipped her wings to force her to land.&rdquo; He spoke into the walkie-talkie again. &ldquo;Glen, Lynn, where are you? These guys are heavily-armed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten minutes out!&rdquo; a voice cackled back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not nearly quick enough,&rdquo; Steve grunted as more shots rang overhead and John managed to fire back a few times. &ldquo;You got any of them yet kid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They’re too far, I can’t get a good shot,&rdquo; John shook his head, &ldquo;I don’t understand, why doesn’t the dragon breathe on them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amy’s too young kid, just like you,&rdquo; Steve replied, &ldquo;You saw her snort out a couple of small fireballs outta her nostrils the other day right? That’s all she can do without getting exhausted.&rdquo; A few more shots rang over their heads. &ldquo;Well, we only got one shot now. Cover me.&rdquo; He reached over back into the jeep again, being careful not to expose his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don’t suppose you have a rocket launcher in there,&rdquo; John said as he fired off a couple more shots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better,&rdquo; Steve said, finally pulling out a weapon only slightly larger than a pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A flare gun? How is that going to help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn’t fire flares kid,&rdquo; Steve aimed the gun upwards. &ldquo;Watch and learn.&rdquo; He pulled the trigger. What shot out certainly looked like a flare to John, as it slowly arced upwards into the sky. At the peak of the shot, where a flare would have exploded into bright light, instead a loud roar pierced the heavens. &ldquo;Gotta hope she’s nearby…&rdquo;</p>
<p>John saw the poachers look up at the sound in alarm. &ldquo;What the heck was that?&rdquo; John asked, &ldquo;Who is nearby…?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was cut off by another roar, seemingly a short distance away, from beyond the woods. He looked to the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There we go,&rdquo; Steve grinned. &ldquo;You’re in for a treat kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A large winged figure was descending towards them quickly. &ldquo;Another dragon!&rdquo; John exclaimed, &ldquo;And she’s a lot bigger too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just any dragon, kid,&rdquo; Steve said, &ldquo;That’s Amy’s mom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her shadow was almost fifty-feet long as she flew over the two of them and circled back towards the poachers. She flew so close to the ground that her scales glistened with the reflections of the fading sunlight, and every flap of her enormous wings sent a strong gust towards John and Steve. John was pretty sure his mouth was agape.</p>
<p>The larger dragon roared again in fury. John looked behind the jeep just in time to see the poachers in a panic, dropping their ropes and guns and making a mad dash for their truck. He looked up and saw the larger dragon take a deep breath and then what seemed like pure hot boiling rage burst forward from her open jaws. The grass seemingly parted way to burnt leaves as the fiery breath scorched the ground, heading straight for the poachers.</p>
<p>The leader of the poachers was already in the truck’s driver seat, willing the engine to start. The others were scrambling into the back of the truck. But it was too late for them. The dragon caught up with them and in a matter of seconds the truck was completely wrapped in flames. With another roar, she swooped back upwards and around for another go, but it wasn’t necessary. As she turned away from the truck, it exploded into a violent ball of fire.</p>
<p>Amy cried out to the skies as her mother circled around and finally landed next to her. The mother’s majestic wings spread out as she landed and she let out another roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on kid,&rdquo; Steve said, finally getting up, &ldquo;Just stick close to me, they know who I am.&rdquo; He started jogging towards the dragons. John shook himself out of his stupor and followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We’re gonna need the water choppers over here,&rdquo; Steve was talking into the walkie-talkie again as they jogged past the burnt grass.</p>
<p>Amy and her mother let out quiet wails as they approached. Not quite roars, but more like cries of… recognition? That’s what it seemed like to John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy there, girls,&rdquo; Steve said in a soothing voice as he slowed down and walked towards the ropes holding Amy to the ground. He kicked one of the barrels the ropes was tied. &ldquo;Must be fifty pounds of rocks in there,&rdquo; he muttered as he pulled out a knife and started cutting off the ropes as the two dragons quietly looked on.</p>
<p>Finally, Amy had been cut loose. She loosed another cry again, perhaps in gratitude. &ldquo;She looks tiny in the shadow of her mother,&rdquo; was all John could say as Amy tried flapping her wings. The left wing was useless, she wouldn’t be able to fly.</p>
<p>The mother let out a subtle roar, and started flapping her wings. Steve held on to his hat as the gusts blew over them. She hovered over the two of them and Amy for a bit, before she finally grabbed the smaller dragon with her hind claws and lifted her up. The two of them took altitude and flew off towards the mountains, into the sunset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow.&rdquo; John said. Then after a while he said it again. &ldquo;Wow. That was… intense. What happens now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve nodded towards the mountains. &ldquo;She has a nest there somewhere. She’ll nurse Amy for a few weeks until the wing heals. Dragons have naturally good healing, so she’ll probably make a full recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John looked back at the charred remains of the poachers’ truck. &ldquo;Does this happen a lot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; Steve shook his head. &ldquo;They don’t often go for the dragons themselves. Couple of times a year, they’ll try raiding the nests for eggs or scales or leavings, that kind of thing. You’ll be surprised what they can get on the black market.&rdquo; He mused. &ldquo;The last time they got a live one must’ve been something like seven or eight years ago. It’s why we only have eight dragons here in the preserve. Used to be nine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No new ones have been born since then?&rdquo; John said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope. Dragon births have been getting rarer and rarer. Not enough males. We haven’t seen our male in a few months,&rdquo; Steve nodded towards the mountains again. &ldquo;Amy’s the most recent birth we know of. No one knows if there’re any in the wild. The older ones are starting to die off too, so there’s a good chance the eight we got might be the last ones ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John shook his head. &ldquo;It’s sad isn’t it, in a few generations, kids might think they’re fairy tales.&rdquo; Steve had no response, so they stood there in silence staring at the charred grass until the sounds of a helicopter started coming in from the east.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, took ‘em long enough,&rdquo; Steve muttered before gesturing John back to the jeep. &ldquo;Cheer up kid, you did good today. Who knows, maybe we make a difference. Maybe soon, dragons will be all over the world again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” Liz said, scratching her head.</p>
<p>“What’s not to understand?” The old man looked at her with a look that was somewhere between condescension and amusement. “There’s simply nothing there.”</p>
<p>“You mean like, no one lives there right? Behind your house? Or is it just a steep cliff that I’d fall off if I tried to walk into whatever that mist is?”</p>
<p>The old man shook his head, “No, no. No cliff. A cliff is something after all. There’s nothing there.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand,” Liz repeated, looking even more confused.</p>
<p>“Tell you what, why don’t you go out back, pick up a stick, and poke it through the “mist”, see what happens,” the old man turned his back to her and started fussing around with the oven again, “After all, this pie will be a few more minutes.”</p>
<p>Liz didn’t really have anything to do but wait, so she decided to satisfy her curiosity. She still wasn’t sure if she could fully trust the old man (although he didn’t look he was in any condition to assault anyone), so she picked up her backpack before heading out the door at the back of the kitchen.</p>
<p>She stepped out into a small, grassy back yard (not very well-maintained) surrounded by a number of trees of varying age. Beyond the yard and beyond the trees, a swirling black and grey and white shrouded her view, and she could not see anything more than a few dozen meters from the house. The black and grey and white extended in both directions, as far as her eyes could see, interspersing with the trees that dotted the landscape.</p>
<p>Slowly, Liz walked towards the mysterious black and grey and white. She glanced back at the house as she did so, the aging red-bricked walls no different from the facade she had sighted from the distance. The house looked a lot smaller up close, even though it was two stories. It must have been some trick of perspective that made it look like a mansion when she first spotted it not thirty minutes ago. Or perhaps a trick of her mind, deliriously happy to see smoke coming from t</p>

<p>In the city areas, I think belief in ghosts and the like is comparable to Western countries. It may be more pronounced in the countryside. A lot of people reference local myths of course, but it&rsquo;s not like adults really believe them or anything. There&rsquo;s a lot of old wives tales too but nobody really takes them seriously afaik</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of chinese families here who practice feng shui and the like too</p>
