<p>Do we know their current ages and when they became Robin, and for how long? I mean, I know Damian is ten years old right now. And Dick is always drawn like he&rsquo;s maybe 21 or something? But given that Dick started being Robin at around 9 or 10, that means Batman has been Batman for more than a decade?</p>
<p>Obviously it&rsquo;s all &ldquo;comic book time&rdquo;, but I just want to get an idea of how long ago and for what duration each of them (Dick, Jason, Tim, Damian) were Robin in the New 52 universe.</p>

<p>When people download something using the bittorrent protocol, there needs to be one or more &ldquo;seeds&rdquo;. These are computers that are providing the material to be downloaded. When one is &ldquo;seeding torrents&rdquo; it means they&rsquo;re making available the contents of that torrent for download by others. If there&rsquo;s no one seeding, the contents can&rsquo;t be downloaded.</p>

I have a question</a></h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m just curious how long it takes them to send out the prize money? I placed in a GP a bit more than a month ago (Manila) and they said I&rsquo;d be receiving some notification by e-mail if the check has been sent out. I&rsquo;m curious as to when I should expect it.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for the responses! Looks like I have to wait a while more.</p>

<p>I joined a tournament, and was doing fine until a round where I had to use a lance while mounted, and I seem to be really bad at it and can&rsquo;t hit anything at all. Any tips for using mounted lances?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a picture: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DOcPX.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/DOcPX.jpg</a> (the glare is hiding the brightness bar). I&rsquo;ve had this monitor for a while, I guess something is loose? Pressing the menu buttons on the side doesn&rsquo;t help (I can&rsquo;t even adjust the brightness to a value other than 100)</p>
<p>Any ideas for a quick fix aside from taking it to some shop to be repaired? I&rsquo;d rather not have to open up the monitor.</p>

<p>I mean, it looks like a main book based on the first few pages with Mockingbird, Wolverine, Ms Marvel, Black Panther, Red Hulk, and other current Avengers on the team, but the cover features the ones who&rsquo;ve appeared in the movie only. Also, as far as I know the current green Hulk is bald and intelligent, while the Hulk in this book has hair and seems less intelligent. So&hellip;which is it?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>In such cases, the judge basically has to listen to each player&rsquo;s explanation and make a judgment as to who is more likely to be telling the truth.</p>
<p>In this case, the UW player is clearly caught with the Batterskull in hand which was sent to the bottom of the library just the last turn, with the only shuffle of his deck being the one where he scooped it into his hand. A judge would be easily able to determine it in this case.</p>
<p>It reminds me of something that happened in GP Manila a couple of weekends ago. One guy had accused his opponent of drawing extra cards and the head judge had to intervene to straighten things out. The head judge basically managed to count every single card the guy had drawn since the start of the game and proved conclusively that the other guy had drawn at least one extra card. The onlookers were very impressed.</p>

I have some questions</a></h4>
<p>I have a 500 GB WD external HDD, and a friend told me I could take it out of it&rsquo;s case and use it as the replacement HDD for the PS3. Can someone confirm that this will work? (I don&rsquo;t want to take apart the drive just to find out it won&rsquo;t work with the PS3).</p>
<p>All the youtube guides I&rsquo;ve seen are saying to get a laptop hard drive but those are more expensive and I already have this external available.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>It should be tied to the PSN account that purchases it. You&rsquo;d have to have the same account available on both systems in order to download the game.</p>
<p>Once you have downloaded the game to a system, any account on that system can play the game (as long as the original account used to download it is still on the system)</p>
