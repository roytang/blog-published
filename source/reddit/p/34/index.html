I have a question</a></h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m just curious how long it takes them to send out the prize money? I placed in a GP a bit more than a month ago (Manila) and they said I&rsquo;d be receiving some notification by e-mail if the check has been sent out. I&rsquo;m curious as to when I should expect it.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for the responses! Looks like I have to wait a while more.</p>

<p>I joined a tournament, and was doing fine until a round where I had to use a lance while mounted, and I seem to be really bad at it and can&rsquo;t hit anything at all. Any tips for using mounted lances?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a picture: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DOcPX.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/DOcPX.jpg</a> (the glare is hiding the brightness bar). I&rsquo;ve had this monitor for a while, I guess something is loose? Pressing the menu buttons on the side doesn&rsquo;t help (I can&rsquo;t even adjust the brightness to a value other than 100)</p>
<p>Any ideas for a quick fix aside from taking it to some shop to be repaired? I&rsquo;d rather not have to open up the monitor.</p>

<p>I mean, it looks like a main book based on the first few pages with Mockingbird, Wolverine, Ms Marvel, Black Panther, Red Hulk, and other current Avengers on the team, but the cover features the ones who&rsquo;ve appeared in the movie only. Also, as far as I know the current green Hulk is bald and intelligent, while the Hulk in this book has hair and seems less intelligent. So&hellip;which is it?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>In such cases, the judge basically has to listen to each player&rsquo;s explanation and make a judgment as to who is more likely to be telling the truth.</p>
<p>In this case, the UW player is clearly caught with the Batterskull in hand which was sent to the bottom of the library just the last turn, with the only shuffle of his deck being the one where he scooped it into his hand. A judge would be easily able to determine it in this case.</p>
<p>It reminds me of something that happened in GP Manila a couple of weekends ago. One guy had accused his opponent of drawing extra cards and the head judge had to intervene to straighten things out. The head judge basically managed to count every single card the guy had drawn since the start of the game and proved conclusively that the other guy had drawn at least one extra card. The onlookers were very impressed.</p>

I have some questions</a></h4>
<p>I have a 500 GB WD external HDD, and a friend told me I could take it out of it&rsquo;s case and use it as the replacement HDD for the PS3. Can someone confirm that this will work? (I don&rsquo;t want to take apart the drive just to find out it won&rsquo;t work with the PS3).</p>
<p>All the youtube guides I&rsquo;ve seen are saying to get a laptop hard drive but those are more expensive and I already have this external available.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>It should be tied to the PSN account that purchases it. You&rsquo;d have to have the same account available on both systems in order to download the game.</p>
<p>Once you have downloaded the game to a system, any account on that system can play the game (as long as the original account used to download it is still on the system)</p>

<p>If you have two sublime archangels, they grant each other an extra instance of exalted, i.e. the lone attacker gets +4/+4</p>
<p>With three, it&rsquo;s +9/+9, with four it&rsquo;s +16/+16</p>
<p>This is a standard of clones (Phantasmal Image/Phyrexian Metamorph). Sounds fun :D</p>

<p>&hellip;she wakes up in the hospital and the doctor says her twins have already been delivered, a boy and a girl. But since she wasn&rsquo;t around to name them, they had to ask her brother to give them legal names.</p>
<p>The woman was worried, because her brother was a bit of an idiot. &ldquo;What did he name them?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He named the girl Denise,&rdquo; the doctor said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a nice name,&rdquo; she said in relief. &ldquo;What did he name the boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Denephew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If he plays the Death Wind after blockers are assigned, you do not take damage. Blocked creatures remain blocked even if the blocker is removed.</p>
<p>In order to deal damage to you, he would have to Death Wind before you block.</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tky0d/i_am_not_a_religious_person_but_dont_you_think/c4nihhz/">a comment by Thnito_Kyrios on &#39;I am not a religious person but don&#39;t you think that you shouldn&#39;t be subscribed to r/atheism automatically like you are not subscribed to r/christianity or r/islam or r/judaism?&#39; on /r/AskReddit</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>That means it sort of feeds itself doesn&rsquo;t it? Once you get into the top subscribed, it&rsquo;s hard to fall out since new users are subbed by default. Unless there&rsquo;s a massive unsubing campaign by existing subs.</p>

<p>The phone is from my brother, though I&rsquo;ve done a reset to clear his data from the phone. It&rsquo;s an LG Optimus Pro c660 with Cyanogen something installed (it&rsquo;s like a custom OS build right?) it says it&rsquo;s android 2.3 somewhere</p>
<p>My question is: I tried downloading some apps like Google Goggles and Instagram, but the Play store tells me those apps are not compatible with the device. Is this sort of thing a restriction of the phone, or the particular OS version I have?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still rocking the first gen ipad. I don&rsquo;t see much reason to upgrade, I&rsquo;m still satisfied with the performance. Maybe if a 128gig model came out&hellip;</p>
