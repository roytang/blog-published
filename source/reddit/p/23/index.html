<p>There is a Comic Quest in SM North EDSA, it should be on the second floor in the main building (unless it has moved recently)</p>
<p>There is also a Comic Odyssey in Trinoma, it&rsquo;s in a cart-like stall in the area behind the Starbucks on the second floor</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not. The current actuarial life of the SSS is only up to 2039, and they have had to increase required member contributions in order to ensure the fund lasts longer than that. (Citation: <a href="http://business.inquirer.net/129887/sss-revives-proposal-to-hike-contributions-to-ensure-benefits-in-perpetuity">http://business.inquirer.net/129887/sss-revives-proposal-to-hike-contributions-to-ensure-benefits-in-perpetuity</a>)</p>
<p>Adding more benefits like college plans would require even larger contributions (educational plans are typically expensive). Even if it was optional, I suspect that only a small percentage of the SSS membership would be able to afford it. And seeing how private business (which are supposedly more efficient/streamlined than government procedures) were unable to keep up with the rising costs of education, it seems unlikely for it to be viable for the SSS.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if there are any shows that blow the viewer away right from the pilot episode, instead of needing a few episodes for the style of the show to sink in.</p>
<p>A pilot episode that when you watch it you&rsquo;re like &ldquo;I must watch the rest of this show&rdquo;</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I dunno. It felt a bit out of place. I mean, Mike&rsquo;s being a bit irrational, pushing all his frustrations on Coulson as a handy representative of the government. And some of his thoughts kind of came out of nowhere (like the part about gods), he wasn&rsquo;t really showing any serious existentialist thinking like this during the earlier parts.</p>

<p>Whenever a creature with deathtouch deals damage, it&rsquo;s always lethal (to other creatures), whether that damage is via combat, via fighting or via abilities like &ldquo;T: Deal 1 damage to target creature&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edit: The relevant rule is the state-based action based on deathtouch, which doesn&rsquo;t discriminate as to the type of damage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>704.5h If a creature has toughness greater than 0, and it&rsquo;s been dealt damage by a source with deathtouch since the last time state-based actions were checked, that creature is destroyed. Regeneration can replace this event.</p>

<p>Yes, first the active player gains priority, then when he passes the non-active player will receive priority. This happens regardless of whether triggers go on the stack.</p>
<p>Comp. rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="503">
<li>Upkeep Step</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>503.1. First, any abilities that trigger at the beginning of the upkeep step and any abilities that triggered during the turn&rsquo;s untap step go on the stack. (See rule 603, &ldquo;Handling Triggered Abilities.&quot;)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>503.2. Second, the active player gets priority. Players may cast spells and activate abilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>116.3a The active player receives priority at the beginning of most steps and phases, after any turn-based actions (such as drawing a card during the draw step; see rule 703) have been dealt with and abilities that trigger at the beginning of that phase or step have been put on the stack. No player receives priority during the untap step. Players usually don&rsquo;t get priority during the cleanup step (see rule 514.3).</p>

<p>Yes it does. An effect resolves all in one go, so Polkranos damages your dude, then your dude damages Polkranos. Only after the effect has resolved will things &ldquo;die&rdquo; (state-based effects like being destroyed due to damage are not checked in the middle of other effects resolving)</p>

<p>Mutavault is very hard to kill with Supreme Verdict or any other sorcery-speed effects.</p>
<p>Does not use up a creature slot in your deck, but still gives you a potential win condition.</p>
<p>You choose when it is a creature, so you can use that timing to your advantage. i.e. wipe the board of creatures, then activate your manland to attack.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I think he&rsquo;ll come back reincarnated as a bear, and he has to somehow convince the Avengers that he&rsquo;s Peter Parker using only grunts and bear swipes, but then he also has this weird need to always have honey.  Then Iron Man builds him some bear armor he uses to take down Superior Spider-Man so that he can fashion a body exchange device to get back into his old body.</p>
<p>After the body swap, the bear gets into an accident that fuses octopus arms to his body. A live octopus, not a mechanical one.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d imagine that there are those who didn&rsquo;t grow up playing video games wondering why their peers haven&rsquo;t outgrown them yet. Gaming wasn&rsquo;t as mass market ten years ago as it was now. Give or take another decade or two and everybody will be used to it.</p>
