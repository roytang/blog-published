<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if there are any shows that blow the viewer away right from the pilot episode, instead of needing a few episodes for the style of the show to sink in.</p>
<p>A pilot episode that when you watch it you&rsquo;re like &ldquo;I must watch the rest of this show&rdquo;</p>

<p>I dunno. It felt a bit out of place. I mean, Mike&rsquo;s being a bit irrational, pushing all his frustrations on Coulson as a handy representative of the government. And some of his thoughts kind of came out of nowhere (like the part about gods), he wasn&rsquo;t really showing any serious existentialist thinking like this during the earlier parts.</p>

<p>Whenever a creature with deathtouch deals damage, it&rsquo;s always lethal (to other creatures), whether that damage is via combat, via fighting or via abilities like &ldquo;T: Deal 1 damage to target creature&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edit: The relevant rule is the state-based action based on deathtouch, which doesn&rsquo;t discriminate as to the type of damage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>704.5h If a creature has toughness greater than 0, and it&rsquo;s been dealt damage by a source with deathtouch since the last time state-based actions were checked, that creature is destroyed. Regeneration can replace this event.</p>

<p>Yes, first the active player gains priority, then when he passes the non-active player will receive priority. This happens regardless of whether triggers go on the stack.</p>
<p>Comp. rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="503">
<li>Upkeep Step</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>503.1. First, any abilities that trigger at the beginning of the upkeep step and any abilities that triggered during the turn&rsquo;s untap step go on the stack. (See rule 603, &ldquo;Handling Triggered Abilities.&quot;)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>503.2. Second, the active player gets priority. Players may cast spells and activate abilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>116.3a The active player receives priority at the beginning of most steps and phases, after any turn-based actions (such as drawing a card during the draw step; see rule 703) have been dealt with and abilities that trigger at the beginning of that phase or step have been put on the stack. No player receives priority during the untap step. Players usually don&rsquo;t get priority during the cleanup step (see rule 514.3).</p>

<p>Yes it does. An effect resolves all in one go, so Polkranos damages your dude, then your dude damages Polkranos. Only after the effect has resolved will things &ldquo;die&rdquo; (state-based effects like being destroyed due to damage are not checked in the middle of other effects resolving)</p>

<p>Mutavault is very hard to kill with Supreme Verdict or any other sorcery-speed effects.</p>
<p>Does not use up a creature slot in your deck, but still gives you a potential win condition.</p>
<p>You choose when it is a creature, so you can use that timing to your advantage. i.e. wipe the board of creatures, then activate your manland to attack.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>I think he&rsquo;ll come back reincarnated as a bear, and he has to somehow convince the Avengers that he&rsquo;s Peter Parker using only grunts and bear swipes, but then he also has this weird need to always have honey.  Then Iron Man builds him some bear armor he uses to take down Superior Spider-Man so that he can fashion a body exchange device to get back into his old body.</p>
<p>After the body swap, the bear gets into an accident that fuses octopus arms to his body. A live octopus, not a mechanical one.</p>

More specifically, are the actions of one character &#34;linear&#34;, meaning do they have an impact in future comic books even if the series changes (like from Batman to Batman and Superman).?&#39; on /r/explainlikeimfive</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Yes, they are linear, as long as they take place in the same continuity. For example, DC currently has 52 ongoing series that all take place in the same continuity, all of these stories are canon. (Although some of them may take place in different universes, like Earth-2; but those stories are still canon since Earth-2 interacts with other universes so continuity exists between them too)</p>
<p>Often a publisher will have a number of books that are &ldquo;out of continuity&rdquo;, these stories are unrelated to their main continuity and will mostly be stand alone. Current examples for DC are &ldquo;Batman 66&rdquo; (it&rsquo;s the Adam West Batman!), &ldquo;Smallville Season Nine&rdquo; (which follows the continuity of the TV series)</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s possible for different universes to interact (i.e. characters crossing over), even those with separate continuity may interact with the main ones.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>When I was a kid (like 6 or 7), we had a bag that had a face and it was often hung up on a hook on the wall right in front of my bed and I spent many a sleepless night worrying about how it was staring at me.</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1lyyqr/til_that_at_265_million_gta_v_cost_more_to_make/">&#39;TIL that at $265 million, GTA V cost more to make than every Hollywood blockbuster ever made - except one: Pirates of the Caribbean 3, which holds the top record at $300 million. Rockstar has already made the money back on pre-orders alone.&#39; on /r/todayilearned</a>:

<div class="content e-content">

<p>$265 million divided by $60, that means at least 4.5 million copies of GTAV have been pre-ordered? Number seems way high</p>

<p>If you find that it&rsquo;s really overheating, you might have to scale down the settings to avoid it, or maybe clean out your CPU case or invest in more heat sinks.</p>
