<p>There is no other way to acquire those items other than renting/buying them from that guy.</p>
<p>That being said, do not be concerned by the item rental system, it&rsquo;s still a ridiculously good game even if you don&rsquo;t like it.</p>

<p>A bit unrelated and assuming this &ldquo;free multiplayer weekend&rdquo; promo is over: I don&rsquo;t have a PS4 yet, but I assume it supports multiple user accounts same as the PS3? My account has PS+, but my brother&rsquo;s does not. If we both have accounts on the same PS4, will my brother be able to play multiplayer from his account?</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/1t0lv1/do_you_have_health_insurance/">&#39;Do you have health insurance?&#39; on /r/Philippines</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Are you employed? Many employers will provide health insurance. If your employer doesn&rsquo;t you might want to find one that does.</p>
<p>You can also apply to Philhealth even if you&rsquo;re not employed (you&rsquo;ll have to make contributions manually)</p>
<p>You should also be able to apply with private insurance groups for personal coverage (again, you&rsquo;ll have to make the contributions yourself). The only ones I&rsquo;ve tried are Intellicare and Medocare.</p>
<p>It is bad not to have health insurance if you are accident prone, or your family has a history of hereditary illnesses, or you are growing older (in your 30s maybe, but I would recommend getting health insurance as soon as possible)</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s not something serious like cancer or a stroke, diagnostic procedures can cost as much as 10k-30k or more, so having insurance to cover some or all of that definitely helps.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Yeap. Well, you could always just try making a fan project and hope and pray that they don&rsquo;t shut it down.</p>
<p>For contacting someone at EA, going through the regular channels like customer support or marketing/sales isn&rsquo;t going to cut it; that&rsquo;s not how deals are made, with their staff entertaining random proposals from people on the internet. The only way to get traction is to find someone on the inside who will listen to you - probably through game dev industry contacts or such. If you already have the capacity, I would suggest just making your own game first (maybe &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; by lands of lore, but not ripping it off directly) and hope that leads into a future path that might eventually get you where you want.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Datablitz doesn&rsquo;t have used games but that doesn&rsquo;t mean the market doesn&rsquo;t exist. There are shops in greenhills that will buy and sell used games. iTech also sells some used PS3 games, not sure if they will buy them off you as well.</p>

<p>I was around 10 when I played and finished the first Legend of Zelda; probably 15 or 16 when I beat A Link To The Past. ALBW is easier than both of those, I think. You might just not be giving younger you enough credit, kids are surprisingly good at games.</p>

<p>Nope. Timestamp order only matters for effects in the same layer (i.e. if you resolve &ldquo;set creature&rsquo;s P/T to 0/1&rdquo; then afterwards resolve &ldquo;set creature&rsquo;s P/T to 3/3&rdquo;, it becomes a 3/3), but for effects in different layers, they are applied simultaneously regardless of timestamp order.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Us Catholics have a Pope; the protestants don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not sure if the protestant religions even consider us proper Christians (edit: Of course we all believe in Jesus; what I meant by the last sentence was that I&rsquo;ve been to places where if you say &ldquo;Christian church&rdquo;, it refers to a place of worship that is protestant, but not Catholic).</p>
<p>Catholics were around first, until the 1500s when some guy named Martin Luther started a movement that created protestantism. The protestant movement started because some people didn&rsquo;t like the way the Catholic Church handled things and I guess they wanted to get more back to basics (that is, focus more on the Bible rather than all the Catholic traditions) - that last part may be my personal opinion.</p>
<p>The protestants have a common set of 3 fundamental beliefs: that scripture (the Bible) alone is the source of all authority (unlike Catholics that have a Pope and a Church that can decide some stuff), that faith in and of itself is enough for salvation, and the universal priesthood of believers (which means that any Christian can read and interpret and spread the word of God, unlike Catholics which have a dedicated priesthood).</p>
<p>Among protestants they have different denominations - Baptists, Presbyterians, etc. They all observe the same fundamental beliefs mentioned above, but they vary in their practices and on what stuff they focus on.</p>
