<p>Hi baka lang may makasagot dito. I got a multiple entry visa to Japan nung 2015 valid until 2018. But I had my passport renewed last year (2016), so the visa on my old passport. I&rsquo;m travelling to Japan again in April. I&rsquo;m told that i just need to bring both passports when i travel, but i couldnt find any official confirmation of this. May nakatry na ba nyan dito?</p>

<p>“Hurry up Michael,” the woman urged as she led the way forward through the brush.</p>
<p>“Ease up Raine, you know I’m an academic right, not a field researcher?” Michael said between short breaths. It was true, he wasn’t used to this much climbing. They were almost at the hill’s peak, but the vegetation didn’t seem to taper off. The trek from base camp had taken them the better part of four hours, most of it only under the light of the second moon.</p>
<p>“Look!” He heard Raine’s voice call out from up ahead. “Hurry up and see!”</p>
<p>“Alright, alright,” he said. He finally broke out of the brush and found that the hill’s surface levelled off a bit. As he caught up with Raine he put a hand on her shoulder. “Ok now, what’s so&ndash; Oh.”</p>
<p>His words trailed off as he finally saw what Raine was pointing at. A vast field of bioluminescent blue greeted him. The sea of bright blue lay in stark contrast to the dark of night. It covered most of the hill top and even some of the slopes that trailed off to the adjacent mountain ranges.</p>
<p>Raine was already running forward and unstrapping her gear bag. “Hey, wait up!” Michael called as he ran after her.</p>
<p>Raine stopped at the edge of the field and lay down her bag. She knelt down and ran her hand through the flower petals glowing with a vivid blue hue. “Look at them Michael! It’s like they’re pulsating!” She looked up and across the clearing. “There must be more than tens of thousands of them here.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we’ll never be able to harvest that many samples,” Michael said with a wry voice. Raine glared at him in return. She began digging through her bag.</p>
<p>“We’ll only need less than a dozen samples. Don’t you dare touch the rest of them!” Raine said.</p>
<p>Michael pulled out his handheld and tapped the screen a few times. He raised his eyebrow at the display.</p>
<p>“It was a good call not taking a shuttle here. Not that I enjoyed the hike I mean. The energy field they’re putting out is subtle, but there’s a good chance it would have wreaked havoc with the shuttle’s instrumentation.”</p>
<p>“Give me that,” Raine said. She didn’t even wait for an acknowledgement and just snatched the handheld out of his hands. She scrolled through the displays. “I think it’s the same signature we saw from the scout telemetry! Similar to the radiation fields on Al Ghedo Prime!”</p>
<p>“Give me that!” Michael grinned as he grabbed back his own handheld. Raine could be like an excitable child when it came to her research. Maybe that was the reason he had found it so easy to join her on this first landing expedition.</p>
<p>It was very rare for an academic to join the preliminary colony establishment missions, much more someone who had spent the past decade in a remote lab. Michael understood the spirit of exploration that drove humanity to colonize as many worlds as they could, but he was no explorer. He rarely travelled, and even when he preferred travelling to well-established colonies, the ones with full populations and their own rich culture. And preferably not trips that take almost four months in hyperspace.</p>
<p>But Raine was a completely different creature, he mused. She followed her research wherever it took her, whether it was to the heart of a hollow moon or here to the farthest world humanity had ever attempted to colonize.</p>
<p>She was completely engrossed now. She had laid out her portable instrumentation platform at the edge of the field and was taking a variety of measurements. Michael sighed. There was no talking to her when she was like this.</p>
<p>Instead, he swiped on his handheld and scanned the display. “The signal here is really great, even though we’re not too high up.” He stared upwards at the second moon and the stars beyond. “In fact, I think the sky tonight is clear enough to see the orbital platform.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?” Raine said, looking up at him. She had a stylus in her mouth, an odd habit of hers. “Whachusaid?”</p>
<p>Trying not to laugh at her, he looked at his display again. “Ark Thirty-Seven should be dropping out of hyperspace in a few hours.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you have a clear signal from here?” She obviously hadn’t been listening.</p>
<p>“Yeap. It’s even clear enough for me to see Christine’s telemetry,” Michael said.</p>
<p>“Ah, you must be excited. You haven’t seen each other in almost a year right?” Raine got up to stand beside him and look at his display.</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s the longest we’ve been apart in a decade actually,” he confessed.</p>
<p>“Yeah well, you guys don’t really travel that much right?” she grinned at him.</p>
<p>“Thanks for this Raine.” He said after a short pause.</p>
<p>“Thanks for what?” She gave him a puzzled look.</p>
<p>“All of this.” He waved his free hand in the direction of the field. “And all of that,” he waved again at the multitude of stars in the sky. “I never had it in me to be an explorer, but damn if I don’t see the appeal of it right now.”</p>
<p>“I know right? For a lot of people, they don’t really think about this stuff,” Raine said. “Like people in the core systems or the factory worlds. They don’t care that humanity is still exploring, they don’t care that we’re still finding new worlds to live on.” She pulled out her own handheld from her pocket. She swiped to the GalWeb app and scrolled through a few dozen posts. “I mean, look at all these people. They’re just happy to have their weekends or their expensive off-world coffees. Thirty-seven different worlds to visit and all they want is to upvote vids of their space cats. They don’t think about what a wondrous age we’re lucky enough to live in.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t take you to be the philosophical kind,” Michael said.</p>
<p>“Hah, I’m not, usually. But come on!” It was like a light had come on in her eyes, and she couldn’t hide the spark in her voice. ‘Ark Thirty-Seven! Isn’t that hard to believe? Who would have thought? I mean, two centuries ago before the core systems first developed hyperdrives, did they ever imagine we’d have thirty-seven colonies up and running in such a short time span? Back then, travelling to strange far-off worlds just to study alien flowers might have seemed like pure science fiction!”</p>
<p>As she was giving her spiel she was continuously browsing her friends’ posts across the GalWeb. Michael smiled and didn’t bother pointing out the other technology she was taking for granted. The technology she was using to see what was going on with her friends on a dozen other planets light-years away, the very same technology that let him monitor Christine’s trip remotely. The ansible. Two hundred years ago, they still had to deal with significant lag between planets in the core system. Faster than light communications would have been unimaginable back then.</p>
<p>He looked up again at the shining green light in the night sky, larger than the other stars. He knew it was the orbital platform. Tens of thousands of tons of heavy machinery, all designed to power and the two machines that drove human exploration - the hyperdrive beacon and the ansible. It had been humanity’s sheer luck that both breakthroughs were made within the same decade, enabling the human colonization of remote worlds.</p>
<p>“Don’t get too excited, young lady. This colony isn’t officially ‘up and running’ you know,” he smiled at her. “At least not until Christine and the ten million other colonists on the Ark get settled in.”</p>
<p>“Hey listen, about that,” Raine said with some hesitation. “You’re not mad are you?”</p>
<p>“Mad? About what?”</p>
<p>“That I made you join the advance mission with me? I mean, you’d be with her right now if it wasn’t for me right?”</p>
<p>“Heh,” he said. “You know, Christine and I actually had a short fight about it back when I first told her about the trip.”</p>
<p>“Really?!? I’m so sooorrrry,” Raine drawled in that weird tone her generation had a habit of using.</p>
<p>“Don’t be. It wasn’t much of a fight,” he reassured her. “More of a debate. We’re scientists, we don’t really fight. But she didn’t understand why we had to go on the advance mission. She said the planet wouldn’t be going anywhere. I had to walk her through your telemetry data slides so she understood why we couldn’t miss the window.”</p>
<p>Raine nodded. “Christine’s a scientist too, I knew she’d understand.”</p>
<p>“Well, she also wasn’t happy that I’d be spending my time with a hot young thing like you,” he grinned.</p>
<p>“‘Hot young thing!’” she slapped him on the back. “What the hell Michael, sexism went out of vogue back in the twenty-first you know!”</p>
<p>“I’m joking!” he laughed at her. Then he turned serious again. “Christine knows why our research is important. The scoutships really need this sort of data.”</p>
<p>Michael thought about the scoutships. Small, autonomous ships travelling at sublight speeds to unexplored star systems. Literally thousands of them spread across the nearby regions, searching for new habitable worlds - or even the remote possibility of alien intelligence. The scoutships relied on surface survey data from scientists like Raine, allowing their machine intelligence to profile similar planets. The more surface data they could feed to the scouts, the more likely they were to be able to identify possible habitables.</p>
<p>He walked up to the edge of the hilltop. It gave him a clear view of the valley below and the forward bases not too far away. The gigantic steel constructs were at rest now, their job mostly done. They had created a clearing, around one hundred and twenty square kilometers in total, he had been told. In just under a week, the ark’s landing module would come to rest in that clearing.</p>
<p>The modern arks were marvels of decades of engineering. Self-sustaining systems, filled with robotics, communications, supply lines, replicators, and anything else needed to quickly establish a modern city. They were a far cry from the early ark models, which were mostly just life support systems that could barely keep ten thousand colonists alive during the first hyperdrive colonization missions. Back then the first wave of colonists had to rough it, setting up their own hydroponic farms and comm systems, and dealing with the local wildlife themselves.</p>
<p>These days, everything was set up to be ready for the ark as soon as it arrived. Forward missions like the one he and Raine had joined went ahead, bringing the heavy machinery needed to prepare the landing zone and to boost the orbital platform’s capabilities. Explorer teams would have already scouted out the entire continent, making sure there weren’t any threats to the colony.</p>
<p>An instant city, with ten million brave souls ready to become the colony’s first official citizens. Many of them would be people like him and Christine and Raine - scientists, engineers, explorers, pioneers, volunteers. But many more would simple be people from the other colonies, hoping to start over with new lives for whatever reasons they had.</p>
<p>“Michael?” he heard Raine’s voice snap him out of his musings. She was pointing up at the sky. “What is that?”</p>
<p>“That’s the orbital platform, didn’t I tell you?” he said.</p>
<p>“The platform is the bright green one, right?” she shook her head. “I was pointing at that other one.”</p>
<p>“What other one?” Michael squinted, but then he saw it. Another pinprick of light, bluish-gray. Difficult to see against the night sky. Raine’s vision was much better than his. “What is that… is it moving?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I think so. It looks like it’s headed for the platform,” she pointed at Michael’s handheld. “Is the ark here early?”</p>
<p>“No, it shouldn’t be due for a few days yet,” Michael shook his head. He frowned and began swiping through the displays on his handheld. “I’m not registering any other ship out there, I&ndash; hey!” He slapped the handheld against his palm. “What the heck, I just lost the connection!”</p>
<p>“Michael&ndash;”</p>
<p>“Wait, just let me see what’s up with this,” Michael said as he tapped a few buttons on the display.</p>
<p>“Michael! Look!”</p>
<p>He finally looked up at where the orbital platform was. The second light was gone, apparently having already arrived at the platform. And for some reason, the green light from the platform was pulsating wildly. And then moments later, the green light died.</p>
<p>“What in blazes&ndash;?”</p>
<p>And then the endless night sky was set afire.</p>

<p>Ask her why she is so emotional about it.</p>
<p>The Jim Paredes thing was really stupid (although IDK if it&rsquo;s true that he&rsquo;s not a Filipino citizen). He shouldn&rsquo;t have fed the trolls</p>

<p>Back when Future Sight had just come out, I went into a store to check their singles and they had like 8 copies of this weird green rare they were selling for less than $1 a pop. I looked at it for a bit, and I thought it might be fun to try to build a deck around. But for whatever reason I wasn&rsquo;t in the mood to buy cards that day so I figured I&rsquo;d come back to it the next time I was in the store. The very next weekend, there was a GP, and the price of Tarmogoyf immediately spiked to around 20-30 dollars and never went back down. Today they&rsquo;re at $100+ a pop, I still only have the one copy I got from a booster pack.</p>

<p>AFAIK only the console where the account is set as primary can that account&rsquo;s games be played by other accounts.</p>
<p>For cross-region compatibility of game DLC, it depends on the game.</p>

<p>So the ship that Leia was in at the start of ANH, was it the same one in the last scene of R1? I mean, it sure looks like it, except in ANH, the soldier claims they are a consular ship, and Vader says transmissions were beamed to the ship from rebel spies.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>PS3 games are not region-locked. (AFAIK the only exception is Persona 4 Arena). Your PS3 console can play any game from any region.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more important is actually the region for your PSN account. PS Store digital purchases are tied to the region of your PSN account. Your PS3 can hold accounts from any region (you just need to create an account with an address in that region)</p>
<p>Some DLCs may not work with game discs from different regions (varies by game,  but I think it&rsquo;s more common that they don&rsquo;t work.)</p>
<p>For example, if you&rsquo;re playing an R1 (America) game disc, but you purchase the game&rsquo;s DLC from the EU PS store, the game probably won&rsquo;t recognize the DLC.</p>
<p>Some functionality such as cross-play/cross-save may not work across regions.</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/5g9mc8/i_am_a_new_casual_player_havent_spent_any_money/">&#39;I am a new casual player (haven&#39;t spent any money) and the highest rank I&#39;ve ever reached is 18. I don&#39;t know every card by heart or understand all the deck types. I&#39;ve tried reading tips and watching videos but they seem to be either below my skill level or way above it.&#39; on /r/hearthstone</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>If you are unwilling to spend money, then it is simply time and patience. Time and patience will lead to familiarity and better play and a larger collection.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a F2P player. I started around a year and a half ago (roughly May 2015). I&rsquo;m caught up on all the adventures, I have a couple of decent meta decks (mostly Shaman in the last season of course), I have very few legendaries.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have much time to play. I don&rsquo;t play everyday. When I do have time, I try to do all 3 quests at once for time efficiency. I do any quests that give me free packs (play on different platforms, etc) I do the tavern brawl every week for the free pack.</p>
<p>I spent the first few months not making it above rank 15. Only in the past half a year or so have I been able to make it above rank 10. If I spent more time playing, I believe I could reasonably hit rank 5 each season.</p>
<p>When I started out there were already two adventures available. I focused on saving up gold to unlock each wing, 700 gold/wing at a time. By the time Karazhan came out, I had enough gold saved up to complete each wing as they came out.</p>
<p>My advice for your situation is this: save your gold for unlocking the adventures, work backwards (start with the most recent ones - Karazhan). Get free packs whenever you can. Eventually, you will open a legendary, that you can dust to craft some budget decks.</p>
<p>Find a budget deck you like and start playing. That 800 dust one you mentioned might be okay. Just play it as often as you can and you will become familiar with the deck and other cards in the format.</p>
<p>If you used to play MTG, you should be able to recognize the same learning curve - MTG has way, way, way more cards than HS, even just in Standard, and you don&rsquo;t need to be familiar with all of them, but if you play often enough you start to recognize the really important ones. Identifying aggro decks should be relatively easy - they come out early with a bunch of creatures and prefer to hit you in the face yes?</p>
<p>But in summary</p>

How can we breach the divide?</a></h4>
<p>Edit: By &ldquo;breach the divide&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t really mean persuading others that you are correct, more like trying to find common ground and to learn from each other. At the very least we should be able to agree on certain things like the need to verify information and not simply believe everything we read on the internet or to be respectful to others that hold different opinions, but it seems many people aren&rsquo;t even open to that. It&rsquo;s just frustrating sometimes.</p>

<p>The Philippines. Today our esteemed president Duterte (you might have heard of him, he&rsquo;s on r/worldnews a lot) in his wisdom decided to allow the late dictator, plunderer, thief and human rights violator Marcos to be buried at our national heroes&rsquo; cemetery</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Hello, I hope you find the time to answer my questions :)</p>
<p>I read the Sword of Truth series (up to Confessor - I have not read any of the later books) perhaps a decade ago. I enjoyed the series for the most part, but I always felt that the first few books were the strongest, and towards the end of the series (starting around Faith of the Fallen) I felt that the characters had become a bit too&hellip;shall we say &ldquo;preachy&rdquo; about their particular worldviews.</p>
<p>My questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Did you initially plan the series to be so many books?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was it originally your plan to introduce philosophical themes such as Objectivist ideas later on in the books?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which parts of the series would you say are the strongest and you are most proud of?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any technical advice you would give to an aspiring fantasy writer trying to get a book sold?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>This reminds me of back when the footbridge near the corner of Commonwealth and Tandang Sora was still under construction. At that time pedestrians could already climb up one side even though it was not yet done, so at one point I saw it and was like &ldquo;cool, may footbridge na pala&rdquo;, went up and got to the halfway point only to find that it didn&rsquo;t reach all the way to the end /glare</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/57ldpk/quick_question_about_misty_rainforest/d8swpon/">a comment by RampageOfZebras on &#39;Quick Question about Misty Rainforest&#39; on /r/magicTCG</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>It&rsquo;s very valuable because:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it&rsquo;s very useful since it serves a &ldquo;flexible&rdquo; land slot in your deck. Normally it can be either an Island or a Forest. But in older sets there are also lands that are both Island and Plains or Forest and Mountain. Effectively, in formats where the old cards are legal, Misty Rainforest can fetch the correct color mana you need at any time. Because of this flexibility, such lands are used in a lot of decks in those formats where old cards are legal, meaning there is a high demand for them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the original version is out of print and has had high demand for a long time, driving the price up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the newer printing from Battle for Zendikar (the one you have) is a very very very rare pull - I&rsquo;m not sure about the numbers, but someone else here mentioned only 1 in around 200 booster packs will have it</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, congratulations on the pull!</p>

<p>D: &ldquo;You want answers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m entitled to them&rdquo;</p>
<p>D: &ldquo;You want answers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want the truth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>D: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t handle the truth! Son, we live in a world that has drugs, and those drugs have to be defeated by men with guns. Who&rsquo;s gonna do it? You? I have a greater responsibility than you could possibly fathom. You weep for the collateral damage and you curse the police. You have that luxury, you have the luxury of not knowing what I know. That the collateral deaths, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and impenetrable to you, saves lives. You don&rsquo;t want the truth because deep down in places you don&rsquo;t talk about at parties, you want me on that wall, you need me on that wall. We use words like slaughter, obosen, killings. We use them as a backbone of a life spent defending something. You use them as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very safety that I provide and then questions the manner in which I provide it. I would rather you just said thank you, and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon, and kill some druggies. Either way, I don&rsquo;t give a damn what you think you are entitled to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you order the extrajudicial killings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>D: &ldquo;I did the job I &ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;DID YOU ORDER THE EXTRAJUDICIAL KILLINGS?&rdquo;</p>
<p>D: &ldquo;YOU&rsquo;RE GODDAMN RIGHT I DID&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Sana may mag act out, with corresponding accent lol)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really have many &ldquo;fanatics&rdquo; who follow me. Maybe someone should make an image version of the monologue part, with the president in the image (implying he said it) and post it to one of the pro-Duterte groups. You know, the ones that believe he&rsquo;s been named the best president in the solar system lol</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>You know how a lot of Pinoys are so proud of Pacquiao whenever he wins a match - I don&rsquo;t get that. I don&rsquo;t relate to him just because we happened to be born on adjacent chunks of land. I had no hand in his upbringing or victories. He and I are around roughly the same age, but I doubt we had very similar experiences in life</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably different in a country like the US where they have some notion of what it means to &ldquo;be an American&rdquo;. Here in the Philippines, I don&rsquo;t think there is any such notion. I don&rsquo;t know what it means to &ldquo;be a Filipino&rdquo;. We aren&rsquo;t really that united in terms of culture and we don&rsquo;t have a strong national identity that all of us can rally around.</p>
<p>Maybe in the end our own diversity can be good for us too, as it means we aren&rsquo;t constrained or tied to a single point of view but are able to work with a veritable melting pot of different cultures and dialects and what-not. Maybe this is what it means to be a Filipino. Maybe this is what it means to be human</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Worth means something different to every person, so it depends on what definition you use and what priorities you think society should have. There are a number of priorities to choose from: survival, advancement of knowledge, expansion of territory, etc.</p>
<p>If you judge based on a priority of survival, then I guess you would give greater worth to food producers (farmers, etc). If you judge based on advancement, perhaps scientists would be ranked highly. I would also imagine that all other things being equal, younger people would be worth more than older people as they have more potential</p>
<p>Regardless of what priority you choose, a precise measurement of a person&rsquo;s worth or ranking will be very difficult, if not impossible, given all the nuances of human life and the inherent potential that any human life possesses</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t played the game since before the first patch (Asimov?), am I in for a treat/different game altogether?</p>
<p>Do we have a release window for Heinlein? I read that savegames will be incompatible after the patch so I&rsquo;ll wait until that comes out before playing Stellaris again</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;m referring to the House of M universe where Logan was a shield agent and Magneto was some kind of royalty etc. Obviously the stuff in the first issue where they had Scarlet Witch in Genosha and the resulting consequences of the story arc (&ldquo;No more mutants&rdquo;) took place in 616, so I didn&rsquo;t bother specifying</p>
<p>Arguably, since it &ldquo;replaced&rdquo; 616 for a bit, you might not consider it an alternate reality, but it&rsquo;s as much alternate reality as Age of Apocalypse was. AoA happened the same way - it replaced 616 for a bit until they did the Bishop going into the M&rsquo;Kraan crystal thing to restore 616, but they later showed AoA universe to continue as an &ldquo;alternate reality&rdquo;</p>
<p>In any case, whether you consider it an alternate reality or not, it&rsquo;s definitely not a reboot in any way, shape, or form</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>The API is pretty inconsistent and poorly designed. There&rsquo;s a lot of articles out there, here&rsquo;s one: <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/</a> It&rsquo;s not very elegant, and features seem to be added willy-nilly. Compare to languages like Python and Ruby, where new additions are reviewed with a focus on being &ldquo;Pythonic&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ruby like&rdquo; so that the entire language has a certain consistency</p>
<p>PHP is also the most common introductory web development language (since most Apache installations support it by default), so there is a lot of poorly written beginner code in the wild, leading to more hate against the language</p>
<p>That being said, if that&rsquo;s what you know, there&rsquo;s no problem with that, as long as you use it well. But it&rsquo;s also good to expose yourself to other languages so you can see if there are others that you will prefer</p>

<p>As a Filipino living in the Philippines, I can tell you he&rsquo;s not exactly the most consistent person spewing out reliable statements. Even during the campaign period he had a tendency to flip-flop especially when people call him out, and even his own spokespeople often give different &ldquo;interpretations&rdquo; of his nonsenical ramblings. If you believe he doesn&rsquo;t want to stay in power, you should also believe his threat to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to declare martial law if she doesn&rsquo;t toe the line, or his threat to leave the UN if they aren&rsquo;t more polite or something</p>
