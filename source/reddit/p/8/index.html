How can we breach the divide?</a></h4>
<p>Edit: By &ldquo;breach the divide&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t really mean persuading others that you are correct, more like trying to find common ground and to learn from each other. At the very least we should be able to agree on certain things like the need to verify information and not simply believe everything we read on the internet or to be respectful to others that hold different opinions, but it seems many people aren&rsquo;t even open to that. It&rsquo;s just frustrating sometimes.</p>

<p>The Philippines. Today our esteemed president Duterte (you might have heard of him, he&rsquo;s on r/worldnews a lot) in his wisdom decided to allow the late dictator, plunderer, thief and human rights violator Marcos to be buried at our national heroes&rsquo; cemetery</p>

<p>Hello, I hope you find the time to answer my questions :)</p>
<p>I read the Sword of Truth series (up to Confessor - I have not read any of the later books) perhaps a decade ago. I enjoyed the series for the most part, but I always felt that the first few books were the strongest, and towards the end of the series (starting around Faith of the Fallen) I felt that the characters had become a bit too&hellip;shall we say &ldquo;preachy&rdquo; about their particular worldviews.</p>
<p>My questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Did you initially plan the series to be so many books?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was it originally your plan to introduce philosophical themes such as Objectivist ideas later on in the books?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which parts of the series would you say are the strongest and you are most proud of?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any technical advice you would give to an aspiring fantasy writer trying to get a book sold?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>This reminds me of back when the footbridge near the corner of Commonwealth and Tandang Sora was still under construction. At that time pedestrians could already climb up one side even though it was not yet done, so at one point I saw it and was like &ldquo;cool, may footbridge na pala&rdquo;, went up and got to the halfway point only to find that it didn&rsquo;t reach all the way to the end /glare</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/57ldpk/quick_question_about_misty_rainforest/d8swpon/">a comment by RampageOfZebras on &#39;Quick Question about Misty Rainforest&#39; on /r/magicTCG</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>It&rsquo;s very valuable because:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it&rsquo;s very useful since it serves a &ldquo;flexible&rdquo; land slot in your deck. Normally it can be either an Island or a Forest. But in older sets there are also lands that are both Island and Plains or Forest and Mountain. Effectively, in formats where the old cards are legal, Misty Rainforest can fetch the correct color mana you need at any time. Because of this flexibility, such lands are used in a lot of decks in those formats where old cards are legal, meaning there is a high demand for them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the original version is out of print and has had high demand for a long time, driving the price up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the newer printing from Battle for Zendikar (the one you have) is a very very very rare pull - I&rsquo;m not sure about the numbers, but someone else here mentioned only 1 in around 200 booster packs will have it</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, congratulations on the pull!</p>

<p>D: &ldquo;You want answers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m entitled to them&rdquo;</p>
<p>D: &ldquo;You want answers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want the truth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>D: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t handle the truth! Son, we live in a world that has drugs, and those drugs have to be defeated by men with guns. Who&rsquo;s gonna do it? You? I have a greater responsibility than you could possibly fathom. You weep for the collateral damage and you curse the police. You have that luxury, you have the luxury of not knowing what I know. That the collateral deaths, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and impenetrable to you, saves lives. You don&rsquo;t want the truth because deep down in places you don&rsquo;t talk about at parties, you want me on that wall, you need me on that wall. We use words like slaughter, obosen, killings. We use them as a backbone of a life spent defending something. You use them as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very safety that I provide and then questions the manner in which I provide it. I would rather you just said thank you, and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon, and kill some druggies. Either way, I don&rsquo;t give a damn what you think you are entitled to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really have many &ldquo;fanatics&rdquo; who follow me. Maybe someone should make an image version of the monologue part, with the president in the image (implying he said it) and post it to one of the pro-Duterte groups. You know, the ones that believe he&rsquo;s been named the best president in the solar system lol</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>You know how a lot of Pinoys are so proud of Pacquiao whenever he wins a match - I don&rsquo;t get that. I don&rsquo;t relate to him just because we happened to be born on adjacent chunks of land. I had no hand in his upbringing or victories. He and I are around roughly the same age, but I doubt we had very similar experiences in life</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably different in a country like the US where they have some notion of what it means to &ldquo;be an American&rdquo;. Here in the Philippines, I don&rsquo;t think there is any such notion. I don&rsquo;t know what it means to &ldquo;be a Filipino&rdquo;. We aren&rsquo;t really that united in terms of culture and we don&rsquo;t have a strong national identity that all of us can rally around.</p>
<p>Maybe in the end our own diversity can be good for us too, as it means we aren&rsquo;t constrained or tied to a single point of view but are able to work with a veritable melting pot of different cultures and dialects and what-not. Maybe this is what it means to be a Filipino. Maybe this is what it means to be human</p>

<p>Bus and plane rides can be uncomfortable due to both lack of leg room and seat backs being too low to comfortably rest head/neck on</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Worth means something different to every person, so it depends on what definition you use and what priorities you think society should have. There are a number of priorities to choose from: survival, advancement of knowledge, expansion of territory, etc.</p>
<p>If you judge based on a priority of survival, then I guess you would give greater worth to food producers (farmers, etc). If you judge based on advancement, perhaps scientists would be ranked highly. I would also imagine that all other things being equal, younger people would be worth more than older people as they have more potential</p>
<p>Regardless of what priority you choose, a precise measurement of a person&rsquo;s worth or ranking will be very difficult, if not impossible, given all the nuances of human life and the inherent potential that any human life possesses</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t played the game since before the first patch (Asimov?), am I in for a treat/different game altogether?</p>
<p>Do we have a release window for Heinlein? I read that savegames will be incompatible after the patch so I&rsquo;ll wait until that comes out before playing Stellaris again</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;m referring to the House of M universe where Logan was a shield agent and Magneto was some kind of royalty etc. Obviously the stuff in the first issue where they had Scarlet Witch in Genosha and the resulting consequences of the story arc (&ldquo;No more mutants&rdquo;) took place in 616, so I didn&rsquo;t bother specifying</p>
<p>Arguably, since it &ldquo;replaced&rdquo; 616 for a bit, you might not consider it an alternate reality, but it&rsquo;s as much alternate reality as Age of Apocalypse was. AoA happened the same way - it replaced 616 for a bit until they did the Bishop going into the M&rsquo;Kraan crystal thing to restore 616, but they later showed AoA universe to continue as an &ldquo;alternate reality&rdquo;</p>
<p>In any case, whether you consider it an alternate reality or not, it&rsquo;s definitely not a reboot in any way, shape, or form</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>The API is pretty inconsistent and poorly designed. There&rsquo;s a lot of articles out there, here&rsquo;s one: <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/</a> It&rsquo;s not very elegant, and features seem to be added willy-nilly. Compare to languages like Python and Ruby, where new additions are reviewed with a focus on being &ldquo;Pythonic&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ruby like&rdquo; so that the entire language has a certain consistency</p>
<p>PHP is also the most common introductory web development language (since most Apache installations support it by default), so there is a lot of poorly written beginner code in the wild, leading to more hate against the language</p>
<p>That being said, if that&rsquo;s what you know, there&rsquo;s no problem with that, as long as you use it well. But it&rsquo;s also good to expose yourself to other languages so you can see if there are others that you will prefer</p>

<p>As a Filipino living in the Philippines, I can tell you he&rsquo;s not exactly the most consistent person spewing out reliable statements. Even during the campaign period he had a tendency to flip-flop especially when people call him out, and even his own spokespeople often give different &ldquo;interpretations&rdquo; of his nonsenical ramblings. If you believe he doesn&rsquo;t want to stay in power, you should also believe his threat to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to declare martial law if she doesn&rsquo;t toe the line, or his threat to leave the UN if they aren&rsquo;t more polite or something</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Sketchbook Pro since that&rsquo;s what I use for my sketching, but I find that my hands are very uneven at drawing the speech bubbles, so I&rsquo;m hoping for something that includes a smoothing process for the lines, and also a way to input multiple lines of text easily</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s better to build trust in the PNP if the organisation itself is able to promote transparency within its own ranks, but I guess it could be anybody</p>

<p>For example, some suggestions I would make:</p>
<ul>
<li>for the president to come out with a strongly worded message enjoining law enforcement to observe proper procedures, rules of engagement and due process</li>
<li>provide regular summary reports, probably weekly of the progress of the &ldquo;drug war&rdquo;: how many buy bust operations, how many drug dealers captured alive, how many died in encounters, how many died while in custody, and so on</li>
<li>provide and publicize a channel/process for family members of people alleged killed unjustly in police operations to air their grievances and file cases. Provide protection and legal counsel (via the PAO?) as needed</li>
<li>related to above, appoint someone to be in charge of investigating extrajudicial killings. that person should provide regular weekly update reports on the cases being investigated and act as a spokesman for the PNP (I assume he would be from the PNP) on this matter and liaise with the senate and the CHR for any investigations</li>
<li>provide regular reports on the status of the vigilante/cardboard killing cases</li>
</ul>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>Edit, some additional:</p>
<ul>
<li>automatically perform autopsy on any alleged criminals killed in a police encounter. Check for powder burns, prints on the weapon, and so on, and regularly release these autopsy reports to promote transparency</li>
<li>conduct re-training for police on how to handle suspects in custody to avoid &ldquo;nang-agaw ng baril&rdquo; even though naka handcuffs. Punish policemen na naagawan pa rin ng baril kahit nakaposas na</li>
</ul>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Play-wise, it&rsquo;s impossible to predict what kind of decks there&rsquo;ll be in March, so just practice general tight play for now.</p>
<p>Aside from that, the biggest difference a large tournament like a GP has compared to an FNM is the sheer length of the tournament. I&rsquo;m not sure how large GPs in your area get, but I would typically expect 9 or 10 rounds on the first day. If you&rsquo;re used to just playing 4-5 rounds of FNM, it can get exhausting. You need to build up both your physical and mental stamina. So what I would suggest is playing at other large tournaments near you to start getting used to it. 7-8 rounds should be fine, if you have trouble looking for something with at least 9 rounds. PPTQs and SCG stuff are your best bet, although some stores might have larger GPT events too if they have a large enough playerbase.</p>

<p>I currently have the 4th generation iPad (the first one with retina display), and I&rsquo;ve tried using third-party styluses with them but am never satisfied, it always feel imprecise. I&rsquo;ve tried drawing with just my fingers and while it&rsquo;s more precise it also feels a bit more tiring</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of getting an iPad Pro next month. How much better would it be to use the Apple Pencil?</p>

<p>Improvement always comes with practice. The improvement may be slow or it may be quick, depending on how focused you are on improving. Even without specifically focusing on improvement, sheer repetition will make you better in some aspect. Maybe your lines will be straighter or your proportions a bit better or you&rsquo;ll draw a bit faster</p>

<p>The main issues are (1) word gender (a concept that exists in neither English nor Filipino), (2) subject-verb agreement (unlike English where the choice is simply between singular and plural, Spanish adds the complication of different verb forms depending on first, second or third person, with variations depending on gender and singular/plural), and (3) object pronouns, that shit is hard. These are the main issues you have to focus on in order to have relatively decent grammar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at 50% Spanish fluency, I started like early 2015. I think I actually got to 60+% fluency but I stopped for a few months so it dropped. When I started I would keep each category at full strength - whenever one of them dropped I would go back and strengthen it again, but that led to slow progress. This time I&rsquo;m going through all the categories first (I&rsquo;m down to the last 10 or so categories), then will go back and reinforce them later. Not sure if this will be more effective, but I figure I would go wide first then strengthen those places where I turn out to be weak</p>
<p>As with all sorts of learning, the key is really to practice, practice, practice. Devote time and energy to it. It would help if you had a Spanish-speaking friend you could talk to regularly</p>

Need some help</a></h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for anyone who has a physical CD copy of their album &ldquo;Time and Chance&rdquo;, specifically the Philippine release. This version has an extra track at the end titled &ldquo;I Remember&rdquo;, which does not appear in most releases in other countries. I am not sure which countries&rsquo; releases had this track, but for sure it is in the Ph version. I would like to get a digital copy of this track. It is not on iTunes, Spotify, torrents, etc, so the best chance is if someone could rip it from the actual CD. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Platform(s):</strong></p>
<p>Famicom (probably no NES version)</p>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong></p>
<p>RPG/Platformer/Metroidvania</p>
<p><strong>Estimated year of release:</strong></p>

<p>A friend and I played it back in the Famicom days, we had to study katakana/hiragana to figure out how to advance. It was some sort of primitive metroidvania-style 2d platformer with exploratory elements. The character was I think some kind of bluish knight kind of person with a sword. This is all I have to go on unfortunately. Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
