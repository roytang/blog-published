<p>I wish they would do one of their big yearly crossovers (on the scale of secret invasion, fear itself, etc) where they spend a lot of time trying to identify the big bad and it turns out that it was dr doom all along. Then of course they defeat him, but it&rsquo;s just a doom bot</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m fine with requiring a button to run. Not only is that how Mario works, but I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going to be randomly walking at the wrong time if it depends on the tilt on the analog stick.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Don&rsquo;t feign confidence, <strong>be</strong> confident.</p>
<p>Take as many opportunities as you can to try to strike up conversations - don&rsquo;t restrict yourself to parties, and don&rsquo;t restrict yourself just to girls you want to hit on</p>
<p>Just keep trying, be yourself, you&rsquo;ll get used to it eventually.</p>

<p>I just crafted four times and got four X% off Valve coupons. I love it. Anyone want to trade for some other coupons?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s been a good sale and christmas hunt. I did get one game from the gift pile (SpaceChem), and bought quite a few cheap ones.</p>
<p>I hope you guys had a good holiday sale :D</p>

<p>DX:HR or the Witcher 2 would be great if possible. Some other hopefuls:  Magicka (with all DLC preferably?), Audiosurf, Shogun 2, Might and Magic Clash of Heroes, SPAZ. Please don&rsquo;t ask me how many coals I want for a game, just make an offer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also consider other games, just make an offer here.</p>
<p>Thanks :D</p>
<p>Edit: I only get to check Reddit every few hours or so, so I may not reply immediately. Cheers.</p>

<p>nope, real life is harsher. sorry dude.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not trying to discourage you, but the &ldquo;standard meta decks&rdquo; are tuned by hundreds of players regularly, that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re standard. it&rsquo;s difficult for a lone player with a rogue deck to match the level of tuning these decks have.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying you can&rsquo;t do it, there&rsquo;s a chance you&rsquo;ve hit on some interesting concept that may crush a lot of other decks out there. or maybe you&rsquo;re a deckbuilding genius savant, i dunno.</p>

<p>If those are the DLC you&rsquo;re buying, then yeah, you would have a problem. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I managed to get 2 pretty good Fallout:New Vegas DLCs for the price of those &ldquo;few guns&rdquo;</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I like the Civ DLC. I don&rsquo;t enjoy map packs, but then again I don&rsquo;t have to buy them. But I like the additional civs being added every now and then. Keeps the game fresh. In fact, I&rsquo;d like to have as many civs as possible, but I don&rsquo;t want to have to wait forever for that game. And with Steam, I never have to buy them full price, I just wait for the next big sale.</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t mind not having religion or corporations, I already have Civ4 for that. :D</p>

<ul>
<li>preferably free :)</li>
<li>easy to transfer/manage lots of files including folder hierarchy (talking hundreds of files in dozens of folders here)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently using ComicFlow, but the limitation of this app is that it only supports a folder structure that is up to one folder deep.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t recommend Stanza, the file management there is terrible when you get to a larger number of files.</p>
<p>Thanks :D</p>

<p>So the library guy at the college asks me to find a copy of the wolf queen v6 at the folgunthur crypt. Trouble is i&rsquo;ve already cleared this dungeon and have the book in my inventory, but i dont get the option to turn it in, and the quest marker still points to the empty chest in the crypt that i got it from. I tried putting it back in the chest (so i could pick it up again) but apparently i cant because its a quest item. Anything i can do about this?</p>

<p>I mean, if both a 3g connection and a wifi connection are available, will it use the wifi instead of the 3g?</p>
