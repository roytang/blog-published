<div class="content e-content">

<p>I think the year in parenthesis is the year the series started. It makes sense for most of them, but not for Amazing Spider-Man. Pretty sure it didn&rsquo;t start in 1999. Shrug.</p>
<p>For series to jump into, do you want to follow an ongoing series? If yes, the recent ones that I like: Daredevil (&lt; 10 issues), Uncanny X-Men (they rebooted last year, only 5 issues so far), Uncanny X-Force (this is around 20 issues in), Wolverine and the X-Men (5 issues), Defenders (only 2 issues in! I like the art). The X-books might be a bit harder to pick up if you&rsquo;re not familiar with the characters as they reference a lot of previous storylines.</p>
<p>You might be interested in the Ultimate line, it&rsquo;s basically a separate universe they started around 10 years ago that has less back story for a new reader to follow. They have some ongoing series currently, namely Ultimate Comics Spider-Man (6 issues in, this Spider-Man is not Peter Parker), Ultimate Comics X-Men (6 issues) and Ultimate Comics The Ultimates (6 issues). If you want to go back farther, I suggest picking up trades of Ultimate Spider-Man (this was the first Ultimate book, and it ended last year) and Ultimate X-Men.</p>
<p>If you want some Avengers, they have several series ongoing. Avengers, New Avengers and Secret Avengers are all okay, and they&rsquo;re all in the 20+ issue range. I like New Avengers best among the three, I need to catch up on Secret Avengers</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>The book is great, except I find the pacing horribly slow. I understand  they&rsquo;re taking it slow deliberately because they&rsquo;re targetting new readers who may or may not be familiar with the rest of the league, but I feel like with a bit tighter pacing they could have gotten the current 5-issue plot in 3 issues or so.</p>
<p>Maybe I just got spoiled by Morrison&rsquo;s JLA run. By issue 5, Morrison was already on the second story arc!</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Most Filipinos already speak English, I don&rsquo;t think there will be a big enough market (there are too many people here who can teach English). Although there are also a lot of Koreans who come here to learn English, so I dunno. Shrug. Your best bet might be English accent training for call centers (locals can&rsquo;t compete with a native American English speaker in this field) OR teaching at international schools (they may prefer expats)</p>
<p>Haha sorry for not being very helpful.</p>

Also, can anyone recommend alternatives?</a></h4>
<p>In my previous thread <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/mv9ji/can_someone_recommend_a_comic_book_reader_cbrcbz/">http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/mv9ji/can_someone_recommend_a_comic_book_reader_cbrcbz/</a> practically everyone recommended comiczeal, but it doesn&rsquo;t have the easy collection management features I was looking for. Specifically, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a way to upload multiple folders&rsquo; worth of comics at a time (both the sync app and itunes file sharing only accept files, not folders), and no easy way to delete lots of comics at a time (still need to select them individually or something)</p>
<p>Is there a way to ask Apple for a refund because I&rsquo;m not satisfied with the app?</p>
<p>Also, can someone recommend any alternatives?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>No offense, but you were probably applying for the wrong companies (obvious if you consider they have some sort of padrino system), either that or you were aiming for jobs you werent qualified for. Not only have i found my current job without any sort of connections, i do not personally know anyone who needed connections to land their job. I&rsquo;ve also interviewed dozens of applicants for entry level positions, everytime i had to fail an applicant it was because he didnt have the talent we needed, connections never came into play.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Disclaimer: I&rsquo;m really bad at explaining things to kids! Especially since this involves probability.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s late in the game and you already have 8 swamps in play. You don&rsquo;t want to draw any more lands, you just want creature to attack with or spells to kill stuff with. If you had 24 swamps in your deck, there&rsquo;d be 16 more lands you can draw after playing 8 swamps! If you had only 32 cards left in your deck, half of those would be lands!</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say instead of 24 swamps, you had 4 marsh flats and 20 swamps instead. And instead of having 8 swamps in play, you have 6 swamps and 2 marsh flats. Everything else is the same (32 cards left in the deck) If you use the two marsh flats to remove 2 swamps from your deck and put them into play, you now have only 30 cards left in your deck. More importantly, now only 14 of them are lands! (12 swamps and 2 marsh flats). So now your odds of drawing odds are slightly less than 50% - 14/30!</p>
<p>It all boils down to improving probabilities and thinning your deck, making it a bit easier to draw useful cards later on.</p>

<p>How high does he think online piracy should rank in terms of America (and the world&rsquo;s) priorities? Aren&rsquo;t there a multitude of more pressing problems regarding poverty, education, unemployment, healthcare that the governments should focus on?</p>
<p>How does he compare the &ldquo;no due process&rdquo; provisions of SOPA (allowing websites to be shut down without need for evidence or hearing) to the constitutional guarantee of &ldquo;innocent until proven guilty&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Is the MPAA even considering developing alternative business models that work with the internet instead of trying to destroy it?</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/Games/comments/oggsn/origin_is_required_for_all_pc_editions_of_mass/c3h4jzs/">a comment by niton on &#39;Origin is required for all PC editions of Mass Effect 3&#39; on /r/Games</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>I dislike the whole thing not because of the DRM (I don&rsquo;t even see Steam as DRM), I dislike it because the Origin service at the moment is crappy. They don&rsquo;t have the same amount of sales Steam does, and their customer service is horrid (there are horror stories about Steam customer service)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for having a competing service to Steam, but hopefully that competing service is a good one that forces Steam to innovate and improve to keep up (not that they&rsquo;re doing a bad job at the moment). Origin is nowhere near that yet.</p>
<p>Mass Effect 3 being exclusive to Origin isn&rsquo;t a bad thing per se, but it&rsquo;s a bit like a much anticipated game being exclusive to a console that only 5% of the market uses - the other 95% are sad, but we just move on because our platform of choice already has a vastly superior library anyway.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;m fine with requiring a button to run. Not only is that how Mario works, but I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going to be randomly walking at the wrong time if it depends on the tilt on the analog stick.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Don&rsquo;t feign confidence, <strong>be</strong> confident.</p>
<p>Take as many opportunities as you can to try to strike up conversations - don&rsquo;t restrict yourself to parties, and don&rsquo;t restrict yourself just to girls you want to hit on</p>
<p>Just keep trying, be yourself, you&rsquo;ll get used to it eventually.</p>

<p>I just crafted four times and got four X% off Valve coupons. I love it. Anyone want to trade for some other coupons?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s been a good sale and christmas hunt. I did get one game from the gift pile (SpaceChem), and bought quite a few cheap ones.</p>
<p>I hope you guys had a good holiday sale :D</p>

<p>DX:HR or the Witcher 2 would be great if possible. Some other hopefuls:  Magicka (with all DLC preferably?), Audiosurf, Shogun 2, Might and Magic Clash of Heroes, SPAZ. Please don&rsquo;t ask me how many coals I want for a game, just make an offer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also consider other games, just make an offer here.</p>
<p>Thanks :D</p>
<p>Edit: I only get to check Reddit every few hours or so, so I may not reply immediately. Cheers.</p>

<p>nope, real life is harsher. sorry dude.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not trying to discourage you, but the &ldquo;standard meta decks&rdquo; are tuned by hundreds of players regularly, that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re standard. it&rsquo;s difficult for a lone player with a rogue deck to match the level of tuning these decks have.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying you can&rsquo;t do it, there&rsquo;s a chance you&rsquo;ve hit on some interesting concept that may crush a lot of other decks out there. or maybe you&rsquo;re a deckbuilding genius savant, i dunno.</p>
