<div class="content e-content">

<p>I don&rsquo;t see it as a problem. We don&rsquo;t know how large the print run is going to be (people are just speculating about it), and no matter how limited it was, it&rsquo;s still adding some N number of modern legal cards into the wild, which is better than adding 0.</p>

<p>Misleading title, and linking directly to his twitter profile means anyone who clicks the link after 24 hours will have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about. (It&rsquo;s only been 4 hours and I had to read the comments to figure out what you&rsquo;re talking about)</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t really enjoy ToA (haven&rsquo;t finished yet, but I&rsquo;m about 80% through the game). Too much unnecessary walking around for me.</p>
<p>Dunno about EO4, but I enjoyed the demo.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>The characters are all owned by Marvel. Marvel is owned by Disney.</p>
<p>Sony doesnt &ldquo;own&rdquo; the Spider-man franchise. Sony has an exclusive license from Marvel to use Spider-man in movies; that means only they can produce Spider-man movies. The license is from before Marvel had their own movie studio.</p>
<p>Fox also has a similar license for the X-Men/Fantastic Four.</p>
<p>For any characters where Marvel hasn&rsquo;t given anyone else an exclusive movie license, they can use those characters in their own movies.</p>

<p>I sunk some 2-300 hours into Crusaders of the Dark Savant back in the day, but never managed to finish it, although I think I got rather close. I remember that it was always troublesome to find those maps off the randomly wandering NPCs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have time to play it again though :p</p>

<p>While I have fond memories of it (and still have a copy at home), it kind of bothers me that late game always devolved to having one uber-hero with a stack of doom and a bunch of other heroes to assist him by moving troops and items and resources around. I&rsquo;m not sure if this has changed in 5 or 6.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Physical purchases (vita cartridges/ps3 discs) are not region locked, you can play games you bought from any physical store anywhere.</p>
<p>For PS+, you&rsquo;ll need a Sony Entertainment Network (SEN) account. Your account will have a country associated with it at creation time and this cannot be changed later.</p>
<p>Online purchases made through the PSN store are tied to your SEN account and the Vita can only have one account active. If you will be in Canada long-term, I suggest that you get a North American PS+ code with your Vita and create a North American (Canada or US) account. However, I don&rsquo;t know if the NA Plus offerings are better than whatever Australian accounts get.</p>
<p>Additionally, I think the PSN stores will only accept credit cards from the same region (this is true for the US store), so it if you plan to make online purchases, take this into account.</p>
<p>DLC for some games is region-locked. For example: a region 1 (North America) copy of Street Fighter x Tekken will only work with DLC downloaded/purchased from a US or Canada PSN store.</p>

<p>Turn-based RPGs, for example, really have nothing to show in terms of gameplay. I suppose responsive menus and quick responses to button presses, but past that it gets pretty hard to improve the gameplay aspect of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My Vita uses a US account; Can I buy an R3 SFxT and use the extra characters DLC on my R3 SFxT PS3 copy? I&rsquo;m not sure whether the SFxT character DLC comes as a code with the game (in which case there wouldnt be any problem), or if I somehow need to login the Vita with my R3 account.</p>
<p>To be clear:</p>
<p>PSN account on my Vita - US</p>
<p>SFxT PS3 copy - R3 (Asia) (I already have this)</p>
<p>SFxT Vita copy - R3 (Asia) (I plan to buy this)</p>
<p>I already know the DLC from the Vita copy will work with the PS3 copy (since they&rsquo;re both R3); what I don&rsquo;t know is whether</p>
<p>(a) the SFxT Vita copy will come with a redemption code for the character DLC that I can just redeem in the PSN Store on my PS3 (I have R3 accounts for this- HK and SG); or</p>
<p>(b) I would need to have an R3 account on my Vita to be able to get the DLC</p>
