<p>I just bought a Vita (yay me!) so I could take advantage of my existing plus subscription. My brother tried it out and he seems interested to get one too, but he&rsquo;s asking me whether we would be able to use the same PSN account on two vitas (so that we both have access to the IGC)?</p>

<p>Mtgo doesnt have an open api - most bots do it through some sort of screen scraping approach. None of them are open either, since most bots are used for profit.</p>

<p>This was the obvious conclusion, and it&rsquo;s why I won&rsquo;t be buying a PS4 for some time. I&rsquo;m prepared (and willing) to just have the PS3 as my console for a couple more years. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re still going to get some good games later in the release cycle.</p>

<p>How to specify that it will alert me only when I get to the location? As far as I can tell the only options for reminders are &ldquo;Remind me on a day&rdquo;, &ldquo;Repeat&rdquo; and &ldquo;Priority&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>when I get home, remind me to do X</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>next time I&rsquo;m at this restaurant, remind me to order Y</p>

<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s a lot more assets that are needed given the amount of content typically packed into an RPG. That means a lot more story, characters, items, balancing, models, voices, videos, etc compared to something like an FPS, which translates to higher effort and thus higher costs. Is this a valid assumption? If yes, then why do companies keep making RPGs, are they more profitable than other genres? If no, what other factors go into the cost of other genres?</p>

<p>People enjoy different things.</p>
<p>That being said, try to challenge yourself every so often, maybe you&rsquo;ll learn new things or grow somehow.</p>

<p>Is there a way to disable those leader messages that I don&rsquo;t really have to respond to? Like when they denounce me, or &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve become friends with [country]&rdquo;? Also the CS popup when you first meet them. It&rsquo;s like those things can just be little notifications on the right side.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I consider myself ok in terms of strategy like spacing, pokes, mind games and the like, but my problem in general is poor execution; it&rsquo;s most probably because i dont want to put in the effort to memorize and practice combo strings and stuff. Like in sf4 i can pull of fadc&rsquo;s occasionally in training mode, but i dont have any hope of pulling it off in the middle of a heated match. For this reason i tend to rely more on short bnb combos</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be travelling for a bit, and I&rsquo;m looking for a PDF or something else (maybe a single web page that I can save) that I can read offline while I&rsquo;m travelling. I&rsquo;m looking for the sort of thing that I can read off the civfanatics forums, but I dont want to have to save each thread individually? Just thought I&rsquo;d post here on the off chance that someone one knows something like this somewhere.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>it wasn&rsquo;t long ago that I was putting roads/railroads on every tile possible rather than just linking cities</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember doing this back in Civ1, because roads/rails gave tiles a trade bonus and there was no maintenance penalty for having too many roads. At that time too, rails cost ZERO movement points, which meant railing my entire continent = units instantly move from one end to the other at will. Good times lol</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using BayanDSL. The speed isn&rsquo;t the best, but it&rsquo;s ok most of the time. My brothers are basically playing DOTA2 every night, though they do experience some lag. Customer service is better than PLDT&rsquo;s at least. If I call their trunk line to complain about connection problems they&rsquo;re going to send someone to check the next day. (When they say someone&rsquo;s going to come the next day, it&rsquo;s true)</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15yq5f/philippines_authorities_propose_scrapping_hunt/">&#39;Philippines authorities propose scrapping hunt for billions looted by Marcos - latimes.com&#39; on /r/Philippines</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>The headline is ridiculous, since scrapping the PCGG is not the same as giving up on the Marcos loot, it just means that we won&rsquo;t have a dedicated agency for that one task, and their tasks will devolve to the DoJ.</p>
