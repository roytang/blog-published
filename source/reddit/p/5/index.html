<div class="content e-content">

<p>Whoever has more lands in hand is more likely to win, but how many lands you draw off the swans will still matter.</p>
<p>Say I have 5 lands and you have 4.</p>
<p>I target the swans with Seismic Assault, discarding one land. If you let it resolve, I draw two cards and potentially gain even more land in hand advantage. If you try to respond by activating your own Seismic Assault, I can respond by discarding another land. Since I have land advantage, my Seismic Assault will always resolve first, which means I get to draw cards first. Whoever draws cards first, if he draws at least one land, he can activate Seismic Assault again to keep the chain going. There will be an opening if the player with land advantage is unlucky enough to draw enough nonlands to lose his advantage.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Locals will have a tendency to fawn over Westerners who come to the country, so at least at the start you might feel like you can do no wrong.</p>
<p>Locals are also a lot less&hellip; direct than Westerners and if there are problems they may dance about the issues a bit for fear of looking bad. You might need to be less direct with any criticism than you&rsquo;re used to with Westerners. And some might have difficulty talking to you if they aren&rsquo;t confident in their English (most Filipinos will be able to speak/understand English to some extent, but not everyone will have decent grammar etc)</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a strong sense of power distance in the company, so they might be a bit afraid of you especially if you are perceived as being &ldquo;higher in the food chain&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Going out with them for meals and maybe treating them every once in a while (don&rsquo;t let them get used to it) would be good ways to become accepted as part of the group. But that power distance may be difficult to breach.</p>
<p>All of these are generalizations of course, not all locals are like the above (I consider myself an exception - I&rsquo;m quite direct even when talking to foreigners), so YMMV.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s this video my brother shared to our family chat group, where my one and a half year old nephew is sitting on a chair and animatedly telling a story, complete with facial expressions and hand motions and pointing around and everything, except everything he says is gibberish because he doesn&rsquo;t really know how to talk yet. I&rsquo;ve watched it for the fourth time just now and it still makes me giggle.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Note sure if this is a good place to ask but: I&rsquo;m thinking of getting a MacBook Pro, should I worry about the supposed keyboard issues?  Background: my main reason for wanting to replace my windows laptop with  an apple one is so i can compile my react native projects for ios  release. (Previously I had been asking my brother to do it for me). I’ve  avoided getting one mostly due to how expensive it is compared to a  windows machine, but I might be willing to bite the bullet now. Since  I’m a programmer, the reported issues with the new keyboard concern me,  how likely am I to encounter this problem, assuming I am buying brand  new?</p>

<p><strong>Platform(s):</strong>
Famicom (probably no NES version)</p>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong>
RPG/Platformer/Metroidvania</p>
<p><strong>Estimated year of release:</strong>
Famicom era, so sometime 1986-1990 maybe</p>
<p><strong>Graphics/art style:</strong>
Side-scrolling 2d graphics. The environment was all in, uh, I want to say &ldquo;blocks&rdquo; (like a mario game I guess?), with the main character being like 1.5-2 blocks high.</p>
<p><strong>Notable characters:</strong>
The main (and only) character was I think some kind of bluish knight kind of person with a sword.</p>
<p><strong>Notable gameplay mechanics:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Other details:</strong>
A friend and I played it back in the Famicom days, we had to study katakana/hiragana to figure out how to advance. It was some sort of primitive metroidvania-style 2d platformer with exploratory elements. This is all I have to go on unfortunately. Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Amazing, this was it! I last posted this a couple of years ago and no one was able to identify it! Thanks a bunch!</p>
<p>But why is the video posted in English? The Wikipedia page doesn&rsquo;t list an English release for the game and I definitely remember only playing it in Japanese. Or is there a romhack translation?</p>

<p>I imagine the profitability of a comic shop isn&rsquo;t that high though. Or am I wrong? Or is it one of those things were you have to be lucky to find a good location?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I did a prerelease at the Hareruya in Tokyo (because it happened to coincide with a trip with friends), it was cool. I think they&rsquo;re pretty used to foreigners coming in, they had English-language prerelease packs for us. And everyone could communicate to some degree. I was mostly able to cope despite not being 100% familiar with the cards. My one problem was when someone played a creature with an ability that I wasn&rsquo;t sure what it was and the guy had to say it a few times. I kept hearing &ldquo;mens&rdquo; but eventually figured out it was &ldquo;menace&rdquo; lol.</p>
<p>(This anecdote isn&rsquo;t really relevant to constructed I guess lol sorry)</p>
