<div class="content e-content">

<blockquote>
<p>since mono-red is the majority of the meta at my ranking, what deck would be best to punish that deck</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For budget options, I like the white weenie decks vs red. They have 12 one-drops that can gain life (the vampire from legion&rsquo;s landing, the 1/1 lifelink flier and the 1/1 gain 1 life if if i have 3 creatures), so they almost always have incidental lifegain. If they manage to pump even 1-2 lifelink vampires with the &ldquo;convoke and put a +1/+1 counter on my dudes&rdquo; elephant, it&rsquo;s a big deal. (I should really learn the names of cards). Selesnya is also pretty good - they have access to both Knight of Autumn and Wildgrowth Walker, so it&rsquo;s kind of a nightmare. And then of course there&rsquo;s those control decks that have Absorb AND &ldquo;Gain 3 life draw a card&rdquo; AND Moment of Craving. I consider these much worse matchups for RDW than Golgari</p>
<p>I agree the Golgari deck can run out of steam too. Golgari&rsquo;s advantage is that your creatures are generally of higher quality and will win over theirs (except maybe for Chainwhirler). Find, Vivien, Karn, and even small Vraska are good for getting your second wind and refilling your hand after stabilizing.</p>
<p>I also run 1 Brontodon in the main, but I don&rsquo;t think I can cut the reapers, as I&rsquo;ve won a few close fights just by chump blocking with creatures to draw cards and find my answers.</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/ais6hu/standard_golgari_midrange_players_how_do_you_beat/">&#39;[Standard] Golgari Midrange players, how do you beat Mono Red?&#39; on /r/spikes</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>I started tracking my BO1 Arena games today. Out of 35 matches, I faced 8 RDW, won 50% (4 matches). I think the matchup overall is about 50-50, maybe 55-45 in Golgari&rsquo;s favor, and your win rate goes up if you get at least one life gain off Wildgrowth Walker. The 3 out of the 4 games I lost I either didn&rsquo;t have access to one color, or never got off 2 lands. (I might need to mulligan better or add more duals - I&rsquo;ve been saving my rare WCs so I only have 3 shock 2 check)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played both decks on Arena; red has some explosive hands, but has a tendency to run out of steam. If they get the nut draw, there&rsquo;s not much you can do, and you&rsquo;ll be down to 6-8 before turn 4.</p>
<p>Having wildgrowth isn&rsquo;t necessary to win - 2 out of my 4 wins I didn&rsquo;t draw one.</p>
<p>The ideal opening hand has 2-3 explore creatures (ideally two 2-drops, squire is preferred over branchwalker and a jadelight) to ensure a steady flow of lands. On turn one you play an elf if you have it, even if you have to use a shock, because they&rsquo;ll bolt it everytime, and 2 &lt;= 2-3. I kind of wish I had been tracking who was going first - I suspect it matters a lot, I&rsquo;ll do that tomorrow.</p>
<p>You want to play creatures on turns 2-3 and just assume they&rsquo;re going to die. You want them to waste their burn spells on your creatures. Play wildgrowth last, but if he&rsquo;s your only guy, it&rsquo;s okay to run him on 2 (especially if you have Find to get him back later).</p>
<p>When exploring during the early turns, send to the graveyard Tyrant, Karn, big Vraska, or Vivienne, those won&rsquo;t be much help. Getting more creatures is better, just make sure you can play them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to stabilize at around turns 4-6, with around 6-10 life, and hopefully the red deck&rsquo;s hand is spent. 6 life is scary - you&rsquo;re basically hoping he doesn&rsquo;t have two bolts, but it happens. Stay scared, never attack without leaving a blocker for a hasted 2/2 mage. You&rsquo;re hoping he doesn&rsquo;t draw LUtS, Risk Factor or Frenzy (frenzy is the worst for him, light up is the best)</p>

<p>Any recommendations? Baka lang may alam kayo na di ko pa alam lol</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Book Sale sa malls of course, but the selection isn&rsquo;t really that good.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Bookay-Ukay in Teacher&rsquo;s Village, selection is a bit better than Book Sale, but parang hindi sya bukas the last time I was in that area.</p>
<p>There used to be a small used book store with a pretty good selection called Chapter IX in Circle C mall along Congressional Avenue, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be there anymore.</p>
<p>The best one I&rsquo;ve found sa Metro Manila was this pop up stall that often appeared in Greenfield near Shaw on Friday evenings. Haven&rsquo;t been there for a few years, so IDK if this is still a thing, pero maganda yung selection nila madaming sci-fi/fantasy classics (I got my copy of Dune there)</p>

<p>Whoever has more lands in hand is more likely to win, but how many lands you draw off the swans will still matter.</p>
<p>Say I have 5 lands and you have 4.</p>
<p>I target the swans with Seismic Assault, discarding one land. If you let it resolve, I draw two cards and potentially gain even more land in hand advantage. If you try to respond by activating your own Seismic Assault, I can respond by discarding another land. Since I have land advantage, my Seismic Assault will always resolve first, which means I get to draw cards first. Whoever draws cards first, if he draws at least one land, he can activate Seismic Assault again to keep the chain going. There will be an opening if the player with land advantage is unlucky enough to draw enough nonlands to lose his advantage.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Locals will have a tendency to fawn over Westerners who come to the country, so at least at the start you might feel like you can do no wrong.</p>
<p>Locals are also a lot less&hellip; direct than Westerners and if there are problems they may dance about the issues a bit for fear of looking bad. You might need to be less direct with any criticism than you&rsquo;re used to with Westerners. And some might have difficulty talking to you if they aren&rsquo;t confident in their English (most Filipinos will be able to speak/understand English to some extent, but not everyone will have decent grammar etc)</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a strong sense of power distance in the company, so they might be a bit afraid of you especially if you are perceived as being &ldquo;higher in the food chain&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Going out with them for meals and maybe treating them every once in a while (don&rsquo;t let them get used to it) would be good ways to become accepted as part of the group. But that power distance may be difficult to breach.</p>
<p>All of these are generalizations of course, not all locals are like the above (I consider myself an exception - I&rsquo;m quite direct even when talking to foreigners), so YMMV.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s this video my brother shared to our family chat group, where my one and a half year old nephew is sitting on a chair and animatedly telling a story, complete with facial expressions and hand motions and pointing around and everything, except everything he says is gibberish because he doesn&rsquo;t really know how to talk yet. I&rsquo;ve watched it for the fourth time just now and it still makes me giggle.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Note sure if this is a good place to ask but: I&rsquo;m thinking of getting a MacBook Pro, should I worry about the supposed keyboard issues?  Background: my main reason for wanting to replace my windows laptop with  an apple one is so i can compile my react native projects for ios  release. (Previously I had been asking my brother to do it for me). I’ve  avoided getting one mostly due to how expensive it is compared to a  windows machine, but I might be willing to bite the bullet now. Since  I’m a programmer, the reported issues with the new keyboard concern me,  how likely am I to encounter this problem, assuming I am buying brand  new?</p>
