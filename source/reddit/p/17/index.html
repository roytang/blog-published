    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/246px0/golden_week_sale_celebrates_japanese_games/">&#39;Golden Week Sale Celebrates Japanese Games&#39; on /r/PlayStationPlus</a>:

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Okay, the sale has been up for a few days, but I still can&rsquo;t decide what to get, if any. I have $20 available in the PSN wallet to spend, but I already have a ridiculously long backlog and next to no free space on my Vita memcard.</p>
<p>Here are the games I&rsquo;m considering:</p>
<p>Tales of Symphonia Chronicles - the price is really good, but I can borrow this from a friend</p>
<p>MGS HD Collection (Vita) - I can borrow the PS3 version from a friend, however I generally have more time/am more inclined to play on a Vita</p>
<p>Muramasa - looks interesting, but I&rsquo;m worried it will be free on Plus soon</p>
<p>Ys: Memories of Celceta - a lot of people recommend it, but it looks like I might be able to get a used physical copy at around the sale price</p>
<p>Tactics Ogre - it seems like it would be nice to have this on Vita, but I have it on PSP (I think my PSP is still working&hellip;haven&rsquo;t touched it in a while)</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>

<p>Very true, the man likes to draw the extra cards, that&rsquo;s not too much of a bad thing though.</p>
<p>Blue is very good in Theros as well, so I wouldn&rsquo;t mind recommending it for the prerelease anyway (a lot of people I know seem to prefer White, which is cool too)</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/23xayg/jou_lsv_set_review_green_the_rest/">&#39;[JOU] LSV Set Review: Green &amp; The Rest&#39; on /r/magicTCG</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Now that all of LSV&rsquo;s limited reviews are up, here&rsquo;s some stats for JOU:</p>
<p>Total score of commons in each color:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>W - 29.5</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>U - 30.5</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B - 29</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R - 28</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>G - 28.5</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Total score of uncommons in each color:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>W - 28</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>U - 30</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B - 24</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R - 26</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>G - 23.5</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, these stats could mean nothing and don&rsquo;t take into account how individual cards stack against each other and you should still use your best judgment, and LSV isn&rsquo;t always right/accurate, but if you have no time at all to study up on the set and don&rsquo;t know what color to pick for the prerelease, I&rsquo;d go with Blue, with White as a second choice.</p>
<p>Have fun at the prerelease everyone!</p>

<p>Seems we got the preview pretty early this month? I usually expect it on the last week before we get the first free game.</p>
<p>This month is okay (yay, Skullgirls!), but I wonder what&rsquo;s the chance of getting Metal Gear HD Collection or UMvC3 on the PSVita for PSPlus?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t too impressed with the final issue. Some nice sequences overall, but a number of parts seemed rushed, like how Peter explains things so quickly to Carlie, Miguel, the Avengers even. And the Goblin recognizing it was Peter after one line of banter?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed in how Norman got away. Spider-man gets stunned for one panel and suddenly he&rsquo;s gone and neither Peter nor Miguel bother to look for him? Obviously they ran out of space to wrap that up neatly, but jeez</p>
<p>I just felt it needed a bit more oomph as a series finale I guess. I suppose they&rsquo;ll be covering the repercussions of Otto&rsquo;s run in the months to come though</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;ve been in situations where I knew a friend was about to do something stupid that could ruin her life, but there was nothing I could do to stop it or dissuade her, all I could do was stand by and bear witness to the inevitable (metaphorical) train wreck that she would have to climb out of. It&rsquo;s terrible because you give advice and you feel like you&rsquo;re not listened to when you&rsquo;re only looking out for them and you&rsquo;re being completely sensible.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just have to let people make their own mistakes.</p>

<p>Just finished reading the Man Out of Time and Winter Soldier story arcs of Brubaker&rsquo;s Captain America run.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t really keeping up with comics back then, how did fans react to Brubaker bringing back Bucky? Did people know ahead of time he was coming back, was it hinted at, or was it a big surprise?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>There are small moments that each person lives for - the smile on a little kid&rsquo;s face, the joy of seeing your crush when you come in to the office in the morning, the satisfaction of a job well done, the thrill of beating unfair odds, the warm feeling of being able to help someone, etc. It varies person by person but these small moments of joy and happiness, no matter how rarely they come to us make all the stress, worries, problems, fears and insecurities of the in-between moments worth slogging through.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;m told that when I was a little kid I had the ability to quickly determine what day of the week any given date was, and the grownups couldn&rsquo;t figure out how I did it. I don&rsquo;t remember this at all - I probably just did some quick maths in my head or something. Now that I think about it, I guess it&rsquo;s not <em>too</em> useless.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Set some high-energy song as your alarm. I use &ldquo;The Final Countdown&rdquo;</p>
<p>Use multiple alarms, spaced 20-35 minutes apart. Try setting the first alarm to be around 1-1.5 hours before you need to wake up. Adjust the number of alarms and the spacing and the initial time until you find a mix that works for you. You can use different tunes/songs for each alarm.</p>
<p>At one point I had something like 10-12 alarms, two of them were Final Countdown, five of them were some rooster crowing, and the others were alarm clock sounds. The earliest alarm came at around 5 AM while the last one fired at 8:10 AM (which at that time was the absolute latest time I could wake up without risking being late for work)</p>
