<p>Can you imagine what it was like to be the poor hapless employee who wrote this barely-recognizable-as-English text?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huy, teka ba&rsquo;t ako? Ba&rsquo;t ako magsusulat neto? Wala bang iba? Alam nyo naman mahina ang English ko? Anlaki ng budget natin, wala ba tayong marunong talaga magsulat? Teka lang, wag nyo ko madaliin, kinakabahan ako. Sige na, sige na, susubukan ko. Pano ba dapat to? Wala ba kong makokopyahan? Ngayon lang ba tayo gumawa ng ganitong id? Ano ba dapat nakasulat dito? Kasi naman, ba&rsquo;t ba ako nandito, e sabi ko nung nagapply ako PCSO, hindi PCOO. Eto na, eto na, saglit lang. Ano ba English ng isaoli? May magrereview naman siguro nito ano? Kelangan pa ng pirma ni secretary e, may magsasabi naman siguro kung may mali? Walang sisihan ha, pinipilit nyo ko, e lahat ng pinapanood ko sa tv tagalog, sana pumasa ingles ko. Bakit may pulang underline ito sa Word? Ano ba ibig sabihin nun? Ok ba yun? Sige na, bahala na si Batman, send ko na lang to. May magrereview naman siguro bago iprint.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>It&rsquo;s pattern recognition. You have to be able to deduce a pattern from the earlier entries.</p>
<p>In your example, you can see that in the first 3, there are 1, 2, and 3 lines near the edge in the first 3 boxes, so logically there must be 4 lines in the next box. This eliminates the 2nd and 4th answers.</p>
<p>In the first 3 boxes, the symbols are on the bottom, then the left edge, then the bottom again. If you choose the first answer for the fourth box, that makes [bottom, left, bottom, bottom] which is no pattern, while if you choose the third answer, the pattern is [bottom, left, bottom, left], so the answer is C</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>That&rsquo;s not how currencies work.</p>
<p>I can however tell you that in the Tokyo area, you can get a cheap fastfood-like lunch for around 500-1000 yen. Fancier meals are available for around 1500 yen or more. Other areas are typically cheaper than Tokyo.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to remember this game, basically it&rsquo;s a space shooter (like Gradius) except the POV is from behind the ship and you always face and fire towards the center of the screen and you can only move your ship in a circle around the center of the screen using left-right keys. Probably SNES era based on my murky recollection of what the graphics looked like</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>The only scenario I can think of ATM where I want to go back to the previous column is when I want to modify the indentation of a line to be aligned to the previous column. In this scenario, does your editor not support backspace to go back to the previous column? (I actually had to open sublime to figure out how I do it since it&rsquo;s so instinctive for me right now)</p>
<p>Or is there another scenario I&rsquo;m missing out on?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We need to add a live support chat to a platform we&rsquo;re developing. It seems there&rsquo;s a lot of options out there and it&rsquo;s difficult to sift through them, so I thought I could ask reddit for help/recommendations.</p>
<p>Basically it&rsquo;s for users of our web application to talk to live support. Ideally something not too complicated to setup and support. We are a software dev team ourselves, but our client kind of added this request at the last minute so to save on costs we are looking for a prebuilt solution.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t need too many frills/features on the customer/UI side, but some nice to haves:</p>
<ul>
<li>control over the backend database</li>
<li>user account integration (i.e. the operator knows which of our system users he is chatting with)</li>
</ul>
<p>Any advice or recommendations would be appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I think there&rsquo;s also surviving/earning money to survive. I guess that&rsquo;s not a waste of time, although I guess you could somehow include that in &ldquo;improving yourself&rdquo;</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Unfortunately, the problem is humans.</p>
<p>Realistically, what can facebook (or any other internet/social media/news platform) do? The most they can do is promote &ldquo;reliable&rdquo; content and deprioritize &ldquo;unreliable&rdquo; content, but then they run into issues of how to rate the reliability of sources/content.</p>
<p>And even assuming they solve that (maybe by asking govt+independent orgs to certify reliability?), what are they supposed to do if people keep sharing unreliable content regardless?</p>
<p>Total worldwide online connectivity unfortunately means the internet brings together even believers of supposedly fringe ideas - flat earthers, anti-vaxxers, conspiracy theorists, white supremacists, fanatics, etc and if you censor their content they will complain about freedom of speech and that starts us down a slippery slope&hellip;</p>
<p>The long term solution would be to educate people, but that relies on more people being willing to be good actors on social networks and speak up against fake news and other unreliable stuff. It isn&rsquo;t in the hands of the tech companies</p>

<p>TRAIN is neutral to okay for the middle class, who get to pay less taxes. Prices will go up, but since they have some discretionary funds to spend, they can simply manage their budget accordingly.</p>
<p>TRAIN is bad for the poor, who weren&rsquo;t paying taxes before anyway. They get no direct benefit, and yet have to suffer higher prices. They already have low discretionary funds to spend, so they have to stretch their budgets further.</p>
<p>TRAIN is a bit bad for the upper class (those who pay the correct taxes at least), but they have wider discretionary budget to spend so they will just pay a little more (or more will be driven to evade taxes completely)</p>
<p>TRAIN is good for the government, since it means more collections and less money spent on enforcement (since taxes on consumption are easier to collect/implement than personal income taxes)</p>
<p>Lastly, TRAIN is very bad for ROHQ employees due to the presidential veto.</p>

<p>Well, if it&rsquo;s true that the new jeeps are more profitable in the long run for the drivers, why do we need to enforce the phaseout? Why not let drivers choose whether to use the old models or the new ones, and let the old model die out naturally to market forces?</p>
<p>I mean, I get all the benefits, but these jeepney drivers don&rsquo;t really earn that much. Anlaki ng cost for them nung new models, so mahihirapan talaga sila if we force them to transition.</p>
