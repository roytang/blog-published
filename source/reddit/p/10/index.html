<p>Thank you for the kind words. I have something rolling about in my head about how Alex and Harry&rsquo;s relationship devolve into what it&rsquo;s going to be. I may write it up someday.</p>

<p>So, the current surviving Clark Kent/Superman is supposedly pre-Flashpoint Superman, and New 52 Superman is dead right?</p>
<p>But Pre-Flashpoint Wally West coming out of the speed force and restoring New 52 Barry&rsquo;s memories implies that New 52 Barry is the same as Pre-Flashpoint Barry. Shouldn&rsquo;t this also mean that New 52 Superman should be the same Superman from Pre-Flashpoint? Is this discrepancy something that&rsquo;s been explained somewhere? Or we just accept that Barry and Superman transitioned differently and handwave it away. &ldquo;Comics, everbody!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I like interesting battle systems. Is there some place that documents what are the best things about the Pokemon battle system for someone who doesn&rsquo;t play the games?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>The building had a nondescript white exterior, with a single grey metal door on the facade and no other hint of what lie within. I tried the knob and a metallic rattle told me it was locked. I frowned, then remembered, then pulled out the mysterious envelope I had found under my door yesterday. I mean, 93 years from now. Well, not 93 years from now for me. Yesterday for me. God, I need to figure out how to think of time again.</p>
<p>I opened the envelope, equally nondescript as the building exterior, and shook it a bit. The small key fell out of it and I almost miss catching it. Harold would have sneered derisively if he was here. &ldquo;World&rsquo;s clumsiest time traveller!&rdquo; he would have said.</p>
<p>Harold. Harry. Good old Harry. The argument had been gone sour last night. Will have gone sour? &ldquo;Why should we go? We have no idea what this is. No idea!&rdquo; he had exclaimed, gesturing wildly as he was wont to do.</p>
<p>I inserted the small key into the lock on the doorknob, and sure enough it clicked into place. I turned the knob and stepped inside.</p>
<p>Harry was always the smart one. The prudent one. He had all these rules. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t risk collapsing the universe!&rdquo; or some such theoretical physics bullshit. He&rsquo;d be hopping mad if he knew I&rsquo;d actually gone. Well, he doesn&rsquo;t need to know, it&rsquo;s a fucking time machine isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ll be back before he knows it.</p>
<p>Behind the door was a long and dimly lit corridor. The only sound was the subtle whirring of a large ceiling fan overhead. Well, that and the creaking of the metal door as I shut it back into place.</p>
<p>A desk. There was a desk. And behind it, a person. A stocky woman, her hair tied in a bun, wearing spectacles. She looked up from what looked like a sudoku puzzle as I stepped closer. Did they even have sudoku in 1923? I reached into my pocket for the envelope again.</p>
<p>I needn&rsquo;t have bothered. &ldquo;Mr. Reyes, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; She nodded towards the far end of the hallway. &ldquo;Take the elevator at the end. There&rsquo;s only one stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er, I was hoping to ask&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pl</p>

<p>A high-pitched bell rang out a couple of times as I stepped into the diner. Outside had been slightly chilly, the first hints of the coming winter lingering in the air. Inside I gratefully took off my cap and laid it on the counter as I sat down and waved over at the middle-aged lady brewing coffee on the other end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fresh pot? I&rsquo;ll have some if that&rsquo;s alright. And any bacon and eggs you have,&rdquo; I found myself saying, surprisingly famished. The woman turned as if seeing me for the first time. I spied a name tag against her faded yellow uniform, in gilded letters it spelled out &ldquo;DOLORES&rdquo;. With a surprising assertiveness I followed up, &ldquo;As quickly as possible please Dolores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dolores&rsquo; raised her eyebrows. I&rsquo;m unsure whether it was because of my unusual order or because of my impertinence, but regardless she turned to the little window behind the counter and whispered something indistinct, I suppose to whoever needed to cook my bacon and eggs.

<p>Dolores smiled a knowing smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not rocket science hon,&rdquo; She gestured with her mouth to the parking lot outside, in the direction of the van I had been driving for the past seven hours. &ldquo;You drive up here a bit past midnight in a big-name delivery van, the kind that don&rsquo;t do deliveries at this hour.&rdquo; She put the coffee pot down and waved her hand over my face, &ldquo;Your eyes are tired and your clothes are rumpled and you smell like you&rsquo;ve been in that van for what, half a day now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awfully perceptive aren&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; I retorted back without thinking, &ldquo;For a waitress at an all-night diner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not tha</p>

<p>I have a daily reminder set.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re having trouble or don&rsquo;t have much time for a particular day, don&rsquo;t hesitate to phone it in :p</p>
<p>I also try to pick something related to draw from one of my many other interests - gaming, comic books, movies, books, etc</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I think the face looks fine. For the hands, I would guess that it starts with not getting the wrist part right (where the hand joins the arms). I try to place the back of the hand first before adding the fingers, so that I know the fingers will end up in sensible positions. Take a picture of what your own hand would look like in the given pose then use it as reference.</p>
<p>For proportions, I think the sketch looks mostly ok, although the legs might be a bit too short. You can try using one of those figure drawing outline thingies (I forgot the term, there was a sketchdaily for them a while back), just google &ldquo;figure drawing outline&rdquo;, it acts like a guide to tell you what typical body proportions should be</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no expert or anything, but I hope I was helpful!</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t tell who it was sorry :( I always find portraits of real-life people difficult to get accurately (maybe I&rsquo;ll attempt Nathan Fillion one of these days too)</p>
<p>Aside from the eyes, I find that the shape of the lower half of the face particularly on the left side of the image feels quite different from the original. The smile is a bit wider on the original too.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>The answer will be different for each person. Starting a business is more stressful and has a lot of risks but is potentially more rewarding. Taking a regular job is &ldquo;safer&rdquo; in the traditional sense, the risk here is mostly of possible future regret - in the future you may wish you had tried out riskier things when you were young.</p>
<p>There are people who will argue that having a job is still a risk since you are dependent on the competence and good will of other people to earn a living, that your safe job may not actually be as safe as you imagine since you could get fired or the company could go under at any time. But truthfully, you run the same risks when running a business, except that you do more of the work yourself, so whether you are able to overcome those risks or not is more dependent on your own effort.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>It means what the reminder text says. You can choose to cast Murderous Cut for a reduced cost (as little as one black mana!) by exiling cards from your graveyard. Each card you exile reduces the cost by (1)</p>
<p>Some decks will use the graveyard as a resource, so they will have cards that allow you to move cards directly from your own library to graveyard (often called &ldquo;milling&rdquo;). The idea is to win before running out of cards in the library, taking advantages of the additional bonuses provided by having more cards in the graveyard (for Murderous Cut, the bonus is having the choice to play it at a lower cost)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found when drawing female faces, the less lines I use they generally turn out better. I try to use just enough lines to show the facial/bone structure</p>
<p>Your sketch is pretty great though!</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Obviously this practice is deplorable. But just curious, where do we draw the line on asset flips. If someone takes these &ldquo;starter kits&rdquo; and reuses the assets but puts in some amount of work: maybe new story or mechanics, but basically still reusing the art and other assets, would that be acceptable?</p>
