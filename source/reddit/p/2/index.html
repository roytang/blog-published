<p>I went 5-2 running Bant Golos. My wins were vs Monoblack aggro, Monoblack vampires, two Golgari decks (one conceded after I Treachery&rsquo;d his 6/6 Questing Beast), and I forget what the other one was (definitely not monored or the mirror)</p>
<p>Losses were to mono-black aggro (I had the realm-cloaked giant for the wrath, but failed to notice I didnt have two white and played the wrong guildgate the turn before) and to the mirror (I got 2 field of the dead first, but he had kenrick and agent of treachery + teferi to take my fields =/)</p>

<p>Oh, that wasn&rsquo;t what I meant. I was on the iPad app when I made the last comment, for some reason the first character of some lines is missing there. See <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/XVpJ0Ge">https://imgur.com/gallery/XVpJ0Ge</a> for what I mean. Is fine on the reddit web page itself though so  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p>Hi! This demo is great! I&rsquo;m new to procreate so I&rsquo;m still learning the features.</p>
<p>I wonder if you could give me some advice. One thing I learned here is that there is a feature like when you draw in a circle then hold the pen in place for a bit, it will automatically &ldquo;smooth&rdquo; the circle. However, when I tried doing this, I can&rsquo;t get it to work consistently. The main problem is that I have unsteady hands, so when I hold the pen in place to do the smoothing, there is often still some slight movement so I guess this is why I can&rsquo;t trigger it consistently. Would you know if there is any workaround or alternative for someone like me?</p>

<p>Of course the suggestions from Wotc twitter (Bob, Bolt and Wurmcoil) are a bit ridiculous. I imagine that a lower power level would be needed. Historic needs to differentiate itself from Standard but not be as ridiculous as modern, and build up slowly but surely. I would like to see cards that had their time in Standard but haven&rsquo;t really found a good place in Modern. I don&rsquo;t agree with those saying it should be Origins-forward though, I think that&rsquo;s unnecessarily restrictive.</p>
<p>Some of my initial ideas (the first 10 are color balanced, but the rest are not):</p>
<p>Knight of the White Orchid</p>
<p>Keiga, the Tide Star</p>
<p>Korlash, Heir to Blackblade</p>
<p>Pia and Kiran Nalaar</p>
<p>Wren&rsquo;s Run Packmaster</p>
<p>Ojutai&rsquo;s Command</p>
<p>Shadowmage Infiltrator</p>
<p>Demigod of Revenge</p>
<p>Huntmaster of the Fells</p>
<p>Dauntless Escort</p>
<p>Siege Rhino</p>
<p>Cruel Ultimatum</p>
<p>Desolation Angel</p>
<p>Mystical Teachings</p>
<p>Char</p>

<p>I had a bunch of old coins from different countries and they were stored in a rusty metal container that was also exposed to water at some point. I checked it recently and many of the coins inside are covered in rust and grime and some of them are even stuck toģether. Any recommendations for cleaning them?

<div class="content e-content">

<p>i’m not a serious collector or anything; these are mostly just leftover coins from foreign trips. so i’m not looking so much to preserve value, more like in the future i’d like to be able to pull them out and go “ah these are from my trip to so-and-so country, etc” i hope that makes sense</p>

<p>This is all great, but one minor complaint: why is it <strong>Players Tour</strong> and not <strong>Player Tour</strong>? The first one sounds so weird. It&rsquo;s not like we used to have a <strong>Pros Tour</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy there&rsquo;s an oldschool Grixis Shadow list there because I haven&rsquo;t played Modern for a while and that&rsquo;s the last deck I had and I was looking at MC Barcelona and I didn&rsquo;t recognize the landscape at all and no more Grixis Shadows. IDK if I want to spend on the Knight-Captains right now to transition to Esper or Mardu. If I take my old Grixis Shadow list to a local modern tourney, how bad are the matchups with the current meta decks?</p>

<h4 id="posted-on-rseattle-a-couple-of-tourist-questionshttpsredditcomrseattlecommentsbzykkqa_couple_of_tourist_questions">Posted on r/Seattle: <a href="https://reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/bzykkq/a_couple_of_tourist_questions/">A couple of tourist questions</a></h4>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be visiting Seattle for a few days later this month, a couple of questions, possibly noobish:</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>- I want to visit the museum of pop culture, but due to logistics and scheduling, I can only do this during a time when I need to be bringing around a small piece of luggage (on wheels), in addition to my backpack. Will they let me into the museum with the luggage? Or is it not a good idea to try this?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>- my flight out of SeaTac is Southwest at 5am on a Tuesday. I plan to be at the airport maybe 9pm-10pm the night before, will they let me check in my luggage that early so that I can just hang out/sleep near the gate? (I guess this isn&rsquo;t really a Seattle-specific question, but more of I&rsquo;m not sure if a US airport will let me do this. Where I&rsquo;m from they typically won&rsquo;t let me check baggage more than 3 hours before my flight)</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/burn1c/filipinos_who_owned_a_famicomnes_how_much_was_it/">&#39;Filipinos who owned a Famicom/NES, how much was it back then and what games did you played on it?&#39; on /r/Philippines</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>We had a NES, my parents bought it when my mom&rsquo;s work sponsored a US trip for them. IDK what the price was. Problematic lang was that NES games were harder and more expensive to buy locally, and all your friends had Famicoms so mahirap ang gamesharing. Yung mga bootleg collections pati na &ldquo;1000 in 1&rdquo; etc available only as Famicom cartridges. Luckily, nagkaron ng binebenta na &ldquo;Honeybee&rdquo; adapter that let you use Famicom cartridges in a NES. I played a lot of the NES classics, all the legit Marios (there some random BS bootleg &ldquo;Super Mario 4&rdquo; that sometimes appeared), Castlevanias, Legend of Zelda (I had to borrow a NES original for this one, mahirap maghanap ng original Famicom cartridge kasi the cart needed its own battery for saving), Contra 1 and 2, Adventure Island etc etc. Kahit yung mga small games na nasa mga 16-in-1/100-in-1/etc like Popeye, Baseball, etc naging expert din ako lol. Pag bata ka madami kang time e</p>
