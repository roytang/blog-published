<div class="content e-content">

<p>Thanks for your reply, but I&rsquo;m still not clear on the &ldquo;employer-employee relationship part.</p>
<p>For example, a contractual part-time service worker in a fast food chain, he is not considered a regular employee is this correct? Is he required to register as a business? (I assume no.) Is he deduced the 8% withholding tax or the regular income tax?</p>
<p>How is this different from the scenario where you are a consultant working as a contractor for a local (PH) client (say, as a graphic designer or software developer)? Is the consultant considered an employee? Is he required to register as a business?</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve worked for a number of clients as a consultant under contract, and they always just withhold the 8% and when I ask if there&rsquo;s anything else I need to do for tax purposes, they never advise me that I need a business permit. Should their accountant been telling them otherwise?</p>
<p>&gt;  Recurring like, you expect to engage in that particular kind of transaction for more than 1 time</p>
<p>-&gt; does that mean if you are only doing this once, it is not considered recurring? i.e. a client asks me to build an application for them and I receive a one-time payment from them upon delivery and afterwards we no longer have a relationship, in this scenario you do not have to register as a business?</p>
<p>Sorry for all the follow-ups, I just want to clearly understand the scenarios wherein I would or would not be required to register as a business, because honestly I would like to avoid the bureaucracy as much as possible, hence I prefer not to register as a business if it can be avoided. I understand our duty as citizens to pay the right taxes etc and I would like to make sure I comply with any requirements and I don&rsquo;t mind the withholding tax being deducted from me. But I would prefer to know under what conditions I could structure freelance/consultant work without having to register as a business.</p>
<p>BTW, I wanted to say I appreciate your answering these questions. I had been planning to look for an accountant to consult on related matters so this thread really helps.</p>

<p>&gt; <strong>1. Should I register as a self-employed /business?</strong><br>
Only if you are earning recurring income not earned under an employer-employee relationship.</p>
<p>Please explain &ldquo;recurring income&rdquo; here? What if I am earning money not on a full-time basis, with no guarantee of recurring income? For example, a company consults with me and I get paid an hourly fee.</p>
<p>Please also explain &ldquo;employer-employee relationship&rdquo;. I was previously working as a consultant with a company, and they were deducting the withholding tax from me (I think it was 8%). My understanding is I was not an actual employee here since I was a consultant, should I have been registered as a business in this instance? It&rsquo;s just weird since this withholding tax was already reported to the BIR and it seems there was no issue.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Sorry, after I posted the comment above, I didn&rsquo;t have much time to grind Arena that month so I don&rsquo;t have much more input. The deck is sweet but it fares much better against aggro decks than the various ramp and control decks that become more prevalent once you&rsquo;re in Diamond or higher.</p>
<p>For this month, I&rsquo;ve switched to Gruul aggro for Historic BO3, the games tend to go a lot faster :)</p>

<p>So I was looking forward to playing Soul Calibur VI in the December early unlocks, but today I find out it&rsquo;s &ldquo;unavailable in my region&rdquo; and all I get is a $5 coupon for my trouble. =/ They could have indicated that in the promotional materials they kept sending me!</p>
<p>I wish they had an option for me to just gift the code to someone who is in the correct region (that way I can at least set up a trade maybe?). Instead I get a $5 coupon that IDK if I&rsquo;ll be able to use; I never purchase stuff from the Humble store because Steam gives me better regional pricing. It would be nice if I could apply the coupon to one of their other bundles instead.</p>
<p>So that this isn&rsquo;t just a rant, can I ask if purchases off the Humble store always give a Steam key?</p>
<p>Edit: I found out that Soul Calibur VI is actually purchasable for me on both Steam and the Humble Store, so IDK what&rsquo;s up with that &ldquo;unavailable in my region&rdquo; thing.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Gave this a quick run and won 5 consecutive BO3 matches easily, barely any struggle. And I never even cast scapeshift! The one close match was vs Fires; Game 1 I almost ran out of cards before I closed the game with a huge krasis, Game 2 he hit me with Unmoored Ego, but I responded with Growth Spiral to play the 2nd Field so it was fine (I never seem to have the Veils when I want them). Granted, this was in Gold, but I look forward to trying to use this deck to grind as far up as I can til end of month.</p>
<p>Since I never got the chance to cast scapeshift, I&rsquo;d like to confirm that if I sacrifice exactly 7 lands and search for 7 uniques including field of the dead, I get 7 zombie triggers yes? (I assume if I have more than 7 and at least one of them is field, I shouldnt sac the field so that I get more triggers)</p>

<p>No one can answer this because no law, ordinance or executive order has been released detailing the rules. Basically its the whim of the authorities</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Decision trees like &ldquo;which starter pokemon do you pick&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t things that should be embedded into your code as if/else statements. These should be data that your code loads.</p>
<p>For this specific example, you could have a data file that has a list of all the available starter pokemon. How many are available to choose from? Your code will read these data files and present them as choices. The data files could include the dialog text and say, an ID string to indicate which pokemon would then be added into your party, something like this (JSON format, because it&rsquo;s easier for me:</p>
<p><code>starters: [</code></p>
<p><code>{ &quot;dialog&quot;: &quot;I choose Charmander!&quot;, &quot;pokemon_id&quot;: &quot;0001&quot;},</code></p>
<p><code>{ &quot;dialog&quot;: &quot;I want Bulbasaur!&quot;, &quot;pokemon_id&quot;: &quot;0002&quot;},</code></p>
<p><code>{ &quot;dialog&quot;: &quot;I want Pikachu!&quot;, &quot;pokemon_id&quot;: &quot;0003&quot;}</code></p>
<p><code>]</code></p>
<p>(I forgot who the 3rd starter was supposed to be, I&rsquo;m not big on Pokemon. Also I&rsquo;m guessing those aren&rsquo;t the actual pokedex IDs)</p>
<p>Each item on the list could also contain some other info. For example in dialogue trees, you might have NPCs react differently depending on what you say, so in that case each node would have an id pointing to the specific NPC response.</p>
<p>The idea is to separate the data from your code, since those are totally separate concerns. This is a general programming principle not specific to game development. In this way, you make it easier to modify your data (like decision trees) without necessarily having to rebuild your code. For example, you could change the dialog message for each pokemon starter choice, or maybe you could add more choices, or make the starter pokemon be Snorlax, MewTwo and Ekans for some reason (those are pokemon right? Lol). Bigger game studios will have separate tools to maintain those data files so that even nonprogrammers can help change those kinds of things in the game.</p>

<p>I went 5-2 running Bant Golos. My wins were vs Monoblack aggro, Monoblack vampires, two Golgari decks (one conceded after I Treachery&rsquo;d his 6/6 Questing Beast), and I forget what the other one was (definitely not monored or the mirror)</p>
<p>Losses were to mono-black aggro (I had the realm-cloaked giant for the wrath, but failed to notice I didnt have two white and played the wrong guildgate the turn before) and to the mirror (I got 2 field of the dead first, but he had kenrick and agent of treachery + teferi to take my fields =/)</p>

<p>Oh, that wasn&rsquo;t what I meant. I was on the iPad app when I made the last comment, for some reason the first character of some lines is missing there. See <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/XVpJ0Ge">https://imgur.com/gallery/XVpJ0Ge</a> for what I mean. Is fine on the reddit web page itself though so  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p>Hi! This demo is great! I&rsquo;m new to procreate so I&rsquo;m still learning the features.</p>
<p>I wonder if you could give me some advice. One thing I learned here is that there is a feature like when you draw in a circle then hold the pen in place for a bit, it will automatically &ldquo;smooth&rdquo; the circle. However, when I tried doing this, I can&rsquo;t get it to work consistently. The main problem is that I have unsteady hands, so when I hold the pen in place to do the smoothing, there is often still some slight movement so I guess this is why I can&rsquo;t trigger it consistently. Would you know if there is any workaround or alternative for someone like me?</p>

<p>Of course the suggestions from Wotc twitter (Bob, Bolt and Wurmcoil) are a bit ridiculous. I imagine that a lower power level would be needed. Historic needs to differentiate itself from Standard but not be as ridiculous as modern, and build up slowly but surely. I would like to see cards that had their time in Standard but haven&rsquo;t really found a good place in Modern. I don&rsquo;t agree with those saying it should be Origins-forward though, I think that&rsquo;s unnecessarily restrictive.</p>
<p>Some of my initial ideas (the first 10 are color balanced, but the rest are not):</p>
<p>Knight of the White Orchid</p>
<p>Keiga, the Tide Star</p>
<p>Korlash, Heir to Blackblade</p>
<p>Pia and Kiran Nalaar</p>
<p>Wren&rsquo;s Run Packmaster</p>
<p>Ojutai&rsquo;s Command</p>
<p>Shadowmage Infiltrator</p>
<p>Demigod of Revenge</p>
<p>Huntmaster of the Fells</p>
<p>Dauntless Escort</p>
<p>Siege Rhino</p>
<p>Cruel Ultimatum</p>

<p>I had a bunch of old coins from different countries and they were stored in a rusty metal container that was also exposed to water at some point. I checked it recently and many of the coins inside are covered in rust and grime and some of them are even stuck toģether. Any recommendations for cleaning them?

<div class="content e-content">

<p>i’m not a serious collector or anything; these are mostly just leftover coins from foreign trips. so i’m not looking so much to preserve value, more like in the future i’d like to be able to pull them out and go “ah these are from my trip to so-and-so country, etc” i hope that makes sense</p>

<p>This is all great, but one minor complaint: why is it <strong>Players Tour</strong> and not <strong>Player Tour</strong>? The first one sounds so weird. It&rsquo;s not like we used to have a <strong>Pros Tour</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy there&rsquo;s an oldschool Grixis Shadow list there because I haven&rsquo;t played Modern for a while and that&rsquo;s the last deck I had and I was looking at MC Barcelona and I didn&rsquo;t recognize the landscape at all and no more Grixis Shadows. IDK if I want to spend on the Knight-Captains right now to transition to Esper or Mardu. If I take my old Grixis Shadow list to a local modern tourney, how bad are the matchups with the current meta decks?</p>
