<p>Yeah, I was having a discussion about it with some friends just this week about how our prices and ISPs are generally terrible here compared to nearby countries such as HK and SG. Understandably, those guys are way ahead of us economically, so I guess the comms infrastructure comes into play when determining our broadband costs, but still the difference is like the gulf between the earth and the sun, it&rsquo;s really hard to find it justifiable.</p>

<p>Truths, if you want to get into game design learn computer science and get a solid paying job at some software firm. You&rsquo;ll have enough code knowledge and free time to code games yourself and be set in terms of money.</p>

<p>They are separate events, but triggered effects don&rsquo;t go on the stack until one of the players gains priority, and then they all go on the stack at the same time for each player. The sequence here goes something like:</p>
<p>Damage is dealt</p>
<p>State-based effects are checked, sending tokens and Obliterator to the GY (they &ldquo;die&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Active player gains priority, all pending effects that triggered from the previous effects go on the stack (active player&rsquo;s effects first, then opponent&rsquo;s)</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>You&rsquo;re the active player, your trigger (Obliterator) goes on the stack first. Then your opponent&rsquo;s triggers (spirits) go on the stack. If you both pass, they resolve top to bottom, spirits first, then Obliterator, so he can sac the spirits to the Obliterator trigger</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, lets just delay this a bit and make a really good game, packed to the brim with content that our fans want.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the correct threshold for this? How do they determine when they have &ldquo;enough&rdquo; characters or content? How do they know when it&rsquo;s already &ldquo;packed to the brim&rdquo;?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like video games can be &ldquo;full&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s always possible to keep adding stuff</p>

<p>This review actually made me hold off on buying it, as it makes out that only the story is the strong point while the gameplay is not as good. I mean, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d enjoy the story as it seems epic based on the demo, but I wouldn&rsquo;t plunk down full price for a game just for that.</p>

<p>Write your order on a small piece of paper and give it to her instead of saying it out loud. Below your order write something like &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go out with you sometime if that&rsquo;s ok. If you&rsquo;re cool with it, write your phone number on my cup. If not, it&rsquo;s ok, we&rsquo;ll pretend it never happened.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>It depends on which one has more value to you. The huntmaster is more prevalent in the current standard meta, but SCG has Sorin a bit more expensive than Huntmaster by around $5</p>

<p>Seriously though, how is this a question? What&rsquo;s the ratio of human population vs bear population anyway? I think it&rsquo;d have to be less than a hundred humans per bear to even be remotely close, because for sure a hundred humans could take a single bear.</p>
