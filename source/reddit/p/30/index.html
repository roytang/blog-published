<p>How is reading on the app compared to say, Comixology?</p>
<p>Looks like a sweet deal, but my problem is I&rsquo;m offline during 90% of the day (I dont have a data plan) and I heard they only allow 6 offline issues at once. I usually do my reading when I&rsquo;m out of the house (when waiting in line, etc) so I&rsquo;m kinda on the fence about subscribing.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>It&rsquo;s fine, just keep going through the levels until you get the hang of it. If you&rsquo;re missing 1/10 attacks it just means you&rsquo;re trying to attack an enemy whose SPD is too high for your hit. If some of your characters are consistently unable to hit, try giving them equipment that boosts their HIT.</p>
<p>Your lower level guys are going to have trouble hitting/damaging higher level guys, use them in combos with your higher level guys so that they can gain some EXP from kills. (Put them side-by-side or right behind the higher level guy who will do the attack and there&rsquo;s a chance for a combo)</p>

<p>I just bought a Vita (yay me!) so I could take advantage of my existing plus subscription. My brother tried it out and he seems interested to get one too, but he&rsquo;s asking me whether we would be able to use the same PSN account on two vitas (so that we both have access to the IGC)?</p>

<p>Mtgo doesnt have an open api - most bots do it through some sort of screen scraping approach. None of them are open either, since most bots are used for profit.</p>

<p>This was the obvious conclusion, and it&rsquo;s why I won&rsquo;t be buying a PS4 for some time. I&rsquo;m prepared (and willing) to just have the PS3 as my console for a couple more years. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re still going to get some good games later in the release cycle.</p>

<p>How to specify that it will alert me only when I get to the location? As far as I can tell the only options for reminders are &ldquo;Remind me on a day&rdquo;, &ldquo;Repeat&rdquo; and &ldquo;Priority&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>when I get home, remind me to do X</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>next time I&rsquo;m at this restaurant, remind me to order Y</p>

<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s a lot more assets that are needed given the amount of content typically packed into an RPG. That means a lot more story, characters, items, balancing, models, voices, videos, etc compared to something like an FPS, which translates to higher effort and thus higher costs. Is this a valid assumption? If yes, then why do companies keep making RPGs, are they more profitable than other genres? If no, what other factors go into the cost of other genres?</p>

<p>People enjoy different things.</p>
<p>That being said, try to challenge yourself every so often, maybe you&rsquo;ll learn new things or grow somehow.</p>

<p>Is there a way to disable those leader messages that I don&rsquo;t really have to respond to? Like when they denounce me, or &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve become friends with [country]&rdquo;? Also the CS popup when you first meet them. It&rsquo;s like those things can just be little notifications on the right side.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I consider myself ok in terms of strategy like spacing, pokes, mind games and the like, but my problem in general is poor execution; it&rsquo;s most probably because i dont want to put in the effort to memorize and practice combo strings and stuff. Like in sf4 i can pull of fadc&rsquo;s occasionally in training mode, but i dont have any hope of pulling it off in the middle of a heated match. For this reason i tend to rely more on short bnb combos</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be travelling for a bit, and I&rsquo;m looking for a PDF or something else (maybe a single web page that I can save) that I can read offline while I&rsquo;m travelling. I&rsquo;m looking for the sort of thing that I can read off the civfanatics forums, but I dont want to have to save each thread individually? Just thought I&rsquo;d post here on the off chance that someone one knows something like this somewhere.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
