<div class="content e-content">

<p>I think the mandate by which the president wins matters, which means abstention matters, since it informs the strength of the president&rsquo;s mandate.</p>
<p>One of the reasons PNoy was able to push through many of his initiatives early on during the presidency was that he was elected with a relatively strong 42% mandate. A president elected with a relatively weaker mandate (say, 25-30%) will have a much tougher time with controversial issues and will be facing a much more independent senate (many of whom will be elected by more voters than the president)</p>
<p>The strength of the mandate even affects those who don&rsquo;t win - Erap placed second in 2010 showing himself to still be a strong political force which leads to his still being influential today</p>
<p>The comparison to the US low voter turnout is interesting, since the voter turnout for their primaries this year is significantly higher compared to 2012 mainly because both parties have significant anti-establishment candidates (Sanders for the Dems, Trump for the Reps) which would lead one to believe that their historically low voter turnout is precisely due to a lack of good candidates, an opportunity which Sanders and Trump can potentially take advantage of. That is the same message that a significantly large abstention (although unlikely) could send - not saying it will, but it&rsquo;s a possibility.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying abstention is some magic thing that will send a message (although it&rsquo;s a possibility if enough people do so), but that people shouldn&rsquo;t be ashamed to abstain if they don&rsquo;t find the options palatable. Even if your reason is something as simple as &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t decide&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s fine, your abstention still has meaning since it indicates that you consider none of the candidates outstanding enough to support</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>If you feel that there is a candidate worthy of your support, go ahead and vote for him/her. I encourage you to do so. I&rsquo;m not saying people should abstain, I&rsquo;m saying people can. It&rsquo;s a valid choice and every voter has the right to withhold his vote if he so chooses. There&rsquo;s no need to downvote if you disagree</p>
<p>I understand that we would prefer high voter turnout so that the will of the people is more accurately reflected, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we should lower our standards and just vote anyone into power. If there were 5 Binays running for president, choosing one at random is the same as not voting.</p>
<p>Even choosing a &ldquo;least evil&rdquo; candidate is still a choice and can be spun into support. If you decide to vote for say, Mar Roxas because you consider him the least evil choice, if Mar Roxas wins with like 30% of the vote (unlikely at this point, but whatever), he&rsquo;s going to be able to point to that and say, &ldquo;this is my voter base, these people support me. If you are against me, you disenfranchise them&rdquo;. You will be tacitly endorsing his incompetence and saying you&rsquo;re fine with that, it&rsquo;s acceptable for you. (Not dissing on Roxas in particular, I can make an example of any of the other candidates). If that&rsquo;s not something you want to be part of, you shouldn&rsquo;t be forced to.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>I have a number of otherwise intelligent friends who often post things in favor of certain candidates that are obviously biased. And if you call them out on their bias they will just be all defensive and ask if you have a better idea, etc.</p>
<p>Like literally, one of my friends posted something along the lines of:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Candidate A - lists negative points; Candidate B - lists negative points; Candidate C - lists positive points. Easy decision right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not even pretending to be fair or anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s normal to be turned off by such things, especially for people who are truly undecided and trying to weigh pros and cons of the candidates. I try to stay informed and read everything even the biased ones post, but I tend to give more weight to those who I know to be undecided and are trying to be objective.</p>
<p>I have to agree that none of the presidential candidates look good enough (at the moment, at least), and I wouldn&rsquo;t object to abstaining the presidential slot. Abstaining is a vote too, in and of itself.</p>
<p>Edit: If you also find that none of the candidates meet your standards and are considering abstaining, you might want to read this: <a href="http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/abstain4president2016/">http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/abstain4president2016/</a></p>
<p>But at the very least consider voting for the other positions. There is (in my opinion) at least one worthy candidate in the VP slot, and your vote could help some of the more worthy senators get past the cringe-worthy ones in the bottom half (sadly, I think we&rsquo;re going to have to live with another term of Senator Sotto)</p>

<p>I uploaded a new version here: <a href="https://supermariomakerbookmark.nintendo.net/courses/2585-0000-01F7-0982">https://supermariomakerbookmark.nintendo.net/courses/2585-0000-01F7-0982</a> if you still want to try it out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried your level, it&rsquo;s fun and seems to be just the right amount of difficulty, although I had a bit more retries at the last room than I was happy with haha. Cleared and starred!</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I sorted all my commons/uncommons a while back, somewhere between 20-25k cards all in all (a good number from pre-Modern sets). Booster boxes can hold like 2-3 letters at a time, i.e. one booster box is enough for all As, Bs and half of Cs. All the Ss needed more than two booster boxes =/</p>
<p>Also, I probably need better storage than booster boxes</p>

<p>The country&rsquo;s name in the local language is &ldquo;Pilipinas&rdquo;. The citizens are &ldquo;Pilipinos&rdquo;</p>
<p>The national language is called &ldquo;Filipino&rdquo; (in English) and &ldquo;Pilipino&rdquo; (in Filipino).</p>
<p>It used to be that the official Filipino alphabet did not include the letter F. This is no longer the case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipino_alphabet">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipino_alphabet</a></p>
<p>Also, in English, the correct adjective to use is &ldquo;Philippine&rdquo;, i.e. the Philippine population.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>They don&rsquo;t feel out of vogue. Off the top of my head, turn-based games I played within the last year: Persona Q, Disgaea 4, Divinity:OS. Bravely Default, Fire Emblem: Awakening, X-Com, Civ 5 (okay, I play Civ every year). I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s more I&rsquo;m forgetting.</p>
<p>Edit: I also played Banner Saga and Shadowrun Returns Dragonfall, thanks to the replies for reminding me</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t need further convincing on his platforms. Most are ok, some might not scale or be practical on a nationwide level but are worth a try.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not going to vote for him unless he categorically states he has never been involved in nor does he condone any illegal killings and will bring such perpetrators/vigilantes to justice</p>

<p>I have both Smash for WiiU and 3ds but I find it difficult to get into it (even though I like the characters and stages and stuff) because It&rsquo;s so different from the fighting games I usually play. I&rsquo;m not a competitive Street Fighter player or anything (poor on execution) but I do enjoy playing that style of game. It&rsquo;s not that I want to get competitive with Smash, but I&rsquo;d like a fairly decent chance when I play online</p>
<p>One thing that gets me a lot is that there&rsquo;s a difference in input when I slightly tilt the stick or flick it quickly, In the heat of battle I never seem to get the right one to come out</p>
<p>Another thing is that it&rsquo;s easy for me to get confused when there&rsquo;s so much stuff happening on the screen - it&rsquo;s hard to keep track of everything. I did manage to win an 8-man smash once, but that was with friends who don&rsquo;t really game that often :)</p>
<p>Any tips?</p>

Or anyone here from Cebu Pacific?</a></h4>
<p>I have an international Cebu Pacific flight out of NAIA early morning on Nov 20 (4:50am). I&rsquo;m from QC and plan to leave for the airport around 12mn-1am. I&rsquo;ve just done the web check-in. My flight is <em>not</em> on Cebu Pacific&rsquo;s list of cancelled flights found here: <a href="https://www.cebupacificair.com/Pages/travel-advisory.aspx?id=110">https://www.cebupacificair.com/Pages/travel-advisory.aspx?id=110</a></p>
<p>Does anybody know:</p>
<ul>
<li>if there&rsquo;s any chance that my flight could still be affected despite not being on the list above? There&rsquo;s supposedly a no-fly zone, but I couldn&rsquo;t find any information on whether that&rsquo;s applicable 24 hours or what.</li>
<li>if I&rsquo;ll even be able to make it to the airport? There&rsquo;s some road closures on Airport Road I think? I&rsquo;m not sure how my taxi would be able to get into NAIA T3.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried calling the Cebu Pacific hotline to ask, but it seems their call center is always busy and I just end up spending a lot of time on hold. If anyone else here is successfully able to fly out of NAIA during the APEC days, that would help assuage my worry :p</p>

<p>Trying to decide between splurging on a GTX970 or just settling for a GTX750Ti for now and possibly upgrading in the future. I&rsquo;m not one of those guys who plans to play at really high resolutions or need to have ultra settings all the time, so I&rsquo;m not sure if the high end one will be worth it. Thoughts?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Because I can afford to pay other people to do it? I&rsquo;ve already assembled enough desktops when I was young and had a lot of free time. It&rsquo;s an easy waste of half a manday, maybe more if you make mistakes. If you have it assembled right there in the shop they&rsquo;ll spot any problems right away and you can replace any problematic parts immediately</p>

<p>I have been playing Shadownrun Dragonfall DC on a laptop I borrowed, with Steam cloud synchronization enabled. But now I have to give back the laptop and haven&rsquo;t finished it yet. If I uninstall Steam from this laptop (and all the games of course) then go back to my desktop which doesn&rsquo;t have have Shadowrun Dragonfall DC installed yet and install it there, will it get the saves I had from the laptop?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been travelling for a few months and have been playing Civ V on my laptop where I already sunk 300+hours into my desktop back home. Will any mines I built/forests I chopped/etc count towards my totals back home?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
