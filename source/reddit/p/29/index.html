<p>Thanks! I was able to add back the old sidebar, but it seems I still can&rsquo;t drag epubs directly to the ipad, though I can add them to the itunes library.</p>

<p>How is this done in the new itunes? In the old one I just drag epubs to the iPad on the left side panel. In the new itunes I tried going to the Books tab of the iPad but it seems I can&rsquo;t drag anything into there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna do syncing or anything, I want to be able to copy/remove books individually as needed.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really only looking forward to this so that the series can finally end. I&rsquo;ve been reading this series for almost two decades, stuck through it when it was draggy just for the heck of it. I can barely remember any of the things that happened in the middle books. If I had time I&rsquo;d reread them all again before the last book comes out but meh, what can you do. There better be a damn good ending!</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Sid Meier once said that a game is a &ldquo;series of interesting decisions&rdquo;. When your decisions have no consequence, the decisions become less interesting and meaningful. If your decisions don&rsquo;t have consequences, why bother having the decisions at all? Why not just give the player everything all at once, since that&rsquo;s what it essentially comes down to when you can respec at will?</p>
<p>I remember when I was playing Kingdom of Amalur, you could respec at any time for a small gold cost. The gold cost increases gradually every time, but it never becomes a very high value such that respeccing was practically free. That means there was no point investing in the Crafting skills since at any point you could decide &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do all my crafting now&rdquo;, respec to the best crafting build, craft your stuff, then respec back to what you normally have.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>It&rsquo;s a problem of balance. If the RPG isn&rsquo;t well-balanced, it may punish the player for decisions made early on (i.e. he chose an ability that didn&rsquo;t turn out to be as useful as he expected), and having no respec option at all locks him into that choice. I agree that there needs to be some level of consequence to your choices and we can&rsquo;t expect the game to be balanced 100% with regards to character choices, but the problem is that for a new player playing a new game, he will almost invariably be unable to judge correctly whether certain choices are good or bad.</p>
<p>So my answer is: I&rsquo;d prefer not having respec options, but I understand the need for them. Maybe not have respeccing be so easy or something would be a good idea (i.e. need to complete some quest that gets harder every time you want to respec)</p>

<p>Seriously, there&rsquo;s always people around who blame their losses on the shuffler or to mana screw. It&rsquo;s like deck building and mulliganing decisions aren&rsquo;t relevant. A lot of people don&rsquo;t understand randomness either - people complain about not having mana screw runs in real life compared to mtgo are often unaware of their own negative bias and most probably are not sufficiently randomizing their decks in real life.</p>
<p>Earlier, there was this guy complaining to me about mana screw and I was like &ldquo;dude I have 3 lands to your 6&rdquo;. And he replied that at least I was casting my spells. Well maybe I had a smaller curve and only two colors (he had 4 colors of land out by the time the game ended) and I kept my hand even with 2 lands because it already had 3 two-drops. When your opening hand is 2 forests, a green card and 3 white cards and you think to yourself &ldquo;Surely I&rsquo;ll draw a plains!&rdquo; then you don&rsquo;t draw one for seven turns, that&rsquo;s not really mana screw, that was a bad keep.</p>
<p>Sigh, sorry about the rant. I just hate it when people complain so much about the same things. (Yet they still keep coming back to play magic)</p>

<p>iTunes will only accept certain video formats. For example, I think mp4s are fine but mkvs aren&rsquo;t. Not sure if it filters based on the container or the encoding.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a different experience, especially in terms of warfare since you can stack multiple units on a tile. In Civ4 you basically create one superstack then throw it at everything.</p>

<p>Some info:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The giveaway games are all minis: Velocity, Breakquest, Canabalt, Wizorb</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The codes will only work on the Europe store (you can just create a EU account if you really want them)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 of my codes worked fine; but for Canabalt, the store said the code was already used =/</p>

<p>Nah, I feel that way too. This year&rsquo;s sale isn&rsquo;t too exciting really. Or maybe it&rsquo;s just that there aren&rsquo;t many games I&rsquo;d want to buy anymore.</p>
<p>I miss those great achievement hunts they used to have.</p>

<p>Is there something that makes this easy? Like say I&rsquo;m browsing something on my PC and I see an image that could be a good ipad wallpaper so I want to send it to my ipad somehow. Or maybe I see something on my ipad and think &ldquo;I want to view this on my desktop&rdquo; so I want to send the link there. I don&rsquo;t want to have to do something like send it out via an email, I&rsquo;m hoping /r/ipad has some sort of mindblowing magic for me.</p>
<p>Edit: probably should have mentioned i dont use a mac</p>

<p>Sorry, it&rsquo;s just not as good as you think it is. The bar is set pretty high in order for creatures to be playable in constructed. They either have to have really, really good stats (power, toughness, combat abilities) for their casting cost or be able to generate card advantage (not just 1-for-1)</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>The stories in the books always take place at the time they were written. Older stories adjust to the timeline of the book you&rsquo;re reading as needed.</p>
<p>When the original x-men were introduced, their story took place in the 60s and that&rsquo;s still true if you&rsquo;re reading uncanny x-men v1 #1.</p>
<p>But when you read all new xmen #1 which takes place in 2012, the story of the original xmen happened 15-20 years ago. This means that their story doesnt have exactly the same setting as it did in uxm#1, although the details remain more or less the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit weird. Best not to take comic book timelines too seriously lol.</p>
