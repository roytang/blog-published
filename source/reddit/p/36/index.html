<p>To be fair, I did not get either ME1 or ME2 for full price either. Too bad ME3 is not likely to go on a Steam-level sale!</p>

<p>This review actually made me hold off on buying it, as it makes out that only the story is the strong point while the gameplay is not as good. I mean, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d enjoy the story as it seems epic based on the demo, but I wouldn&rsquo;t plunk down full price for a game just for that.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Write your order on a small piece of paper and give it to her instead of saying it out loud. Below your order write something like &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go out with you sometime if that&rsquo;s ok. If you&rsquo;re cool with it, write your phone number on my cup. If not, it&rsquo;s ok, we&rsquo;ll pretend it never happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seriously though, how is this a question? What&rsquo;s the ratio of human population vs bear population anyway? I think it&rsquo;d have to be less than a hundred humans per bear to even be remotely close, because for sure a hundred humans could take a single bear.</p>

<p>I wonder why they don&rsquo;t include the Square characters anymore (like Squall, Cloud, etc who appeared in the original KH) Probably some licensing issue I guess</p>

<p>As much as I support this post, I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s not really going to do much to change the minds of those who feel really entitled to it. They are too blinded by nerdrage to understand what this chart means, I say just let them rant it all out and ignore the multiple threads about it, until ME3&rsquo;s release date when the rage subsides as they enjoy the game.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>They need to deliver the game to the console guys (Microsoft/Sony) for certification months before the release date (I believe for ME3 it was submitted for certification in January). So your suggestion is that even if they have a chance to work on additional content earlier, they should NOT do that at all? Like, just have those guys work on the old republic or something?</p>

<p>Strictly out of curiosity, for what value of N would &ldquo;DLC released N days after the launch day&rdquo; be okay for you, but &ldquo;DLC release N-1 days after launch day&rdquo; not be okay?</p>

<p>I like how your criteria for &ldquo;Good DLC&rdquo; doesnt include whether it was a day one release or not. And if you&rsquo;re saying &ldquo;day one&rdquo; means it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;new&rdquo;, would day two be better?</p>

<p>I like how the statue is part of the game&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that time I bought FF7 and later there were action figures of cloud and sephiroth being sold in the store, but they should give those to me for free because they&rsquo;re part of the game content! Oh, and I should also get a copy of Advent Children for free!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s expensive to implement a payment system processing credit card payments. There&rsquo;s security certifications you need to go through before the CC companies will agree to process payments coming from your website, the cost is in the tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Sorry, I don&rsquo;t know what to tell you but that&rsquo;s how this game is played on the competitive level. When the world/internet has already built the top tier of decks, the option exists to simply tweak one of those decks for your meta and rely on your play skill to see you through. You can go against the tide and build your own deck, but you better be damn well prepared for the top tier decks regardless. Budget isn&rsquo;t really an excuse.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always casual play with friends where you can agree not to play netdecks.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve tried both the PS3 and the PC demos. The PC version looks better, but the control scheme seems clunky for the keyboard/mouse (the loot dialog doesn&rsquo;t even seem to have any keyboard shortcuts) and better for the controller. I&rsquo;m also not too thrilled that the PC version required me to login to my EA account. Any feedback on the full version, is it ok, better than the demo?</p>
<p>Anything else I need to consider in weighing PC vs PS3? Do we expect mod support? Also, if I buy the retail version (off the shelf copies are a lot cheaper than digital downloads where I am), will it be for Steam or Origin or Neither?</p>
