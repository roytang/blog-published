</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>It&rsquo;s actually the opposite for me, i play more video games than magic as i&rsquo;ve gotten older. Mostly because most of my play group has moved away so i dont enjoy tournaments as much. I dont really play magic for the social interaction, i can get that elsewhere, and video games are way less expensive as a hobby :p</p>

<p>Stay out of the scary places for now. Try fighting aboveground things first&hellip; fiends or or radscorpions and such, so you get used to paying attention to looking at your radar (lower left corner) to be aware of nearby enemies. Also you might want to increase your perception stat so that enemies show on the radar earlier.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Upvotes for this. I posted the following message:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are multitouch gestures not enabled in iOS5 for iPad1? I&rsquo;ve been using them for months in developer mode without any problems so I&rsquo;m sure the hardware can handle it. Please patch it back in, this makes me want to jailbreak&rdquo;</p>
<p>No idea if it will work, but maybe if enough of us do it they&rsquo;ll take notice :D</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using multitouch gestures on the iPad1 for months and it didn&rsquo;t feel laggy at all to me. Far from completely pointless, I loved the feature</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I had the multitouch gestures before the update (i have developer mode) so it is quite ridiculous how ios5 disabled it for ipad1s since ive never had a problem with the feature. Either apple hates us ipad1 owners or they want to force us to upgrade. Having multitouch gestures really made the ipad a lot more usable, i will miss it greatly (and no i dont want to jailbreak~)</p>

<p>From the first issue it looks like Tim Drake and company will be establishing the Titans, does mean the previous incarnations of the team never existed in the DCNU? Cyborg heading straight to the JL seems to support this, but Red Hood and the Outlaws #1 is telling us Dick has been with Starfire before, though they can always retcon that to a non-Titans interaction</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>I havent played civ5 in a while and I thought I&rsquo;d give the latest patch a go. I find that every so often the game hangs between turns - it&rsquo;s stuck with &ldquo;Please wait&rdquo; and the mouseover message says it is waiting for other human players (it&rsquo;s a singleplayer game obviously). It&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s just taking too long to complete, it seems to be stuck in some sort of infinite loop. I left it running for 10-15 minutes at one point with no luck.</p>
<p>When i get to this state I need to load a few turns back and change a few decisions. If I just do the same things, the game will hang again.</p>
<p>Anyone encountering this? Not sure if it&rsquo;s a problem with my particular save, gonna try to start another game.</p>

<p>Like a character editor or mod or whatever. I just became a Spectre (I guess not really the middle, more like a couple of hours in), but then I noticed something annoying on my FemShep&rsquo;s eyebrow texture and I want to change it. I just know I&rsquo;m going to notice it all the time now.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Nope, you assign blockers all at the same time, with no room for playing spells or abilities in between.</p>
<p>For MTM, at the beginning of your upkeep the &ldquo;discard or sacrifice&rdquo; trigger will go on the stack. At that point you can respond to the triggered ability by playing the other abilities, and they will resolve before the triggered ability.</p>
<p>(Note that this is your first chance to play spells or abilities during your turn, there is no &ldquo;after untap but before upkeep&rdquo;)</p>
