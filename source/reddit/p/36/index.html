<div class="content e-content">

<p>It depends on which one has more value to you. The huntmaster is more prevalent in the current standard meta, but SCG has Sorin a bit more expensive than Huntmaster by around $5</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Seriously though, how is this a question? What&rsquo;s the ratio of human population vs bear population anyway? I think it&rsquo;d have to be less than a hundred humans per bear to even be remotely close, because for sure a hundred humans could take a single bear.</p>

<p>As much as I support this post, I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s not really going to do much to change the minds of those who feel really entitled to it. They are too blinded by nerdrage to understand what this chart means, I say just let them rant it all out and ignore the multiple threads about it, until ME3&rsquo;s release date when the rage subsides as they enjoy the game.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>They need to deliver the game to the console guys (Microsoft/Sony) for certification months before the release date (I believe for ME3 it was submitted for certification in January). So your suggestion is that even if they have a chance to work on additional content earlier, they should NOT do that at all? Like, just have those guys work on the old republic or something?</p>

<p>In my opinion any plot related dlc available on launch day should be free.</p>

<p>Strictly out of curiosity, for what value of N would &ldquo;DLC released N days after the launch day&rdquo; be okay for you, but &ldquo;DLC release N-1 days after launch day&rdquo; not be okay?</p>

<p>Good DLC adds something new to the game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like how your criteria for &ldquo;Good DLC&rdquo; doesnt include whether it was a day one release or not. And if you&rsquo;re saying &ldquo;day one&rdquo; means it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;new&rdquo;, would day two be better?</p>

<p>I like how the statue is part of the game&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that time I bought FF7 and later there were action figures of cloud and sephiroth being sold in the store, but they should give those to me for free because they&rsquo;re part of the game content! Oh, and I should also get a copy of Advent Children for free!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s expensive to implement a payment system processing credit card payments. There&rsquo;s security certifications you need to go through before the CC companies will agree to process payments coming from your website, the cost is in the tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Sorry, I don&rsquo;t know what to tell you but that&rsquo;s how this game is played on the competitive level. When the world/internet has already built the top tier of decks, the option exists to simply tweak one of those decks for your meta and rely on your play skill to see you through. You can go against the tide and build your own deck, but you better be damn well prepared for the top tier decks regardless. Budget isn&rsquo;t really an excuse.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always casual play with friends where you can agree not to play netdecks.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve tried both the PS3 and the PC demos. The PC version looks better, but the control scheme seems clunky for the keyboard/mouse (the loot dialog doesn&rsquo;t even seem to have any keyboard shortcuts) and better for the controller. I&rsquo;m also not too thrilled that the PC version required me to login to my EA account. Any feedback on the full version, is it ok, better than the demo?</p>
<p>Anything else I need to consider in weighing PC vs PS3? Do we expect mod support? Also, if I buy the retail version (off the shelf copies are a lot cheaper than digital downloads where I am), will it be for Steam or Origin or Neither?</p>

<p>I hope this isn&rsquo;t true, that would be terrible. I love that there&rsquo;s a different Spider-Man in the Ultimate Universe, with his own set of problems and issues. I&rsquo;d understand them wanting to bring Peter back someday, but Miles needs more time in the sun!</p>

<p>Are you suggesting that r/gaming should be filled with posts begging for stuff? You&rsquo;re not the only poor gamer you know.</p>
<p>r/gaming is not averse to giveaways, but the supply of people who can giveaway stuff is a lot less than the people who want stuff, so it&rsquo;s more acceptable to post a thread giving away stuff than begging for stuff</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I think the year in parenthesis is the year the series started. It makes sense for most of them, but not for Amazing Spider-Man. Pretty sure it didn&rsquo;t start in 1999. Shrug.</p>
<p>For series to jump into, do you want to follow an ongoing series? If yes, the recent ones that I like: Daredevil (&lt; 10 issues), Uncanny X-Men (they rebooted last year, only 5 issues so far), Uncanny X-Force (this is around 20 issues in), Wolverine and the X-Men (5 issues), Defenders (only 2 issues in! I like the art). The X-books might be a bit harder to pick up if you&rsquo;re not familiar with the characters as they reference a lot of previous storylines.</p>
<p>You might be interested in the Ultimate line, it&rsquo;s basically a separate universe they started around 10 years ago that has less back story for a new reader to follow. They have some ongoing series currently, namely Ultimate Comics Spider-Man (6 issues in, this Spider-Man is not Peter Parker), Ultimate Comics X-Men (6 issues) and Ultimate Comics The Ultimates (6 issues). If you want to go back farther, I suggest picking up trades of Ultimate Spider-Man (this was the first Ultimate book, and it ended last year) and Ultimate X-Men.</p>
<p>If you want some Avengers, they have several series ongoing. Avengers, New Avengers and Secret Avengers are all okay, and they&rsquo;re all in the 20+ issue range. I like New Avengers best among the three, I need to catch up on Secret Avengers</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>The book is great, except I find the pacing horribly slow. I understand  they&rsquo;re taking it slow deliberately because they&rsquo;re targetting new readers who may or may not be familiar with the rest of the league, but I feel like with a bit tighter pacing they could have gotten the current 5-issue plot in 3 issues or so.</p>
<p>Maybe I just got spoiled by Morrison&rsquo;s JLA run. By issue 5, Morrison was already on the second story arc!</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Most Filipinos already speak English, I don&rsquo;t think there will be a big enough market (there are too many people here who can teach English). Although there are also a lot of Koreans who come here to learn English, so I dunno. Shrug. Your best bet might be English accent training for call centers (locals can&rsquo;t compete with a native American English speaker in this field) OR teaching at international schools (they may prefer expats)</p>
<p>Haha sorry for not being very helpful.</p>

Also, can anyone recommend alternatives?</a></h4>
<p>In my previous thread <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/mv9ji/can_someone_recommend_a_comic_book_reader_cbrcbz/">http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/mv9ji/can_someone_recommend_a_comic_book_reader_cbrcbz/</a> practically everyone recommended comiczeal, but it doesn&rsquo;t have the easy collection management features I was looking for. Specifically, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a way to upload multiple folders&rsquo; worth of comics at a time (both the sync app and itunes file sharing only accept files, not folders), and no easy way to delete lots of comics at a time (still need to select them individually or something)</p>
<p>Is there a way to ask Apple for a refund because I&rsquo;m not satisfied with the app?</p>
<p>Also, can someone recommend any alternatives?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>No offense, but you were probably applying for the wrong companies (obvious if you consider they have some sort of padrino system), either that or you were aiming for jobs you werent qualified for. Not only have i found my current job without any sort of connections, i do not personally know anyone who needed connections to land their job. I&rsquo;ve also interviewed dozens of applicants for entry level positions, everytime i had to fail an applicant it was because he didnt have the talent we needed, connections never came into play.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Disclaimer: I&rsquo;m really bad at explaining things to kids! Especially since this involves probability.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s late in the game and you already have 8 swamps in play. You don&rsquo;t want to draw any more lands, you just want creature to attack with or spells to kill stuff with. If you had 24 swamps in your deck, there&rsquo;d be 16 more lands you can draw after playing 8 swamps! If you had only 32 cards left in your deck, half of those would be lands!</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say instead of 24 swamps, you had 4 marsh flats and 20 swamps instead. And instead of having 8 swamps in play, you have 6 swamps and 2 marsh flats. Everything else is the same (32 cards left in the deck) If you use the two marsh flats to remove 2 swamps from your deck and put them into play, you now have only 30 cards left in your deck. More importantly, now only 14 of them are lands! (12 swamps and 2 marsh flats). So now your odds of drawing odds are slightly less than 50% - 14/30!</p>
<p>It all boils down to improving probabilities and thinning your deck, making it a bit easier to draw useful cards later on.</p>

<p>How high does he think online piracy should rank in terms of America (and the world&rsquo;s) priorities? Aren&rsquo;t there a multitude of more pressing problems regarding poverty, education, unemployment, healthcare that the governments should focus on?</p>
<p>How does he compare the &ldquo;no due process&rdquo; provisions of SOPA (allowing websites to be shut down without need for evidence or hearing) to the constitutional guarantee of &ldquo;innocent until proven guilty&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Is the MPAA even considering developing alternative business models that work with the internet instead of trying to destroy it?</p>
