<p>Noob question: How are these tournaments held, given the client doesn&rsquo;t have tournament support? They just challenge each other to matches? Can people spectate?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I did a prerelease at the Hareruya in Tokyo (because it happened to coincide with a trip with friends), it was cool. I think they&rsquo;re pretty used to foreigners coming in, they had English-language prerelease packs for us. And everyone could communicate to some degree. I was mostly able to cope despite not being 100% familiar with the cards. My one problem was when someone played a creature with an ability that I wasn&rsquo;t sure what it was and the guy had to say it a few times. I kept hearing &ldquo;mens&rdquo; but eventually figured out it was &ldquo;menace&rdquo; lol.</p>
<p>(This anecdote isn&rsquo;t really relevant to constructed I guess lol sorry)</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>How about some kind of different minimum wage brackets depending on how many employees you have (this would include subcontracting etc). Like for 1-10 employees, minimum wage is X, for 11-50 employees minimum wage is X + 100, 51-200, minimum wage is X + 200, and so on.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>A couple of questions about the legacy finals (sorry, I only caught a portion of it and not really a legacy player): there&rsquo;s a monarch effect in play, where did that come from? I skimmed the decklists and couldnt find it. Also speaking of decklists, there&rsquo;s a Throne of Geth in Josh Utter-Leyton&rsquo;s SB, what&rsquo;s that for?</p>
<p>Edit: Oops, sorry. Checked the decklists again, saw that Palace Jailer gives monarch. Only thing I&rsquo;m confused about now is Throne of Geth!</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>I have yet to see a compelling and detailed economic analysis as to how it will benefit each region (as in, I&rsquo;d like to see a breakdown of the expected economic benefit to each region)</p>
<p>As for cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>between fascist tendencies, highly divisive political tactis, and at best a loose relationship with the truth, such a large change cannot be entrusted to this administration</li>
<li>federalism creates a 2-tier taxation system (state and federal), possibly leading to more taxes</li>
<li>empowers political dynasties</li>
<li>costly transition without clear cost/benefit analysis</li>
<li>our societal problems are largely cultural in nature, changing the system of government will do little to address that</li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, I could see why some people might like it, and I am not against changing the charter per se (I agree that there are some problematic things with the 1987 constitution)</p>

<p>How do you feel about adding Divest to the SB to help against RB? i.e. make sure they dont have whirler before committing to the board? Or pick the soul scar out of their hand before they can combo it with a whirler?</p>
<p>Also thinking about shapers&rsquo; sanctuary, to help against all their spot.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Putting your picture on your resume when your appearance shouldnt have any effect on the job you&rsquo;re applying for is a silly thing Pinoys do that should end. It contributes to a culture of shallowness where people judge you based on your appearance.</p>
<p>Aside from it being better for society, you would probably not want to work at the sort of places that expect your resume to have a picture.</p>
<p>That being said, if you have any sort of facebook presence, you can be sure you&rsquo;re gonna get online-stalked before any intervieew.</p>
