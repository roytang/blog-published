<p>Seems we got the preview pretty early this month? I usually expect it on the last week before we get the first free game.</p>
<p>This month is okay (yay, Skullgirls!), but I wonder what&rsquo;s the chance of getting Metal Gear HD Collection or UMvC3 on the PSVita for PSPlus?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t too impressed with the final issue. Some nice sequences overall, but a number of parts seemed rushed, like how Peter explains things so quickly to Carlie, Miguel, the Avengers even. And the Goblin recognizing it was Peter after one line of banter?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed in how Norman got away. Spider-man gets stunned for one panel and suddenly he&rsquo;s gone and neither Peter nor Miguel bother to look for him? Obviously they ran out of space to wrap that up neatly, but jeez</p>
<p>I just felt it needed a bit more oomph as a series finale I guess. I suppose they&rsquo;ll be covering the repercussions of Otto&rsquo;s run in the months to come though</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;ve been in situations where I knew a friend was about to do something stupid that could ruin her life, but there was nothing I could do to stop it or dissuade her, all I could do was stand by and bear witness to the inevitable (metaphorical) train wreck that she would have to climb out of. It&rsquo;s terrible because you give advice and you feel like you&rsquo;re not listened to when you&rsquo;re only looking out for them and you&rsquo;re being completely sensible.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just have to let people make their own mistakes.</p>

<p>Just finished reading the Man Out of Time and Winter Soldier story arcs of Brubaker&rsquo;s Captain America run.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t really keeping up with comics back then, how did fans react to Brubaker bringing back Bucky? Did people know ahead of time he was coming back, was it hinted at, or was it a big surprise?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>There are small moments that each person lives for - the smile on a little kid&rsquo;s face, the joy of seeing your crush when you come in to the office in the morning, the satisfaction of a job well done, the thrill of beating unfair odds, the warm feeling of being able to help someone, etc. It varies person by person but these small moments of joy and happiness, no matter how rarely they come to us make all the stress, worries, problems, fears and insecurities of the in-between moments worth slogging through.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m told that when I was a little kid I had the ability to quickly determine what day of the week any given date was, and the grownups couldn&rsquo;t figure out how I did it. I don&rsquo;t remember this at all - I probably just did some quick maths in my head or something. Now that I think about it, I guess it&rsquo;s not <em>too</em> useless.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Set some high-energy song as your alarm. I use &ldquo;The Final Countdown&rdquo;</p>
<p>Use multiple alarms, spaced 20-35 minutes apart. Try setting the first alarm to be around 1-1.5 hours before you need to wake up. Adjust the number of alarms and the spacing and the initial time until you find a mix that works for you. You can use different tunes/songs for each alarm.</p>
<p>At one point I had something like 10-12 alarms, two of them were Final Countdown, five of them were some rooster crowing, and the others were alarm clock sounds. The earliest alarm came at around 5 AM while the last one fired at 8:10 AM (which at that time was the absolute latest time I could wake up without risking being late for work)</p>

<p>Considering getting a PS4 because of all the very nice Infamous:SS screen shots going around, but is the game more than just a pretty face?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bit bothered by the Kill Screen review: <a href="http://killscreendaily.com/articles/reviews/infamous-second-son-shows-what-ps4-capable-and-nothing-more/">http://killscreendaily.com/articles/reviews/infamous-second-son-shows-what-ps4-capable-and-nothing-more/</a></p>
<p>I finished Infamous 1 but not Infamous 2 coz I kind of got bored with it being more of the same. Would I get bored with SS after admiring the pretty graphics for a while?</p>

<p>When they come out with lists like these, these are just the announced ones right? We can still expect more exclusives announced during E3?</p>
<p>I like that there&rsquo;s a lot of titles scheduled for this year, but I feel like they need more big exclusive titles to better differentiate from the competition among the AAA crowd of gamers</p>

<p>How is it compared to Infamous 1/2? I finished 1, but couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to finish 2, and platinumed neither. Some of the collecting crap (blast shards, etc) got a bit boring at times</p>
