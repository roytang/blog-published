<div class="content e-content">

<p>I consider myself ok in terms of strategy like spacing, pokes, mind games and the like, but my problem in general is poor execution; it&rsquo;s most probably because i dont want to put in the effort to memorize and practice combo strings and stuff. Like in sf4 i can pull of fadc&rsquo;s occasionally in training mode, but i dont have any hope of pulling it off in the middle of a heated match. For this reason i tend to rely more on short bnb combos</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be travelling for a bit, and I&rsquo;m looking for a PDF or something else (maybe a single web page that I can save) that I can read offline while I&rsquo;m travelling. I&rsquo;m looking for the sort of thing that I can read off the civfanatics forums, but I dont want to have to save each thread individually? Just thought I&rsquo;d post here on the off chance that someone one knows something like this somewhere.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d just delete the extra workers and keep maybe 2-3 that I can sleep somewhere safe. (Depends on your number of cities). You&rsquo;re going to need them again later as tech progresses (new resources become available, or railroads)</p>

<p>it wasn&rsquo;t long ago that I was putting roads/railroads on every tile possible rather than just linking cities</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember doing this back in Civ1, because roads/rails gave tiles a trade bonus and there was no maintenance penalty for having too many roads. At that time too, rails cost ZERO movement points, which meant railing my entire continent = units instantly move from one end to the other at will. Good times lol</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using BayanDSL. The speed isn&rsquo;t the best, but it&rsquo;s ok most of the time. My brothers are basically playing DOTA2 every night, though they do experience some lag. Customer service is better than PLDT&rsquo;s at least. If I call their trunk line to complain about connection problems they&rsquo;re going to send someone to check the next day. (When they say someone&rsquo;s going to come the next day, it&rsquo;s true)</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>The headline is ridiculous, since scrapping the PCGG is not the same as giving up on the Marcos loot, it just means that we won&rsquo;t have a dedicated agency for that one task, and their tasks will devolve to the DoJ.</p>

<p>Thanks! I was able to add back the old sidebar, but it seems I still can&rsquo;t drag epubs directly to the ipad, though I can add them to the itunes library.</p>

<p>How is this done in the new itunes? In the old one I just drag epubs to the iPad on the left side panel. In the new itunes I tried going to the Books tab of the iPad but it seems I can&rsquo;t drag anything into there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna do syncing or anything, I want to be able to copy/remove books individually as needed.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really only looking forward to this so that the series can finally end. I&rsquo;ve been reading this series for almost two decades, stuck through it when it was draggy just for the heck of it. I can barely remember any of the things that happened in the middle books. If I had time I&rsquo;d reread them all again before the last book comes out but meh, what can you do. There better be a damn good ending!</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/15rvcf/where_do_people_stand_on_respeccing_in_rpgsarpgs/c7poxhz/">a comment by grumbel on &#39;Where do people stand on respeccing in RPGs/aRPGs?&#39; on /r/truegaming</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Sid Meier once said that a game is a &ldquo;series of interesting decisions&rdquo;. When your decisions have no consequence, the decisions become less interesting and meaningful. If your decisions don&rsquo;t have consequences, why bother having the decisions at all? Why not just give the player everything all at once, since that&rsquo;s what it essentially comes down to when you can respec at will?</p>
<p>I remember when I was playing Kingdom of Amalur, you could respec at any time for a small gold cost. The gold cost increases gradually every time, but it never becomes a very high value such that respeccing was practically free. That means there was no point investing in the Crafting skills since at any point you could decide &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do all my crafting now&rdquo;, respec to the best crafting build, craft your stuff, then respec back to what you normally have.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>It&rsquo;s a problem of balance. If the RPG isn&rsquo;t well-balanced, it may punish the player for decisions made early on (i.e. he chose an ability that didn&rsquo;t turn out to be as useful as he expected), and having no respec option at all locks him into that choice. I agree that there needs to be some level of consequence to your choices and we can&rsquo;t expect the game to be balanced 100% with regards to character choices, but the problem is that for a new player playing a new game, he will almost invariably be unable to judge correctly whether certain choices are good or bad.</p>
<p>So my answer is: I&rsquo;d prefer not having respec options, but I understand the need for them. Maybe not have respeccing be so easy or something would be a good idea (i.e. need to complete some quest that gets harder every time you want to respec)</p>

<p>Seriously, there&rsquo;s always people around who blame their losses on the shuffler or to mana screw. It&rsquo;s like deck building and mulliganing decisions aren&rsquo;t relevant. A lot of people don&rsquo;t understand randomness either - people complain about not having mana screw runs in real life compared to mtgo are often unaware of their own negative bias and most probably are not sufficiently randomizing their decks in real life.</p>
<p>Earlier, there was this guy complaining to me about mana screw and I was like &ldquo;dude I have 3 lands to your 6&rdquo;. And he replied that at least I was casting my spells. Well maybe I had a smaller curve and only two colors (he had 4 colors of land out by the time the game ended) and I kept my hand even with 2 lands because it already had 3 two-drops. When your opening hand is 2 forests, a green card and 3 white cards and you think to yourself &ldquo;Surely I&rsquo;ll draw a plains!&rdquo; then you don&rsquo;t draw one for seven turns, that&rsquo;s not really mana screw, that was a bad keep.</p>
<p>Sigh, sorry about the rant. I just hate it when people complain so much about the same things. (Yet they still keep coming back to play magic)</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>iTunes will only accept certain video formats. For example, I think mp4s are fine but mkvs aren&rsquo;t. Not sure if it filters based on the container or the encoding.</p>
<p>And yeah, syncing to an iPad isn&rsquo;t the best thing =/</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a different experience, especially in terms of warfare since you can stack multiple units on a tile. In Civ4 you basically create one superstack then throw it at everything.</p>
