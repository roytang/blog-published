    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/12s179/mrt_during_rush_hour/">&#39;MRT During Rush Hour&#39; on /r/Philippines</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>It&rsquo;s actually worse during mornings at North EDSA, since the mass of people there trying to get into the station reaches all the way to the ground level at EDSA itself, sometimes extending maybe a quarter of a kilometer on either side (thankfully, the cops keep them on the sidewalk and don&rsquo;t let them spill out onto the road itself anymore)</p>
<p>No one likes riding the MRT, far too overcrowded. I support raising the fares because (a) I don&rsquo;t want to subsidize this shit and (b) hopefully we either get more trains or less people riding due to higher fares (kinda antipoor I know, but there you go)</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Saying all games should have a certain trait is a bit like saying all movies should be the same genre. It&rsquo;s ok that there are games that are hard - theyre not for casuals. And complaining that not everybody gets to experience those games or their content is a it like complaining that not everybody gets to enjoy twilight. Surprise - different people like different things!</p>

<p>A game&rsquo;s story isnt just the one told through cutscenes - it&rsquo;s sometimes told through the gameplay and the difficulty therein (see the long discussion about dark souls in this page).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not an american, and we dont have write-in votes where i&rsquo;m from, but in the Ultimates, cap wins the election via write in and they know the results immediately (within the same day the ballots were cast). Are they really able to count handwritten votes that quickly in US elections, or is this just a comics thing?</p>

<p>Not interested in stuff like graphics improvements, new skins, new armors, weapons, etc. Prefer things with new quests or NPC interactions, or doing something clever with the engine. Thanks!</p>

<p>I just have to say, I really appreciate the text-only spoilers. It lets me view them at work without people seeing large magic card images on my monitor. Cheers :D</p>

<p>Do we know their current ages and when they became Robin, and for how long? I mean, I know Damian is ten years old right now. And Dick is always drawn like he&rsquo;s maybe 21 or something? But given that Dick started being Robin at around 9 or 10, that means Batman has been Batman for more than a decade?</p>
<p>Obviously it&rsquo;s all &ldquo;comic book time&rdquo;, but I just want to get an idea of how long ago and for what duration each of them (Dick, Jason, Tim, Damian) were Robin in the New 52 universe.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>When people download something using the bittorrent protocol, there needs to be one or more &ldquo;seeds&rdquo;. These are computers that are providing the material to be downloaded. When one is &ldquo;seeding torrents&rdquo; it means they&rsquo;re making available the contents of that torrent for download by others. If there&rsquo;s no one seeding, the contents can&rsquo;t be downloaded.</p>
