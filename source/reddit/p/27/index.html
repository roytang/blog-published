<p>For the PS3, it is allowed to have the same account activated on up to two machines. If they follow the same scheme for PS4, then you could have a single PS+ sub with the account on both machines.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>I have both (well technically, I have access to both&hellip;the 3DS is my brother&rsquo;s and he doesn&rsquo;t use it.) I&rsquo;ve had access to the 3DS longer, the Vita is only a couple of months old.</p>
<p>I use the Vita a lot more because reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The screen is very very nice, especially compared to the 3DS screens. My eyes hurt a bit after a while of using the 3DS (even with 3D off). The Vita games also look a lot better compared to 3DS ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Playstation Plus. Nuff&rsquo; said.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No online account for the 3DS means I&rsquo;m not going to make digital purchases off the eShop, which limits my available library. I&rsquo;m worried about losing or breaking the system and losing access to all my purchases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just find that I like more games on the Vita. I like Mario and Zelda on the 3DS (the new Legend of Zelda will probably be the next game I play on 3DS), but aside from that most of the library is meh for me. I played Tales of the Abyss and Paper Mario Sticker Star on the 3ds but both got boring for me quickly. I might try out Fire Emblem, and if there&rsquo;s a new Advance Wars I&rsquo;d jump on that. On the Vita, I&rsquo;ve been playing P4G, Disgaea 3, Gravity Rush and I want to go through SFxT and Blazblue:CS, then there&rsquo;s Uncharted, Final Fantasy Tactics and I heard Zero Escape was good, and I want to try Guacamelee, and one of these days I&rsquo;m going to give in to impulse buying urges and get Xenogears off the store, oh and if LBP vita went on sale I&rsquo;d get that, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achievements/Trophies. I realize a lot of people don&rsquo;t care for them and don&rsquo;t &ldquo;get&rdquo; people who like them and that&rsquo;s fine, more power to you. But I do like them, though I&rsquo;m not like a platinum hunter or anything like that.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>There is no guarantee that blocking used games will increase profits. It&rsquo;s even possible for it to decrease profits since consumers will have less money to spend due to being unable to sell their used games.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been subbed for a month or so, it&rsquo;s been fine so far, although you get the occasional random word balloons missing for some reason. There&rsquo;s also a few seconds load time when opening a comic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is there anyway to know what games are upcoming in the U.S. store?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only for the coming month, since they announce all of the month&rsquo;s free games on the first week.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if I buy a U.S. subscription, and I later buy a Europe one when the U.S. expires, can I still acces my games I bought with the U.S. account?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it possible to buy a code in stores in the EU and use it on the U.S. store?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The code you buy would have to specifically be for the US store; ask the clerk at the store you&rsquo;re buying at to give you a US code/card.</p>

<ol>
<li>As large as you can, especially if you&rsquo;re getting PS+. I&rsquo;d recommend 160 at the minimum. For PS1 classics, I think FF9 is 1.5 gigs, that should be typical. For PS3 games, they range in size from 5-20gb (I think Uncharted</li>
</ol>
<p>3, which will be free on PS+ after Jun 11 will be more than 20gb)</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>I would just get the latest model unless BC is really, really important, the only BC models are the really old ones, the first generation so they&rsquo;re likely to have more hardware problems. There are some PS2 games available on PSN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s usually 10 PS3 games and some number of PSP/Vita games available in the instant game collection at any one time. Around 4-5 of them cycle in and out every month. You can check this link for the current list for the NA store: <a href="https://store.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/#!/en-us/free-games/cid=STORE-MSF77008-PSPLUSFREEGAMES">https://store.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/#!/en-us/free-games/cid=STORE-MSF77008-PSPLUSFREEGAMES</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New PS+ free games are added weekly for North America, but announcements are made before the first Tuesday of the month. Not sure how it works for Europe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have no idea</p>
</li>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I started up Persona 4: Golden on the Vita. It&rsquo;s mildly addictive, because I keep wanting to maximize what I do everyday. If you haven&rsquo;t played it, it&rsquo;s a weird cross of dungeon crawling with Pokemon-like battles (elemental weaknesses, etc) and Life/Dating Sim (for the noncombat parts); the relationships you build in the noncombat parts improve the Personas (pokemon) you can use in the dungeons, the noncombat stats unlock quests that require you to farm in the dungeons, etc. I think I&rsquo;ve played some 20-30 hours since starting it around Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>

<p>You can make an NA account from anywhere, but if you plan to use credit card payments for the store, it will only accept cards with a US address. I&rsquo;m from SE Asia and I have an NA account, I use prepaid PSN cards for buying stuff.</p>
<p>Edit: and yes, if you have both the NA account and your main account on the same PS3, your main account can play downloads from the NA account.</p>

<p>Most Marvel universes have the Fantastic Four and the Avengers (and the X-Men and Spider-Man etc) living together in the same world, yes.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>There is one main comics universe (it&rsquo;s often referred to as universe #616), all of the Marvel guys are there, including both Avengers and X-Men and a whole bunch of other people.</p>
<p>There are other universes, each with their own sets or versions of the Marvel characters. Sometimes events happen where the universes intersect or characters cross over from one universe into another.</p>
<p>One of the more prominent alternate universes is the ultimate universe (designated as universe 1610). All the current Marvel series with titles beginning with &ldquo;Ultimate&rdquo; such as Ultimate Comics Spider-Man or The Ultimates take place in this universe.</p>
<p>An example of differences between universes: In the Ultimate universe, Peter Parker died some time ago and there is a new kid who has become a new Spider-man.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with the Marvel series of films (Iron Man, Avengers, etc), those films take place in yet another universe called the Marvel Cinematic Universe (I&rsquo;m not sure if it has a numeric designation.)</p>
<p>Note that there are Marvel character movies produced by studios other than Marvel/Disney; examples are Amazing Spider-man, Fantastic Four and the X-Men series of movies. These do not take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That doesn&rsquo;t mean these characters don&rsquo;t exist in the MCU, it just means the MCU versions of those characters haven&rsquo;t appeared in the movies yet.</p>

<p>Because you&rsquo;re making it sound like the current through any particular wire is constant.</p>

<p>Forgive me if I gave that impression, but it&rsquo;s not (as my last post mentioned &ldquo;if you measured the current in the wire <em>at that time</em>). The current passing through a wire or being drawn by a device can change, the same way voltages can change or through switching.</p>

<p>When I say &ldquo;this wire has 2 amperes&rdquo;, I just mean that if you measured the current in the wire at that time, it would be 2 amperes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if wires are rated that way. (They probably are for safety purposes)</p>

<p>I just realized the Oblivion and Morrowind sales were only for 66% off; I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve seen them go for 75% off before though. It&rsquo;s only a couple of dollars difference for each, but I wish I had waited since I probably won&rsquo;t have time to play them both in the near future =/</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Ohms are a unit of resistance, which tells limits the amount of current that can be generated by a given voltage in a circuit. This means that given the same amount of voltage, a higher resistance will result in a smaller current.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you have two devices. You know that device A has twice as much resistance (twice as many ohms) as device B.</p>
<p>If you hook up device A to a five-volt battery, a certain amount of current will flow through (that is, charge will flow through the device at a certain speed).</p>
<p>If you hook up the same battery to device B, since device B has half the resistance of device A, there will be twice as much current flowing through device B compared to device A. (Electrical charge will be moving twice as fast)</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1fiwjc/eli5the_difference_between_watt_joules_and_amps/caapcio/">a comment by THE_HUMAN_TREE on &#39;ELI5:The difference between watt, joules, and amps.&#39; on /r/explainlikeimfive</a>:

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Hm, ok let&rsquo;s try another tack. Amperes, joules and watts aren&rsquo;t things that you can see or things that move, they&rsquo;re units of measurement, like a foot or a meter or a mile. When we say &ldquo;rate&rdquo; it measures the speed of something like feet per second or miles per hour.</p>
<p>Amperes are something like the speed. When you talk about a car&rsquo;s speed, it&rsquo;s in something like miles per hour right? Amperes are like the speed of electricity (to be specific, electric charge). When you say &ldquo;this wire has 2 amperes&rdquo;, it means electricity moves through that wire twice as fast as one that only has 1 ampere. Since it&rsquo;s speed, amperes aren&rsquo;t something that&rsquo;s created, it&rsquo;s just a measurement of speed.</p>
<p>Joules are a unit of work or energy. This means joules measure when force is used to move something over some distance. Like if 2 people are carrying some objects over the same distance; if person A is carrying an object that is twice as heavy as the object carried by person B then we can say person A did twice as many joules of work as person B (heavier objects need more force to be carried)</p>
<p>Watts are a unit of measurement for power; power is the speed of work, or how much work is done in a given time. Let&rsquo;s say two people carried the same weight of objects over the same distance, then they both did the same amount of work. But if person A did this work in half the time as person B, then we can say person A used up twice as much power (or twice as many watts) as person B</p>
<p>When referring to electricity, joules and watts typically refer to the amount of work or power that was used to generate that electricity. The work/energy is created by machines instead of people.</p>
<p>When you have two devices, say device A is rated at 100 watts and device B is rated at 200 watts. This means device B uses up twice as much electrical energy as device A over the same amount of time. It means the machines generating electricity have to work twice as hard over the same amount of time to power that device.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>These are units for different things.</p>
<p>Amps (amperes) are a unit of current which is the rate at which charge flows.</p>
<p>Joules are a unit of work or energy.</p>
<p>Watts are a unit of power which is the rate at which energy is generated or consumed.</p>

<p>Looks like it&rsquo;s this one: <a href="http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12452/?">http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12452/?</a> (must have been renamed for some reason), but I can&rsquo;t use it as it requires Dawnguard which I don&rsquo;t have (waiting for Steam sale to get it)</p>
<p>Oh well, guess I&rsquo;ll just wait.</p>

<p>Does the story mode cover the entire One Piece manga run? Or just select parts? Or it&rsquo;s an original story?</p>
<p>Also, do you think it would it be better to buy OP:PW (I can probably find a used one somewhere for cheap), or wait for OP:PW2 (being released later this year)?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>If the Xbox One (a) lets me play all my PS3 discs and PSN downloads AND (b) had an online service that gave out lots of value in free games, that&rsquo;d turn me for sure. I&rsquo;m not terrible interested in Xbox franchises like Halo or Gears of War. (I originally typed GoW, but realized that means God of War)</p>
<p>PS4 has (b) but not (a), but I&rsquo;m not rushing out to get that on release date either, and I figure given enough time and Gaikai, Sony would be able to figure something out for (a)</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>It would have to be enough life to stave off death from aggro attacks for 2-3 turns because (a) you wasted a turn casting it and (b) you still need to naturally draw into whatever answer you&rsquo;re looking for within the window the life gain gives you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say 12 might be borderline playable, depending on the environment. 15 is already reasonable and will probably see sideboard play. 20 seems a bit overboard, but it could be balanced if aggro becomes really strong/fast</p>

<p>I can see where the parsing might have been misunderstandable.</p>
<p>Anyway, just show him this thread. Or ask a judge. Or show him some youtube videos on MTGO/pro level play of how it&rsquo;s used.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>July and August might get fairly rainy.</p>
<p>Weekend trips: the popular ones are the beaches (Boracay, etc), there are cheap local flights if you buy ahead of time. You can also head up north to Baguio, it&rsquo;s a nice place, though people usually travel there during summer (April-May)</p>
<p>Safety is a concern, yes, but don&rsquo;t let that stop you. Just be more wary especially if you&rsquo;re in a seedy-looking area. I think the Makati central business district is pretty safe most of the time.</p>
<p>Most people will have some level of English understanding, though some might respond to you in broken English. A few key phrases might help, but are unnecessary.</p>
<p>The basketball thing, hard to say, you have to know people who participate in leagues (the local term is &ldquo;liga&rdquo;). If you&rsquo;re working for a big company, the employees there will be able to help you, most guys are basketball fans.</p>
<p>Have fun and enjoy your stay!</p>

<p>I hope this gets released as a PS2 classic via PSN. I only had 1 play through before my PS2 gave up the ghost.</p>

<li>
<p>&ldquo;unmanipulated open market&rdquo; is exactly why MM is expensive - demand is high and buyers are willing to pay at a high price and sellers are free to sell at the price (because the market is &ldquo;unmanipulated&rdquo; and &ldquo;open&rdquo;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would you feel if you ripped a Voice of Resurgence from a booster pack and Wizards told you that you could only sell it for $5 or trade for another card with the same rarity 1:1?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if there was some magical way to force retailers to sell product at MSRP, buyers will just turn around and sell them at expensive prices because that&rsquo;s what the market is willing to pay. Again, supply and demand.</p>

<li>
<p>Not everyone has a DCI#!</p>
