<p>So my friend has an R2 copy of Injustice while mine is R3, and apparently we can&rsquo;t play against each other online? When we get the invite from the other person it asks us to quit the current Injustice game and insert the &ldquo;Injustice Gods Among Us&rdquo; disc, even though that&rsquo;s what we currently have.</p>
<p>Is there any workaround for this? It&rsquo;s quite sucky =/</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>#6 is part of the Omega Effect crossover with the Daredevil and Punisher books</p>
<p>#8 is an epilogue for the Ends of the Earth storyline from Amazing Spider-man</p>
<p>They are probably not included in Vol 2 because they are included with separate volumes for their own storylines.</p>
<p>It should be fine to miss them, but you might also be interested in reading the above two storylines.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>I think the normal battery life is around 3 hours. When I go out, I put mine on flight mode, that allows me to get more battery life out of it (5-7 hours active play time I think)</p>

<p>it is illegal for them to sell the cross buy digital bonus to someone</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not an American, so I&rsquo;d love a citation on that one.</p>
<p>Regardless, even if they couldn&rsquo;t sell it, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that suddenly it becomes &ldquo;finders keepers&rdquo; where the first person who sees it can just get it.</p>
<p>You know what, I&rsquo;m not judging or anything, whatever floats your boat. If you think it&rsquo;s okay to get something for free without even asking the owner go ahead. I&rsquo;m just saying if it were me I&rsquo;d probably ask the manager or an employee first if I could have the cross buy copy. Maybe even use your arguments that they&rsquo;re not going to use it anyway.</p>

<p>So how is this at all different from one person buying the game and letting someone else have their cross-buy version</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did the place it was rented from say the first renter could have the cross buy version? If not, then it&rsquo;s seems closer to one person buying it and the second person borrowing the game under the pretext of playing it then using the cross-buy version without permission. The one who bought the game is the one entitled to get the cross-buy version, and unless he explicitly let you have it then you&rsquo;re taking advantage of his ignorance.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>You are almost completely correct. The only minor note I&rsquo;d like to make is that sometimes cards can change value even when there are no new sets being released. This can happen when someone discovers a particularly strong deck or combination midseason and the demand rises and the card prices change accordingly.</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s not fair to you at that price then simply don&rsquo;t get it at that price. You don&rsquo;t have to play the AAA games when they come out.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m planning to play in a WMCQ in a couple of weeks, but I haven&rsquo;t played Standard in a while (like for half a year maybe). I have the shell of a UW Delver deck available (Snapcasters, Restoration Angels, etc) that I can try to fill out until then, but will it have a fighting chance in standard at the moment?</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for the feedback guys, looks like I&rsquo;ll have to look for other options.</p>

<p>How is reading on the app compared to say, Comixology?</p>
<p>Looks like a sweet deal, but my problem is I&rsquo;m offline during 90% of the day (I dont have a data plan) and I heard they only allow 6 offline issues at once. I usually do my reading when I&rsquo;m out of the house (when waiting in line, etc) so I&rsquo;m kinda on the fence about subscribing.</p>
