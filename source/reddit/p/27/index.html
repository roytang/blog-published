<p>Forgive me if I gave that impression, but it&rsquo;s not (as my last post mentioned &ldquo;if you measured the current in the wire <em>at that time</em>). The current passing through a wire or being drawn by a device can change, the same way voltages can change or through switching.</p>

<p>When I say &ldquo;this wire has 2 amperes&rdquo;, I just mean that if you measured the current in the wire at that time, it would be 2 amperes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if wires are rated that way. (They probably are for safety purposes)</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I just realized the Oblivion and Morrowind sales were only for 66% off; I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve seen them go for 75% off before though. It&rsquo;s only a couple of dollars difference for each, but I wish I had waited since I probably won&rsquo;t have time to play them both in the near future =/</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Ohms are a unit of resistance, which tells limits the amount of current that can be generated by a given voltage in a circuit. This means that given the same amount of voltage, a higher resistance will result in a smaller current.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you have two devices. You know that device A has twice as much resistance (twice as many ohms) as device B.</p>
<p>If you hook up device A to a five-volt battery, a certain amount of current will flow through (that is, charge will flow through the device at a certain speed).</p>
<p>If you hook up the same battery to device B, since device B has half the resistance of device A, there will be twice as much current flowing through device B compared to device A. (Electrical charge will be moving twice as fast)</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1fiwjc/eli5the_difference_between_watt_joules_and_amps/caapcio/">a comment by THE_HUMAN_TREE on &#39;ELI5:The difference between watt, joules, and amps.&#39; on /r/explainlikeimfive</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Hm, ok let&rsquo;s try another tack. Amperes, joules and watts aren&rsquo;t things that you can see or things that move, they&rsquo;re units of measurement, like a foot or a meter or a mile. When we say &ldquo;rate&rdquo; it measures the speed of something like feet per second or miles per hour.</p>
<p>Amperes are something like the speed. When you talk about a car&rsquo;s speed, it&rsquo;s in something like miles per hour right? Amperes are like the speed of electricity (to be specific, electric charge). When you say &ldquo;this wire has 2 amperes&rdquo;, it means electricity moves through that wire twice as fast as one that only has 1 ampere. Since it&rsquo;s speed, amperes aren&rsquo;t something that&rsquo;s created, it&rsquo;s just a measurement of speed.</p>
<p>Joules are a unit of work or energy. This means joules measure when force is used to move something over some distance. Like if 2 people are carrying some objects over the same distance; if person A is carrying an object that is twice as heavy as the object carried by person B then we can say person A did twice as many joules of work as person B (heavier objects need more force to be carried)</p>
<p>Watts are a unit of measurement for power; power is the speed of work, or how much work is done in a given time. Let&rsquo;s say two people carried the same weight of objects over the same distance, then they both did the same amount of work. But if person A did this work in half the time as person B, then we can say person A used up twice as much power (or twice as many watts) as person B</p>
<p>When referring to electricity, joules and watts typically refer to the amount of work or power that was used to generate that electricity. The work/energy is created by machines instead of people.</p>
<p>When you have two devices, say device A is rated at 100 watts and device B is rated at 200 watts. This means device B uses up twice as much electrical energy as device A over the same amount of time. It means the machines generating electricity have to work twice as hard over the same amount of time to power that device.</p>

<p>Looks like it&rsquo;s this one: <a href="http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12452/?">http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12452/?</a> (must have been renamed for some reason), but I can&rsquo;t use it as it requires Dawnguard which I don&rsquo;t have (waiting for Steam sale to get it)</p>
<p>Oh well, guess I&rsquo;ll just wait.</p>

<p>Does the story mode cover the entire One Piece manga run? Or just select parts? Or it&rsquo;s an original story?</p>
<p>Also, do you think it would it be better to buy OP:PW (I can probably find a used one somewhere for cheap), or wait for OP:PW2 (being released later this year)?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>If the Xbox One (a) lets me play all my PS3 discs and PSN downloads AND (b) had an online service that gave out lots of value in free games, that&rsquo;d turn me for sure. I&rsquo;m not terrible interested in Xbox franchises like Halo or Gears of War. (I originally typed GoW, but realized that means God of War)</p>
<p>PS4 has (b) but not (a), but I&rsquo;m not rushing out to get that on release date either, and I figure given enough time and Gaikai, Sony would be able to figure something out for (a)</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>It would have to be enough life to stave off death from aggro attacks for 2-3 turns because (a) you wasted a turn casting it and (b) you still need to naturally draw into whatever answer you&rsquo;re looking for within the window the life gain gives you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say 12 might be borderline playable, depending on the environment. 15 is already reasonable and will probably see sideboard play. 20 seems a bit overboard, but it could be balanced if aggro becomes really strong/fast</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>July and August might get fairly rainy.</p>
<p>Weekend trips: the popular ones are the beaches (Boracay, etc), there are cheap local flights if you buy ahead of time. You can also head up north to Baguio, it&rsquo;s a nice place, though people usually travel there during summer (April-May)</p>
<p>Safety is a concern, yes, but don&rsquo;t let that stop you. Just be more wary especially if you&rsquo;re in a seedy-looking area. I think the Makati central business district is pretty safe most of the time.</p>
<p>Most people will have some level of English understanding, though some might respond to you in broken English. A few key phrases might help, but are unnecessary.</p>
<p>The basketball thing, hard to say, you have to know people who participate in leagues (the local term is &ldquo;liga&rdquo;). If you&rsquo;re working for a big company, the employees there will be able to help you, most guys are basketball fans.</p>
<p>Have fun and enjoy your stay!</p>

<p>&ldquo;unmanipulated open market&rdquo; is exactly why MM is expensive - demand is high and buyers are willing to pay at a high price and sellers are free to sell at the price (because the market is &ldquo;unmanipulated&rdquo; and &ldquo;open&rdquo;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would you feel if you ripped a Voice of Resurgence from a booster pack and Wizards told you that you could only sell it for $5 or trade for another card with the same rarity 1:1?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if there was some magical way to force retailers to sell product at MSRP, buyers will just turn around and sell them at expensive prices because that&rsquo;s what the market is willing to pay. Again, supply and demand.</p>

<p>Misleading title, and linking directly to his twitter profile means anyone who clicks the link after 24 hours will have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about. (It&rsquo;s only been 4 hours and I had to read the comments to figure out what you&rsquo;re talking about)</p>

<p>Thor: GOT is very good.</p>
<p>Cable and X-force is a bit meh. Uncanny X-Force is better IMHO</p>
<p>Look into X-Men #1 coming out this week.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>The characters are all owned by Marvel. Marvel is owned by Disney.</p>
<p>Sony doesnt &ldquo;own&rdquo; the Spider-man franchise. Sony has an exclusive license from Marvel to use Spider-man in movies; that means only they can produce Spider-man movies. The license is from before Marvel had their own movie studio.</p>
<p>Fox also has a similar license for the X-Men/Fantastic Four.</p>
<p>For any characters where Marvel hasn&rsquo;t given anyone else an exclusive movie license, they can use those characters in their own movies.</p>
