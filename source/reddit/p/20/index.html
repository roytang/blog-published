<p>I don&rsquo;t really care about the UI, but they really need to do something about server stability, lag and recovery from crashes.</p>
<p>MTGO&rsquo;s convenience is a big plus for me, since I can&rsquo;t really allocate any large amount of time towards paper Magic anymore (and most of the people I grew up playing Magic with have moved to faraway places). The server issues are the only real problem and the reason why I dont play large events any more.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;m in the process of going through all the cards now. My current scheme is 3 groups: rares/mythics (sorted alphabetically), commons/uncommons (sorted alphabetically), excess trash commons/uncommons.</p>
<p>I still keep trash cards, but no more than 1 playset. (This part might be a bit irrational), the rest go into the 3rd group</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only at letter C at the moment, but I&rsquo;ve already filled up more than one booster box of trash cards, I&rsquo;ll dispose of them somehow once I&rsquo;m done with everything. Aside from the excess trash, I have roughly one booster box each of A, B and C, and one fat pack of A,B,C rares/mythics sorted.</p>
<p>I already have all the other cards sorted by letter, I just need to go through them to classify and group each bucket. I started around 3 weeks ago and just sort/organize a few stacks of cards at a time. The cards are currently stored in numerous booster boxes, fat packs and such; I&rsquo;ll think about better storage when I&rsquo;m done with all this sorting.</p>
<p>I also separate all the foils, regardless of rarity. I have about 2/3rds of a booster box worth of foils, not yet sure what to do with them. Maybe I&rsquo;ll make some sort of weird unbalanced cube.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a picture of some cancels: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/yuyzcM5.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/yuyzcM5.jpg</a></p>

<p>I feel like 90% of people would prefer casual play, but once you&rsquo;ve gotten into competitive play it starts to get into your blood and it&rsquo;s hard to go without it for an extended period.</p>

<p>It protects you from a different set of things than single color protection would. Brave the elements will only protect from one color at a time, and you need to have it at the time you want your creature protected. Soldier of the pantheon&rsquo;s protection is built in - no need for an extra spell! And you can still brave the elements him if you want!</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Additional info: these aren&rsquo;t valuable cards (most of them anyway), just random foils accumulated from years of Magic, so I&rsquo;m not inclined to sleeve them. When I get a valuable foil I keep it separate (and unbent) or just trade it away.</p>

<p>There is a Comic Quest in SM North EDSA, it should be on the second floor in the main building (unless it has moved recently)</p>

<p>If SSS is so successful and stable</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not. The current actuarial life of the SSS is only up to 2039, and they have had to increase required member contributions in order to ensure the fund lasts longer than that. (Citation: <a href="http://business.inquirer.net/129887/sss-revives-proposal-to-hike-contributions-to-ensure-benefits-in-perpetuity">http://business.inquirer.net/129887/sss-revives-proposal-to-hike-contributions-to-ensure-benefits-in-perpetuity</a>)</p>
<p>Adding more benefits like college plans would require even larger contributions (educational plans are typically expensive). Even if it was optional, I suspect that only a small percentage of the SSS membership would be able to afford it. And seeing how private business (which are supposedly more efficient/streamlined than government procedures) were unable to keep up with the rising costs of education, it seems unlikely for it to be viable for the SSS.</p>
