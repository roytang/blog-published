<p>Might be travelling to the US for the first time later this year. Do console game prices really go so low over there? They&rsquo;re always pretty expensive over here (SE Asia), even used copies never go as low as a dollar. Would it be worth it for me to visit some stores and which stores would be good to visit? I&rsquo;ll be in california if that matters.</p>

<p>Nah, I like living here, in spite of everything, and I&rsquo;m programming avails me a good living naman. I&rsquo;ve worked abroad on short stints (pinadala ng company), but TBH, I had never even considered leaving the country long-term, but I started looking into it after 2016. Hassle for me na ma-uproot and to try to start over elsewhere.</p>

<p>Wait, what do you mean? Web services are like web pages, except they&rsquo;re endpoints that usually do only one thing and return some machine readable format like JSON or XML instead of HTML that can be rendered and viewed by a human in a browser. Basically you send them an HTTP request and they maybe do some processing and spit back an HTTP response that you consume.</p>
<p>Some types are simpler than others - REST-based web services are usually very simple for example, and can sometimes be invoked directly via the browser address bar. Some follow more complicated protocols (SOAP) that support things like authentication and signing and so on.</p>
<p>Web services are developed the same way as normal web pages, with the usual backend processing and stuff (but there are some frameworks to make this easier, especially for complicated protocols like SOAP), but the client program (the one calling the web services) does not have to be another web application. It can be a mobile app for example.</p>
<p>One of the typical usages would be third-party integration. For example, Philhealth I believe currently has some kind of e-Claims web services in development (maybe? IDK the current status), where the idea is to allow third-party systems to submit Philhealth claims electronically. The idea is that individual hospitals have their own medical records systems, those systems can send HTTP requests to the e-claims web services in order to for example check whether a patient is eligible for a claim.</p>
<p>Ok, sorry I know that explanation doesn&rsquo;t really work for a 5-year old lol</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Shifting careers from IT support isn&rsquo;t an unreasonable proposition, but you need to already know your stuff before going in for interviews. You will also still need some basic level of programming knowledge. A lot of things you&rsquo;ll need can be learned on the fly/on the job (like usage of specific languages or tools or libraries), but you need a good basic foundation to build on.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m interviewing someone coming from a nonprogrammming background, I&rsquo;ll basically be treating her as an entry-level candidate. You will need to be able to justify why I should hire you over say, a fresh grad who still remembers his java programming from his college days. The interviewer will need to know you&rsquo;re not trying to BS your way into the position. Having some work you can show off (side projects or whatever) can be a big help. You can also cite anything you&rsquo;re doing in your current domain that might show off some related skillset. Like, if you did some minor scripting to gather support statistics, something like that? IDK if IT support people do that kind of stuff. See my other interview tips in the other answer elsewhere in this thread too.</p>

<p>See my edit above. It&rsquo;s hard to give an average. At 15 years, I&rsquo;d certainly be expecting a six-digit ask at least. I did interview a dude once who was older than me, but his asking salary was below 100k (I think he was running some side business or sth so he didn&rsquo;t care too much). The range would also be highly dependent on skillset and the client and the position - at 15 years it&rsquo;s not unreasonable to be CTO of a small-medium-sized company. If you can get a remote job (working for US companies or such), a few hundred thousand a month wouldn&rsquo;t be unreasonable. Sorry for the non-answer</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Why do people keep asking about salary? That&rsquo;s not really a programming or software dev question. I am a freelancing consultant at the moment, so I can&rsquo;t really give a simple answer to that anyway (it&rsquo;s almost always &ldquo;it depends&rdquo;)</p>
<p>I will answer the experience one - 15ish years in the industry (yeah, I&rsquo;m old).</p>
<p>Edit: Also, there is a high range in the salaries of software devs in this country (not sure if the same elsewhere, probably), because:</p>
<ul>
<li>some people are better at selling themselves than others</li>
<li>some devs are way better than others (and thus are more valuable)</li>
<li>each dev&rsquo;s career path and growth is often unique, so it&rsquo;s difficult to compare, especially once you rack up some years of experience</li>
</ul>
<p>i.e. for a given number of years of experience, the salary band will be quite wide.</p>
<p>I get that when you&rsquo;re starting out, salary is a big deal, but honestly if you&rsquo;re a decent enough programmer, you can get into any place with above average salary. You can grow your salary a bit faster by hopping jobs every so often, but too many hops looks bad on a resume.</p>
<p>Anyway, my advice is that once you get to a decent salary range that is good for you (i.e. you&rsquo;re not starving), focus less on comparing yourself to other people, and more on increasing your own value and managing your work/life balance. Money isn&rsquo;t everything, beyond basic survival.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;ve technical interviewed a lot of entry-level/junior level devs. Honestly any kind of project would probably be okay, as long as you&rsquo;re able to explain what role you played, bonus points if you&rsquo;re able to discuss technical decisions you made (why was this choice made, and why not this other one etc) or specific technical challenges you were able to overcome. That kind of stuff. Really, if you can demonstrate that you really worked on a project (and not just coasted by on teammates help etc), you&rsquo;re already an above average interview.</p>
<p>Entry-level candidates might have more trouble since they often won&rsquo;t have a portfolio, but the quality of candidates is a bit low locally, so if you can demonstrably do simple stuff like loops, recursion, stacks, etc you&rsquo;re probably already an above average interview. Bigger companies will have written exams to filter out peeps who can&rsquo;t do that though.</p>
<p>More random technical interviewing tips, even though you didn&rsquo;t ask for that: being able to communicate well is a big plus, mandatory even. Lack of confidence makes the interviewer worry that you don&rsquo;t really know what you&rsquo;re talking about. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll slip in something I know to be wrong &ldquo;Diba pag cinall mo yan, ganito mangyayari?&rdquo;, and see how the candidate reacts</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/ais6hu/standard_golgari_midrange_players_how_do_you_beat/eerkryj/">a comment by cbslinger on &#39;[Standard] Golgari Midrange players, how do you beat Mono Red?&#39; on /r/spikes</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<blockquote>
<p>since mono-red is the majority of the meta at my ranking, what deck would be best to punish that deck</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For budget options, I like the white weenie decks vs red. They have 12 one-drops that can gain life (the vampire from legion&rsquo;s landing, the 1/1 lifelink flier and the 1/1 gain 1 life if if i have 3 creatures), so they almost always have incidental lifegain. If they manage to pump even 1-2 lifelink vampires with the &ldquo;convoke and put a +1/+1 counter on my dudes&rdquo; elephant, it&rsquo;s a big deal. (I should really learn the names of cards). Selesnya is also pretty good - they have access to both Knight of Autumn and Wildgrowth Walker, so it&rsquo;s kind of a nightmare. And then of course there&rsquo;s those control decks that have Absorb AND &ldquo;Gain 3 life draw a card&rdquo; AND Moment of Craving. I consider these much worse matchups for RDW than Golgari</p>
<p>I agree the Golgari deck can run out of steam too. Golgari&rsquo;s advantage is that your creatures are generally of higher quality and will win over theirs (except maybe for Chainwhirler). Find, Vivien, Karn, and even small Vraska are good for getting your second wind and refilling your hand after stabilizing.</p>
<p>I also run 1 Brontodon in the main, but I don&rsquo;t think I can cut the reapers, as I&rsquo;ve won a few close fights just by chump blocking with creatures to draw cards and find my answers.</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/ais6hu/standard_golgari_midrange_players_how_do_you_beat/">&#39;[Standard] Golgari Midrange players, how do you beat Mono Red?&#39; on /r/spikes</a>:

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I started tracking my BO1 Arena games today. Out of 35 matches, I faced 8 RDW, won 50% (4 matches). I think the matchup overall is about 50-50, maybe 55-45 in Golgari&rsquo;s favor, and your win rate goes up if you get at least one life gain off Wildgrowth Walker. The 3 out of the 4 games I lost I either didn&rsquo;t have access to one color, or never got off 2 lands. (I might need to mulligan better or add more duals - I&rsquo;ve been saving my rare WCs so I only have 3 shock 2 check)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played both decks on Arena; red has some explosive hands, but has a tendency to run out of steam. If they get the nut draw, there&rsquo;s not much you can do, and you&rsquo;ll be down to 6-8 before turn 4.</p>
<p>Having wildgrowth isn&rsquo;t necessary to win - 2 out of my 4 wins I didn&rsquo;t draw one.</p>
<p>The ideal opening hand has 2-3 explore creatures (ideally two 2-drops, squire is preferred over branchwalker and a jadelight) to ensure a steady flow of lands. On turn one you play an elf if you have it, even if you have to use a shock, because they&rsquo;ll bolt it everytime, and 2 &lt;= 2-3. I kind of wish I had been tracking who was going first - I suspect it matters a lot, I&rsquo;ll do that tomorrow.</p>
<p>You want to play creatures on turns 2-3 and just assume they&rsquo;re going to die. You want them to waste their burn spells on your creatures. Play wildgrowth last, but if he&rsquo;s your only guy, it&rsquo;s okay to run him on 2 (especially if you have Find to get him back later).</p>
<p>When exploring during the early turns, send to the graveyard Tyrant, Karn, big Vraska, or Vivienne, those won&rsquo;t be much help. Getting more creatures is better, just make sure you can play them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to stabilize at around turns 4-6, with around 6-10 life, and hopefully the red deck&rsquo;s hand is spent. 6 life is scary - you&rsquo;re basically hoping he doesn&rsquo;t have two bolts, but it happens. Stay scared, never attack without leaving a blocker for a hasted 2/2 mage. You&rsquo;re hoping he doesn&rsquo;t draw LUtS, Risk Factor or Frenzy (frenzy is the worst for him, light up is the best)</p>

<p>Any recommendations? Baka lang may alam kayo na di ko pa alam lol</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Book Sale sa malls of course, but the selection isn&rsquo;t really that good.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Bookay-Ukay in Teacher&rsquo;s Village, selection is a bit better than Book Sale, but parang hindi sya bukas the last time I was in that area.</p>
<p>There used to be a small used book store with a pretty good selection called Chapter IX in Circle C mall along Congressional Avenue, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be there anymore.</p>
<p>The best one I&rsquo;ve found sa Metro Manila was this pop up stall that often appeared in Greenfield near Shaw on Friday evenings. Haven&rsquo;t been there for a few years, so IDK if this is still a thing, pero maganda yung selection nila madaming sci-fi/fantasy classics (I got my copy of Dune there)</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Whoever has more lands in hand is more likely to win, but how many lands you draw off the swans will still matter.</p>
<p>Say I have 5 lands and you have 4.</p>
<p>I target the swans with Seismic Assault, discarding one land. If you let it resolve, I draw two cards and potentially gain even more land in hand advantage. If you try to respond by activating your own Seismic Assault, I can respond by discarding another land. Since I have land advantage, my Seismic Assault will always resolve first, which means I get to draw cards first. Whoever draws cards first, if he draws at least one land, he can activate Seismic Assault again to keep the chain going. There will be an opening if the player with land advantage is unlucky enough to draw enough nonlands to lose his advantage.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Locals will have a tendency to fawn over Westerners who come to the country, so at least at the start you might feel like you can do no wrong.</p>
<p>Locals are also a lot less&hellip; direct than Westerners and if there are problems they may dance about the issues a bit for fear of looking bad. You might need to be less direct with any criticism than you&rsquo;re used to with Westerners. And some might have difficulty talking to you if they aren&rsquo;t confident in their English (most Filipinos will be able to speak/understand English to some extent, but not everyone will have decent grammar etc)</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a strong sense of power distance in the company, so they might be a bit afraid of you especially if you are perceived as being &ldquo;higher in the food chain&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Going out with them for meals and maybe treating them every once in a while (don&rsquo;t let them get used to it) would be good ways to become accepted as part of the group. But that power distance may be difficult to breach.</p>
<p>All of these are generalizations of course, not all locals are like the above (I consider myself an exception - I&rsquo;m quite direct even when talking to foreigners), so YMMV.</p>
