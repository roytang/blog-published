<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily that they&rsquo;re damning. It&rsquo;s more likely that most of them are questions they can&rsquo;t answer yet right now, maybe a lot of details are not yet finalized and they&rsquo;d rather not risk committing Microsoft&rsquo;s mistake of putting out an inconsistent message.</p>

<p>Wow, I&rsquo;ve had a PS3 since &lsquo;08 played zero of those lol. It&rsquo;s no surprise I didn&rsquo;t get one at launch, the only thing there that remotely interests me is Marvel:UA and that Genji thing looks like it might be interesting.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>They&rsquo;re not going to change anything this early in the game, when the consoles aren&rsquo;t even out, for the same reason that the die-hard XBox fans are still going to buy the machine on launch, even if they&rsquo;re a minority now - it&rsquo;s still too early to tell what&rsquo;s going to happen, and Sony still has a lot of chances to screw things up. Sony may have won E3, but that was just E3, the real test is where we are 2 years down the road.</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/1gcbjs/playstation_plus_rss/caiyevl/">a comment by Porpoise_Jockey on &#39;Playstation Plus RSS?&#39; on /r/PS3</a>:

<div class="content e-content">

<blockquote>
<p>For instance, there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a post on there about uncharted or xcom being free at the moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They have a weekly PS store update post which includes the PS+ IGC games for that week, Uncharted 3 and X-Com are covered here: <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/06/11/playstation-store-update-295/">http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/06/11/playstation-store-update-295/</a></p>
<p>Edit: Also <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/06/10/playstation-plus-e3-2013-sale-free-machinarium-uncharted-3-xcom-more/">http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/06/10/playstation-plus-e3-2013-sale-free-machinarium-uncharted-3-xcom-more/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, there is a lot of other crap on there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s only because it&rsquo;s E3 this week.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Was hoping there might be a PS+ specific feed somewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know about that, but since the blog is an official source, literally every PS+ free game and sale gets announced there at some point. Between reddit (r/PlaystationPlus) and the blog, I don&rsquo;t see any chance of &ldquo;missing out&rdquo; on any deals.</p>
<p>Edit: I only thought to try this after writing this post, but you can just subscribe to their PS+ tag directly to get the PS+ content only. Try the following URL: <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/tag/playstation-plus/">http://blog.us.playstation.com/tag/playstation-plus/</a> (it worked in Google Reader)</p>

<p>I only play the occasional Street Fighter / SFxT / Blazblue / Injustice match online (then get crushed due to being a noob and/or lag). Any other online play I get is on the PC</p>

<p>Mick, are you an XBox or Playstation kind of guy?</p>
<p>During your time as a pro wrestler, how did you explain to your kids what you were doing and how you were getting hurt? Did it give you any trouble raising them that they might try some of the dangerous stuff you do?</p>
<p>Who do you think is the best superstar in the WWE right now?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>The console features weren&rsquo;t very exciting so if they had something new there that might have helped. Although TBH the hardware spec bump is pretty significant already, I don&rsquo;t mind this so much.</p>
<p>More exclusives would have been nice, although I have to say Second Son is looking pretty sweet. I don&rsquo;t actually care for the XBox &ldquo;exclusives&rdquo; myself, but the longer list of titles on that side makes it easier for XBox fans to talk themselves out of switching.</p>
<p>And Vita owners everywhere will say: more Vita support, more Vita games, Vita/memory card price drops. The Vita is a clear differentiator over MS (and even Nintendo - the Vita and the 3ds dont actually occupy the exact same market niche in terms of games) so more PS4 x Vita features would have been great too.</p>
<p>Right now, they clearly won over MS, but that&rsquo;s only because MS made so many blunders along the way. If all of the above had been provided, xb1 might have been buried so hard whoever manages to pull it out of that hole would be named king of england.</p>

<p>I was playing LBP and I was thinking it would be pretty sweet to have a level editor and community-created levels for a Mario game. It would legitimize all those romhacks that create fun or impossible stages, etc. Why hasn&rsquo;t Nintendo done something like this?</p>

<p>For the PS3, it is allowed to have the same account activated on up to two machines. If they follow the same scheme for PS4, then you could have a single PS+ sub with the account on both machines.</p>

<p>I think Spike TV announced earlier that they would be Microsoft exclusive for E3 (I hear &ldquo;they paid us some monies&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Also, there&rsquo;s /r/Games, /r/ps3 subs that you can join for the sony news.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>I have both (well technically, I have access to both&hellip;the 3DS is my brother&rsquo;s and he doesn&rsquo;t use it.) I&rsquo;ve had access to the 3DS longer, the Vita is only a couple of months old.</p>
<p>I use the Vita a lot more because reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The screen is very very nice, especially compared to the 3DS screens. My eyes hurt a bit after a while of using the 3DS (even with 3D off). The Vita games also look a lot better compared to 3DS ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Playstation Plus. Nuff&rsquo; said.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No online account for the 3DS means I&rsquo;m not going to make digital purchases off the eShop, which limits my available library. I&rsquo;m worried about losing or breaking the system and losing access to all my purchases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just find that I like more games on the Vita. I like Mario and Zelda on the 3DS (the new Legend of Zelda will probably be the next game I play on 3DS), but aside from that most of the library is meh for me. I played Tales of the Abyss and Paper Mario Sticker Star on the 3ds but both got boring for me quickly. I might try out Fire Emblem, and if there&rsquo;s a new Advance Wars I&rsquo;d jump on that. On the Vita, I&rsquo;ve been playing P4G, Disgaea 3, Gravity Rush and I want to go through SFxT and Blazblue:CS, then there&rsquo;s Uncharted, Final Fantasy Tactics and I heard Zero Escape was good, and I want to try Guacamelee, and one of these days I&rsquo;m going to give in to impulse buying urges and get Xenogears off the store, oh and if LBP vita went on sale I&rsquo;d get that, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achievements/Trophies. I realize a lot of people don&rsquo;t care for them and don&rsquo;t &ldquo;get&rdquo; people who like them and that&rsquo;s fine, more power to you. But I do like them, though I&rsquo;m not like a platinum hunter or anything like that.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>There is no guarantee that blocking used games will increase profits. It&rsquo;s even possible for it to decrease profits since consumers will have less money to spend due to being unable to sell their used games.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<ol>
<li>As large as you can, especially if you&rsquo;re getting PS+. I&rsquo;d recommend 160 at the minimum. For PS1 classics, I think FF9 is 1.5 gigs, that should be typical. For PS3 games, they range in size from 5-20gb (I think Uncharted</li>
</ol>
<p>3, which will be free on PS+ after Jun 11 will be more than 20gb)</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>I would just get the latest model unless BC is really, really important, the only BC models are the really old ones, the first generation so they&rsquo;re likely to have more hardware problems. There are some PS2 games available on PSN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s usually 10 PS3 games and some number of PSP/Vita games available in the instant game collection at any one time. Around 4-5 of them cycle in and out every month. You can check this link for the current list for the NA store: <a href="https://store.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/#!/en-us/free-games/cid=STORE-MSF77008-PSPLUSFREEGAMES">https://store.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/#!/en-us/free-games/cid=STORE-MSF77008-PSPLUSFREEGAMES</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New PS+ free games are added weekly for North America, but announcements are made before the first Tuesday of the month. Not sure how it works for Europe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have no idea</p>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I started up Persona 4: Golden on the Vita. It&rsquo;s mildly addictive, because I keep wanting to maximize what I do everyday. If you haven&rsquo;t played it, it&rsquo;s a weird cross of dungeon crawling with Pokemon-like battles (elemental weaknesses, etc) and Life/Dating Sim (for the noncombat parts); the relationships you build in the noncombat parts improve the Personas (pokemon) you can use in the dungeons, the noncombat stats unlock quests that require you to farm in the dungeons, etc. I think I&rsquo;ve played some 20-30 hours since starting it around Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>

<p>You can make an NA account from anywhere, but if you plan to use credit card payments for the store, it will only accept cards with a US address. I&rsquo;m from SE Asia and I have an NA account, I use prepaid PSN cards for buying stuff.</p>
<p>Edit: and yes, if you have both the NA account and your main account on the same PS3, your main account can play downloads from the NA account.</p>
