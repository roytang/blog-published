    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1mbec5/eli5_how_do_comic_books_work_more_specifically/">&#39;ELI5: How do comic books work? More specifically, are the actions of one character &#34;linear&#34;, meaning do they have an impact in future comic books even if the series changes (like from Batman to Batman and Superman).?&#39; on /r/explainlikeimfive</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Yes, they are linear, as long as they take place in the same continuity. For example, DC currently has 52 ongoing series that all take place in the same continuity, all of these stories are canon. (Although some of them may take place in different universes, like Earth-2; but those stories are still canon since Earth-2 interacts with other universes so continuity exists between them too)</p>
<p>Often a publisher will have a number of books that are &ldquo;out of continuity&rdquo;, these stories are unrelated to their main continuity and will mostly be stand alone. Current examples for DC are &ldquo;Batman 66&rdquo; (it&rsquo;s the Adam West Batman!), &ldquo;Smallville Season Nine&rdquo; (which follows the continuity of the TV series)</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s possible for different universes to interact (i.e. characters crossing over), even those with separate continuity may interact with the main ones.</p>

Rockstar has already made the money back on pre-orders alone.&#39; on /r/todayilearned</a>:

<div class="content e-content">

<p>$265 million divided by $60, that means at least 4.5 million copies of GTAV have been pre-ordered? Number seems way high</p>

<p>If you find that it&rsquo;s really overheating, you might have to scale down the settings to avoid it, or maybe clean out your CPU case or invest in more heat sinks.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to. If you want, I&rsquo;ll just give you a summary right here.</p>
<p>[Spoiler](#s &ldquo;US Govt forms their own Justice League (JLA) to keep JL in check. Later Superman somehow loses control and accidentally kills one of the JLA members, Dr Light. The three Justice Leagues (JL, JLA and JL Dark - the magic guys) start hunting for this magic thing called Pandora&rsquo;s Box which they think can cure Superman or something, but the box radiates evil and makes them all fight one another. The leader of the Secret Society, the Outsider, makes an appearance and reveals that the box is actually a device that can open a gateway to his parallel world Earth-3. Then he uses the box to bring the Crime Syndicate of America (you might want to research them) over to our world. It is revealed that the Outsider is actually the &ldquo;Alfred&rdquo; of Earth-3 and the female Atom of the JL is actually from Earth-3 and was the one who jabbed a sliver of Kryptonite into Superman&rsquo;s brain to make him kill Dr Light, and that Cyborg&rsquo;s mech parts were actually an evil robot called Grid. Trinity War ends with the Crime Syndicate claiming this world as theirs &ldquo;)</p>
<p>If you really want to read it, reading the first (Justice League 22) and last (Justice League 23) issues are sufficient. All the rest is filler. And really, the only thing you need to know is that <a href="#s" title="there's an evil Justice League that wants to take over this world">Spoiler</a></p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember grinding too much as in fighting just for the sake of gaining levels. Are you doing the quests that will require you to backtrack through older dungeons to farm things (it doesnt feel too much like griding if you&rsquo;re farming for something else). You can go back to earlier dungeons inside the TV by talking to party members, they&rsquo;ll give you a choice to visit the dungeon where they were persona-ized (whatever).</p>
<p>Each of the older dungeons also has an additional optional boss on the top-level, I always did the optional boss of the previous dungeon (I think you get a nice item or something) before going for the boss of the current dungeon.</p>
<p>Try to bring a wide variety of personas in with you all the time, in terms of elemental attacks, so that you can always hit the enemy weak spots.</p>
<p>I would recommend backtracking for the above stuff particularly before  trying to beat Rise&rsquo;s dungeon where you are now - Rise&rsquo;s dungeon has two bosses at the end.</p>

<p>You can talk to the other party members and they&rsquo;ll bring you to the other dungeons. i.e. talking to Kanji will bring you to the dungeon where you rescued him.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>So far it&rsquo;s been 5 issues of &ldquo;hey let&rsquo;s split up into 3 different groups that don&rsquo;t make sense and go to random places together and occasionally hit each other&rdquo;. It feels like everything significant is going to happen in the sixth issue.</p>
<p>I feel like this could have been done in a single 3-issue crossover between the 3 books, instead of dragging it out over six.</p>

<p>Are you asking about the concept of comic book universes in general or about what universes Marvel has specifically?</p>
<p>Marvel has an infinite number of universes (all of them together comprise the Marvel multiverse), as opposed to DC which has only 52 universes. Each universe is usually identified by a number.</p>
<p>The main Marvel universe in which most of the Marvel comic book stories have taken place is commonly referred to as the 616 universe.</p>
<p>The other universes most active right now are the Ultimate universe for the Ultimate Comics line (I forgot the exact designation for this universe, it&rsquo;s 16xx I think) and the Marvel Cinematic Universe (I believe this is designated universe 199999) for the Iron Man/Avengers set of movies.</p>
<p>Edit: Here is a list of known Marvel universes: <a href="http://marvel.wikia.com/Multiverse/Universe_Listing">http://marvel.wikia.com/Multiverse/Universe_Listing</a></p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Procedural generation is a form of random generation; except that when you say procedural generation, you expect that there are more rules than just randomly putting any set of results together.</p>
<p>An example of procedural generation would be map generation in games like Civilization. If it were completely random, you would often see ice areas near the equator or next to desert areas or other such tile placements that make no sense. Instead it&rsquo;s procedural, there&rsquo;s certain rules followed like for each type of terrain, there&rsquo;s a given probability that it will be beside this other type of terrain, and there are other rules and algorithms to ensure things like continents or achipelagos form well.</p>
