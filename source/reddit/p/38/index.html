<p>DX:HR or the Witcher 2 would be great if possible. Some other hopefuls:  Magicka (with all DLC preferably?), Audiosurf, Shogun 2, Might and Magic Clash of Heroes, SPAZ. Please don&rsquo;t ask me how many coals I want for a game, just make an offer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also consider other games, just make an offer here.</p>
<p>Thanks :D</p>
<p>Edit: I only get to check Reddit every few hours or so, so I may not reply immediately. Cheers.</p>

<p>nope, real life is harsher. sorry dude.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not trying to discourage you, but the &ldquo;standard meta decks&rdquo; are tuned by hundreds of players regularly, that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re standard. it&rsquo;s difficult for a lone player with a rogue deck to match the level of tuning these decks have.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying you can&rsquo;t do it, there&rsquo;s a chance you&rsquo;ve hit on some interesting concept that may crush a lot of other decks out there. or maybe you&rsquo;re a deckbuilding genius savant, i dunno.</p>

<p>If those are the DLC you&rsquo;re buying, then yeah, you would have a problem. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I managed to get 2 pretty good Fallout:New Vegas DLCs for the price of those &ldquo;few guns&rdquo;</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I like the Civ DLC. I don&rsquo;t enjoy map packs, but then again I don&rsquo;t have to buy them. But I like the additional civs being added every now and then. Keeps the game fresh. In fact, I&rsquo;d like to have as many civs as possible, but I don&rsquo;t want to have to wait forever for that game. And with Steam, I never have to buy them full price, I just wait for the next big sale.</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t mind not having religion or corporations, I already have Civ4 for that. :D</p>

<li>preferably free :)</li>
<li>easy to transfer/manage lots of files including folder hierarchy (talking hundreds of files in dozens of folders here)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently using ComicFlow, but the limitation of this app is that it only supports a folder structure that is up to one folder deep.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t recommend Stanza, the file management there is terrible when you get to a larger number of files.</p>

<p>So the library guy at the college asks me to find a copy of the wolf queen v6 at the folgunthur crypt. Trouble is i&rsquo;ve already cleared this dungeon and have the book in my inventory, but i dont get the option to turn it in, and the quest marker still points to the empty chest in the crypt that i got it from. I tried putting it back in the chest (so i could pick it up again) but apparently i cant because its a quest item. Anything i can do about this?</p>

<p>I mean, if both a 3g connection and a wifi connection are available, will it use the wifi instead of the 3g?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>It&rsquo;s actually the opposite for me, i play more video games than magic as i&rsquo;ve gotten older. Mostly because most of my play group has moved away so i dont enjoy tournaments as much. I dont really play magic for the social interaction, i can get that elsewhere, and video games are way less expensive as a hobby :p</p>

<p>Stay out of the scary places for now. Try fighting aboveground things first&hellip; fiends or or radscorpions and such, so you get used to paying attention to looking at your radar (lower left corner) to be aware of nearby enemies. Also you might want to increase your perception stat so that enemies show on the radar earlier.</p>

<p>Upvotes for this. I posted the following message:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are multitouch gestures not enabled in iOS5 for iPad1? I&rsquo;ve been using them for months in developer mode without any problems so I&rsquo;m sure the hardware can handle it. Please patch it back in, this makes me want to jailbreak&rdquo;</p>
<p>No idea if it will work, but maybe if enough of us do it they&rsquo;ll take notice :D</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>I had the multitouch gestures before the update (i have developer mode) so it is quite ridiculous how ios5 disabled it for ipad1s since ive never had a problem with the feature. Either apple hates us ipad1 owners or they want to force us to upgrade. Having multitouch gestures really made the ipad a lot more usable, i will miss it greatly (and no i dont want to jailbreak~)</p>

<p>From the first issue it looks like Tim Drake and company will be establishing the Titans, does mean the previous incarnations of the team never existed in the DCNU? Cyborg heading straight to the JL seems to support this, but Red Hood and the Outlaws #1 is telling us Dick has been with Starfire before, though they can always retcon that to a non-Titans interaction</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>I havent played civ5 in a while and I thought I&rsquo;d give the latest patch a go. I find that every so often the game hangs between turns - it&rsquo;s stuck with &ldquo;Please wait&rdquo; and the mouseover message says it is waiting for other human players (it&rsquo;s a singleplayer game obviously). It&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s just taking too long to complete, it seems to be stuck in some sort of infinite loop. I left it running for 10-15 minutes at one point with no luck.</p>
<p>When i get to this state I need to load a few turns back and change a few decisions. If I just do the same things, the game will hang again.</p>
<p>Anyone encountering this? Not sure if it&rsquo;s a problem with my particular save, gonna try to start another game.</p>
