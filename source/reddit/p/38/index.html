<p>If the damage is prevented, it can&rsquo;t be redirected.</p>
<p>You can target a planeswalker as long as your spell says &ldquo;target planeswalker&rdquo; or maybe &ldquo;target permanent&rdquo;. Lightning bolt can only target creatures or players.</p>

<p>Really? Did you get that from the multiple game of the year awards it garnered? :p</p>
<p>Dunno whether bnet is &ldquo;shitty&rdquo; or not but I&rsquo;ve personally logged more than 500 games online, and I&rsquo;m no pro just a casual player mostly. Hundreds of games are ongoing at any one time on bnet, I&rsquo;m not sure under what definition of shitty that qualifies.</p>
<p>Tldr sc2 is an awesome game</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ey888/so_what_is_the_appropriate_way_to_present_a/">&#39;So, what is the appropriate way to present a website idea to a programmer?&#39; on /r/AskReddit</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>What is your purpose in presenting the website idea? Are you hiring the programmer to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Design the website? (Not just graphic design, but to flesh out the details of how your requirements can be met, like what screens will be needed, what sort of data will be stored)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement a design you already have? (In which case the design better be thorough! You wouldn&rsquo;t come up to a carpenter and just say &ldquo;Build me a shelf!&rdquo; without any details)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m not one to troll :)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that much of an FPS player so I never really got into the Half-Life series.</p>
<p>Their naming convention is weird with HL2E1 and HL2E2, I initially thought they were like parts of HL2 or something.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the definition of &ldquo;expert&rdquo; in the post that&rsquo;s throwing me off. By that definition, the only people who can be considered experts have to be playing FPS, RPGs, Platformers, and every other genre that has one of the &ldquo;must play&rdquo; video games.</p>

<p>Reddit is so pro-TF2 that I want to try it. However, I&rsquo;m in southeast asia and this news has me worried:

<p>I heard it is primarily a multiplayer game, would it still be worth it if I could not find any decent servers that give me a good ping time?</p>

<p>A newlywed couple moves into their new house. One day the husband comes home from work and his wife says, &ldquo;Honey, you know, in the upstairs bathroom one of the pipes is leaking, could you fix it?&rdquo; The husband says, &ldquo;What do I look like, Mr. Plumber?&rdquo; A few days go by, and he comes home from work and his wife says, &ldquo;Honey, the car won&rsquo;t start. I think it needs a new battery. Could you change it for me?&rdquo; He says: &ldquo;What do I look like, Mr. Goodwrench?&rdquo; Another few days go by, and it&rsquo;s raining pretty hard. The wife finds a leak in the roof. She says, &ldquo;Honey, there&rsquo;s a leak on the roof! Can you please fix it?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;What do I look like, Bob Vila?&rdquo; The next day the husband comes home, and the roof is fixed. So is the plumbing. So is the car. He asks his wife what happened. &ldquo;Oh, I had a handyman come in and fix them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Great! How much is that going to cost me?&rdquo; he snarls. Wife says: &ldquo;Nothing. He said he&rsquo;d do it for free if I either baked him a cake or slept with him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Uh, well, what kind of cake did you make?&rdquo; asks the husband. &ldquo;What do I look like,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;Betty Crocker?&rdquo;</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>You&rsquo;re going to need a whole lot more details before anyone can give you a reasonable estimate, especially from a programmer who&rsquo;s not familiar with how fantasy leagues work. Where is the data going to come from? How many players will participate? What kind of actions can they do? Will size will you need to be able to scale to? etc</p>
