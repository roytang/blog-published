<p>Hi,</p>
<p>A coworker has Etrian Odyssey IV streetpass activated on his 3ds, while I have SMT4 streetpass activated on mine. But I&rsquo;m not getting any streetpasses from him (other than Mii Plaza of course)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve downloaded from the eShop the &ldquo;Shin Megami Tensei IV Update&rdquo; released on 07/16, is this the one that enables streetpass with Etrian Odyssey IV? Or there&rsquo;s something else I have to download or install or set?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>DAE cringe at &ldquo;life points&rdquo;? :p</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re at 20, almost all damage is as we say locally &ldquo;malayo sa bituka&rdquo; (far from the gut), so I&rsquo;d almost always take the first 5 damage from the 5/3 before chump blocking. Remember, it&rsquo;s really only the final point of damage that kills you.</p>

<h4 id="posted-on-rvita-help---vita-charger-not-working-httpsredditcomrvitacomments1jfshfhelp_vita_charger_not_working">Posted on r/vita: <a href="https://reddit.com/r/vita/comments/1jfshf/help_vita_charger_not_working/">Help - Vita charger not working =(</a></h4>
<p>Hey r/vita, hope you can help me a bit.</p>
<p>I plugged in my Vita to the AC adapter before going to sleep the other day, but when I woke up the next day it hadn&rsquo;t gained any charge at all!</p>
<p>Any advice? I&rsquo;ve already checked the connections: the vita to usb cable, usb cable into the black rectangle adapter, adapter to cable, and finally the wall outlet. It looks like all the connections only go in one way too so I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve reversed anything. The only unusual thing I noticed (which I&rsquo;m not sure if this was already the case before) was that the metal part of the cable connector that plugs into the Vita doesn&rsquo;t go all the way in, as seen in this badly taken grainy picture: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ozM0QY5.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/ozM0QY5.jpg</a> It may have already been that way before, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>If I power off the Vita and plug it in to either the adapter or my PC, I don&rsquo;t get that orange light thingy on the PS button.</p>
<p>I still have around 50% charge left on the Vita though. I can probably take it to a shop to be checked in a couple of days, but I was hoping /r/vita might have some advice in the meantime!</p>
<p>Edit: Okay, I also tried connecting it via USB cable to the PS3, but Content manager was unable to connect to the USB D: So it&rsquo;s likely a faulty USB cable? Is this a common thing?</p>
<p>Update: I brought my Vita to a store and compared the USB cable to one of theirs and definitely something was wrong with my connector, so I had it replaced. The store lady said my connector might have suffered from the cable being pulled out too hard or something. Thanks for the input guys :D</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;m 30+ years old, and I play my 3ds or Vita everywhere, on the commute, when in line for anything, while waiting at a restaurant, etc. I don&rsquo;t really care what other people think. :p</p>
<p>Best story, during one of my commutes I was riding in a shuttle type thing with people sitting on every side of me and I had my DS (this was maybe half a decade ago) playing this tower defense game Ninja Town and I was in a dire situation and had to activate this power which required me to blow into the DS to activate it. To the uninitiated it must have looked really weird, but what the hell, I went ahead and blew as hard as I could into the DS that day. No fucks were given, lol</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>So, I purchased it on GMG before watching the review, might have been a good idea to do it in the reverse order. I still would have purchased it anyway.</p>
<p>Anyway, I found out from the review that this is the last expansion for civ 5? I&rsquo;m kind of disappointed because I was hoping they would implement a &ldquo;random events&rdquo; system like what they had in the last civ4 expansion. Still probably gonna spend a couple of hundred hours here though :p</p>

<p>How about copying the itunes backups to a different drive or an external HD or something, is that possible? I&rsquo;m not short on space, the problem is that the itunes library is stored on my OS folder and that&rsquo;s getting pretty low</p>

<p>I just finished The Last Of Us! Fantastic game (as everyone has been saying)</p>
<p>I also started up Infamous 2 again (I lost my save when my old PS3 hard drive had a problem, and I didn&rsquo;t have cloud saving enabled then)</p>
<p>Also doing a little BlazBlue on the Vita on the side. The missions are hard!</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>The DC universe rebooted back in September 2011, which may be causing some of your confusion. Martian Manhunter used to be a big part of one of the Jusice League incarnations before this reboot. In the current universe, he has some sort of history with the Justice League but was never a full member I think.</p>
<p>In the current universe (the new 52):</p>
<p>Justice League - team of heroes formed during the Darkseid invasion five years ago, basically kicked off an age of superheroes</p>
<p>Justice League of America - the US government (ARGUS)&rsquo;s attempt to form a counterbalance to the Justice League. Basically they want to have their own Justice League that they can control.</p>
<p>Justice League Dark - a team of magic-related heroes hanging out together for one reason or another. Unaffiliated with either the JL or the JLA</p>
