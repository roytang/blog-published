<div class="content e-content">

<p>So, I purchased it on GMG before watching the review, might have been a good idea to do it in the reverse order. I still would have purchased it anyway.</p>
<p>Anyway, I found out from the review that this is the last expansion for civ 5? I&rsquo;m kind of disappointed because I was hoping they would implement a &ldquo;random events&rdquo; system like what they had in the last civ4 expansion. Still probably gonna spend a couple of hundred hours here though :p</p>

<p>How about copying the itunes backups to a different drive or an external HD or something, is that possible? I&rsquo;m not short on space, the problem is that the itunes library is stored on my OS folder and that&rsquo;s getting pretty low</p>

<p>I just finished The Last Of Us! Fantastic game (as everyone has been saying)</p>
<p>I also started up Infamous 2 again (I lost my save when my old PS3 hard drive had a problem, and I didn&rsquo;t have cloud saving enabled then)</p>
<p>Also doing a little BlazBlue on the Vita on the side. The missions are hard!</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>The DC universe rebooted back in September 2011, which may be causing some of your confusion. Martian Manhunter used to be a big part of one of the Jusice League incarnations before this reboot. In the current universe, he has some sort of history with the Justice League but was never a full member I think.</p>
<p>In the current universe (the new 52):</p>
<p>Justice League - team of heroes formed during the Darkseid invasion five years ago, basically kicked off an age of superheroes</p>
<p>Justice League of America - the US government (ARGUS)&rsquo;s attempt to form a counterbalance to the Justice League. Basically they want to have their own Justice League that they can control.</p>
<p>Justice League Dark - a team of magic-related heroes hanging out together for one reason or another. Unaffiliated with either the JL or the JLA</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Time and effort and cost (assets, etc.) and the story all factor in. Some stories are stronger when told in a straight/linear fashion.</p>
<p>The term laziness here upsets me for some reason (nothing personal). Might be because I&rsquo;m a programmer and I understand what it means to need to cut content or features or avoid feature-creep in order to meet budgets and schedules. It&rsquo;s not like &ldquo;branching paths&rdquo; are on a standard RPG checklist and developers are just &ldquo;naw, fuck that&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That being said, there are still a lot of very nonlinear RPGs around. The Fallout series and the Elder Scrolls games come to mind, and I think the Witcher series offers a lot of choice too.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see a problem. It could be a one-way crossbuy where getting the PS3 version nets you both of the Vita versions. Heck, even if the PS3 version got you only FFX Vita, that would already be pretty sweet.</p>

<p>Well, that might take a while longer then. &ldquo;The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time.

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I always get physical for 3ds. I buy digital on Steam and PSN and the AppStore, but not on the eShop because Nintendo won&rsquo;t implement the primary advantage digital downloads for me: tying the purchase to an account so that even if something bad happens to my device I can still access the game on a future device. It&rsquo;s doubly important for handhelds!</p>
