<p>I feel like if I was younger and more trusting of state authority, there would have been a better chance of me being in favor of the death penalty. But I&rsquo;m old and wise enough to know that humans are fallible creatures, and somehow placing them in power makes them even more so, and thus we should avoid giving the state too much authority over human life.  Side note: I clicked through the link and read through the comments section a bit. Big mistake, sumakit lang ulo ko sa terrible comments</p>

<p>Finished Legends of Tomorrow S1. It wasn&rsquo;t always the best, and their time travel logic is terribly inconsistent, but I think it was a fun ride overall and finished strong with a great cliffhanger for S2. Mike Ross ftw!</p>

<p>Finished watching all 5 seasons of the BBC Merlin show. Lots of Game of Thrones actors making an appearance lol. I like how they flipped the trope of Merlin being a wise old wizard advising Arthur, but of course the series ending was way too predictable (it can&rsquo;t be helped given the Arthurian legend)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an indication of narrow mindedness that BBM supporters don&rsquo;t understand where Leni&rsquo;s votes are coming from. It&rsquo;s a dictatorial mindset that doesn&rsquo;t understand that people can have other POVs outside of their personal echo chambers</p>

<p>In addition to improving education on Martial Law history, maybe we should also seriously consider adding the following to the high school curriculum:</p>
<ul>
<li>basic logic and reasoning</li>
<li>different types of fallacies</li>
<li>how to do basic research</li>
<li>how to verify whether something is true</li>
<li>how to verify whether a source is reliable</li>
<li>how to to identify satire and/or sarcasm</li>
<li>basic concepts of statistics</li>
<li>how to articulate your arguments well (I think the Eng/Fil subject in HS curriculum covers only literature and not any sort of communication skill)</li>
<li>how to debate and argue without taking things personally</li>
<li>basic concepts of economics</li>
<li>proper usage of memes</li>
<li>when it is appropriate to post spoilers</li>
</ul>
<p>Can someone forward this to Tesdaman? Thanks! Lol</p>

<p>So, after all that weighing of pros and cons of the different candidates, I might be the only idiot who accidentally voted #abstain4president. It wasn&rsquo;t any glitch in the machine or the ballot, just a glitch in the user. After standing in a hot queue for one hour, I took my ballot and sat down. I decided to skip the President slot first and just come back to it later since I was undecided, then filled in VP, Party-List and Senators. I decided to just skip the local candidates altogether and submitted my ballot and only realized my mistake when the scanner said UNDERVOTE for president. Oh well, I guess it was my destiny to abstain after all haha. I leave the rest to you guys!</p>

<p>For my pro-Duterte friends, I have a survey. I&rsquo;m not going to try to change your minds, but which of the following views do you hold (EJK = extra judicial killings):</p>
<ol>
<li>I think there are no EJKs in Davao</li>
<li>(removed - don&rsquo;t answer this, see comment below)</li>
<li>I think there are EJKs in Davao, but the authorities/the mayor are not involved</li>
<li>I think that those allegedly killed by EJKs were killed by authorities in legitimate operations or self-defense</li>
<li>I think there are EJKs in Davao, and the authorities are involved, but it&rsquo;s okay because:<br>
a. They&rsquo;re criminals and they deserve it<br>
b. Going through the judicial system takes too long<br>
c. Hindi naman ako affected<br>
d. It is an acceptable price to pay for peace and order/progress<br>
e. winawarningan naman muna sila</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t want to think about it kasi wala naman akong first-hand info</li>
<li>Something else (feel free to explain)</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are uncomfortable giving your answer in public, feel free to PM me</p>

<p>Captain America Civil War spoiler-free review:</p>
<ul>
<li>great fight sequences, start to finish</li>
<li>the newcomers were great, airport big fight sequence had a great surprise (and not the one you already saw in the trailer - although you might have already been spoiled if you pay attention to certain toy lines), although I feel like a couple of the characters were pulled in to the conflict in a way that was a bit weak, but it&rsquo;s still pretty good overall</li>
<li>the plot was ok. Justification for the civil war was ok. Some surprises. The villain motivation was slightly mediocre, but that wasn&rsquo;t really the focus of the movie anyway</li>
<li>Martin Freeman&rsquo;s role felt totally superfluous - it did not seem necessary to cast Martin Freeman</li>
<li>the movie kind of ends with the MCU and the Avengers in a weird place, some people might not like it</li>
<li>better than: Winter Soldier. The plot kind of develops in the same way but everything is on a much bigger scale now</li>
<li>there are two post-credit scenes, one in the middle and one at the very end</li>
<li>Imax worth it? Probably. Not very ostentatious use of 3d, but most of the fight sequences have it. You might get dizzy if you&rsquo;re not used to it</li>
<li>Magugustuhan ba ni Mama? Maybe, but I&rsquo;d have to keep explaining who these characters are</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, I watched the whole video. I know that he&rsquo;s a brave son of a bitch willing to let himself take the place of hostages and that he killed all the rapists. Hooray for him.</p>
<p>No, I still don&rsquo;t want him to be president. I wouldn&rsquo;t want Rambo to be president either. But that&rsquo;s me. If you&rsquo;re voting for him, that&rsquo;s fine, ikaw bahala. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean tatanggapin mo na lang na hindi nya kailangan mag-apologize. Hint: Pwede mag-acknowledge ng flaws and still vote for him..</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t excuse the rape joke. It doesn&rsquo;t excuse trivializing rape. Saying na ganun talaga magsalita ang mga lalaki trivializes rape (I hope I don&rsquo;t have to say this, but hindi ako ganun magsalita). It trivializes rape. Saying that your rival candidate is not rapeable trivializes rape. Saying that heroic deeds excuse rape jokes trivializes rape. Claiming that he said it in anger doesn&rsquo;t excuse it (it makes it worse). Repeating the joke for cheap laughs during political gatherings? Trivializes rape.</p>
<p>Saying the other canddiates have also said terrible if not worse things does not excuse it.</p>
<p>What would have been a better response? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for my poor choice of words. I&rsquo;m sorry for repeating those words during political rallies. Rape is never a laughing matter, no matter what the context. Real men should never look at any woman with thoughts of rape. I ask all my supporters not to speak this way about women. I will try not to speak this way again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not going to get that response. That&rsquo;s the kind of person he is.</p>
