I remember the atmosphere at UP around the time of the infamous second evelope at Erap&rsquo;s trial. Even the normally apathetic Engineering students were being woken out of their political stupor by outrage at the turn of events by the Estrada-friendly senators.

Should I get a Hipster PDA? I&rsquo;m thinking about it. Or something similar.
Not really for organizing tasks and stuff. Only for jotting down temporary things when away from a computer. So I can remember them later. I often think up incredibly clever world-shaking ideas while commuting, it would be nice to remember all of them.
I still largely prefer the advantages of electronic storage: cut/paste functionality, easy to make backups/copies, distribution, easily searchable etc.

One word: Suxxor.
Well, not really. It&rsquo;s okay I guess. When I first heard they were making a Fantastic Four movie, my first reaction was, &ldquo;Uh&hellip; that can&rsquo;t be good.&rdquo;
The plot is barely servicable&hellip; the thing that really made me think &ldquo;suxxor&rdquo; was how Victor von Doom&rsquo;s role was handled. I mean, in the comics, Doom was a monarch, ruler of Latveria. He wasn&rsquo;t a madman bent on revenge. He was a madman bent on world domination!

I was going to ahead and break my blog silence on the whole Gloriagate thing, but I realized I should read the whole transcript at PCIJ first, boring as it is. That way, I can at least say I&rsquo;m basing my opinions on known facts unlike roughly 90% of the rest of the participants in this debacle.
I went through it in about thirty minutes, skimming most and picking out only the parts that seemed most interesting, and skipping anything that was too vague or that I didn&rsquo;t strictly understand the mechanics of.

Radio is so primitive. You can&rsquo;t skip songs, you can&rsquo;t get to listen to a single track repeatedly, you can&rsquo;t jump to random tracks, you can&rsquo;t listen to only artists that have songs about Superman. Listening to random music some random guy thinks you will like, with no guarantee of whether he actually knows your taste or not. Granted, you can increase that likelihood by listening to the right station, but unless we had one station for every person, it&rsquo;s impossible for the radio station to fully satisfy your tastes.

Awesome. Definitely better than the all the other Batman movies. This movie is no kids&rsquo; movie either. The movie is less about Batman&rsquo;s crimefighting adventures and more about Bruce Wayne&rsquo;s journey from being a angry, confused rich orphan to the billionaire playboy/costumed vigilante popularized by the earlier films.
The movie captures the essence of Batman&rsquo;s character perfectly. It&rsquo;s all about fear — Bruce overcoming his fear of bats and eventually turning that fear into a symbol to strike terror into the hearts of criminals.

Some comments on the Yahoo webapps.
 The next/previous links on top of Yahoo mail messages are confusing. I&rsquo;m not sure if they take me up or down the mail-list. Gmail is better, since it explicitly says &ldquo;older&rdquo; and &ldquo;newer&rdquo;; With Yahoo, I&rsquo;m always wrong when I guess. After some experimenting, I figure it out. &ldquo;Next&rdquo; and &ldquo;Previous&rdquo; are based on the sort order in the list of messages. Since the default is sorted by date descending (newest first), &ldquo;Next&rdquo; corresponds to Yahoo&rsquo;s &ldquo;older&rdquo; by default.

Download recordings of alleged destabilization tape &ndash; INQ7.net
Transcript at PCIJ blog
I don&rsquo;t do much politics, but for those out of the loop, the government has recently released some tapes of conversations allegedly edited to make it look like the President has been participating in electoral fraud.
I&rsquo;m actually more interested in the tech part of this &ndash; these are supposedly mobile phone taps, so I guess they should have come from the mobile service provider?

I should&rsquo;ve thought of this as soon as I got DSL: I went ahead and downloaded Transformers the Movie.
Transformers was of course, the epitome of my youth. Unlike most other guy kids, I preferred the Transformers to G.I. Joe. I guess I preferred high-tech fantasy over soliders back then, with the war of the heroic Autobots and the Evil Decepticons appealing more to my young mind than soldiers trying to fight terrorists.

We saw Revenge of the Sith at the Gateway mall in Cubao. It&rsquo;s less than a year old, and it&rsquo;s target audience is a higher class than the usual malls. It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s trying to be something like the Podium, which makes it a bit out of place in Cubao. The mall is good anyway, as you&rsquo;d expect. Not my type of place to hang out, but has the comforts you&rsquo;d expect of such a mall&hellip; clean, not much of a crowd, and people greeting you when you get off the taxi.

The circle is now complete. The whole tale has been told. Revenge of the Sith completes Lucas&rsquo; space opera. And the Force is strong in this one.
Highly enjoyable movie, if you take the time to push away your inner critic and look past the spotty acting, the so-so dialogue, and all the little flaws and inconsistencies you spot throughout the movie. Get past all of that, and it&rsquo;s a decent enough ride, and a fitting conclusion to the Star Wars epic.

Yeah, so I guess I&rsquo;m hypertensive. I get dizzy occasionally, and today I decided to pass by the Clinic to consult about it. My BP reading was a 150/110! The highest reading I&rsquo;ve had, ever. I hope it&rsquo;s not too serious though. Will find out soon.
I don&rsquo;t really mind not being 100% healthy, and taking maintenance medicine could hurt a bit in the pocket (although I don&rsquo;t care much for money) What I don&rsquo;t like about not being healthy is the diet.

<div class="content p-summary">
Just saw a segment on Oprah where Oprah helped a 15-year old girl realize her wildest dream &ndash; to meet Ashton Kutcher.
Is must be nice to have a lifetime dream so easy to achieve. Oprah&rsquo;s job is nice too. She finds some poor little girl whose dream is to meet a B-list Hollywood celebrity. Wow, how hard was it for her to fulfill that?
Seriously, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s great, it&rsquo;s sweet that Oprah&rsquo;s doing this for the kid, who has some sort of vision-related medical problem.

One of my officemates is now a proud father-to-be! I&rsquo;d be extremly happy for him, if not for the fact that he has to take a week off to attend to his family matters, and now I have to take up his workload. And just one day after I had finally managed to catch up to my own schedule!
I expect to be in crunch mode for a week at least.

<div class="content p-summary">
A while back, inspired by the CSS Zen Garden, I modified my Blogger template to use entirely CSS-based design. That is, I can know update the layout instantly simply by replacing the stylesheet file used by template (like now!)
The new layout uses up a wider screen space, but I think it&rsquo;s neat. The lighter colors are easier on my tired, computer-strained eyes. Hopefully, this new CSS-based design allows me to do more experimentation and improve my ability to design web UIs.

Haven&rsquo;t read Robert Jordan in a while. Someone gave me Crossroads of Twilight as a gift, so I read it and hope that his pacing has improved. It has not. He writes well enough, dialogue is nice, descriptions are more than adequate, but I expect some things to happen in his books! He has so many plots running at once, he should at least resolve two or three per book. Perrin, Mat and Elayne get a lot of chapters, but they barely get anything done.

Pimp My Rig is a hardware review side associated with a friend of mine from high school. Yes, I was asked to help promote it. 😀
I haven&rsquo;t worried about hardware issues in a while, since I usually ask my kid brother to handle most hardware purchases/setup at home. So, I don&rsquo;t really know much about the latest and greatest hardware but this site looks helpful enough to be given a try, especially if you&rsquo;re the sort who enjoys putting together his own PC.

I only had three tasks laid out for me this weekend:
  Watch season 4 of X-men Evolution. I realize that X-men Evo was not as popular as some of the other superhero series such as Justice League and Teen Titans, but I mostly like it anyway. It&rsquo;s more of a light-hearted version of the X-men universe , really. (Presidential hopeful Senator Kelly of canon is merely Mayoral hopeful Principal Kelly here!

One thing about spending a free day at home. The temperature in my room gets really high during the afternoon, it&rsquo;s quite uncomfortable. Especially since I&rsquo;m used to wasting away most of my daylight hours in an airconditioned office.
It&rsquo;s good to spend a couple of days away from the office though &ndash; God only knows I&rsquo;ve been so damn uninspired with work lately. For the past two weeks or so, I haven&rsquo;t had much heart for my work.

Smart and complex, you always love a new intellectual challenge.
Your biggest pet peeve is people who slow you down with trivial chit chat.

<div class="content p-summary">
Some weirdness today.
Around 4PM, word spread through the office that some sort of psychic nun had predicted an intensity nine earthquake today at 5PM. (This fantastic prediction came through SMS of course. Despite my not having a cellphone, I am not outside its&rsquo; influence.) Since we work on a rather high floor, an earthquake would be very bad ™ from us. Of course, nobody took it seriously, although I suspect some wanted to take the opportunity to dodge some work.

Well, I thought I&rsquo;d write about Suikoden IV before I forgot all about it. I finished it around Holy Week, but haven&rsquo;t bothered to go through again, even though I promised myself I would try since I did not get the magic number of a hundred and eight stars of destiny this time around. Curse my pride for not reading any FAQs while playing! Time is short, with work and all, so I should make the most of my games so I don&rsquo;t need to re-play them.

Wordpress host &ndash; free blog
I&rsquo;ve wanted to try WordPress for a while now, but not having easy access to a PHP-enabled server of my own, I haven&rsquo;t had the chance.
Blogsome is a new, free service that provides WordPress for blogging. I signed up, and roy.blogsome.com was still available (nothing there, don&rsquo;t bother looking)
Am I going to leave blogger? I don&rsquo;t know, really, I&rsquo;m already pretty comfortable with it already, and moving to WordPress means learning a while new templating language (I know it would take all of an hour to get it down, but still&hellip; inertia).

I&rsquo;m not much into FPS titles, but over the past couple of weeks, my bro Alvin and I have been playing the occasional game of CTF or Zones in Timesplitters III (via split screen on one TV of course.) The last time I got into an FPS game multiplayer was when Mon, Dave, Paul and I would do a four-way splitscreen on a single TV with the PS port of Quake 2.

Speaking of my high school batchmates&rsquo; earth-shaking accomplishments, props to Neil Simon Silva for getting 9th place in the recent bar exams.
Congrats as well to new attorneys Chris Bolastig and Ly-an Carlos.
Jeesh. It&rsquo;s getting harder and harder to keep up with my batchmates. When will I accomplish something that will land me in the papers? Or maybe I should stop being so competitive? =p

The Gender Genie
Apparently, according to this handy web tool, I write like a girl, or at least I do when my posts exceed 500 words. How embarassing! Apparently I should be using more masculine words like &ldquo;the&rdquo;, &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;something&rdquo; rather than feminine words like &ldquo;but&rdquo; and &ldquo;actually&rdquo;!
Noted!

I was back in Pisay today, to attend my brother&rsquo;s graduation. He&rsquo;s the last of us, three brothers who all went through Pisay. I&rsquo;ve never seen the pool up close before today. It doesn&rsquo;t look very deep.
I&rsquo;m incoherent. It might be because I&rsquo;ve been reading the Sluggy Freelance archives since I got home.
The graduation ceremony was mostly boring. I think most are, unless you&rsquo;re one of the graduates. Or one of the graduates&rsquo; parents.

[Originally posted to the GameFAQs message boards]
Now, there are rude and annoying people everywhere, especially on the internet. And normally, I don&rsquo;t care, I just ignore them. On battle.net, I just let them be, and keep on playing. Every so often however, some guy comes along who just pisses me off completely.
So I play random 3v3, right? It&rsquo;s not the most &ldquo;skillful&rdquo; type of battles, but it&rsquo;s fun and I enjoy it.

As it may mention in the page title, I&rsquo;m currently screwing around with the blogger template, so this blog may look a bit&hellip; um&hellip; screwy for a while.
I&rsquo;ve been wanting to toy around with Javascript hacks to extend the Blogger template functionality. The first thing I did was add some Javascript that allows you to show/hide individual posts on the page. But actually, I don&rsquo;t really like it, I&rsquo;ll remove it later.

I seem to be slightly more alert in the morning and a bit more agressive throughout the day with less sleep (around 6 hours). Taking eight or more hours of sleep seems to leave me slightly laid-back for the rest of the day. I&rsquo;m trying to be more aware of my sleep dependencies, as I&rsquo;m probably going to have to work 12-hour days for a while (maybe up to the end of April) :(

A while back I blogged about Bob Ong&rsquo;s first book. A short while after, I also picked up his next two books, Bakit Baliktad Magbasa ng Libro Ang Mga Pilipino? (Why Do Filipinos Read Backwards?) and Ang Paboritong Libro ni Hudas (Judas&rsquo; Favorite Book).
&ldquo;Bakit Baligtad&rdquo; focuses on the Philippines, its people, its quirks and its problems. &ldquo;Paboritong Libro&rdquo; is a lot harder to classify, as it jumps across several topics, with the unifying theme being the chapters named after anagrams of the seven deadly sins.

No seriously, I don&rsquo;t remember having received any before.
Edit: Okay, it&rsquo;s the first one that I actually received in my inbox. I don&rsquo;t actually know if Yahoo or Gmail&rsquo;s filters killed one before i saw it.

Currently listening to &ldquo;Boulevard of Broken Songs&rdquo;, a neat mashup mainly of Green Day&rsquo;s &ldquo;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&rdquo; and Oasis&rsquo; &ldquo;Wonderwall&rdquo;. This and some other mashups here. (haven&rsquo;t listened to the others though&hellip; )
Another interesting mashup that came out quite a while back was &ldquo;This Is How You Remind Me Someday&rdquo; , where Nickelback is caught basically reusing the same chords for two songs. Great stuff.
Other songs/bands I&rsquo;ve been listening to lately:

The last Zelda game I played (as in, to the end) was Link To The Past, and I think it was on David&rsquo;s old SNES. Or it may have been on ZSNES, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure anymore. Before that was the first Zelda, which I actually finished on its original console!
Seems that the years have been kind to the Zelda formula: Octoroks and Tektites on the world map, Bats, Skeletons and Wizrobes underground, Boomerangs and Arrows to throw about, Pieces of Heart to collect, Swords, Bottles, hidden passages, name it, it&rsquo;s all here.

Bomb blasts rock Davao, General Santos, Makati &ndash; INQ7.net
 Makati City, three people were killed while at least 20 others were injured after an explosion rocked a bus plying EDSA as it passed underneath the Metro Rail Transit&rsquo;s Ayala Station, Metro Manila police chief Director Avelino Razon Jr. said.
 What a way to celebrate Valentine&rsquo;s day. And here I was just blogging about security issues. (Although looks like this incident wasn&rsquo;t actually in the MRT.

Optical media and the MRT/LRT
I&rsquo;m pretty sure what is described in the above blog post (confiscation of unlabelled optical media from LRT/MRT commuters) is obviously stupid, though probably not illegal. The rail authorities can probably refuse entry to anyone for any reason they consider valid.
It&rsquo;s probably legal, but I doubt it&rsquo;s enforceable though. Anyone who&rsquo;s ridden the MRT during rush hours knows what I&rsquo;m talking about. Security inspections last roughly half a second for every three passengers; the security personnel will simply make a quick pass through your bags with their stick.

GearLive: Why Sony&rsquo;s PSP will suck
I&rsquo;m not actually particularly interested in the PSP, but this article is interesting and has quickly convinced me that the PSP will in fact, suck.
As a handheld platform, I think it&rsquo;s pretty hard to beat the GBA. I&rsquo;m already thinking of buying one, as it would give me access to all those great Nintendo franchises [1] in their pure 2D forms, without me having to buy a different console.

I tried to play two PS2 games today: Spiderman 2 and Naruto &ndash; Narutimate Hero 2. I knew we had pirated copies of both.
Spiderman 2 &ndash; failed. The PS2 wouldn&rsquo;t even play the disc. Instead it made a wonderful churning noise that made me quickly hit the eject button. This is Sony&rsquo;s best form of copy protection: In my experience, our PS2 can only play somewhere between 30% &ndash; 50% of all pirated discs out there.
