Note to self: Don&rsquo;t forget to check out the games at Liberated Games
sometime in the future. They host commercial games which have been released for free to the public&hellip; some with source code. I mean, c&rsquo;mon, they apparently have the source code for Star Control 2! (I say apparently because their download page seems to have a problem right now, hence I will get back to it later.)

&ldquo;Life-changing events&rdquo;&hellip; one would think I&rsquo;m about to speak of something like a natural disaster, getting married or quitting my job, something that would create a profound change in my life.
No, I&rsquo;m going to talk about something a bit less dramatic, but it has had a profound effect on me nonetheless. I don&rsquo;t talk about these things that often, but hey, what use is a blog if you can&rsquo;t use it as an outlet, right?

 First up, the Kingdom of Loathing, it&rsquo;s an online Stickman RPG! It&rsquo;s MMO (well, not really massive), it&rsquo;s wacky, and you can be a pastamancer! It currently amuses me&hellip; and I hate waiting to get more turns! My account there is &ldquo;hungry roy&rdquo; It&rsquo;s Quentin Tarantino&rsquo;s diary!

Spent some cash this weekend. First thing was a 256 Mb Kingston flash drive. Nothing too complicated, just something to transfer MP3s to and from work with. =)
Next up was a digital camera. A Kodak CX6330 to be exact. We had been planning to buy one for a while. Pics? Not now. Funny story though. There was this promo where we could get a P5000 discount (less than US$100) if we could show a receipt for P200 worth of Pampers (a local brand of baby diapers)&hellip; so I had to explain to people why in the world I was carrying around some diapers&hellip;

RP troop pullout not cowardice, at least not according to Malacanang. The whole world knows by now that the Philippine government has capitulated (or intends to, at least) to the demands of terrorists kidnappers holding Filipino truck driver Angelo dela Cruz hostage.

I&rsquo;m not particularly fond of internet quizzes that attempt to plunk you down into a category &ndash; but sometimes they&rsquo;re damn accurate. Take this one for example. My results are:
 You are an SEDF&ndash;Sober Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you an evil genius. You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your tasks. With luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving your intellect, rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting.

I suppose everyone and their mother has had a chance to voice their opinions on Spiderman 2 by now, so here&rsquo;s mine: Some parts are hokey, some parts are cheesy, some parts are gratuitous Hollywood crap, it has quite a few inconsistencies and plot holes but overall, it&rsquo;s a hell of a ride, and I found it considerably more ‘fun&rsquo; than the first one. That being said, I&rsquo;m not entirely excited about the Goblin making an obvious comeback in Spiderman 3, but the only other Spidey nemesis worthy of being in a movie would be Venom&hellip; and bringing alien symbiotes in the equation would completely change the feel of the movies.

Maniac Mansion Deluxe
is a 256-color remake of the original Maniac Mansion, done by a group calling themselves LucasFan Games. I&rsquo;m not sure how legal this is, but hey, it&rsquo;s Maniac Mansion!
Any adventure gamer worth his salt knows about the Mansion and Dave&rsquo;s efforts to save his girlfriend Sandy from Dr. Fred and the evil meteor. The great thing about Maniac Mansion (or not so great, maybe), is that unlike later adventure games, your kids can die, you can accidentally blow up the mansion and you can get work yourself into an unsolvable situation.

Yup, it&rsquo;s a Japanese-only PS2 game based on the currently popular Naruto anime/manga. If you&rsquo;re not aware of Naruto, it&rsquo;s pretty much like Dragonball Z, except with better animation, actual reasons for fighting, and ninjas instead of aliens. It tells the story of a young boy in the Hidden Village of Konoha, cursed with being the living incarnation of a feared nine-tailed demon fox spirit. Simple enough eh?
The game itself is cool; it&rsquo;s one-on-one fighting featuring characters from the anime/manga.

&hellip; that disgraceful slow-count of an election canvass that is. I can&rsquo;t help but wonder whether anyone actually bothered to follow the last few days of the canvassing on TV&hellip; I mean, the proceedings are boring as hell! You know what would have been better for the country as a whole? When I saw a small portion of it, the only thing I could think of was that we should have WWE&rsquo;s The Rock on the National Board of Canvassers!

<div class="content p-summary">
Literally translated as &ldquo;I dare you to touch his ear&rdquo;, the phrase is commonly used by elementary school boys prior to starting a fight. It&rsquo;s similar to the more well-known Western scenario where one boy draws a line across the sand and goes &ldquo;I dare you to cross this line&rdquo; This phrase came to me today because we were talking to two girls (well okay, ladies) at work today and they weren&rsquo;t familiar with the phrase or it&rsquo;s usage.

As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, I was sent to HK a couple of weeks back, for the rollout of a project I&rsquo;ve been involved with for about a year and a half. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s right for me to be talking about the project here, so I won&rsquo;t delve into any specifics. I will however, bore you all with stories from my first trip anywhere remotely far from home.

God, it feels good to be goofing off. After having to spend six days in HK (well, more like five-and-a-half, more on that later) and then proceeding to conduct SQL training sessions for the latest batch of recruits, I was kinda tired and stressed out from work. Good thing I had the common sense to file for two days leave after the elections last Monday; don&rsquo;t have to come in &lsquo;til tomorrow.

I&rsquo;m not sure yet. I obviously don&rsquo;t have much time to maintain it. I&rsquo;d like pretty much to have a &ldquo;professional&rdquo; website, with the domain name and everything, but I&rsquo;m afraid it would fall into misuse as well. Arrr&hellip; .I&rsquo;ll figure something out.

Yup. This week, for the first time ever, I&rsquo;m leaving the country, and flying down to HK to provide support for the rollout of the project I&rsquo;ve been with for the past year and a half. First time to leave the country, and I&rsquo;m gonna be flying alone to a country where people speak a language I can recognize but not understand. I&rsquo;m understandably a bit freaked out; who wouldn&rsquo;t be, right?

I hate KOTOR. Not because it&rsquo;s a bad game, in fact it&rsquo;s the exact opposite. It&rsquo;s a fantastic game. With the unfortunate side effect that everything else gets pushed back so I cam play some more. This was actually the first time I&rsquo;d done some serious &lsquo;net surfing since I borrowed David&rsquo;s KOTOR copy. Here&rsquo;s my take on it in a post to RPG-Skies:
 This game is fantastic! I borrowed my friend&rsquo;s copy after he finished it, so I only started it last week, but it&rsquo;s already eaten up a lot of my (non-work) time.

Seeing as how Cheese (the machine I bought in March) broke down for the umpteenth time, I finally decided to buy a second computer, and went out and bought a new machine (code-name: Barbecue) the day before Christmas. Spent less than I had expected, but the machine is pretty decent, except my video card is a measly 64Mb GeForce2. I&rsquo;ll probably post the specs later. Finished Final Fantasy X-2, at 67% story completion (Yeah I suck&hellip;) Maybe I&rsquo;ll post a review of it later.

I got it same time as FFX-2. However, I can&rsquo;t get it to run&hellip; when I choose &ldquo;Game&rdquo; from the launcher, I just get the little spinning disc cursor for a while, then nothing. I&rsquo;ve tried most of the stuff found in the accompanying troubleshooting doc, and I&rsquo;ve sent Lucasarts a plea for help, but no response so far. Any help?
Actually I had the same problem with Neverwinter Nights when I first got it, and I was able to work that out by downloading the most recent patch.

I&quot;m about two or three hours into it. I like it. But then again, I like anything with a job system and learnable abilities. I find myself excited at the prospect of learning abilities with weird names such as &ldquo;Cheap Shot&rdquo;, &ldquo;Initiative&rdquo;, &ldquo;Flametongue&rdquo; and &ldquo;Silent Samba&rdquo;!
The game itself has a very &ldquo;happy&rdquo; feel&hellip; the battles are fast-paced and the general mood is upbeat. If you came in looking for a Final Fantasy game, you&rsquo;re gonna be disappointed.

Since I got Windows XP a little less than a year ago, I&rsquo;ve tried looking around for cheap (read: free) ways to customize the interface. I did eventually find some solutions, but after trying a nice chrome theme for a while, I eventually went back to the default XP look. Why? I realize now, I like the Luna interface. It&rsquo;s neat. It&rsquo;s one of the best things to come out of Microsoft in eight years.

I&rsquo;m alive, I think.
 Last Saturday, I helped an old man cross a very dangerous street! This may seem a weird thing to report, but it felt unusual enough to be helping a complete stranger. I&rsquo;m not saying I don&rsquo;t normally help complete strangers, but I rarely see people helping old people cross the street!
 I&rsquo;m thinking of getting a domain name and paid webhosting&hellip; there&rsquo;s this host that&rsquo;s cheap and local&hellip; .

So I saw Matrix: Revolutions last Friday. Nice movie, entertaining to watch, but it&rsquo;s not as deep as you&rsquo;d expect, and the Matrix trilogy really ends not with a bang but with a whisper. I like this review, it analyzes things very well.
 I feel like quitting Warcraft III for a while — maybe a couple of weeks. I&rsquo;m not really getting any better at it, and I&rsquo;m a bit bored with it now.

W3chart &ndash; seems to be a Warcraft 3 utility of sorts. I hear it can measure your APM, if you like that sort of thing. I&rsquo;m still downloading it, so haven&rsquo;t tried it yet.

Things are flaky. Have setup this blogger thing to publish to the fateback account (roytang.sinfree.net), seems to be working fine now. Ressurrected one of the older page layouts and added the pandaren brewmaster! Anyway, I&rsquo;ll also probably most of the website stuff from topcities to fateback, seeing as how topcities has gotten crappy lately with the FTP problem. That is all, back to work&hellip;

Whee&hellip; holiday. For those not from the Philippines, All Saints Day and All Souls Day are non-working holidays for us, and the roads are generally jammed anywhere near cemeteries as Filipinos flock to the graveyards to remember their deceased loved ones. Sadly, since my folks are out of town, and I have no idea how to get to the resting place of my grandparents without them, all I can do is say a prayer for them right here.

Yesterday, at around 6 PM, as I was winding up the day&rsquo;s work, we received a request from the user that they wanted some maintenance work done on one of the more obscure programs. And they needed it the next day! And we still had to have a meeting (we had originally scheduled the meeting for 3:00PM but had to keep pushing it due to stuff coming up) I wanted to reach out across the internet and slap whoever made the maintenance request on the head.

&ldquo;If history is to change, let it change!
If the world is to be destroyed, so be it!
If my fate is to die, I must simply laugh.&rdquo;
&ndash; Magus, Chrono Trigger
 For as long as I have known about it, I have always liked this quote. It speaks of a certain ferocity, a certain stubbornness, a firm, unbending belief that whatever life throws at you, you will be able to not only handle it, but laugh in the face of its absurdity.

I turned 24 yesterday.
Generally uneventful birthday, as usual. I&rsquo;m glad I got the whining done in the last post. Spent the night before at David&rsquo;s (whose birthday is a couple of days before mine). Dave, Mon and I played approximately seven hours of CvS2, watched a Jet Li flick then played around eight hours of Warcraft III. WC3 is the bomb! (And it further highlights my craving for a new computer) Anyway, went home the next morning, got some sleep.

I&rsquo;m pissed off.
Today I went to Ortigas for a job interview with a nameless IT company where my cousin Rachel works. I was quite optimistic too — the position was for a &ldquo;Java Trainee.&rdquo; I was more than willing to be trained, and a trainee position meant you didn&rsquo;t have to be proficient in Java right? Turns out I was wrong. =( Apparently they needed someone with some experience in Java, preferably with a project or two under his belt.

Don't that just beat all? - Rei, Breath of Fire III I recently had a talk with my uncle. Tito Ferry is the head of ePeople, an IT consultancy that handles projects for the government. My mom had me meet with him hoping he could give me some job-hunting advice. He says that the best thing to do would be to specialize in something like network engineering, 'coz that's where big bucks are, or something.

Sometimes my still being unemployed depresses me greatly (Although my periods of depression typically last no more than thirty minutes.)
The biggest problem in my job-hunting woes is the fact that the type of job I want varies greatly from what I have training in. I want to be involved in IT or programming, but I don&rsquo;t have a lot of the skills necessary to succeed in those fields. I will probably always regret not shifting to Computer Science or even Computer Engineering early on in college.

Well I finally decided to start a full-blown web journal. I used to keep one some years ago — I think it greatly helped me develop my english skills. Or not. Anyway, I tend to run my mouth off for paragraphs at a time anyway, and so many things run through my head at any given time it probably makes sense to put down at least some of it on paper (or in a computer at least.

First off, I haven&rsquo;t finished the game yet, I&rsquo;m somewhere in Chapter 5. I stopped playing the game a month or so ago out of sheer irritation.
For the uninitiated, H:RBE is a tactical RPG for the PSX, released during the last year the PSX. The game is similar in some respects to games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre, with an emphasis on turn-based squad-level combats. Unlike FFT and TO&rsquo;s similar Active Time system, H:RBE uses a system called RAP, where each character can perform as many actions as he wants provided he still has the RAP gauge to pay for it.

I stood there wordlessly, inching my way through the unending mass of people. There must have been several hundred people crammed into less than two hundred square meters of mall area, interspersed with some twenty cubicles filled with various displays and banners. What madness is this you ask? What product could be so enticing that hundreds of otherwise sane people to participate in such a gathering, jostling for space and risking being elbowed, stepped on or maybe even pick pocketed?

Hey, we have cable again! Okay, so we never actually _lost_ cable, but it felt like we had, back when the Star network withdrew its channels from Home Cable around six months ago. Now they&rsquo;re back, which means I once again get to watch Simpsons, Futurama and Whose Line Is It Anyway? =)
In other news, I&rsquo;m still unemployed and cashless. =(

So the ECE board exams are now over. Six months (okay three) of hard work and preparation (well alright, occasionally glancing at my books) and what do we get? A bunch of questions chosen seemingly at random. The Math and Electronics parts were good enough actually, and I felt pretty confident there. The second day was bad. The Communications exam might as well have been a random set of questions about cookie dough and displacer beasts.
