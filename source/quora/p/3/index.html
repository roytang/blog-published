<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Hacking at its most simple consists of knowing what vulnerabilities to test for in an application deployment.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Vulnerabilities can happen at multiple levels, not just at the application level. If you are already confident that your own account is secure from most forms of hacking (not just SQL injection, but also including brute force attacks, username/password enumeration, cross-site scripting, man-in-the-middle attacks, etc), then the next step is making sure your deployment is secure. Check for out of of date web server/container versions, known vulnerabilities in the deployed versions, exposed ports, exposed admin urls, that kind of thing.</p></span></p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">This will largely depend on the implementation of the servlet container. It will be called whenever the servlet container deallocates the servlet instance. The servlet spec does not specify when this should happen. The servlet instance may be active for the entire duration that the servlet container is up, or it may deallocate instances earlier for performance purposes</p></span></p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Often it will be a matter of differences in experiences and perspectives. Typically, people scoring high on IQ tests are more used to thinking out of the box or approaching problems from different perspectives, enabling them to see more possible solutions than people with a narrower focus. Also, practice matters. If you are more used to solving different kinds of problems, you will have more experience to draw on when approaching a new kind of problem, and problems that are similar to ones you have encountered before will be much easier.</p></span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-people-make-amends/answer/Roy-Tang">Why can&rsquo;t people make amends?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">There are many reasons, but the most common is probably pride. They don&rsquo;t want to admit that maybe they were wrong or at least partially responsible for any rift. This pride may manifest in making up reasons not to make amends (&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need him, etc&rdquo;)</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">That being said, there are valid reasons for letting go of a friendship and not bothering to make amends. One is if a friendship is not good/healthy for you, for example if the friend is a bad influence, or he is always hurting you and taking advantage of you. In such cases, not making amends and just letting go of the friendship is understandable</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The answer to that depends entirely on you - do you think the point of life is just to eat, go to bars and have fun? Do you think there&rsquo;s more to life than that?</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Do what you want and enjoy life, but maybe try not to burn up or use up all your resources, money, etc. People can change and mellow with age, and maybe at a later date your priorities will change and you will wish you had saved just a bit more money.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">When there is no index in use, you are essentially performing a sequential search (iterating through each row and testing it to see if it matches your criteria), which means the search performs at O(n). If you limit your results to the first hit (using TOP 1 as pointed out by Scott Berry), the average number of checks is n/2 where n is the total size of the sample set. If there is no limit, the average number of checks is n (since you check all rows)</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Well, you probably know the famous quote:</p><blockquote><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Some people, when confronted with a problem, think &ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;ll use regular expressions.&rdquo; Now they have two problems. - Jamie Zawisnki</p></blockquote><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">That being said, regular expressions can be a good approach for particular problems. Sifting through JSON however, does not sound like one of them. Why not? JSON is already a structured format that has elements you can easily iterate through using normal programming constructs. I&rsquo;m assuming you mean using regular expressions to search through JSON data by treating the entire JSON object as a string. If instead you&rsquo;re using regex matching on individual JSON elements, that&rsquo;s probably fine.</p></span></p>

There are people who know the tricks to look clever, but they can easily be exposed as fakers if you&rsquo;re willing to dig a little deeper (which usually means only people who are genuinely clever/knowledgable can call them out!)</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I&rsquo;d like to say yes because that&rsquo;s how it is for me, but the truth is it depends largely on the person trying to learn. Different people learn in different ways, some learn better if they do a lot of reading ahead of time, while others will find it easier to just jump in and try stuff and poke around. Try different approaches and figure out what works best for you</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It would depend on the problems you are trying to solve. If they can be solved by brute-forcing all the possibilities within a given scope, then yes computer programs can help solve them. Typically however, any problem that <em>would</em> be solvable by this method already has been solved.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Also, it will only work for problems that can be perfectly simulated. For most physical experiments this is not feasible; since the computer program can only simulate what humans know well enough to be able to input that data into a computer. Quantum mechanics tells us that there will always be uncertainty at the quantum level so perfect simulations are not possible. In theory, simulations might be able to help narrow the scope of a problem though.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">A vast majority of people in the world don&rsquo;t really know what to do in life or what they want in life. They/we all just kind of stumble along to where life takes us. Many people take up a degree in college only because they believe that course will lead them to a good job, so they can get promoted to a high position, get married, raise a family, etc. Most people are on this &ldquo;default path&rdquo; that society provides instead of figuring out what they really want to do or where their passions lie. Many people live their entire lives not finding a passion or what they want in life.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">So don&rsquo;t worry too much if you are finding it difficult to find out what you want in life, because most people are in that state. The difference between you and other people is you are aware of it, that you want more in life but are not yet sure what that something is. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Explore life. Say yes to more random encounters. Take up new opportunities when they appear. Increase the scope of your activities. Do all these things to increase the odds that you will be able to find and figure out what you want in life.</p></span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/How-can-you-read-and-study-a-large-software-project-source-code/answer/Roy-Tang">How can you read and study a large software project source code?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Attacking a large, existing codebase that you are unfamiliar with can be a daunting endeavor. Don&rsquo;t expect that you will be able to easily navigate the codebase quickly after just a few days of studying it. Familiarity will come with experience.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Some things that can help:</p><ul><li>Don&rsquo;t try to understand everything all at once. Figure out what is interesting to you and focus your efforts there</li><li>Follow the path of data. Easiest way to see how the program works. For example, if I were studying a web application that processes request parameters to generate a search result, I would trace how the program captures the parameters from the requests object, formulates it into a search query, sends it to the database, receives the results, formats the results, then sends it back to the browser. Looking at the typical paths through which data traverses the system can give you a good overview of where everything is.</li><li>Try to fix a bug or implement some sort of change. If it&rsquo;s an open source project, this is probably the best way to familiarize yourself with the codebase <em>and</em> get more involved at the same time. I&rsquo;d suggest starting with minor UI bugs, those tend to be easiest to figure out since a text search of the source will often point you to where the correction needs to be made. For example, if the bug is that a particular error message is being shown under the wrong conditions, you can use a text search to find where the error message is declared, then trace all the code points that generate that message, figure out which one you need to update (probably by trial and error) and fix accordingly</li></ul></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Yes.

I did take some programming classes as part of my course though.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Just be aware: The further your background is from computer science, the more work and learning you will have to put in.</p></span></p>
