<p>There are many people using PLDT that are able to play online using the PS4. There is probably some sort of configuration or routing issue in your area which is causing the problem.</p>
<p>Also, try a hard reset on your router every so often. I had this issue with my Bayantel router that my PS4 suddenly can&rsquo;t connect to PSN for a few days. After some time and a few router restarts, it got better.</p>
<p>I suggest calling Sony support. Tell them about the error and ask them for technical details of the possible cause, and if there are any diagnostics you can do. Ask them what you need to tell your ISP to check</p>

</blockquote>
<p>People die at seemingly random times all the time. Not everybody lives up to &ldquo;old age&rdquo; and even when you do you still don&rsquo;t know when death will come for you. There&rsquo;s no point worrying about it, if you die you die.</p>
<p>Stay healthy, take care of yourself and be careful not to walk down dangerous areas at night. Now, even though you do all these precautions, there&rsquo;s no guarantee you won&rsquo;t suddenly die due to some random accident. Just do what you can and live your life to the fullest. Live each moment as if it might be your last, appreciate the things you have and the people you love and know that they might all vanish in a heartbeat</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s really up to you to decide if where you are is something you&rsquo;re satisfied with. In life, you often come to a crossroads where you have to decide whether you are willing to settle with what you have and are comfortable with, or to go out to seek something better. The choice is not always clear-cut, and the right answer always depends on the person and what he wants out of life</p>
<p>It is a tenuous balance between ambition and happiness. If you are too ambitious and always keep moving on looking for the next best thing, you run the risk of never being happy. If you find yourself happy where you are, you run the risk of settling for something less than what you could have had. You have to look inside yourself and figure out where that balance lies.</p>
<p>Think about what happens if you stay: what&rsquo;s the best-case scenario? Will the job eventually become more challenging? More engaging? What&rsquo;s the worst-case scenario? Will it become even more boring later on?</p>
<p>Think about what happens if you leave: are you likely to be able to find new work? (Actually there&rsquo;s minimal risk since you don&rsquo;t have to resign before looking for new work). Will you likely do well at any other job? Will you find happiness elsewhere?</p>
<p>For my case, I worked in a software job for more than a decade. It paid really well and I was well-respected by my peers and it was quite cushy for me. But eventually I decided to leave and take a break from working for a while to figure out where to go next. I had enough savings to live comfortably for a new months. Absolutely no regrets, enjoying all the free time I have now :)</p>

<p>JDBC is an API for Java programs to connect to SQL relational databases. JDBC drivers are implementations of the JDBC interface for various databases (Oracle, MySQL, etc)</p>
<p>The rest are packages in the JDBC API. There are basic tutorials on Oracle.com: <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/">Lesson: JDBC Basics</a></p>

<p>Finding a purpose in life is a life-long pursuit. It won&rsquo;t necessarily come easily. It may come early in life or it may come late. Don&rsquo;t let the lack of it lead to despair. Instead, enjoy life and explore it as much as possible. Try out as many new things as you can. Walk down unexplored side streets. Pursue strange and unusual things. Don&rsquo;t give up, just keep trying different things.</p>
<p>Think about school subjects you&rsquo;ve taken and put them in a list. Now sort that list according to which subjects you found most interesting to least. Now you have some indication of where your interests may lie. It may not be a strong indication, but it can be a good place to start</p>

<p>The answer is to try out a lot of different things and see what sticks. Explore life. Say yes to a lot of things. Try out random activities you see in flyers or posters. Don&rsquo;t let other people tell you what you can or cannot do</p>

</blockquote>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not foolish to have dreams. But don&rsquo;t let your dreams stay dreams. Figure out what kind of work you plan to do for yourself and how you&rsquo;re going to get there. Step-by-step, as detailed as possible. Take the first steps to get to your goal. Review your plan on a regular basis and make sure that either you are still on that plan or you want to take a different direction.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The world is a large and varied place, filled with many things that may or may not pique your interest. If you find your current environment or activities boring, then it is up to you to step outside of it and seek out things that will engage you more.</p>
<p>It might be daunting because the world offers many possibilities, and not all of them may look interesting at first. I suggest trying out a lot of different things, exploring widely (breadth-first in computer science speak) until you find one or two threads you find interesting then following the ones most promising</p>

<p>Knowledge vs information: Knowledge means being able to put different pieces of information together to figure out how to make use of them and derive new information.</p>
<p>Knowledge vs clear is more of theoretical vs practical</p>

<p>My country gets hit by devastating typhoons on a regular basis. I would build some sort of offshore, gigantic, wind-powered turbine that can capture the power of typhoon-level winds and store the energy in large electrical batteries or something like that. It solves two problems at once, it can reduce the impact of typhoons and it can reduce the cost of power!</p>

<p>I think I am. With some exceptions, I think it happens naturally - that you like to do those things you are good at it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always looking for more things I can do or be good at though</p>

<p>No, why would it? The whole point of trying new things is that if you find it doesn&rsquo;t really work for you, you should be able to abandon it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s never too late to be who you were meant to be.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry too much about time. Focus on exploring life to find your passion, to find that thing you can excel at and do good work at and be of most use to the world.</p>

Do I need to know all of these technologies like servlets, jsp, jsf, spring, struts, etc?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I always recommend learning java web development in the following order:</p><ol><li>Client-side stuff (If you&rsquo;re not familiar yet - HTML, JavaScript, CSS)</li><li>Basic Java usage (no web stuff)</li><li>Servlets, including request processing and response generation</li><li>JSP, including EL and tag libraries</li><li>SQL and basic database usage (If you&rsquo;re not familiar yet)</li><li>Database usage in Java (JDBC)</li></ol><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">At this point, you understand the basics of building webapps in Java without using any frameworks. It will give you a good base from which to branch out and choose specific frameworks or technologies to try and specialize in. The above is part of the regular training course for new developers in a company I previously worked in, new hires (fresh grads) without Java knowledge can complete the above in two weeks.</p>
<p>I would also recommend the Head First Servlets and JSP book, I&rsquo;ve found it to be pretty useful</p>

<p>I disagree.</p>
<p>The thing about this line of work is that there is always something new to do. If you find yourself doing the same type of work all the time, it might be time to look for a different job/company that can offer you more challenging situations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a web developer since 2004. Over the past five years, most of my projects have brought some new and interesting challenges. Some examples:</p><ul><li>One of my projects had to be ported from a large legacy client/server system under a minimal budget. We had create a converter that would create the boilerplate java code (I work primarily in servlets/JSP) from the source of the legacy PowerBuilder system which was very challenging since C/S program stuff doesn&rsquo;t always map cleanly to web-based stuff</li><li>Another project had me building a generic workflow engine to support the various modules in a large project. The engine had to cater to the different needs of the modules while remaining flexible enough to accommodate new modules and any configuration changes the clients wanted to support (the project had multiple clients)</li><li>The same project above had us learning about the challenges behind DevOps. The size of the project meant our build and deployment processes had to be revamped otherwise the builds would slow to a crawl (at one point it was taking three or more hours to churn out a build, totally unacceptable at the rate we needed to integrate and verify fixes). </li><li>I was also involved in a project that included a web portal that acted as messaging hub for a number of mobile apps. That meant devising a messaging protocol and format that could efficiently communicate with a large array of clients in real-time. </li></ul><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Web development actually has a lot of scope. It&rsquo;s true that many web development frameworks are largely the same, but that only makes the basic CRUD work easy. It means the developers need to move on to higher-order problems that are not covered by those frameworks.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Fear of public speaking is one of the most common fears (if not the most common - more than fear of death even), so in this you are in good company.</p>
<p>The first key to overcoming any fear is <b>to face it head on</b>. In this case, that means trying out public speaking, no matter how hard it seems or how badly you do. To try it again and again, until that fear is gone. You don&rsquo;t have to speak in front of an audience of hundreds or thousands to practice, you can do smaller steps first, like maybe in a classroom setting. If you are having trouble for example with a presentation you want to do in class, ask a small group of friends if you could practice the talk/presentation in front of them so they can give you feedback. This will give you more confidence during the actual talk.</p>
<p>Speaking of confidence, another key is to <b>learn how to express your ideas confidently</b>. This means practice as well, with an example above. But the practice here isn&rsquo;t restricted to speaking, you need to practice this at every opportunity. You need to practice expressing your ideas not only verbally, but also in written form. You need to be comfortable with the notion of presenting your ideas to people. One thing that can help is to have a like-minded group of friends, the kind you can have deep ongoing conversations with. Or join a debate team in school. Or even try discussing issues with strangers on internet forums (be careful with this one haha). Basically take any opportunity you have to practice expressing your ideas so that you have the confidence to present them to an audience.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Practice, practice, practice.</p>
<p>What is it you want to write? Practice that, as much as possible. Want to write novels? Write shorter stories first, maybe even just snippets of prose whenever you have free time. You want to write nonfiction about a certain topic? Start a blog about it. Write often. Answer questions on Quora about the topic.</p>
<p>When possible, put your work up for the world to see, so that you might improve. Look for like-minded people and hang out with them. Take a writing class.</p>
<p>Read. Read a lot. It will help you recognize what are good forms of writing and what are not. Read the sort of things you expect to write. Be critical of your reading. When you finish reading something, ask yourself &ldquo;Was this a good piece? How could it be improved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Writing eloquently is not the domain of journalism though.</p>

<p>It can be jarring to transition from drawing manually using traditional tools to digitally using a tablet. There&rsquo;s no secret to mastering this transition - there is only practice. Practice drawing with the tablet until you get as used to it as drawing with pencil and paper.</p>

<p>The biggest was a case management system (that&rsquo;s pretty generic, I know), a web application written mostly in Java, that involved a development team of some 30-40 people, of which I was the technical lead. The system was pretty large - case management consisted of a lot of different types of records and there was a significant finance component. The system included a customisable workflow engine of which I was the primary architect.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It would be best if you could talk to a professional.</p>
<p>If that option is not available, there might be other resources you can try like a depression hotline available in your area. If you are religious (or even if you are not actually), maybe there is a local priest or pastor willing to listen to you.</p>
<p>Also see if you can find any family or friends you can confide in, someone who&rsquo;s willing to listen. It might be difficult, but simply tell them &ldquo;I have a lot on my mind. Do you have time to listen?&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t give up and keep going until you find someone willing to listen.</p>
<p>When you do find someone willing to listen, talk. It might be difficult for you to explain things, but keep going, power through it and eventually it will come out.</p>
<p>Life is strange sometimes, it has these ups and downs. Try to weather the downs so you can get back to the ups. Good luck and don&rsquo;t give up</p>

<p>There is a significant difference in the natural resources available in the Americas during earlier eras as compared to Asia/Europe. I would suggest reading Jared Diamond&rsquo;s &ldquo;Guns Germs and Steel&rdquo; which delves into these differences and their effects on the advancement of cultures in different continents</p>

<p>He felt the rage building in his throat and the words spilled out of his mouth with a voice that echoed like thunder across the field: &ldquo;Fire at will&rdquo;</p>

<p>It means an unhandled exception occurred in one of your servlets. You need to check the server logs to get the details of the specific exception that occurred.</p>

<p>Take every opportunity to write. And to craft words. While riding the bus, form sentences in your head to describe the people around you</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a subreddit, r/WritingPrompts. You might want to give that a shot</p>

<p>It sounds like you should just ignore this person. When he sends you such advice, just respond with &ldquo;eh, I don&rsquo;t really care&rdquo;, and walk away</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Moving on doesn&rsquo;t mean forgetting her. Don&rsquo;t dwell too much on her death; whenever you find yourself thinking about that topic, try to refocus your thoughts to her life and to your good memories together with her.</p>
<p>It might be difficult to let go, but it will come eventually with time. In the meantime, try to find new ways to occupy your mind and keep you distracted. A new hobby or something else to direct your attention to. Ask your friends to help you with this as well.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s an understandable bias, always needing perfect information before moving forward and taking action. But it can be paralyzing, and there are situations where you will need to act quickly and with minimal information. As in many things in life, it&rsquo;s important to strike a balance and know when to wait for more data or when to move forward with what you have.</p>
<p>If you are having difficulty with this, you might need to practice being more spontaneous. Ask your friends to help you with this: ask them to drag you along on sudden road trips without telling you where you&rsquo;re going, or to surprise you with random situations where you have to react quickly</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Minimum length requirements are inflated to take into account the BS that students write. If students write 500 words of meaningful response + 1500 words of BS for a 2,000 word essay, then for a 500 word essay, you&rsquo;re likely to get only 125 words of meaningful response.</p>
<p>And even the mere act of thinking up 1,500 additional words of BS is something, at least you&rsquo;re trying to think about things tangentially related to the topic at hand.</p>

<p>Practice solving puzzles to get better at math. Not necessarily math puzzles (those are fine), but also logic puzzles will help. Try the book Satan, Cantor and Infinity</p>
<p>For remembering things, try to exercise your memory in everyday locations. For example whenever you go to the grocery store, choose a thing that you like to buy, say potato chips. Look at the row of potato chips on sale and try to memorize the order of the brands as arranged on the shelf. Then the next time you go to the store, see how well you remembered it.</p>
<p>You can also look into/research the memory technique called the memory palace. There&rsquo;s a TED talk about it somewhere.</p>

<p>It can be something as simple as a checklist that you verify at the end of the period to make sure you&rsquo;ve done all the necessary things. Add a reminder/notification to your phone to remind you to do the thing you have to do for your goal. Tell your friends about your goal to keep you honest.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Practice, practice, practice.</p>
<p>Try tracing out pictures for a while. Get a sheet of paper that you can partly see through and overlay it on an existing image of a face and a body. Depending on the paper you might not be able to see much detail, but you can trace the outline and general location of the facial details and also the general body proportions.</p>
<p>Most artists will use outline figures, like ovals and circles and lines, to outline the general placement of body parts and proportions. There&rsquo;s an example of this at <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Draw-People">How to Draw People</a></p>
<p>Once you have the rough outline, either from a sketch or what, you can fill out the details however you like</p>
<p>Try to draw first from reference images that you can see, not just ones you have in your head, it will be easier. After a lot of practice, you will be more easily able to translate the images in your head to drawings by hand.</p>
<p>If you use reddit, there&rsquo;s a subreddit I&rsquo;ve found helpful, it&rsquo;s <a href="http://reddit.com/r/sketchdaily,">http://reddit.com/r/sketchdaily,</a> you might want to check it out.</p>

<p>Typically, a database administrator will have the following tasks:</p><ol><li>Database installation and configuration</li><li>Maintenance - version upgrades and applying patches</li><li>Migration - transferring data from one database to another, or an older database version to another</li><li>Setting up regular backups and planning for recovery procedures</li><li>Configure security models</li><li>Storage and capacity planning - this means monitoring the disk storage used by the database</li><li>Performance monitoring and tuning - users will complain if the database slows to a crawl! Tuning here can mean modifying SQL statements or stored procedures to improve performance</li><li>General database troubleshooting</li><li>Maintaining data integrity - this means making sure the data in the tables and the relationships between them are &ldquo;correct&rdquo;. Typically a database will have internal mechanisms to ensure this, such as foreign keys (which may be configured by the database administrator also), and applications using the database will have their own set of rules that they impose upon the data. However, the applications aren&rsquo;t always correct, so that may from time to time require running SQL scripts to correct any data errors that arise from misconfiguration or application errors</li></ol><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Hope that helps!</p>

<p>Fear can keep you alive, so yes. At the same time, you shouldn&rsquo;t let that fear hold you back from experiences that may be valuable or meaningful for you. Learn to understand and assess your fears so that you know when they are justified and when they are not</p>

<p>You have nothing to feel guilty about. Raising a child is not for everyone, and you can live a fulfilling even without children. Life is short, travel and see the world!</p>

<p>Having a mix of skills will be incredibly valuable for you since it makes you &ldquo;rarer&rdquo;. Look for the place where your skills/interests intersect - that is a good niche for you to pursue since there will be fewer people to compete with. i.e. look for programming work where an economics domain would be an advantage, or work for an economics graduate (I have no idea what that entails LOL) where you can leverage your programming knowledge (maybe via program-assisted data crunching or analysis). It&rsquo;s better than competing against everyone who is a programmer.</p>

<p>Try turning your suggestions into questions, which suggests inviting input from others. Instead of &ldquo;In my opinion, telling this to the client will not be received well.&rdquo;, try &ldquo;Do you think the client will receive this well?&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a difficult fear, and it may take a lot of practice to get over. Not all fears have reasonable causes, but that&rsquo;s okay. To overcome fear you do not need to rationalize it, you only need to confront it.</p>
<p>Basically you need to start confronting this fear in small doses. It&rsquo;s best if you have friends you can count on and that are aware of your fear and willing to help.</p>
<p>Practice being comfortable around small groups of people first. Try taking the bus to/from school or work, if possible. Better if you can ride the bus with a friend.</p>
<p>Do your shopping errands at different grocery stores, find one where you feel slightly uncomfortable with the amount of people there and do your grocery shopping there for a while. When you get used to it, look for another grocery store that might be more difficult for you.</p>
<p>Bring a friend when you need to navigate through a large crowd (say, at the shopping mall or such). Having a friend along will make you a bit more comfortable.</p>
<p>Practice small talk. Say hi to the cashier at the grocery store, or the bus driver on your way to work. You don&rsquo;t need to think of anything else to say beyond &ldquo;Hi, how are you doing?&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t worry if you have trouble responding, just smile and try again next time.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>Edit: You don&rsquo;t always need to be outgoing and confident! It&rsquo;s perfectly acceptable to sometimes want to curl up in bed all day and stay away from people :)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If you are depressed, it is best to talk to a professional. This is the very first thing you should do.</p>
<p>Also see if you can share your fears and anxieties with friends and family and ask for their support. Maybe you also fear telling them about it, but that&rsquo;s fine. You&rsquo;ve already taken the first step of asking people on the internet for help anyway. If you have trouble telling them your problems, you can send them the link to this question :) Try to ask friends or family members who you think will likely be supportive.</p>
<p>For your everyday fears, try facing them one at a time. Try the easiest ones first. Try a break in your routine. Go to a different coffee shop. Say hi to the barista (any small talk after that is optional!) When you go get a haircut ask the barber to suggest a different look. Or ask him how his family is doing. Little things, one at a time. It&rsquo;s ok to fail too. Every attempt is already a victory.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s up to you to decide whether another person is worth risking heartbreak for. And you can avoid ever getting attached to anyone if you really want to avoid heartbreak. But if you do that, are you even really living?</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t let negative people get you down. Most often the people trying to drag you down are insecure about their own position and in seeing you working hard they feel some insecurity because they are stuck in their own mediocrity. As long as you are doing what you believe is right and you are not hurting other people, you shouldn&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>If those people are affecting you negatively, you might want to consider avoiding them or cutting them out of your life entirely</p>

<p>On the one hand, it&rsquo;s not really your responsibility. Unless it affects you somehow (i.e. their work in that field is affecting yours)</p>
<p>On the other hand, if that person is not aware that he doesn&rsquo;t have talent then it might be better to let him know so that he can decide whether he wants to go on or not. If he is already aware of this, and decides to go on anyway, I don&rsquo;t think you can do anything more.</p>
<p>If you do decide to discuss this with him, try to soften it a little. I would wrap it in concern: &ldquo;Hey, are you doing okay? You always seem like you&rsquo;re having trouble with [field]?&rdquo; Get them to consider other alternatives: &ldquo;If things are so hard, have you ever thought of pursuing some other field like [alternative]?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the person is doing well, you want to reward him/her with either a raise or a promotion or both. But to justify a raise/promotion, there is also a perception that you will need to take on additional responsibilities as well. And for many companies, they will reach a point where they are unable to assign further technical responsibilities to a senior developer. At this point, they may consider moving the developer into management. This usually means taking on project management tasks - monitoring the work of other people, managing schedules, trying to help the team meet the schedules/deadlines, resolving conflicts within the team, coordinating and assigning work, etc. Many developers won&rsquo;t have the skills for these tasks and thus many will also be unhappy doing this kind of work. Many will still prefer to keep one foot in the technical side - this means still doing some of the dev work while also taking on management tasks. Some developers who value status or adjustment may prefer moving on to management.</p>

<p>For specific technical skills (programming languages, frameworks, platforms and such), it&rsquo;s literally impossible to say. Technology advances quickly and at a pace difficult to predict. We probably can&rsquo;t even predict what will be in use 5 years down the line, let alone 15 years.</p>
<p>Focus on soft skills and technical principles that will be the same no matter the technology being used:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Learn to communicate well. That means listening and reading and writing and speaking and good grammar and conveying your ideas clearly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding of design patterns in software. Such design patterns are prevalent regardless of the technology in use (although they may look slightly different on each platform)</p>
</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Hahaha no.</p>
<p>Assessing programming skill is highly difficult and subjective. There&rsquo;s not even an objective metric that would take <em>a year</em> to measure. Sure, in a year&rsquo;s time you could figure out whether a programmer is &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; (already subjective), but even then comparing against other programmers (&ldquo;better&rdquo; or &ldquo;worse&rdquo;) will still be highly subjective. There&rsquo;s nothing like say &ldquo;programmer A is 89%, while programmer B is 72%, so we&rsquo;ll pick programmer A&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Think about WHY you need to convince them you&rsquo;re not crazy?</p>
<p>I understand the need to have your family understand what you&rsquo;re doing, even if you&rsquo;re not dependent on them for financial reasons. If you really need to explain it to them, try to communicate that:</p><ol><li>This is something you&rsquo;ve always wanted to do</li><li>You&rsquo;ve thought about the risks and consequences thoroughly</li><li>You&rsquo;ve prepared some measures in case it doesn&rsquo;t work out - you have a buffer of savings, etc (if you haven&rsquo;t done this, you should consider doing it first!)</li><li>Set a time limit (I&rsquo;m going to take 1 year off to try to pursue this dream, if it doesn&rsquo;t work out, I can go back to my other field)</li></ol><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Good luck!</p>

<p>It is always difficult to let go of someone especially if that person was significant in your life. It will come mostly with time, slowly and it&rsquo;s something you can&rsquo;t really hurry. Try to train yourself to redirect your thoughts to something else whenever you think about this person, and keep yourself occupied to avoid stray thoughts. You may never ever forget that person completely (I sometimes find my thoughts wandering back to someone I knew 20 years ago!), but eventually you&rsquo;ll get to the point that you can move on.</p>
