<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If you live in the Philippines, it&rsquo;s easily the best University in the country. As compared to the other two generally considered to be tops Universities (Ateneo, DLSU), you get exposed to a wider variety of both professors and students. There is a significant culture of activism and political involvement (if that&rsquo;s the sort of thing that you like) - except maybe for the College of Engineering, where I found it to be minimal. Because of the varied population of the University, there&rsquo;s generally something there for everyone.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It depends on how predictable your day is. If there is a constant risk of crises coming up as the day goes on, it becomes more difficult. Making it more complicated is that people really aren&rsquo;t very good at assessing how much additional work they can take on without starting to lose focus.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">In general, the best idea would probably be to do the most important things, the ones that require your most attention, early in the day when your mind is the most sharp and creative, instead of risking doing them later in the day when intervening crises may have sapped your concentration and focus.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Taking it by force entails too many risks and will very likely escalate tensions making a bad situation worse. I think the current approach being taken - pressuring China to let up on its illegal activities and gathering support from other nations and going through the arbitration case - are much safer bets in the long term.</p></span></p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Confidence really only comes with experience. The reason senior developers are able to handle pressure so easily is that they&rsquo;ve been under the gun many times and know how to focus and deliver even under strict deadlines. I suggest just putting in the best work you can, be helpful to your team as much as possible. Respect will come naturally to those who put in good work</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Yeah. It&rsquo;s partly because the media overhypes some things. One of the best examples is terrorism - terrorism is terrible of course and many lives are lost. But the truth is many more lives are lost to everyday occurrences like car accidents as compared to terrorist attacks. It&rsquo;s just that terrorist attacks are more sensationalized (which is kind of what terrorists want) so people are more outraged by them</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It&rsquo;s also partly because people tend to rely on how they feel emotionally rather than thinking rationally about how likely certain worries really are. It&rsquo;s like mothers who are overprotective of their children and don&rsquo;t want them running around the playground with strange kids because they might get hurt, when really kids have been playing outdoors for ages and ages and most of the time it&rsquo;s fine.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">You know, you are already being given some free tips on how to improve yourself: they&rsquo;re in the comments you get from code review! Study the comments, and if you don&rsquo;t understand, feel free to discuss with the reviewer and ask how it could be made better.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Writing good, clean, robust code is difficult. Not even veteran software developers will get it right 100% of the time. The only difference between you and them is that they have a lot more practice and experience which translates into better instincts as to which code will perform better or will be easier to maintain. And experience and instinct can only be acquired with time.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">You also have to accept that you will not write perfect code most of the time. Possibly never. And often there is no real &ldquo;best&rdquo; approach: even among senior developers implementing any nontrivial programming solution, the code will most likely be completely different among them. Even veteran software developers will often look back at code they wrote weeks or months ago and wonder WTH they were thinking.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Lastly, do not attach too much of your ego to your code such that you are embarrassed by how it turns out. You are not your code. You are not the snippets of Javascript or for loops or function calls you hammered out today. The code you have written is almost immediately yesterday&rsquo;s news. The instant you save it or commit it or build it, you have already outgrown it. If you make mistakes, own up to them and figure out how to avoid them in the future and move on.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Maybe. There are two possibilities: </p><ul><li>you are not yet used to the level of work expected of someone in the industry</li><li>you are being given too much work in too little time</li></ul><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Think about the first possibility. Are you doing the best work you possibly can? Are your co-workers having trouble with the same level of work? Are you managing your time properly? Are you spending too much time fixing defects or reworking existing code? Is your understanding of the business requirements sufficient or are you making mistakes because of a gap in understanding? Ask yourself these and similar questions to identify areas of improvement to help you cope with the amount of work you need to do</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The workload will also vary wildly between companies, so it&rsquo;s also a possibility that you have the bad luck of being in one of those companies that overwork their developers</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The best thing about trying to develop self-control is that there are a lot of opportunities everyday to practice it. Just try something like: whenever you have an impulse for something (like to buy a new thing that you just found about, or sudden urge to have an unhealthy snack), try to delay it until the next day</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Introspection and self-awareness helps too. Analyze your wants and needs so that you&rsquo;re aware what things you really need and which ones you can easily defer or outright ignore.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">In general, the best answer to &ldquo;how can I get better at X&rdquo; is to keep practicing X until you get better. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">That being said, there are some ways to make it easier to deal with rejection. Most of it has to do with improving your state of mind.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">What does that mean? It doesn&rsquo;t mean conditioning yourself to expect rejection (that would be a self-fulfilling prophecy right there!) but rather to detach your ego from the attempts you make. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The reason rejection can be so difficult to handle is that it&rsquo;s a huge ego hit, it makes you feel bad about yourself, as if there&rsquo;s something wrong with you that&rsquo;s why you got rejected. And that&rsquo;s nonsense.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">People get rejected all the time. Good people, bad people. Handsome people, ugly people. Rich people, poor people. A rejection isn&rsquo;t a reflection of something wrong with you as a person, it&rsquo;s a reflection of something wrong with the relationship you were trying to form. And that&rsquo;s the nature of the world - not all persons are meant to have relationships together! This can apply to romantic relationships, business relationships, friendships, etc. Once you accept this truth, it becomes a lot easier to handle rejection.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Well, what is the criteria to be considered the best in your field? For a real estate salesman I would guess it&rsquo;s to generate the most amount of sales among the salesmen in your area right? </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">First, maybe you can figure out who is the salesman currently considered as the best in your field. Figure out how much he&rsquo;s making. Figure out how many sales he makes, how much margins they usually have. Then ask him for tips! If he doesn&rsquo;t want to talk to you, that&rsquo;s fine, no loss there! You can also try talking to his clients, ask them what made them willing to buy real estate from that guy.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Copying other people can only get you so far though. The real way to get ahead of the pack is to hustle. Get busy. Work hard. Practice on your pitch. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The only way to be the best salesman is to sell more than other people. That means making more pitches than everyone else and improving on your pitches so that you can convert more of them into sales than everyone else!</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Aiming to be the best in any given field is a huge goal to work towards, but it can be worth it!</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">When a person is said to take something personally, it means that person considers something to be directly affecting his ego and reflecting upon him as a person. For example, if you try to refute a person&rsquo;s arguments and he takes it personally, it means he gets offended by your counter-argument as if you were attacking him as a person instead of just his arguments. Or taking one&rsquo;s work personally means if there&rsquo;s a problem with your work you think there&rsquo;s a problem with you as person.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Not taking things personally means being able to detach ourselves from the things we interact with.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I think so. I think that some level of introspection or self-awareness is important in making the most of your life, identifying the things that are not good for you, identifying the things you want, etc. The more you understand your own life, the easier will it be for you to focus it towards directions that lead to growth and happiness</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It is a form of self-awareness, which can come only with contemplating yourself and your actions. Look at how you live your life. Which things do you prioritize, which principles do you adhere to? What actions do you respond to well? What actions do you respond to poorly? e.g. If you respond poorly to people lying, maybe you strongly value honesty and integrity. If you respond well to people who make intelligent discussion points maybe you value cerebral thinking</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It&rsquo;s difficult. Generally whatever you do will always be colored to some extent by your personal biases. The key is to be aware of your personal views and biases and compensate against them in order to be more balanced. Do more research on views opposing your own to counteract your own biases</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">People don&rsquo;t always react well to people they perceive as different from them. It is born of a primal fear of things that are unknown, i.e. in the olden caveman days you had to be wary of every unknown thing since it might be a dangerous predator. This fear can be hard to overcome unless the person willingly recognizes it and acts to change it. Your acquaintance may not realize it, but he is probably scared that you will do something unusual or awkward and he won&rsquo;t know what to do or how to respond. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I would suggest just telling him that you&rsquo;re just like every other person: you have some unusual quirks that takes some getting used to. Everyone is like that! But if he doesn&rsquo;t want to hang out with you, you have to respect that and just look for better friends who can be more understanding.</p></span></p>

If your fear is keeping you from entering unsafe conditions, i.e. maybe your fear is stopping you from moving in to a bad neighborhood known for a high crime rate, that fear might be justified and it&rsquo;s ok. But if your fear is unjustified, it can be unhealthy. i.e. if you fear flying because you think it&rsquo;s unsafe (despite the fact that thousands of planes take off and land each day without incident), that&rsquo;s irrational</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Remember: You are not your code. You are not the hundred or so lines of C or Java or Javascript or whatever that you wrote today.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">This problem arises because you are too attached to your code. Your ego is associated with the code you write and you feel that any comments or defects found reflect upon   you as a person. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">You are not perfect. You will not write perfect software, and that&rsquo;s fine. It&rsquo;s not a flaw, it&rsquo;s just the way software is. It isn&rsquo;t written all in one go, magically perfect and elegant and satisfying all the requirements. Good software goes through multiple iterations and many eyes looking at it. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It is also important to treat it as a learning experience - learn what you can from each code review comment and try to apply what you learn to future code you write. This also helps you minimize review comments in the future. Instead of treating the large number of comments as a shortcoming on your part, treat it as a metric you can improve upon.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Fear is an instinct, to keep one away from danger. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Sometimes the fear is valid. Such fear can keep you alive, especially in crisis situations. Examples are fear of falling or fear of injury.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Many other times, fear is simply a vestige of our prehistoric brains not yet adapted to modern times. An example is fear of humiliation, maybe manifesting as a fear of public speaking. Our prehistoric lizard brains are afraid that we might say something stupid and be humiliated and lose standing among the tribe, leading to us being ostracized. In prehistoric times, being ostracized can mean death, since humans had to band together to survive. But in modern times, such fear is unnecessary and unhealthy since people are more free to disagree with one another.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The key is to recognize fear for what it is and to understand whether the fear you are feeling is justified and needs to be acted upon, or simply part of a prehistoric instinct that is meaningless in the modern life.</p></span></p>

Personally, I&rsquo;d recommend Python, but it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what programming language you choose, your initial learning stage should only be to get you familiar with programming concepts and constructs.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">When looking for a job, look for the ones geared towards fresh graduates that may be offering training for new hires. This puts you on a more even field with people who have been programming for longer.</p></span></p>
