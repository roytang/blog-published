2020 Movies update: 7 movies watched in Feb. Probably the best movie I&rsquo;ve seen this month was Knives Out. (Jojo Rabbit close second.) The goal of 200 movies for the year is getting farther!
As for TV, I think most of my watching time was spent rewatching Rick and Morty for quiz purposes lol. Well, Criminal Minds ended, so there&rsquo;s that. Arrowverse has been meh, though I did enjoy Supergirl&rsquo;s 100th episode.

In 2010 I took a short work hiatus which meant I was often home for most of the day. Back then Netflix wasn&rsquo;t really a thing, so I would often have local cable TV playing in the background of whatever I was doing. And it was because of this that I started regularly watching police procedurals. They&rsquo;re not the cleverest or most highbrow of shows, but they&rsquo;re more like a guilty pleasure.

I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I should continue this watching-lately series since I already set up a separate page for listing my 2020 movies watched. It might have been more consistent to have a list for the 2020 TV shows also? But then again, TV shows are a much different beast, since each show/season is broken into an episode and sometimes you watch them all in one go or sometimes over the span of a few months.

Been watching a lot of things this December.
I finally got back on The Expanse after finishing S1 more than a year ago. I only finished S2, but it was already a vast improvement over S1. S1 felt like a lot of meandering around until the characters actually ran into the plot. S2 was stronger, faster-paced, and there&rsquo;s always a lot of things going on in each episode. I really like this series now, looking forward to S3 and S4 when I have the time.

<p>I watched the most recent Star Wars last night. Spoiler-free review posted <a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/12/rise-of-skywalker/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since this ended the sequel trilogy and the entire &ldquo;Skywalker Saga&rdquo;, I thought it deserved a bit more spoilery discussion.</p>

Nothing in the cinema this month (going to the cinema is expensive!). I did watch a couple of animated movies this month:
 Dragonball Super: Broly. I have some vague recollection of watching the original Broly movie, and I believe this one is much better. DBS Broly is a slightly more nuanced character than just &ldquo;random raging monster&rdquo; from the previous non-canon movie. The animation was okay, you could tell the animators were having fun with some of the battle parts.

Actually watched something in the cinema this month: Joker. I wasn&rsquo;t originally sure if I wanted to see it, I wasn&rsquo;t hyped for it at all in the months prior. But as the showing date came nearer, there was a lot of buzz around it so I decided to go anyway. I don&rsquo;t feel like it lived up to the hype and the warnings about promoting incel stuff, but at least it&rsquo;s one of the higher-grossing DC movies, so maybe we&rsquo;ll have more to come in that vein.

I finally got around to watching X-Men Dark Phoenix which I skipped when it came out mainly because (a) poor reviews, and while normally I&rsquo;d have watched it anyway since I have not missed any of the X-Men movies in the cinema, not even the horrendous Wolverine Origins, there was also to consider that (b) I was in the US at the time and was only willing to spend my precious dollars on one expensive American cinema and Spider-man Far From Home won out.

Hmm, surprisingly I haven&rsquo;t watched too much stuff this month.
Eigasai I watched a Japanese film at Eigasai in UP Diliman for the first time ever, upon the invite of some friends. We saw One Cut of the Dead a comedy zombie film. It was great and it was hilarious, although you must make sure not to lose patience with the first thirty minutes. I went in blind not knowing anything about it other than &ldquo;Japanese comedy zombie movie&rdquo;, so you should too!

I was travelling for most of the past two months, so this covers both June and July, and I guess I haven&rsquo;t been able to watch too much. Maybe? IDK, we&rsquo;ll see.
Since I was in the US, I took the opportunity to finish watching Voltron: Legendary Defender which only had two seasons available on PH Netflix. Pretty good adaptation, lots of fun callbacks to the old series. Some annoying filler eps, especially in the middle seasons onwards.

The big TV thing of May 2019 was of course, the much maligned finale for Game of Thrones. I&rsquo;ve written about that separately here.
Most of the US TV series also ended their runs in May. Arrowverse show seasons were littered with poor writing as usual. I rank the seasons in this order:
 best is Legends of Tomorrow season 4. The reason Legends is the best is that they&rsquo;re not afraid to be outrageous.

After a much-maligned eighth and final season, HBO&rsquo;s Game of Thrones is done. Unmarked spoilers follow.
The eighth season was so notoriously bad, we got petitions asking for rewrites. Here&rsquo;s how I explained it to a friend after the notorious episode 5:
 It&rsquo;s not about characters being killed, it&rsquo;s about bad writing because they&rsquo;re cramming. The writers were determined to finish the show in 2 smaller seasons so they&rsquo;re skipping a lot of necessary character development and characters just do stupid things because the plot demands it.

Continuing with the Wheel of Time re-read! I devoured Eye of the World much more quickly than I expected, finishing the book in less than 3 days. It helps that I had already read it before of course, but I think there&rsquo;s also a part of me that enjoys escaping into this fantasy world when the real world outlook seems dire.
Anyway, the book shows a lot of Tolkien-esque plot influence, especially near the start: Some kids from a backwater village are visited by a magic user and after some troubles are forced on the run from black riders?

Since I was going to be taking a long trip in a month, I was looking for some books to read on the plane and in airports and whatnot while waiting. I settled on a re-read of Robert Jordan&rsquo;s Wheel of Time series, a pretty good time for it since by next year we may have a TV series from Amazon (hopefully better than Game of Thrones). Side note: Wheel of Time is also why I&rsquo;m not optimistic that GRRM can finish ASoIaF in just two more books - Jordan took forever and died before he could finish WoT and even Sanderson who took over needed an additional three books to finish the saga.

I&rsquo;ve already written extensively about Avengers Endgame, but there are other things I watched this month too.
Shazam came out early this month, and while it was unfortunately sandwiched between MCU blockbusters, it was a fun adventure romp and surprised me in a few ways. I wrote a short spoiler-free review over on Tumblr.
TV-wise, I&rsquo;ve been on a rewatch binge of 30 Rock that unfortunately started with season 4 due to Amazon Prime&rsquo;s weird way of presenting things.

I already wrote about Avengers Endgame a bit in yesterday&rsquo;s post, but that was a bit rushed and I had more thoughts, so here we are. I figured I might as well get everything out. There will be unmarked spoilers for Avengers Endgame and Agents of SHIELD.
Before even going into the movie that was seemingly sold out everywhere despite being on almost every cinema screen in the Metro, I was thinking to myself what a phenomenon.

Since I&rsquo;m easily distracted, I often tumble down rabbit holes way too easily. You know the kind of rabbit holes I&rsquo;m talking about: you just want to lookup the name of that actor who appeared in that movie and suddenly you find yourself forty minutes into a Wikipedia dive with three different tabs open, none of them remotely related to what you were originally searching for. (Wikipedia could also be IMDB, Reddit, or TV Tropes).

Many of the manga series I used to follow from long ago have since ended, the only ones still running now are One Piece and Hajime no Ippo. So I thought I&rsquo;d follow some newer ones. Here are some short reviews:
The Promised Neverland
I picked up this one due to a strong recommendation from someone I follow on social media. The premise starts out with some super smart kids who grew up in an orphanage without any knowledge of an outside world.

Some number of years back I first encountered this comic image and I really liked it because it had a message of boundless optimism, of no challenge too large to overcome.
  (Click to view full-size)    
2 Apr 2019 5:56amClose   I later found out that the image comes from an Eisner-award winning webcomic called minus (intentionally lower case). The meaning of the comic changes significantly in the context of the webcomic, as the titular girl minus apparently has unlimited reality alteration powers.

The big one this month was Captain Marvel. I posted the usual spoiler-free review over on Tumblr, but I have some more spoiler-y thoughts over here:
(Spoilers)   While I thought the movie was ok, I was underwhelmed by the third act and specifically the lack of any serious threat for Carol to defeat towards the end of the movie. As this tumblr post explains more clearly than I ever could, perhaps the issue is that the narrative is not something targetted towards me as a man, who has not experienced the emotional gaslighting IRL that many women are exposed to.

If you haven&rsquo;t figured it out yet, I watch a lot of TV shows, rarely on TV itself though. I outgrew scheduled television maybe more than a decade ago. I&rsquo;m reminded of this because I was going through some old disks and found burned episodes of stuff like Smallville, Heroes, The Simpsons, various anime, and so on.
Those were from the days before streaming though. These days an abundance of content is available online via the streaming services, no need to store all those episodes yourself.

Some things I&rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:
I watched Alita: Battle Angel, with the friend who introduced me to the series in the first place. The movie looked fantastic and the fight scenes were great. Plot was supercondensed, several books&rsquo; worth of story combined into one. Ended in a weird place, kinda? Easily the best western live action anime adaptation by far.
On 7 Feb 2019 2:06pm I wrote:  Watched Alita: Battle Angel earlier today.

18 Feb 2019 5:56amClose   The quote is from the 1980s cult classic Bill and Ted&rsquo;s Excellent Adventure. I didn&rsquo;t include this movie in my top 10 movies post, but it and the sequel Bill and Ted&rsquo;s Bogus Journey are still among my childhood faves. These wise words are give by the Wyld Stallyns band composed of the epnoymous Bill and Ted, and form the philosophical basis of the future utopian civilization inspired by their music.

Interesting article on closed captioning, or as I like to call them, subtitles. My first exposure to subtitles was anime of course, but these days I vastly prefer having subtitles on any show, even if it&rsquo;s dubbed in a language I do understand. From the article:
 “Why do you have captions on?&rdquo; I asked.
“It helps me with my ADHD: I can focus on the words, I catch things I missed, and I never have to go back,&rdquo; she replied.

Some Youtube channels I&rsquo;ve been enjoying recently:
ComicTropes is a weekly show that does deep dives into various mainstream comics titles, and often includes the background history of characters and creators, so very interesting stuff for comic book nerds.
GameMaker&rsquo;s ToolKit talks about video game level design topics. His series &ldquo;Boss Keys&rdquo; does a deep dive into Zelda dungeons and analyzes them based on criteria like linearity. His level design analyses are strongly based on systems and gameplay and how they affect the player experience.

Between the ages of 10-12, my reading diet consisted almost exclusively of the teenage-targetted detective series The Hardy Boys. For me, the term invokes the names Frank and Joe before the Matt and Jeff of WWE fame. We had a fairly wide collection of the blue-hardcovered books of those days. And I believe I made the effort to read every single book in that particular series, through borrowing and such. I think I was successful, but I can&rsquo;t be sure.

Some things I&rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:
Bumblebee only came out over here in January (thanks to the usual MMFF shenanigans), and I decided to watch it on a whim. Pretty decent soft reboot, read my spoiler-free review over on the Tumblr
The first half of Young Justice Outsiders is out, and it&rsquo;s pretty good. Focus is back on a smaller group after the larger team in YJ season 2.

The first trailer for Spider-Man Far From Home dropped last week. I used to pretty hyped for superhero movie trailers, but I haven&rsquo;t bother watching this one yet. MCU still has two more movies coming out before this one, and I&rsquo;m already hyped enough for those, I don&rsquo;t think I have hype to spare for a third one.
My brother was complaining to me about the trailer, saying he was spoiled about some elements.

In a recent episode of The Orville, captain Ed Mercer of the Union is stuck debating with a member of the Krill, a fanatic and xenophobic race in conflict with Earth&rsquo;s multi-species Planetary Union. He says:
 &ldquo;Look, from what we&rsquo;ve seen, when planets first achieve space travel and they venture out into the galaxy and discover that they&rsquo;re just one single species among a vast diversity of lifeforms, they usually react in one of two ways: they embrace and adapt to the fact that they&rsquo;re no longer the center of the universe, or they ratchet up their xenophobia.

I don&rsquo;t know much about this Konmari thing. I think it&rsquo;s been around for a while, but got a boost recently due to a Netflix special. I think I agree with it in principle, or at least what I know of it from secondary social media commentary. Minimalism is a worthwhile goal, and so is getting rid of things that do nothing for you other than take up space.

Some things I&rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:
I very much enjoyed Elseworlds, the Arrowverse crossover this year. I mean sure, a lot of it didn&rsquo;t make any sense, but it was like a love letter to DC fans. I actually consider myself more of a Marvel fan than DC, but I still loved it! I wrote a spoiler-free review over on the Tumblr.

The other day I was passing through the QC memorial circle (as is my wont) and I decided to walk around the tiangge/flea market that&rsquo;s often there. It seemd larger than usual that day, so I figured I should finally take a look.

I read this article about how Bill Gates spent 5 years not watching TV or listening to music in his twenties while building Microsoft. Now, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I watch a lot of TV, unapologetically. Quite possible too much. But I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if maybe I would be more productive if I had the same kind of discipline Bill Gates had, and maybe that would increase the odds that I could focus and create something of consequence?

Some things I&rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:
For some reason, I watched two biopics this month. The first one is Hidden Figures, about three black women who were instrumental during the early days of NASA leading up to the Friendship 7 mission piloted by John Glenn. The movie is fairly interesting if you are even remotely interested in either the challenges faced in black history or math and science or the early days of the space program competition between the USA and Russia.

During the past few years, I&rsquo;ve started following more artists (mostly comic-book related) on social media. Seeing the occasional art post wander across my feeds is often a welcome respite from the terrible news in the world today. I thought I&rsquo;d share some of my favorites!
Jim Lee is a comic book icon and for me his very detailed and elaborate pencils epitomize 90s comic art and his style still heavily influences many newer artists today.

I used to play a lot of JRPGs, especially back during they heyday of the Playstation Era. These days, I only get to play a few, but I still enjoy a lot of the music tracks from this game, often the battle music since I prefer more upbeat tracks. Here are some of my favorite JRPG tracks from recent years:
Rivers in the Desert (Persona 5) &ndash; easily the best song in the OST for me, and the rest of this OST is amazing so that&rsquo;s saying a lot.

1 Nov 2018 5:03amClose   Shogun was the first novel I ever read outside of required school readings and it remains one of favorites to this day after many rereadings. It had it all &ndash; the age of exploration, religious conflict, language barriers, duty, honor, love, betrayal, war, sacrifice, samurai, ninjas, guns, cannons, etc and it still influences my thinking to this day.

Some things I&rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:
Tom Clancy&rsquo;s Jack Ryan (on Amazon Prime) &ndash; surprisingly good, even if I&rsquo;m not too familiar with the Jack Ryan stuff. I only know John Krasinski from The Office,
Spoilers for Tom Clancy&rsquo;s Jack Ryan:
(Spoilers)  The story starts with Ryan tracking down Suleiman&rsquo;s network via financials, but they never follow-up on who was financing his group I&rsquo;m not sure what was the point of the whole drone pilot side story (including the weird trip to the casino and the night with the couple), although it was admittedly kind of entertaining   Daredevil season 3 (on Netflix) &ndash; I enjoyed the season a lot.

Comic books and superheroes have always tended to skew towards liberal philosophies, given how writers and artists tend to support ideals like individualism and free expression. So it&rsquo;s not surprising that the derivative shows tend to lean the same way. Not only do many of the shows promote diversity, but many are becoming overtly political as well. Some recent examples. (Spoilers for current seasons of Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow and Daredevil follow)

I&rsquo;ve been re-watching The Office (US) lately (it&rsquo;s a good show to leave running in the background while you&rsquo;re doing other stuff), and I just find the character of Michael Scott fascinating. He&rsquo;s funny and well-written and basically just a big bag of human flaws that somehow bumbles his way into managing an office. He&rsquo;s self-centered, attention-hungry, easily distracted, and refuses to acknowledge any bad news, yet despite all of that he loves his workmates like a family.

This started as one of those silly Facebook memes where you post one thing every day and didn&rsquo;t have to explain and you tagged other people and they continued with the meme. I was very bad at following the meme instructions, but I did find the exercise interesting. I found it difficult to identify 10 specific movies, and since I didn&rsquo;t explain during the FB posts, I thought I&rsquo;d make a blog post about them instead.

I realise it&rsquo;s a bit weird for me to be reviewing a marketing book, given my self-proclaimed aversion to marketing and sales. A while back I wrote a review for Tim Ferris&rsquo; book Tribe of Mentors on this blog, and for some reason someone decided to contact me citing this review and asked if I would review this other book and they would give me a complimentary copy. This was something new to me, so I thought I&rsquo;d try it out!

This book was on sale on Amazon Kindle a while back, I figured I&rsquo;d give it a whirl. Some years ago I had read one of the author&rsquo;s previous books, The Four Hour Workweek, and I wasn&rsquo;t too impressed. It was interesting at least, but a lot of the advice seemed either difficult to apply to my personal situation or involved doing stuff I wasn&rsquo;t really interested in (i.e. sales and marketing and whatnot).

When Game of Thrones entered its sixth season in 2016, it was true spoiler territory for those of us who had read the GRRM books before HBO&rsquo;s TV adaptation turned the property into a worldwide phenomenon. Due to the author&rsquo;s glacial writing pace, at this point the TV series went past the point that the novels had reached. Thus nobody &ndash; book readers or tv viewers &ndash; knew what events would unfold in the story.

First, the spoiler-free summary (spoilers after this part):
 overall a very entertaining movie to sit down and watch popcorn and to enjoy the jokes and the space battles and the different colored lights and the tiny adorable tree creature GOTG&rsquo;s humor was one of its strong points and for the 2nd movie, they push the comedy up a notch, perhaps a little too much in some places. Lots of funny gags and one-liners I felt like some of the character/background development stuff was pushed a bit too hard as well the movie&rsquo;s plot also felt a bit thin and straightforward.
