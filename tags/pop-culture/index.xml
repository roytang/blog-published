            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/page/lists/2020/movies/&#34;&gt;2020 Movies&lt;/a&gt; update: 7 movies watched in Feb. Probably the best movie I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this month was &lt;strong&gt;Knives Out&lt;/strong&gt;. (&lt;strong&gt;Jojo Rabbit&lt;/strong&gt; close second.) The goal of 200 movies for the year is getting farther!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for TV, I think most of my watching time was spent rewatching &lt;strong&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/strong&gt; for quiz purposes lol. Well, &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2020/02/criminal-minds/&#34;&gt;Criminal Minds&lt;/a&gt; ended, so there&amp;rsquo;s that. Arrowverse has been meh, though I did enjoy &lt;strong&gt;Supergirl&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s 100th episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hm, I guess I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually watched a lot of stuff in the past month. There&amp;rsquo;s a ton of stuff that I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to watch but haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten around to: The Expanse, Star Trek Picard, new season of Jack Ryan, Birds of Prey/Harley Quinn, and so on. We&amp;rsquo;ll see if things get better next month maybe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus, since this entry was kinda short: Here&amp;rsquo;s three movies I started watching but didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to finish:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/strong&gt;. It started off with like 20 minutes of some monkeys shouting at each other and a mysterious black box and I kind of lost interest. I&amp;rsquo;m sure that kind of thing was fine in 1968 when the movie came out and the people whose butts were already in the theatre were like &amp;ldquo;this is strange, but we&amp;rsquo;re already here, so we might as well sit through it&amp;rdquo;, but it&amp;rsquo;s 2020, I kind of need something to hold my internet-broken attention span more easily. It&amp;rsquo;s also one of the most renowned and highly-praised movies of all time, so I&amp;rsquo;m probably losing something here. Will try to resume it sometime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Conjuring&lt;/strong&gt;. We have a horror-movie themed quiz category coming up so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d watch a horror movie. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve voluntarily done so since having been mentally scarred by &lt;strong&gt;The Gate (1987)&lt;/strong&gt; as a kid. I picked The Conjuring, it was first on Netflix&amp;rsquo;s list of horror movies. I sat through the appropriately-creepy intro, then one of my quiz teammates told me he&amp;rsquo;d already unwillingly seen it before and couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep for a week after, and I was like &amp;ldquo;You just gave me an excuse not to watch it.&amp;rdquo; so I stopped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carrie (2013)&lt;/strong&gt;. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to give up on horror movies just yet, so I picked another title from Netflix. I chose this one because it had Hit-Girl. It started out with typical teenage bullying stuff before she manifested her mutant powers and after that I kept thinking they needed to contact Professor Xavier, and couldn&amp;rsquo;t take it seriously after that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;In 2010 I took a short work hiatus which meant I was often home for most of the day. Back then Netflix wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a thing, so I would often have local cable TV playing in the background of whatever I was doing. And it was because of this that I started regularly watching police procedurals. They&amp;rsquo;re not the cleverest or most highbrow of shows, but they&amp;rsquo;re more like a guilty pleasure. Most of it was &lt;strong&gt;NCIS&lt;/strong&gt;, which the cable channels loved showing for some reason, but during that time I also picked up other shows like the quirky &lt;strong&gt;Bones&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Castle&lt;/strong&gt;. But the best of these shows by far, was &lt;strong&gt;Criminal Minds&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criminal Minds, or CM for short (as the very small group of office friends who also enjoyed the show called it), was a cut above the rest for a number of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a strong, solid cast of interesting characters, my favorite was the &amp;ldquo;nerd&amp;rdquo; of the group, Dr. Spencer Reid, played by Matthew Gray Gubler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s serious stuff, the crimes in investigation almost always being of the serial killer variety; the other shows often sprinkled some light comedic moments across the episodes, such a thing was rare in CM, especially considering the subject matter they dealt with. What other shows would have as special season finale villains would be mere unsubs-of-the-week for the CM team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a focus on behavioral science and profiling in order to catch their unsubs. While I did read somewhere a while back that profiling isn&amp;rsquo;t held in as high regard nor considered as scientifically rigorous as the show makes it out to be, it&amp;rsquo;s still a reasonably good conceit for a TV show, and the framework helps the show establish villains with understandable motivations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these shows tended to have the trope of having an &amp;ldquo;ridiculously powerful tech guy&amp;rdquo; providing support for the team. The most egregious of these is NCIS&amp;rsquo; Abby, who is somehow able to do anything with a computer while at the same time being a top of the line forensic scientist. (NCIS is also famous for idiotic tech scenes that work nothing like IRL, such as the famous one where &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8qgehH3kEQ&#34;&gt;they have 2 people working one keyboard trying to stop a hacker&lt;/a&gt;). The best one is CM&amp;rsquo;s Penelope Garcia; like most such characters she can do basically anything with a computer, but this is a lot more believable than the rest because she is a complete nerd who was access to all the FBI databases. (Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, you definitely still have to suspend your disbelief a lot of times!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I&amp;rsquo;m writing about this show because their series finale ended this week, after 15 seasons. I started watching this show around the 3rd or 4th seasons (after Mandy Patinkin&amp;rsquo;s Jason Gideon had already left), and never stopped. (I later borrowed some DVDs from one of the office friends to back-watch the first few seasons). The series finale was reasonable, not the best I could have imagined (more on that later), and centered mostly around Reid and Garcia, appropriate since they were the only characters who had managed to stick around from season 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recurring villain for the final season was one carried over from season 14, and was kind of a disappointment. He was kind of hyped up to be a really big threat, the FBI&amp;rsquo;s Most Wanted, but he went out in just the most ridiculous way to somehow justify a spectacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the perfect idea a while back for how this show would end: it would involve Aaron Hotchner. He was one of the original CM FBI team members and head of the BAU (Behavioral Analysis Unit) from the time Mandy Patinkin left until he was written off the show in 2016 due to the actor Thomas Gibson having an altercation with someone from the crew. Because of the way he left, this suggestion would never have been viable, but I would have wanted Hotch to be the series&amp;rsquo; final unsub, finally breaking down after one last horrible event that forces him to relive all the trauma from all the previous seasons. And he would be the BAU&amp;rsquo;s greatest nemesis - someone who knows how they work and operate, who can counter all their moves and even use their profiling against them. In my head, it would have been glorious. Alas, it was not to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CM is actually the last of the police procedurals I was still watching. Others that I liked because of their quirkiness, such as Castle and Bones, had ended years ago.So it&amp;rsquo;s kind of an end of an era for me, not just the era of Criminal Minds, but the era of watching police procedurals in general. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot more stuff to watch now, so I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;d ever pick up such a show again. I did enjoy the show a lot during the course of the last ten years, despite the heavy subject matter, so I look back at it fondly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last time, wheels down.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Watching Lately, Jan 2020: Arrow, The Good Place, The Witcher, Kim&#39;s Convenience, The Expanse

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if I should continue this &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/tags/watching-lately&#34;&gt;watching-lately&lt;/a&gt; series since I already set up a separate page for &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/lists/2020/movies&#34;&gt;listing my 2020 movies watched&lt;/a&gt;. It might have been more consistent to have a list for the 2020 TV shows also? But then again, TV shows are a much different beast, since each show/season is broken into an episode and sometimes you watch them all in one go or sometimes over the span of a few months. So maybe let&amp;rsquo;s keep this going for the while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, movies. From the list for January, I think the best one was Parasite. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any expectations on what this movie was about yet somehow I still feel like it subverted those expectations anyway. I only saw 15 movies in January, which is below rate if I&amp;rsquo;m targetting 200 for the year. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s one of those NYR things that peters out after a month or so. Too early to tell, and besides, that&amp;rsquo;s not an insurmountable deficit. And 200 isn&amp;rsquo;t a hard target either so let&amp;rsquo;s just see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the realm of TV, this kind of explains why my movie-watching trailed off in the second half of the month, since the regular TV series started coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2020/01/arrowverse-crisis-on-infinite-earths/&#34;&gt;wrote about the Arrowverse crossover&lt;/a&gt; when the back half aired. This month the last two episodes of Arrow aired. The first one was a backdoor pilot for a new spinoff series, Green Arrow and the Canaries, starring Mia Queen. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to think about the spinoff or whether I&amp;rsquo;ll even try it out. The whole time travel thing seems so convoluted as a way to bring Mia, E2 Laurel and Dinah together. The second episode was the series finale, basically a retrospective on the entire series. They pulled out all the stops, bringing back supporting characters from all 8 seasons of the show (Except for Malcolm Merlyn, apparently John Barrowman was busy reappearing in a different series), and even surrendering to some long-time fan wishes such as Digg picking up a mysterious green object dropped from space. In spite of all my complaints about the poor writing on this show (and the related ones) through the years, I will admit the finale was pretty good and they stuck the landing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the rest of the Arrowverse, some comments that I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where else I can post, mostly on the post-crisis set up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently in the rebooted universe, there was still a multiverse (since E2 Laurel exists, and doppelgangers showed up in Supergirl), but then the other universes were destroyed in a crisis (probably similar but different than the one we actually watched.) This is totally different from the &amp;ldquo;it became one universe from the very start&amp;rdquo; ending of the original CoIE and took away from the crossover a bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was mildly annoyed when Jonn turned out to be able to restore pre-crisis memories. This only makes sense if what he&amp;rsquo;s restoring are part of his own memories, but not events he never knew about, otherwise, where did those pre-crisis memories come from? This annoyance was exacerbated by the GAatC backdoor pilot introducing a &amp;ldquo;device made by Cisco that replicates&amp;rdquo; Jonn&amp;rsquo;s powers so now anyone can restore pre-crisis memories, even from people Jonn has never met like future JJ. And in the Arrow finale, it seemed like everyone at the funeral was aware of the previous universe, did Jonn reset them too?? Seemed wholly unnecessary, but I suppose then we get difficult to explain things like Tommy wondering why E2 Laurel seems different&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fun fact: at Oliver&amp;rsquo;s funeral, Dinah is from before the GAatC episode (since in that episode she says she vanished after the funeral), Mia is from after that episode, and presumably so is E2 Laurel, although this isn&amp;rsquo;t explicitly specified. Timey-wimey!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Good Place&lt;/strong&gt; is also ending this week. As the time this post goes live, I will not have yet watched the season finale, but I did binge the rest of the seasons leading up to it, so maybe I can share some thoughts anyway. The Good Place was a weird series. It&amp;rsquo;s highly acclaimed and covers a lot of interesting topics philosophically, and puts its cast through a lot of interesting situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main issue with TGP is that I don&amp;rsquo;t find it particularly funny. Not like other Schur-influenced shows such as Brooklyn Nine Nine and Parks and Recreation. The characters can be charming sure and ridiculous sure. But their situations are rarely sitcom funny. I think part of it is that the situations they face are always so dire. I mean, their consequences somehow ramped up from eternal torture and damnation to the erasure of earth and all of humanity during the course of the series. Not very light-hearted topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another part of it might be the severe &lt;a href=&#34;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization&#34;&gt;Flanderization&lt;/a&gt; of the most of the characters. Typically this is a process that happens over the lifetime of a show, but with TGP, the characters&amp;rsquo; most annoying traits are highly focused on from the start: Eleanor is an asshole, Jason is an idiot, Tahani is a name-dropping socialite and Chidi is an anxious, undecisive philosopher. Eleanor and Chidi get a bit of character growth through the series (more Eleanor than Chidi), but Jason and Tahani are kind of still the same people by the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I like the show, but more for the questions it raises about how the afterlife could possibly work, rather than for pure comedic value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some friends somehow convinced me to watch &lt;strong&gt;Kim&amp;rsquo;s Convenience&lt;/strong&gt; (it was on NF). I have no regrets. It&amp;rsquo;s a smart, funny show about a Korean immigrant family in Canada. There were 3 seasons to binge on NF and it was very easy to side-watch since it&amp;rsquo;s a sitcom. The best character is the father of the family, a first-generation Korean immigrant who owns a convenience store (hence the show title). My only complaint is that it&amp;rsquo;s challenging my suspension of disbelief that the first generation immigrants still speak in English when among themselves, but as a friend said, it was probably for the sake of avoiding subtitles. Also, I wanted to see what the future Shang-chi actor looked like. Isn&amp;rsquo;t it kind of weird that he&amp;rsquo;s Chinese but he&amp;rsquo;s playing a Korean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shorter series I saw on Netflix was &lt;strong&gt;The Witcher&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty good, and I much prefer Henry Cavill as Geralt in this show rather than as Superman. (Although he looks nothing like W3 Geralt). I wish I had seen this series before playing the games, as it sets up a lot of the character back stories that I kind of just accepted in the games. Looking forward to future seasons!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I managed to watch the first half of The Expanse season 3. It takes me a whole to catch up with this show because each episode is heavy and a lot of things are always happening, so it always needs my full attention. It&amp;rsquo;s so good, and it&amp;rsquo;s not like those shows where you never get any answers, things actually get resolved at a reasonable pace. One and a half more seasons to catch up on!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Been watching a lot of things this December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally got back on &lt;strong&gt;The Expanse&lt;/strong&gt; after finishing S1 more than a year ago. I only finished S2, but it was already a vast improvement over S1. S1 felt like a lot of meandering around until the characters actually ran into the plot. S2 was stronger, faster-paced, and there&amp;rsquo;s always a lot of things going on in each episode. I really like this series now, looking forward to S3 and S4 when I have the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix-wise, I enjoyed their recently-added &lt;strong&gt;Jeopardy&lt;/strong&gt; series (always a great show to have playing in the background), the new documentary &lt;strong&gt;The Movies That Made Us&lt;/strong&gt; (loved their selection of movies to feature), and the second season of &lt;strong&gt;Final Space&lt;/strong&gt; (a fun sci-fi space romp if ever there was one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of crazy sci-fi, &lt;strong&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve caught up with the recently released S4 as well. This series seems a lot more self-aware now, and a lot more unafraid to make fun of tropes and genre conventions. I liked the heist episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcast-wise, I enjoyed the front half of the Arrowverse&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Crisis of Infinite Earths&lt;/strong&gt; crossover. It had that same feeling as Avengers Endgame where I knew what was likely to happen based on comic book knowledge, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t think they could do it, but they did it! Whenever discussion of this crossover leaked over to the mainstream TV subreddits/forums, there was a lot of criticism of how it looked so low-budget, but I think any expecations of them being able to provide Avengers-quality costumes and effects on a broadcast TV show budget are unrealistic. The Arrowverse shows certainly have a lot of flaws, but this type of multiversal crossover isn&amp;rsquo;t something that could have been achieved without all the setup of the past eight years (and even beyond, considering older shows like Smallville and 90&amp;rsquo;s Flash), and that&amp;rsquo;s something comparable to what the MCU has built, even at a fraction of the budget. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll have more words for this series and the Arrowverse in general when the back half airs in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend also somehow tricked me into watching &lt;strong&gt;Sky High&lt;/strong&gt;, a rather old and campy and totally predictable superhero-type movie. I did finish it so I guess I enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nieces were over this weekend so I finally got to watch &lt;strong&gt;Toy Story 4&lt;/strong&gt;. I was a bit skeptical that they decided to add another installment when I felt the trilogy was already pretty tight. I have to admit I was surprised with the direction this movie took and the ending it gave, which leaves an opening for future movies in the franchise, though they might already be quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched &lt;strong&gt;Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker&lt;/strong&gt; before Christmas, here are &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/12/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-spoilers/&#34;&gt;my thoughts on the film and the trilogy&lt;/a&gt;. WHile I wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely happy with it, I did enjoy watching the film and I recognize that it was a good retelling of Star Wars for new/modern fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also rewatched &lt;strong&gt;The Last Jedi&lt;/strong&gt; for the first time about a week later, it was still pretty good, especially that third act. (Casino subquest still felt superfluous). I did come out a bit more disappointed that ROS didn&amp;rsquo;t follow through with some of the themes of TLJ. I can only assume there are a couple of alternate universes out there where both Rian Johnson&amp;rsquo;s direction and JJ Abrams direction came true for the Skywalker saga ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Star Wars, I enjoyed the ending of &lt;strong&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/strong&gt;, although it did have a couple of weaker episodes in the middle that felt like filler (or maybe just there to seed characters for the eventual second season). The final two episodes are pretty good, and we get the payoffs of actualy learning the Mandalorian&amp;rsquo;s history and all. I do find it ridiculous that the Jedi and the Force are still unknown enough that the Mandalorian has never heard of them considering it probably hasn&amp;rsquo;t even been more than 30 years since Palpatine took down the Republic, which had literally an entire council of Jedi as an advisory body to the Senate and featuring prominently in the Clone Wars. Do they not have recorded history? Lol. In any case, I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to season 2 whenever it lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THat&amp;rsquo;s it for the decade!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I watched the most recent Star Wars last night. Spoiler-free review posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/12/rise-of-skywalker/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this ended the sequel trilogy and the entire &amp;ldquo;Skywalker Saga&amp;rdquo;, I thought it deserved a bit more spoilery discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure we needed to introduce some brand new characters in the third movie that don&amp;rsquo;t even get that much buildup because there were so many other things happening, unless they were seeded here for purposes of future Star Wars movie, which is just silly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much fondness for the guy, but Hux deserved better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some great appearances here that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lando showing up in the desert planet wearing the same outfit he used as a disguise in the first act of &lt;em&gt;Return of the Jedi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Han appearing as a hallucination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wedge Antilles is still alive! And comes back with Lando and Chewie to help out during the final space battle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the parallels with &lt;em&gt;Return of the Jedi&lt;/em&gt; are glaringly obvious, especially for the third act: Rey going alone to face off against the evil emperor while the rebellion pursues a last-chance and hopeless space battle outdoors? Check. Series protagonist face turn at the last minute? Check. Lando piloting the Falcon as a general in the final space battle? Check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the sequel trilogy really suffered from not having a single creative vision for all three movies. J.J. Abrams and Rian Johnson obviously wanted to take the franchise in two different directions, with Abrams wanting to make an homage to the original trilogy with new characters, and Johnson wanting to explore what there is outside of the original trilogy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, Abrams has to do a strong pull back from the second film, which meant he had a whole lot more setup to do, leading to ridiculous things like a huge plot point like Palpatine&amp;rsquo;s return being introduced in the opening crawl and that messy frantic pace of a first act&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine now where else the franchise could have gone, but I would have liked to see something like:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Episode 7 as homage to original trilogy and passing of the torch to new characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Episode 8 as subverting expectations and striking in a different direction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Episode 9 as defining a new kind of future for Star Wars, perhaps with more Force users, not necessarily Jedi or Sith&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instead what we get with &lt;em&gt;Rise of Skywalker&lt;/em&gt; is basically the same ending as &lt;em&gt;Return of the Jedi&lt;/em&gt;: The evil emperor is defeated (the same evil emperor at that!) and the rebellion is victorious and celebrating and now only one Jedi remains and balance exists in the force. I can understand wanting to do a modern re-telling for a new generation of fans, but we lived with that ending since 1983, it would have been nice to see something different this time. Such was not to be. (And I&amp;rsquo;m sure the mixed reaction to &lt;em&gt;Last Jedi&lt;/em&gt; had a hand in Disney deciding to be more conservative with this one)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s really weird for me that the &amp;ldquo;Skywalker Saga&amp;rdquo; ends with a new Skywalker emerging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final Skywalker saga rankings: 5-ESB &amp;gt; 4-ANH &amp;gt; 6-ROJ &amp;gt; 3.5-RO &amp;gt; 7-TFA &amp;gt; 8-TLJ == 3-RTS &amp;gt; 9-ROS &amp;gt; SOLO &amp;gt; 2-AOC &amp;gt; 1-TPM&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Nothing in the cinema this month (going to the cinema is expensive!). I did watch a couple of animated movies this month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dragonball Super: Broly. I have some vague recollection of watching the original Broly movie, and I believe this one is much better. DBS Broly is a slightly more nuanced character than just &amp;ldquo;random raging monster&amp;rdquo; from the previous non-canon movie. The animation was okay, you could tell the animators were having fun with some of the battle parts. Also, I watched the English dub, and I just realized Goku&amp;rsquo;s voice is super annoying, so I pity the Americans who had to grow up with that voice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Justice League vs the Fatal Five. I&amp;rsquo;m still a bit behind on the DC animated stuff. I liked this one because I think it handled Jessica Cruz fairly well, and it got me backreading Justice League Odyssey for more Cruz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TV-wise, since I got a &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/11/new-video-card/&#34;&gt;new video card&lt;/a&gt; and have a second monitor again, side-watching is back on the menu, so I was able to catch up with some of the ongoing series: Modern Family (meh), Simpsons (meh), Rick and Morty (ok so far, only 3 eps in).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I caught Season 3 of The Toys That Made Us on Netflix. Not as fun as S2 for me since that one had Transformers, and I only have secondary interest at best in the toylines for S4, but some of the stories here were pretty interesting, like they say that the giant robot from Japanese Spider-Man was the one that inspired sentai robots! What! The TMNT ep was also pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrowverse is still going on (somehow), with their upcoming big-deal Crisis crossover kicking off in mid December. Surprisingly, Arrow itself has been pretty good this season (perhaps because no Felicity? lol), followed by Flash, with Supergirl dead last. I am not fond of Lena&amp;rsquo;s heel turn in Supergirl, I felt like it was a disservice to the character who when introduced was desperate to get out of her brother&amp;rsquo;s shadow. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been watching Batwoman, even though it&amp;rsquo;s part of the crossover, we&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to watch the first ep of Mandalorian, but haven&amp;rsquo;t had time yet for the most recent eps. It&amp;rsquo;s not the sort of thing I&amp;rsquo;d side-watch, so I have to dedicate time for it. I better do that before the spoilers catch up with me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next month I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crisis on Infinite Earths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star Wars: Rise of the Skywalker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Actually watched something in the cinema this month: &lt;strong&gt;Joker&lt;/strong&gt;. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t originally sure if I wanted to see it, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t hyped for it at all in the months prior. But as the showing date came nearer, there was a lot of buzz around it so I decided to go anyway. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like it lived up to the hype and the warnings about promoting incel stuff, but at least it&amp;rsquo;s one of the higher-grossing DC movies, so maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll have more to come in that vein. MCU movies all have kind of same-y tone and feel, so probably DC can differentiate itself by doing these heavier movies with a different kind of style. My spoiler-free review of this movie is &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/10/1180086308963618816/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching Joker and also reading Scorsese recent comments about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/04/martin-scorsese-says-marvel-movies-are-not-cinema&#34;&gt;MCU movies not really being cinema&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to watch one of his movies and decided on &lt;strong&gt;Goodfellas&lt;/strong&gt;. (The only other one I had seen prior to this was &lt;em&gt;Shutter Island&lt;/em&gt;, which for a long while I thought was a Nolan flick.) Goodfellas was pretty good, definitely nothing like an MCU movie. They are obviously different kinds of &amp;ldquo;cinema&amp;rdquo; altogether, with the MCU movies leaning more towards the &amp;ldquo;popcorn&amp;rdquo; side of the spectrum. I did find it a bit hard to take Joe Pesci seriously here since I only really knew him from &lt;em&gt;Home Alone&lt;/em&gt;. I believe this is also the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen Ray Liotta in a film, so now I know who he is. I definitely enjoyed the &amp;ldquo;slice-of-life&amp;rdquo; look into the old-school gangster lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also watched &lt;strong&gt;Stuber&lt;/strong&gt;, mostly because this movie kept being advertised when I was in the US and it reminded me of Deadpool and that taxi driver friend of his. I was only expecting Batista, but Karen Gillan is also here (briefly!), so there&amp;rsquo;s a tiny GotG reunion there. Indian taxi driver dude was cool, the movie was ok, moderately funny, nothing too genre-busting. More popcorn movies for scorsese to snub his nose at, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catching up on my backlog of DC animated films, I decided to watch &lt;strong&gt;Wonder Woman: Bloodlines&lt;/strong&gt;. Plot spoilers, it&amp;rsquo;s basically a gaggle of WW villains (Silver Swan, Doctor Poison, Doctor Cyber, Cheetah, Giganta) plotting to invade Themyscira, I suspect to make them more well-known among the DC animated viewers. Coincidentally, I had also recently read the WW Rebirth story arc where a gaggle of WW villains tried to trick her into revealing the location of Themyscira, so I had a fresh point of comparison. In the comic book arc, everything was masterminded by Veronica Cale, a pharmaceutical CEO who had been created in the early 2000s with the intent of being the Lex Luthor to WW&amp;rsquo;s Superman. In the movie Cale works with WW for a while, and along I was waiting for the reveal that she was behind everything, but that never came. I would guess they have some bigger plans for Veronica Cale down the line in the DC animared film-universe. Otherwise, the movie was ok. Nothing too spectacular, missable, but also good enough to watch. EDIT: I found out after I wrote this that Bloodlines had a mid-credits scene where WW figures out Cale was behind everything all along!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TV-wise, not much to say right now. The fall shows are back, that means the Arrowverse is in full swing again (except for Legends, they&amp;rsquo;ll be back in January). The &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo; on &lt;strong&gt;Flash&lt;/strong&gt; is still ridiculous. The flash forwards on &lt;strong&gt;Arrow&lt;/strong&gt; are still boring (I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why they want to make a spinoff for Mia Smoak!), &lt;strong&gt;Supergirl&lt;/strong&gt; is also a bit meh. I&amp;rsquo;m really only looking forward to the Crisis crossover this season (and of course, &lt;em&gt;Legends of Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;.) Haven&amp;rsquo;t watched Batwoman yet, maybe I should since she has one of the five Crisis episodes. Also been following some of the regular stuff: The Good Place, Modern Family, etc. There&amp;rsquo;s also a lot of superhero shows still on the backlog, some of which I may never get to watch: Runaways, Cloak and Dagger (cancelled!), Krypton (cancelled!), Legion (finished!), Doom Patrol, Titans S2, etc. Maybe there&amp;rsquo;s a point where there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt; content for comic book fans? Lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix: I saw that Jenny Slate has a standup special out and I tried watching it, but eh, not for me, found it very boring and stopped about a third of the way through. I also found myself re-watching the end of &lt;strong&gt;Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood&lt;/strong&gt;, mostly because I was envious of a friend who was watching it for the first time. Was surprised to learn the anime is 10 years old as of this year! Still held up well, possibly my favorite anime of all time. The final confrontation and fight scenes were great, although the epilogue episode was a bit anticlimactic and awkward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it for this month. Maybe next month we manage to dent the ever-growing backlog? Maybe?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Watching Lately: September 2019: Dark Phoenix, The Ranch

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I finally got around to watching &lt;strong&gt;X-Men Dark Phoenix&lt;/strong&gt; which I skipped when it came out mainly because (a) poor reviews, and while normally I&amp;rsquo;d have watched it anyway since I have not missed any of the X-Men movies in the cinema, not even the horrendous Wolverine Origins, there was also to consider that (b) I was in the US at the time and was only willing to spend my precious dollars on one expensive American cinema and &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/07/spider-man-far-from-home/&#34;&gt;Spider-man Far From Home&lt;/a&gt; won out. The movie wasn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; bad really, at least I felt better about it than the aforementioned Wolverine Origins. Here are &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/notes/2019/09/1171737237135867906/&#34;&gt;some of my nitpicks&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s not what would&amp;rsquo;ve been the best ending for the X-Men series which was really one of the pioneers of the superhero movie revolution (alongside Raimi&amp;rsquo;s Spider-Man), but that&amp;rsquo;s what we got. At least it ended with a big fiery bird explosion in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also watched Part 7 of &lt;strong&gt;The Ranch&lt;/strong&gt; on Netflix. The Ranch is one of those weird family comedy/drama shows that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally seem to be in my spheres of interest, especially since the show is probably a lot more appealing to conservative/right-wing viewers. (It&amp;rsquo;s often punctuated by country music and the characters regularly criticize Hillary Clinton and mock the idea of climate change.) I will not admit that I got into it mostly because of Elisha Cuthbert. It is a moderately enjoyable show, the kind you don&amp;rsquo;t mind having run in the background while you&amp;rsquo;re doing something else, although it did lose a bit of its comedy punch with the firing/writing off of Danny Masterson (&amp;ldquo;Hyde&amp;rdquo; from the 70s show) last season due to #MeToo issues, and the guy they replaced him with hasn&amp;rsquo;t been super impressive thus far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slow month again this time. The lull should pick up in October once the fall US shows start off. And there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of movies I want to watch too but some combination of laziness and lack of time always puts them off.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Hmm, surprisingly I haven&amp;rsquo;t watched too much stuff this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;eigasai&#34;&gt;Eigasai&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched a Japanese film at Eigasai in UP Diliman for the first time ever, upon the invite of some friends. We saw &lt;strong&gt;One Cut of the Dead&lt;/strong&gt; a comedy zombie film. It was great and it was hilarious, although you must make sure not to lose patience with the first thirty minutes. I went in blind not knowing anything about it other than &amp;ldquo;Japanese comedy zombie movie&amp;rdquo;, so you should too! Easily one of the funniest movies I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;young-justice&#34;&gt;Young Justice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back half of Young Justice Outsiders finished this week. I&amp;rsquo;ve honestly been a bit whelmed for this half of the season as I feel like they&amp;rsquo;re all over the place and there&amp;rsquo;s too many plot threads going on at once. Still an enjoyable watch especially for DC fans of course. The thing about having such a large cast is that it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to focus on any one of them too long, but this season was all about Halo, Geoforce and Cyborg so the arc endings pretty much revolved around those three. It feels like so many status quo changes happened in the last episode though, felt a bit crammed. Also, some spoilers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;details class=&#34;spoiler&#34;&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;(Spoilers)&lt;/summary&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I feel like the Light declaring at the end that their gains were sufficient vs Luthor&amp;rsquo;s original plans seemed ridiculous (i.e. controlling Markovia vs controlling and registering all superhumans). They already had one puppet nation under their control (Queen Bee is right there!) and they&amp;rsquo;re literally planning to go against Darkseid, how does controlling Markovia help? Feels like a very post-facto justification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did like that they chose not to complete their Judas Contract re-telling in a similar manner and we get a &amp;ldquo;redeemed&amp;rdquo; Tara to contrast with the &amp;ldquo;fallen&amp;rdquo; Geoforce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fleabag&#34;&gt;Fleabag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about this Amazon Prime series going in either, only that it was a comedy and it was well-reviewed. I did enjoy watching it, although it&amp;rsquo;s more of a tragic comedy than anything else. Basically about how people deal with absurdly difficult situations in their daily life. The story is well-told, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I get all the hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-boys&#34;&gt;The Boys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Amazon Prime series. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t read the source material, and I was a bit turned off by the first episode, but I powered through. I knew it would be dark going in, and possibly gratuitous in terms of the sex and violence at some points, so not many surprises there. The plot seems in my head to be &amp;ldquo;What if superheroes were driven by a greedy corporation&amp;rdquo;, which certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t help address my &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2018/10/capitalism/&#34;&gt;misgivings about capitalism&lt;/a&gt;. The plot also reminds me of Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s book Reckoners, which was also a story about a resistance trying to oppose a superhuman regime led by a Superman-like figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking over the Wikipedia entry for the comic book series, it seems the TV show had some significant divergences, which is understandable, so I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll be seeking out the comic books. The series was enjoyable enough to binge over a few days, although some parts are a bit predictable. I did like the treatment given to Hugh and Annie/Starlight. The cast is pretty good too, I almost didn&amp;rsquo;t recognize Simon Pegg (because it was such a serious role) and Elisabeth Shue (because&amp;hellip;I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen her in anything in a while?). Oh and Gus Fring is also here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I ended up enjoying the season overall, as it tackles a lot of issues I relate with. I will probably be watching Season 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rockos-modern-life-static-cling&#34;&gt;Rocko&amp;rsquo;s Modern Life: Static Cling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix tried to bring Rocko into the modern era, although strangely none of the characters have aged at all. Although they are cartoon characters so I guess that makes sense? The special is about as ridiculous as the old cartoon was, unsurprisingly, although it does try to convey a message about how change is an inevitable part of life. I did like that they had a reference to my favorite episode, R-E-C-Y-C-L-E Recycle~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More next month! Maybe!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I was travelling for most of the past two months, so this covers both June and July, and I guess I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to watch too much. Maybe? IDK, we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was in the US, I took the opportunity to finish watching &lt;strong&gt;Voltron: Legendary Defender&lt;/strong&gt; which only had two seasons available on PH Netflix. Pretty good adaptation, lots of fun callbacks to the old series. Some annoying filler eps, especially in the middle seasons onwards. I like how they spent the entire series going through the main Voltron villains one by one: first Zarkon, then Lotor, then a little bit of Sendak, then finally Hagar. It got a bit too hocus pocus magicky BS near the finale for me, but overall a pretty good watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were staying with relatives in the US, it turns out they&amp;rsquo;re really fond of watching Filipino movies. I&amp;rsquo;m not big on Filipino movies, most of them seem either uninspired, formulaic or outright ridiculous. I did enjoy a couple of the ones that I sat through, at least enough to comment on them, coincidentally both starring Eddie Garcia (RIP). The first one was &lt;strong&gt;Rainbow&amp;rsquo;s Sunset&lt;/strong&gt;, which has Eddie Garcia playing a senior citizen ex-politician who comes out as gay and explores the repurcussions to his children and grandchildren. This movie had a strange ending that came out of nowhere though. The second movie was &lt;strong&gt;Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Waiting&lt;/strong&gt; where Garcia portrays an old man who has died and finds himself in a waiting area before he can be sent to heaven, basically purgatory. In this place he finds an old flame of his from his youth, who has secretly been waiting for him all this time, refusing to advance to heaven. The movie explores themes of life and death and love and regret and commitment, but in a context outside of the typical Filipino love team movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a bunch of other Netflix movies watched - these folks didn&amp;rsquo;t have that much to do at home - but the only other one I remember sitting through was &lt;strong&gt;Murder Mystery&lt;/strong&gt; starring Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston. Basically a comedic whodunnit, it was entertaining enough to sit through, but nothing too special. I did like the car chase scene at the end though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from watching on Netflix, I also tried out an American cinema and watched &lt;strong&gt;Spider-man Far From Home&lt;/strong&gt; with a friend. I have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/07/spider-man-far-from-home/&#34;&gt;separate blog post&lt;/a&gt; for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murder Mystery might not have been too special, but it did inspire me to watch the copy I had of &lt;strong&gt;Murder on the Orient Express&lt;/strong&gt; when I got back home. It was my first exposure to Hercule Poirot, and I was pleasantly surprised by the star-studded cast. It&amp;rsquo;s the sort of movie where you can&amp;rsquo;t watch it twice though; I suppose all whodunits are like that, but now I can&amp;rsquo;t watch the older movie based on this book. There&amp;rsquo;s supposedly a sequel coming out next year, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll watch that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the trip, there was a whole lot of shows to catch up on. The only one I managed to complete was &lt;strong&gt;Jessica Jones S3&lt;/strong&gt;, the final season among the erstwhile Netflix-Marvel shows. I liked this season, mostly because it went way more dark than I expected and had a very &amp;ldquo;Criminal Minds&amp;rdquo;/procedural kind of vibe since her main antagonist here was a serial killer, and one of the themes is how a hero has to play by the rules and can&amp;rsquo;t just do whatever he wants like killing criminals. (This kind of message always resonates with me now because of where the country is.) While I feel like it might have been better to cap the Netflix-Marvel venture with Daredevil&amp;rsquo;s fantastic season 3, this one isn&amp;rsquo;t a bad ending either. I suspect I will do a more detailed look back on these shows soonish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I have a ton of shows to catch up on. Good Omens, Stranger Things, Doom Patrol, Legion, etc to name a few. And I missed out on a few movies though, like Dark Phoenix, which I was tempted to watch in the cinema despite the bad reviews, because I&amp;rsquo;ve never missed any of the prior X-Men movies, not even Wolverine Origins. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll have time to catch up on all of this stuff before the Fall TV season comes in!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;The big TV thing of May 2019 was of course, the much maligned finale for &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve written about that separately &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/05/game-of-thrones/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the US TV series also ended their runs in May. Arrowverse show seasons were littered with poor writing as usual. I rank the seasons in this order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;best is &lt;em&gt;Legends of Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt; season 4. The reason Legends is the best is that they&amp;rsquo;re not afraid to be outrageous. My favorite moment was from before the midseason break, Puppets of Tomorrow!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;second best is &lt;em&gt;Supergirl&lt;/em&gt; season 4. I don&amp;rsquo;t like that Supergirl always felt very preachy about modern-day issues like feminism and diversity and immigration, and this season amped that up a lot, but I still enjoyed it because (a) Lex Luthor was great; and (b) they adapted a couple of my favorite DC Superman storylines, namely Manchester Black and the Elite and Red Son (Red Daughter in this case).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;third best is &lt;em&gt;Flash&lt;/em&gt; season 5. Cicada was a terrible villain and the rules of when and how the dagger works were just screwy, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad Eobard gets to come back in the ending (though I still don&amp;rsquo;t know why he has Wells&amp;rsquo; face)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;last is &lt;em&gt;Arrow&lt;/em&gt; season 7, just poor all-around writing, including an episode where Roy Harper flat out murders two innocents and everyone else on Team Arrow is like &amp;ldquo;Huh, okay, we&amp;rsquo;ll cover this up so the police don&amp;rsquo;t find out&amp;rdquo;, and a poorly explained road to Star City&amp;rsquo;s future. The season finale tellss us that Oliver dies during the upcoming Crisis of Infinite Earths. Arrow had a good run, but a few of the seasons were really week. It didn&amp;rsquo;t get as many seasons as Smallville did, but it has a legacy of its own (and arguably Smallville lasted a couple of seasons too long as well). More on this when Arrow&amp;rsquo;s abbreviated eighth and final season finishes later this year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all my complaints, I&amp;rsquo;m still looking forward to this year&amp;rsquo;s Crisis crossover!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of DC TV series, &lt;em&gt;Gotham&lt;/em&gt; also ended its 5-season run, and although the show diverges significantly from the traditional Batman mythos, I still liked it. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t spectacular or anything, but there were some nice portrayals of many Batman characters and events. We never get to see Bruce don the cape and cowl, although it is heavily foreshadowed in the last episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Bang Theory also had its series finale, and I liked it. Overall as a series it had its flaws, and at many times promoted smart-shaming and nerd stereotypes, but its a sitcom, so I don&amp;rsquo;t take it too seriously. I think the ending of Sheldon getting his nobel prize (with Amy) and finally acknowledging how difficult he has been as a friend is an appropriate ending for the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my attempt to watch/read more &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/tags/manga/&#34;&gt;manga&lt;/a&gt;/anime again, I started watching &lt;em&gt;Boku no Hero Academia&lt;/em&gt; on Netflix a few months ago, but only got two episodes in. This month I finally binged the rest of the anime and for good measure caught up with the manga as well. This series feels like some cross of One Punch Man (for the superpowers and the modern society) and Naruto (for the kids being supervised by adults), except I&amp;rsquo;d say the depth of the lore so far is not that much, more OPM than Naruto. Still a fairly enjoyable read/watch, since I usually enjoy shonen manga/anime, and it got me thinking that Marvel should make a shonen version of an X-Men comic someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much movies-wise this month, though I did do a rewatch of &lt;em&gt;Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; the other day, mostly because I had watched some videos ranking the MCU movies now that Endgame is done. Winter Soldier was always in my #1 slot, and the rewatch basically affirmed that. I had only meant to watch a little bit before going off to do something else, but the pacing of the movie was so great I just ended up watching it to the end. I think the themes of freedom vs security also really resonate with the liberal in me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it for this month! Next month I&amp;rsquo;ll be travelling, so who knows what I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to watch! I&amp;rsquo;ll have access to US Netflix!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;After a much-maligned eighth and final season, HBO&amp;rsquo;s Game of Thrones is done. Unmarked spoilers follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eighth season was so notoriously bad, we got petitions asking for rewrites. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I explained it to a friend after the notorious episode 5:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not about characters being killed, it&amp;rsquo;s about bad writing because they&amp;rsquo;re cramming. The writers were determined to finish the show in 2 smaller seasons so they&amp;rsquo;re skipping a lot of necessary character development and characters just do stupid things because the plot demands it. The most recent episode (spoilers follow, no apologies) has Dany do something really bad and out of character. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been so bad if they had spent maybe 5-6 episodes building up to it, but there&amp;rsquo;s nothing, she just decided out of nowhere, fuck it, let&amp;rsquo;s do this. The show was already very simplified compared to the books, which had a lot of plot threads and character arcs that never carried over to the show, which is understandable given the volume, and season 8 basically dumbs it down even more so they can hit their target number of episodes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final episode aired today, and I was mostly whelmed. A big meh. It&amp;rsquo;s always challenging to finish in a satisfying manner an epic story with many intersecting character arcs, especially something this popular. You are almost always not going to please everybody. Some endings made sense, some I could see that GRRM was probably planning for all along, some came out of nowhere (Arya the Explorer comes to mind). Like many things about season 8, so much of it feels crammed and unearned. The season might have been better received if they had stretched things out more. As it is, they had to do things like have Tyrion justify Dany&amp;rsquo;s madness in a speech to Jon after the fact, instead of building up to it organically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiencing the series as a book reader was interesting, since we knew what was going to happen for basically the first five seasons. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;m not the only book reader who was excited to see how TV viewers would react to things like the execution of Ned Stark and the Red Wedding. Once the series overtook the books, we then fell into this weird position of having the show spoil the books. Not that we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t still read the books, but the show leaving out certain elements changes their importance in the books. For example, the absence of the Lady Stoneheart and Young Griff in the shows implied those plot threads were actually irrelevant to the show&amp;rsquo;s ultimate ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think the poor writing in season 8 makes me look forward to the books more, if only to see if and how GRRM is able to deliver a better and more satisfying ending. I think the ending for the Starks is probably what he had in mind all along (or very close to it); in his initial outline for the entire series, it was always about the Starks. Whether he sticks to that plan or pivots after seeing the reactions to the show, we shall see. I read a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dsilvermint/status/1125856091261136896?s=21&#34;&gt;great thread on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; describing GRRM as a &amp;ldquo;pantser&amp;rdquo; kind of writer, i.e. he writes by the seat of his pants, letting the characters and events drive the story forward instead of strictly following an outline. It makes for good narrative, but is probably also why he&amp;rsquo;s taking forever to finish. And we hope he will finish! Maybe someday, when the books are done, we eventually get a better and more faithful remake series (cue the &amp;ldquo;Game of Thrones: Brotherhood&amp;rdquo; jokes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall though, I think history will look kindly on the entire series of Game of Thrones for what it did. It brought epic fantasy to the forefront of pop culture. People talked excitedly about every episode as it came out and speculated about what would happen. Even my dad got into it, even though I often had to explain some bits to him, and he didn&amp;rsquo;t like watching the show without subtitles. They failed to stick the landing, so they don&amp;rsquo;t belong in the same conversation as series like &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt;, but there were a lot of epic moments and some very good television in those eight seasons, and the show ultimately deserves its places in the cultural zeitgeist. Because of this show, we are getting other epic fantasies as TV series moving forward. I&amp;rsquo;m most looking forward to Amazon&amp;rsquo;s upcoming &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/05/wheel-of-time-new-spring/&#34;&gt;Wheel of Time&lt;/a&gt; series, hopefully they don&amp;rsquo;t screw it up. (That one would take maybe two decades to finish!)&lt;/p&gt;

            <guid>https://roytang.net/2019/05/wheel-of-time-eye-of-the-world/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Continuing with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/05/wheel-of-time-new-spring/&#34;&gt;Wheel of Time re-read&lt;/a&gt;! I devoured Eye of the World much more quickly than I expected, finishing the book in less than 3 days. It helps that I had already read it before of course, but I think there&amp;rsquo;s also a part of me that enjoys escaping into this fantasy world when the &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/05/ph-elections-2019-otso-diretso-compromises-lesser-evils/&#34;&gt;real world outlook seems dire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the book shows a lot of Tolkien-esque plot influence, especially near the start: Some kids from a backwater village are visited by a magic user and after some troubles are forced on the run from black riders? Sounds familiar. Not only that, but you can even map the characters somewhat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emond Field kids -&amp;gt; Hobbits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moiraine -&amp;gt; Gandalf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lan -&amp;gt; Aragorn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thom -&amp;gt; Okay, LoTR didn&amp;rsquo;t have a bard, but he does take the role of sacrificing himself while the kids run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s even a location called the Mountains of Dhoom, which is a riduclous name!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s fine. I remember back when I read this series the first time I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much patience for Jordan&amp;rsquo;s prose where he describes everything in so many words including the food being eaten, the clothes worn, the crowds, the buildings and so on; I was always hungry for the plot so I tended to skim a lot of the background noise. This time I made more of an effort to appreciate the prose and the settings, since I already knew most of the plot. It is not as boring as I feared it would be, and perhaps my imagination is more enriched because of it. The characters certainly look a bit different in my head now than they did before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the book does take its time. After Shadar Logoth, the party gets split up and it takes them forever to be reunited. It isn&amp;rsquo;t until 85% through the book that everyone gets back together and Moiraine concludes that they have to go visit the titular Eye of the World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nynaeve and Lan relationship wasn&amp;rsquo;t built up very well either I think. It seems they just were suddenly affectionate near the end, after barely anything more than longing looks and barely any conversations for most of the book. Also, I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the WoT TV series if only to learn how to properly pronounce &amp;ldquo;Nynaeve&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book ends with a victory for the good guys. Not THE victory, as some of them think, but it is a victory. But it is also a strange place, as Rand discovers what he can do and decides to leave the group for a while. The next book takes them to Ilian for the Great Hunt I believe, and I seem to recall that it may be a long time before the Emond Fielders are together in the same place again. Onwards!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Since I was going to be taking a long trip in a month, I was looking for some books to read on the plane and in airports and whatnot while waiting. I settled on a re-read of Robert Jordan&amp;rsquo;s Wheel of Time series, a pretty good time for it since by next year we may have a TV series from Amazon (hopefully better than Game of Thrones). Side note: Wheel of Time is also why I&amp;rsquo;m not optimistic that GRRM can finish ASoIaF in just two more books - Jordan took forever and died before he could finish WoT and even Sanderson who took over needed an additional three books to finish the saga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I read any of the books - I bought and read the final book &lt;em&gt;A Memory of Light&lt;/em&gt; when it came out, so that was around 2013. That means I followed the series for around two decades - I remember borrowing &lt;em&gt;Eye of the World&lt;/em&gt; from a friend maybe around late high school/early college (circa mid 90s) and quickly going through the books until I was caught up. Wheel of Time was my first real epic fantasy series - I only read Tolkien later on and before that most of my fantasy exposure was limited to TV and movies. I enjoyed the first half of the 14-book series, then got &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2005/05/wheel-of-time-10-crossroads-of-twilight/&#34;&gt;annoyed by the pacing in the second half&lt;/a&gt;, and was relieved when Sanderson managed to satisfactorily land the plane with &lt;a href=&#34;https://tumblr.roytang.net/post/41200573244/so-i-finished-reading-a-memory-of-light-today&#34;&gt;Memory of Light&lt;/a&gt;. My annoyance with the later books may have been due to the fact that I had to wait for each one in turn to be released - it will be interesting to see how the series holds up for me now that I can read all the books in succession. I also like to think I&amp;rsquo;ve matured as a reader since then and will be able to appreciate the books differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also well behind my book reading target for this year, so doing a re-read of a long series gives me a good bump. Also, since the books have been out forever, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to bother to mark spoilers when I&amp;rsquo;m discussing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am however starting with a book I haven&amp;rsquo;t read yet - &lt;em&gt;New Spring&lt;/em&gt; is a prequel novel that I never bothered to read before. The story takes place 20 years before &lt;em&gt;Eye of the World&lt;/em&gt;, so it&amp;rsquo;s a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story follows the PoV of two characters introduced in &lt;em&gt;Eye of the World&lt;/em&gt; - Moiraine Damodred, starting out as an Accepted with future Amyrlin Siuan Sanche at the White Tower in Tar Valon, and Lan Mandragoran, fresh off the tail end of the Aiel War and how their paths eventually intersect. Given the two main characters future, we can anticipate that the novel will end with them forming the Warder bond. The book is short - about half as long as &lt;em&gt;Eye of the World&lt;/em&gt; - but as is typical of Robert Jordan, it takes a long time to get there, as most of the first half of the book centers around Moiraine and Siuan navigating the intrigues of the White Tower as the search for The Dragon Reborn begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pace picks up a bit once Moiraine manages to leave the tower and crosses path with Lan and they realize the existence of the Black Ajah searching for the Dragon Reborn. Yes, reading this book before the rest means you are already aware the Black Ajah exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given how at the start of this book Lan is openly disdainful of getting caught in Aes Sedai problems and how tight Moiraine and Lan are by the time of &lt;em&gt;Eye of the World&lt;/em&gt;, I assumed there would be some big life-changing event near the end of the book that would cause him to change his mind and allow the Warder bond, but I was a bit whelmed by how it happened. One would think losing his oldest bondsman to the Black Ajah would Lan more wary of Aes Sedai, but all it took was a quick reminder from Moiraine about the stakes and he easily acquiesed to the bond. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished the book in 3 days (as I said, quite short), but the other books in the series are at least twice as long, and there are 14 more books to go, so I think there should be plently leftover by the time the trip rolls around.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve already written extensively about &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/04/more-thoughts-on-avengers-endgame-and-the-mcu/&#34;&gt;Avengers Endgame&lt;/a&gt;, but there are other things I watched this month too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shazam&lt;/strong&gt; came out early this month, and while it was unfortunately sandwiched between MCU blockbusters, it was a fun adventure romp and surprised me in a few ways. I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://tumblr.roytang.net/post/183916511215/shazam-spoiler-free-review&#34;&gt;short spoiler-free review&lt;/a&gt; over on Tumblr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TV-wise, I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a rewatch binge of &lt;strong&gt;30 Rock&lt;/strong&gt; that unfortunately started with season 4 due to Amazon Prime&amp;rsquo;s weird way of presenting things. I&amp;rsquo;ve already blown past the series finale and wrapped around to the start and currently at season 2, so close to completion. The series is as great and insane as I remember. It&amp;rsquo;s like a more outrageous version of ensemble comedies like Parks and Recreation, and though I am fonder of PNR, I can see why 30 Rock is the more award-winning show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek Discovery&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;The Orville&lt;/strong&gt; finished their second seasons this month. Discovery closed off their time loops neatly and sent the Discovery into an unknown future, meaning they get to start season 3 now no longer bound by Star Trek history and free to forge their own path. The season was ok, I enjoyed the classic Trek references and all the timey-wimey stuff. The Orville had a great season, with the introduction of a new enemy empire and possibly one of the best TV space battles of all time. They ended their season with a timey-wimey episode as well, looks like that&amp;rsquo;s a trend for April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/strong&gt; final season started up in April of course, and its only halfway through. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably have a lot more to say about it when the season ends in May.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>More thoughts on Avengers Endgame and the MCU

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I already wrote about Avengers Endgame a bit in &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/04/were-in-the-endgames-now/&#34;&gt;yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post&lt;/a&gt;, but that was a bit rushed and I had more thoughts, so here we are. I figured I might as well get everything out. There will be unmarked spoilers for Avengers Endgame and Agents of SHIELD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before even going into the movie that was seemingly sold out everywhere despite being on almost every cinema screen in the Metro, I was thinking to myself what a phenomenon. Endgame is the culmination of a decade&amp;rsquo;s worth of movies, 22 in total, and even some number of shows, something unrivalled in all of movie history. It&amp;rsquo;s a new form of serialized event entertainment - even though there have been movie franchises with continuity before, most have been limited to trilogies, and the MCU blows them all out of the water. In my head it&amp;rsquo;s more akin to an extended HBO or Netflix series, one that only gets three episodes a year, and each episode is an event in that you can go to the cinema and watch it with your friends. And Endgame was here, trying to put a bookend on all of that, an entire decade worth of stories, with dozens of characters and the stakes no less than half the universe. The scale of it is mind-boggling and very ambitious, and if they dropped the ball on this one it would be so terrible and a huge waste and it would take another decade to even attempt to conclude another story in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The movie starts with the cold open of Clint and his family getting dusted. This could have easily been done as a post-credits scene in Infinity War, but having this here allows them to remind the audience of the stakes involved at the very start. (And saves them having to credit Jeremy Renner in both movies.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next we get the trailer scene of Tony in space recording his message to Potts. The trailer makes this out to be kind of a hopeless-we&amp;rsquo;re-about-to-die situation for Tony (and Nebula), but the movies resolves it quickly by having Carol come in to save them at the last minute. At first I was confused a bit about whether we were going to see the Captain Marvel post-credits scene in this movie, but they save some time by having all of that (including introducing Carol to everybody and explaining Thanos and all) happen off-screen. Tony gets back to Earth but he&amp;rsquo;s still pissed at cap and they part ways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With Nebula now on Earth, they know where Thanos is and the plan is to go beat him up, get the stones and use that to resotre all the dusted people. But Thanos has destroyed the stones, making the snap apparently irreversible. Thor is frustrated and goes for the head this time, and we timeskip five years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both the timeskip and the length of it caught me a bit off-guard, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting it. I can imagine that Infinity War could&amp;rsquo;ve ended here too (if not for the pesky detail of Carol not yet being introduced.) Aparently five years was not enough for the people of the world to move on. That&amp;rsquo;s understandable, but I would have assumed they would clean up the mess a little bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next we have the rat that saves the world. Pure blind luck gets Scott out of the Quantum Realm; the only reason it took five years to get to this point is that rat was lazy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing the MCU tradition of trying to complete the Community cast, we get a 2-second cameo by Ken Jeong/Senor Chang. Later on we also get a slightly longer cameo from Yvette Nicole-Brown/Shirley!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scott gets to meet grown-up Cassie, setting up the stage for her Phase 4 adventures as Stature, and perhaps, the Young Avengers? Who else would be there?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After some meandering, Scott makes his way to the Avengers compound, and finally explains his ludicrous timey-wimey plan of using the quantum realm to do a time heist. They need someone smart to figure this out so they go to Tony, and we get to meet his daughter Morgan (I would guess at 4 years old). Tony dismisses their plan as some fantasy Back to the Future-type nonsense. Apparently (as would be explained further on), Back to the Future rules do not apply in the MCU - changing the past does not affect the future. I initially thought they would try to use time travel to go back and redo the battle of Wakanda, this time with more foreknowledge and Carol on their side and thus stop the snap from even happening, but this throws that out the window. There&amp;rsquo;s no getting around it now - the snap is irrevocably part of MCU history and future films will have to work around that or otherwise deal with the consequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They need another smart guy, so they go see Bruce, who is now Smart Hulk. Not what I was expecting, though not unprecedented from the comics. Banner has had a weird character arc since Age of Ultron, going from permanently Hulk to unable to Hulk and now both Banner and Hulk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tony figures it out and comes around, so they try to get the gang back together to do the Time Heist. Rocket and Bruce go to pick up Thor, who is now a depressed fat drunk idiot apparently. Far Thor is a bit of a disservice to the character - but given that during the last few movies he&amp;rsquo;s lost his mother and his father and his girlfriend and his home and his posse and half the remaining Asgardians and he feel responsible for the snap because he didn&amp;rsquo;t go for the head, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a little justified. Hey, at least Valkyrie and Korg survived, so that&amp;rsquo;s something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natasha tracks Clint swordfighting some Yakuza in Tokyo and gives him hope.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So the Time Heist crew are: Steve, Tony, Bruce, and Scott going for the three infinity stones in New York 2012, Rocket and Thor going for the Ether in Asgard 2013, Nebula, Rhodey going for the power stone on Morag in 2014, and Clint and Natasha going for the Soul Stone in 2014 as well. They only get one round trip each, so no one is allowed to fail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was pleasantly surprised all the appearances of characters from previous movies: the Ancient One, Rumlow, Agent Sitwell, Loki, Alexander Pierce, Frigga, even Natalie Portman&amp;rsquo;s Jane Foster! Did they actually get Portman to shoot a scene gain, or just reused footage from Dark World? (I assume the latter). Tt&amp;rsquo;s amazing that they were able to shoot new scenes with actors like Tilda Swinton and Robert Redford and not have that info leak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some great throwback moments include:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I can do this all day&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Yeah, yeah&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Ancient One punching Bruce out of the Hulk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the elevator scene from Winter Soldier turned on its head by Cap whispering &amp;ldquo;Hail Hydra&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cap, Iron Man and Hulk going back to the battle of New York made sense, since they could blend in during the fight somehow and Tony has access to Stark tower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thor does his blubbering idiot thing but gets a bit of his mojo back after talking to his mother and finding out he was still worthy to summon Mjolnir&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you know that Clint and Natasha are going for the Soul Stone, you already know one of them has to die; the only question was which one. Natasha unfortunately, did not have a spouse and children to go back to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhodey and Nebula successfully conk out idiot Peter Quill and grab the Power Stone from him. It&amp;rsquo;s weird that they chose to go back to this time instead of say, after Gotg1 when the power stone was safely in the hands of the Nova Corps. I guess they figured it was easier to get it from Quill rather than try to infiltrate Xandar, but coming back to this time creates an opportunity for Nebula to get her wifi network crossed with 2014 Nebula and so 2014 Thanos finds out about the entire Time Heist and sends 2014 Nebula back to 2023 as a sleeper agent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steve and Tony hop to 1970 as their back up plan for getting the tesseract. Steve catches a glimpse of Peggy, but she looks a bit too young considering she should be 50ish at this time. Tony meets up with Howard and I am momentarily confused because I am more familiar with Dominic Cooper than John Slattery but here we are. Howard saying Tony is about to be born tells us Tony is more than 50 in 2023, quite old already as well. Oh, and Jarvis is here too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Time Heist is successful! Everyone but Nat makes it back home, and they mourn her for all of ten seconds before going to build their own Infinity Gauntlet. She probably deserved more than that, but she is still slated for an upcoming movie, however that works, and this movie is all about a sendoff for Cap and Tony, so she gets less focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(As the third act is beginning, I suddenly get the urge to pee, but I can&amp;rsquo;t go now! And I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of the row so going would bother a lot of people and I end up uncomfortably holding it in for an hour. This is my excuse in case I screw up some facts below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2014 Nebula brings 2014 Thanos and his warship through the time machine into the present day. One would wonder how they got enough Pym particles to shrink the entire warship, but presumably they had enough time to study and clone the tech before 2014 Nebula called to them. The ship did not pop out full size in Avengers compound as I expected, instead appearing in the sky above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bruce prepares to use the gauntlet, and without explanation everyone suits up, as if expecting they&amp;rsquo;re about to be attacked by the Mad Titan they thought they killed a while back. Bruce snaps, and a phone call confirms the undusting worked, but then they get space bombarded by Thanos&amp;rsquo; warship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clint is left alone to run away with the gauntlet to protect it from beasties. The original three (Steve, Tony and Thor) go face to face with Thanos directly. Thor, probably bursting with a chance to redeem himself, dual wields Stormbreaker and Mjolnir and uses the lightning to get out his sweatpants and fashion himself new armor and braid his beard. They go at it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2014 Gamora frees 2023 Nebula and they go save Clint just when 2014 Nebula was about to take the gauntlet from him. Bruce is trying to keep the rubble from collapsing on Rhodey, Rocket and himself as Scott heads their way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanos vs the original three is a close fight, but the Mad Titan has them on the ropes when suddenly Steve wields Mjolnir! Completely predictable, but it&amp;rsquo;s something the fans have been clamoring for since Age of Ultron. Thor cheers &amp;ldquo;I knew it!!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In spite of everything, Thanos beats them back, shattering Steve&amp;rsquo;s shield. Steve struggles to get up, barely breathing, and all seems lost when he gets some radio comms from somewhere. It&amp;rsquo;s Sam! Right, all the dusted people are back! Took them long enough! &amp;ldquo;On your six&amp;rdquo; is a throwback to their jogging days back during Winter Soldier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magic portals from Doctor Strange&amp;rsquo;s peeps pop up all over, and the reinforcements are here: T&amp;rsquo;Challa, Shuri, Okoye and the armies of Wakanda! Sam, Bucky, Wanda, Quill, Drax and Mantis! Peter Parker, Spider-man! Pepper in the Rescue Armor! Hope van Dyne! Valkyrie and the Asgardians! Wong and his magic friends! 2014 Gamora and 2023 Nebula! Scott goes Giant-Man and busts Bruce, Rhodey and Rocket out of the rubble! Thanos calls down his armies, the Black Order and the Leviathans from the battle of New York. Everyone is geared up for a rematch of Wakanda, and Steve finally utters those magic words: Avengers Assemble! (We&amp;rsquo;re already assembled, Steve!). Hands down the best moment of the movie!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not much to say about the battle itself, its great and everyone has their moments. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a problem with the whole girl power moment after Carol comes in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tony&amp;rsquo;s response of &amp;ldquo;I am Iron Man&amp;rdquo; as he snaps his gauntlet is weird but I understand why it&amp;rsquo;s there. His journey begins and ends with that line. His body can&amp;rsquo;t take the power of infinity and he dies. Pepper tells him its time to rest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tony gets a long funeral scene, and some characters notably appear for the first time in the movie: Janet van Dyne, Maria Hill, Nick Fury and some teenager I don&amp;rsquo;t recognize but later find out is supposed to be the kid from Iron Man 3. Some posts are also naming him as &amp;ldquo;Iron Lad&amp;rdquo;, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t jive with the Young Avengers Iron Lad origin, but I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s a possible future something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And now, the weakest part of the movie&amp;rsquo;s plot: Steve going back to the past to return the infinity stones (and Mjolnir) to where they got them, to minimize timestream damage. So many questions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is Steve the only one to go? Hank Pym is back, they can make more Pym Particles again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is his shield whole again? Did Shuri repair it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did he go back to Asgard and inject the ether back into Jane Foster?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did he make the tesseract a cube again? How did he put the mind stone back into the sceptre which he didn&amp;rsquo;t bring?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did the reunion with Red Skull on Vormir go? Did he get a refund on the price paid for the Soul stone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a bunch of timey-wimey problems but probably there are multiple ways to justify things and you shouldnt think about them too hard and just accept them. For the record, here is what I believe. Presumably, returning the infinity stones to where they got them removes the branch timeline that was created when they originally got them. This means:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Returning the time stone to the Ancient One means the events of Doctor Strange still happen in the prime timeline, and that time stone was the same one Thanos used in Infinity War&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Returning the sceptre to Agent Sitwell means it still has the same mind stone used in Age of Ultron etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Returning the space stone (now Tesseract) to the SHIELD vaults means it does all of its stuff in the prime timeline as expected, and is still the same space stone used in Infinity War&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Returning the ether to Jane Foster means the events of Dark World still unfold as they did&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of these are merged back into the prime timeline via &lt;a href=&#34;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAlreadyChangedThePast&#34;&gt;TV Tropes: You Already Changed The Past&lt;/a&gt;, so they all already happened in the prime universe. This means four of the stones used in Infinity War and later destroyed were also the same ones used in Endgame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, there are at least two changes Steve would have been unable to repair:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loki escaping with the Tesseract in 2012&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The removal of 2014 Thanos, Gamora, Nebula and all of Thanos&amp;rsquo; crew from their time. This means it was also unnecessary to return the power stone and soul stone to this branch timeline, but I guess they did it anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another mystery is in what timeline did Steve get his last dance with Peggy and hence grow old etc. The fact that he was able to appear on the bench as an old man shortly after being sent back implies to me that he grew old in the prime timeline (in yet another instance of You Already Changed The Past), and that Peggy simply kept the real identity of her husband a secret to her dying day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The real problem with this whole affair character-wise is that it means Steve became selfish and chose to live out his life given the chance, instead of going back to his friends as expected. I like to think that seeing Peggy again in 1970 made him realize he was always meant to be with her and thus made him decide to do what he did&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handing off the shield to Sam: I expected it to be Bucky, given that in the comics he got to be Cap before Sam, but this is okay too. Though I think Steve could&amp;rsquo;ve given Bucky a few parting words as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quill pretty much got the short end of the stick in IW/EG: Fans hate him now for screwing up the battle on Titan, his girlfriend is dead, and now his leadership of the Guardians is in question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notable deaths/absences:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2018 Gamora truly dead and gone. No explanation given for what happened to 2014 Gamora, as she wasn&amp;rsquo;t shown being dusted. Presumably we&amp;rsquo;ll see her and Thor again in Guardians 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Vision this time, but presumably Shuri would be able to restore him sans mind stone, especially since he and Wanda are slated for a Disney+ show&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natasha dying was sad, but she is slated for a solo movie, and EG leaves at least two outs for her coming back: one is via a Soul Stone refund as mentioned above, and another is Bruce saying he tried to bring her back when he did the snap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Agent Coulson appearance would have been nice, although he presumably died after the end of the last season of Agents of SHIELD. This movie also leaves Agents of SHIELD in a weird place: in the last season they had Infinity War happening concurrently with the season finale, and they delayed the start of season 6 until after Endgame, but given that they now have to live with a 5-year time gap where half the people are dead, IDK if they&amp;rsquo;ll have to adapt their scripts to that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In future movies, they now have access to a time machine! They can&amp;rsquo;t change the past, but they can do silly things like bring back dead characters to help lol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Future movies also have to deal with the fact that half the population skipped ahead 5 years and also that the world is a mess. Things certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t look like a mess in the Far From Home trailer though. Presumably Peter Parker&amp;rsquo;s friends Ned, MJ and Flash all got dusted in IW so that they are all still the same age in Far From Home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whew, I wrote a lot! I guess it&amp;rsquo;s justified given how much I liked the movie and the scale of it and everything. As I mentioned in the spoiler-free review, they could end the MCU here and it would be fine. A fitting end and tribute to the past decade of movies. I am even tempted to watch it in the cinemas a second time, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll have even more insights then!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Two endgames to discuss in one post! MTG War of the Spark and Avengers Endgame spoilers ahoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endgame #1: War of the Spark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#cdb655624b3cf2a4e1e4d7428d798e2a-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/04/were-in-the-endgames-now/endgame_huf808040a75b6fb5c1e9efb3608d00058_168404_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;cdb655624b3cf2a4e1e4d7428d798e2a-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/04/were-in-the-endgames-now/endgame.jpg&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;27 Apr 2019 5:56am&#34;&gt;27 Apr 2019 5:56am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest Magic set has been a home run in terms of lore and flavor and storytelling, bringing the last three years worth of MTG lore to its conclusion as the villainous dragon planeswalker Nicol Bolas aims to complete his plan to achieve omnipotence over the multiverse. The set is packed with planeswalkers summoned to Ravnica by Bolas&amp;rsquo;s schemes, which means mechanically that a lot of new planeswalker design space is being explored. The spoiler season was well-executed (despite some leaks during the last week), allowing us to see the story unfolding through the cards in a clearer way than ever before: from the dreadhorde invasion of Ravnica, the counterattack by the guilds, the arrival of the Amonkhet God-Eternals, and the death and betrayal that soon followed. It remains to be seen what impact the set will have on the gameplay and the meta, but from lore and flavor alone it&amp;rsquo;s already a win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endgame #2: Avengers Endgame&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the spoiler-free review (mirrored from &lt;a href=&#34;https://tumblr.roytang.net/post/184473737480/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review&#34;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, I figured there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to publish there exclusively):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avengers: Endgame spoiler-free review!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I watched Endgame exactly 365 days after watching Infinity War! (And also 3 years to the day after watching Civil War)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I approve of this movie as a fitting end to the last decade of Marvel films. This is a slam dunk ending. They could end it here, with no additional MCU movies/shows coming out and that would be completely fine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I approve of how little information about the movie managed to leak, I approve of the trailers and the marketing campaign: just enough to get hyped but nothing too spoilery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a lot to unpack, but its impossible to cover anything without getting into spoilers, but I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with the movie and the fan service, especially as a comic book fan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the plot starts out slow and moves quickly at the end. If you have to pee, better to do it sometime during the first hour; I found myself holding my pee for the last hour of the movie and not wanting to miss anything, it was not pleasant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imax was fine, but without probably also would have been fine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is supposedly no post-credits, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know as I couldn&amp;rsquo;t hold it much longer and left mid-credits. The first half of the credits was nice though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: No, same issue as Infinity War, too many characters to follow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re going to earn a bajillion dollars with this one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoilers follow:

&lt;details class=&#34;spoiler&#34;&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;(Spoilers)&lt;/summary&gt;
    There are some timey-wimey concerns, but nothing a bunch of nerds wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to rationalize quickly. So much to unpack here, so many easter eggs and fan service: Widow&amp;rsquo;s death, Fat Thor, Smart Hulk, revisiting several previous movies, Steve wielding Mjolnir, Steve and Peggy&amp;rsquo;s last dance, Pepper rocking the Rescue armor, the Tony Stark final sacrifice and sendoff, all the cameos from previously lost characters and villains (did they actually get Natalie Portman to shoot new footage?!?), and finally that scene where when all hope was lost, I was wondering what deus ex machine they would use to get out of the situation, and when Sam made contact I was like, that&amp;rsquo;s right, everyone&amp;rsquo;s back, then we get all the Avengers, Wakandans, Asgardians, Sanctorum dudes, etc and Cap going &amp;ldquo;Avengers Assemble!&amp;rdquo; (Hey, wheren&amp;rsquo;t they already assembled?!?)
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worth the wait, very happy with the movie, and even tempted to watch it one more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is of course a third endgame that kicked off in April, and that&amp;rsquo;s Game of Thrones, but it&amp;rsquo;s not yet done, so I&amp;rsquo;ll cover that another time.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Shaggy Dogs
</title>
            <link>https://roytang.net/2019/04/shaggy-dogs/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2019 05:56:56 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://roytang.net/2019/04/shaggy-dogs/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I was struggling to remember the term - I knew there was one - for the type of stories where it&amp;rsquo;s long-winded and the narrator is generally trying to keep the audience hanging and eventually ending in an anticlimax. These are called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaggy_dog_story&#34;&gt;Shaggy Dog Stories&lt;/a&gt;, there&amp;rsquo;s even &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/shaggydogstories&#34;&gt;a subreddit for them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ones I heard the most growing up were from my high school crowd, and I remember two of them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &amp;ldquo;bloop bloop&amp;rdquo;. Basically, a kid is asked what he wants to do when he grows and he says &amp;ldquo;I want to invent the bloop-bloop!&amp;rdquo; and the story proceeds to describe the kid&amp;rsquo;s academic growth track and at every milestone he repeats the same goal; he takes a number of courses, joins research projects, and at the end he announces that he has finished his life goal and invites everyone to a demonstration. He takes out a small round object and drops into a vat of liquid, where it makes the sound &amp;ldquo;bloop bloop&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the pink table. A kid is asked what he wants for his birthday, and he says &amp;ldquo;I want a pink table!&amp;rdquo;, but his parents get him something else. This scenario repeats every year. But I forget how this one ends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried Google searching for the above stories, but because these were largely transmitted via verbal narration in the pre-internet days, it is unlikely there are &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; versions of these shaggy dog stories recorded online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most famous shaggy dog story I do know of is of course, &lt;a href=&#34;https://natethesnake.com/&#34;&gt;Nate the Snake&lt;/a&gt;. (The wayback machine tells me this site and domain have been up since 2012, that&amp;rsquo;s neat, I&amp;rsquo;d have at least put ads on it by now!)&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Rabbit Holes
</title>
            <link>https://roytang.net/2019/04/rabbit-holes/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2019 05:56:56 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://roytang.net/2019/04/rabbit-holes/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;m easily distracted, I often tumble down rabbit holes way too easily. You know the kind of rabbit holes I&amp;rsquo;m talking about: you just want to lookup the name of that actor who appeared in that movie and suddenly you find yourself forty minutes into a Wikipedia dive with three different tabs open, none of them remotely related to what you were originally searching for. (Wikipedia could also be IMDB, Reddit, or TV Tropes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also the rabbit holes of video games - I&amp;rsquo;ve probably spent like 20 hours over the long weekend picking up a 2017 save game of Tales of Hearts R on my Vita. I&amp;rsquo;ve finished the game, but then there&amp;rsquo;s the post game and the New Game+ etc. So maybe not a review yet. I was really just looking to see what options I&amp;rsquo;d have to keep myself entertained during the long plane rides I have scheduled in a couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also the rabbit hole of streaming TV - I&amp;rsquo;ve found out that &lt;em&gt;30 Rock&lt;/em&gt; is on Amazon Prime Video so I&amp;rsquo;m about halfway through season five right now (don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I started with season four because APV likes to have random seasons for some reason). This show is great to rewatch and has a lot of ridiculous lines that I wish I could quote in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s my long weekend. Not that I haven&amp;rsquo;t been productive at all. I did manage to dive into the rabbit hole of spring cleaning a bit, moving things around and dusting and throwing things into a garbage bag at 11:30 in the evening, and that satisfied my OC-ness for a bit. But there were some side projects I wanted to get into and and didn&amp;rsquo;t get to, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think falling down rabbit holes is okay, as long as you recognize what&amp;rsquo;s happening to you and you have the self-control to pull yourself back as needed. Everything in moderation, as they say. Today is a Monday, so back to dreary real-life responsibilities and less rabbits for now I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Many of the manga series I used to follow from long ago have since ended, the only ones still running now are One Piece and Hajime no Ippo. So I thought I&amp;rsquo;d follow some newer ones. Here are some short reviews:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Promised Neverland&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up this one due to a strong recommendation from someone I follow on social media. The premise starts out with some super smart kids who grew up in an orphanage without any knowledge of an outside world. Suddenly they find out that not all is as it seems and that they are actually captives in some kind of human farm for strange &amp;ldquo;demons&amp;rdquo; to consume. The first arc consists of the oldest kids trying to figure out a way to outsmart their captors and escape and find out the truth of what is happening in the outside world. (The previous two sentences aren&amp;rsquo;t too spoiler-y, this setup is pretty much established in the first issue.) The 3 oldest kids are supersmart, so much of the tension lies in them trying to stay two steps ahead of their captors who suspect they know the secret, and at the same time trying to figure out a way to escape with more than 30 kids, some of them toddlers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some spoilers for the second arc follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;details class=&#34;spoiler&#34;&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;(Spoilers)&lt;/summary&gt;
    The second arc after they manage to escape involves them trying to survive in a world that they find to be mostly populated by demons, some of them cunning like humans, and some wild and savage, all of them much stronger than humans. Sometimes writers won&amp;rsquo;t know what to do after their initial premise, but &lt;em&gt;The Promised Neverland&lt;/em&gt; handles it well; after the initial &amp;ldquo;Prison Break&amp;rdquo; story arc they successfully transitioned into a &amp;ldquo;Wilderness Survival&amp;rdquo; arc that reminds me a lot of Claymore. During the course of their journey to find a safe haven they learn the truth of why the world is like it is which eventually leads to a &amp;ldquo;Revolution&amp;rdquo; arc (currently ongoing) where the protagonists are trying to change the nature of this world. There were some fantastic battle scenes against overwhelming odds in the second arc as well, especially against Lewis and the other demons at Goldy Pond.
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Promised Neverland&lt;/em&gt; is currently at 130 issues and I enjoyed it a lot. The writing is good, the artwork is not too complicated yet dynamic and flowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Stone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember reading about this one a couple of years ago about promising new series in &lt;em&gt;Shonen Jump&lt;/em&gt;, but at that time I chose to start &lt;em&gt;Robot x Laserbeam&lt;/em&gt; instead, which didn&amp;rsquo;t last too long. I didn&amp;rsquo;t start this one back then because I honestly wasn&amp;rsquo;t a fan of the art style, but I gave it another shot last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise is that sometime in 2015 (?), a mysterious petrification beam turned every human being (and swallow) on earth into stone. The protagonist Senku is a genius-level science nerd who manages to keep his consciousness alive for the 3,700 years that it takes until he is freed from his petrification by a mysterious liquid. By this time, human civilization has collapsed, and all that remains is the preserved stone statues of the humans (and swallows). A firm believer in science, Senku resolves to use his analytical skills to restore human civilization, his first task being to study the mysterious liquid that freed him and use it to free some other nearby humans - the first one being his friend Taiju, who has unnaturally high endurance making him suitable for doing the hard labor neded to support Senku&amp;rsquo;s science. While they are in the process of attempting to free a third human, they are beset upon by wild animals and have to run. They have no choice but to use their depetrification formula to free a nearby human who turns out to be a super-strong and athletic fighter who can defeat wild animals with his bare hands, Tsukasa. (All of this happens in the first three issues.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After things settle down, Senku finds out that Tsukasa hates the modern world and does not want to bring everyone back, and he starts smashing statues of older people. Fundamentally disagreeing on the way forward, this sets up the first major arc for the series, with Tsukasa taking control of the depetrification formula to establish his own empire, and Senku vowing to start a Kingdom of Science to advance human civilization and overcome Tsukasa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about this series is how focused it is on science, detailing the steps needed to do complicated things like formulating chemicals or building complicated devices like a crossbow or a battery. The series is only 100 issues long so far, but thanks to Senku being ridiculously knowledgable, science advances quickly even in this &amp;ldquo;Stone&amp;rdquo; age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;details class=&#34;spoiler&#34;&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;(Spoilers)&lt;/summary&gt;
    By the 100th issue, Senku has advanced the cause of science enough to be able to create (with the help of a whole village of people) such advanced devices as mobile communicators, a steam engine-powered boat, and even a carbon-fiber tank.
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit I can&amp;rsquo;t follow the science myself too closely (since I&amp;rsquo;m not that well-versed in chemistry), so I can&amp;rsquo;t vouch for its accuracy, but I enjoy how it is presented and how Senku explains things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these series feature superoptimistic protagonists who are hypercompetent and very resolved to save everyone (sometimes even their enemies), no matter the ridiculous odds. A bit trope-y, but I enjoyed both series nonetheless, and both are still ongoing, so I have new manga to look forward to every week!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Some number of years back I first encountered this comic image and I really liked it because it had a message of boundless optimism, of no challenge too large to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#f9e853637f8e961cf3056b401bb4cf24-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/04/minus/minus_hu7a25886459391d053039e26028c4c1df_51547_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;f9e853637f8e961cf3056b401bb4cf24-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/04/minus/minus.jpg&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;2 Apr 2019 5:56am&#34;&gt;2 Apr 2019 5:56am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I later found out that the image comes from an Eisner-award winning webcomic called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minus_(webcomic)&#34;&gt;minus&lt;/a&gt; (intentionally lower case). The meaning of the comic changes significantly in the context of the webcomic, as the titular girl minus apparently has unlimited reality alteration powers. I still like the optimism version though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of this because I found my old copy of the above image (and even set it as my Twitter profile header) and was trying to remember the name of the comic, and in the course of my research, I found out that the webcomic&amp;rsquo;s website has disappeared (domain purchased by some Japanese company), and the creator Ryan Armand has since &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/4kywfh/ryan_armands_website_author_of_minus_a_webcomic/&#34;&gt;disappeared from the internet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting mystery whenever a well-known creator vanishes from the public eye. It reminds me a bit of notable Ruby programmer &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff&#34;&gt;why the lucky stiff&lt;/a&gt;, who also chose to withdraw from the internet because he wanted to be left alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s too bad Ryan Armand is no longer doing webcomics, as minus was pretty good. You can read minus&amp;rsquo; archives &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20060413173320/http://www.kiwisbybeat.com/minus.html&#34;&gt;via the internet archive&lt;/a&gt; or here are &lt;a href=&#34;https://comicvine.gamespot.com/forums/off-topic-5/minus-aka-the-greatest-webcomic-ever-524815/&#34;&gt;some on Comic Vine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;The big one this month was &lt;strong&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/strong&gt;. I posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://tumblr.roytang.net/post/183266384975/captain-marvel-spoiler-free-review&#34;&gt;the usual spoiler-free review over on Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, but I have some more spoiler-y thoughts over here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details class=&#34;spoiler&#34;&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;(Spoilers)&lt;/summary&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I thought the movie was ok, I was underwhelmed by the third act and specifically the lack of any serious threat for Carol to defeat towards the end of the movie. As this &lt;a href=&#34;https://mabeloni-sandwich.tumblr.com/post/183645870983/the-biggest-problem-with-every-single-bad-review&#34;&gt;tumblr post explains&lt;/a&gt; more clearly than I ever could, perhaps the issue is that the narrative is not something targetted towards me as a man, who has not experienced the emotional gaslighting IRL that many women are exposed to. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting way to frame the narrative, and probably explains why some movies (i.e. chick flicks) really don&amp;rsquo;t appeal to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did enjoy most everything else about the movie, especially most of the comic book tie-ins and links to other MCU movies. I appreciated how they re-told the &amp;ldquo;Carol getting her powers from an explosion&amp;rdquo; and Mar-vell still being there. I appreciate the surprise that Annette Benning was Mar-Vell all along. I appreciate their reimagination of the Kree Supreme Intelligence. I appreciate that by the time Avengers Endgame or any potential Captain Marvel 2 rolls around, Monica Rambeau will be old enough to be her own superhero as well. I appreciate all the little things connecting this movie to the first Iron Man, the first Avengers, and even to Infinity War itself. I also appreciated that their depiction of the Kree did not rule out the Agents of SHIELD versions existing! (That being said, I would have appreciated an explanation for why some Kree are blue and some are not!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much else to report. The Arrowverse is limping along. Recent episodes of &lt;strong&gt;Supergirl&lt;/strong&gt; have been great, I loved Jon Cryer as Lex Luthor, and I love how they&amp;rsquo;ve been able to adapt multiple comic book storylines this season such as &lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s So Funny About Truth, Justice, &amp;amp; the American Way?&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;American Alien&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Red Son&lt;/em&gt;. (Excuse me, red daughter.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more sci-fi land, &lt;strong&gt;The Orville&lt;/strong&gt; has been fantastic, with their surprise twist to the Isaac storyline culminating in one of the best space battles portrayed on TV. &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek Discovery&lt;/strong&gt; is not as good, but I still like it, as it feels a lot more classic Trek than S1 and the overarching S2 plot is more interesting to me too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next month is looking packed. The big headliners to look forward to are of course &lt;strong&gt;Avengers Endgame&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Shazam&lt;/strong&gt;, and the final season of &lt;strong&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Netflix and Amazon Prime: An abundance of content

            <guid>https://roytang.net/2019/03/netflix-and-amazon-prime-an-abundance-of-content/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t figured it out yet, I watch a &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/tags/watching-lately/&#34;&gt;lot of TV shows&lt;/a&gt;, rarely on TV itself though. I outgrew scheduled television maybe more than a decade ago. I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of this because I was going through some old disks and found burned episodes of stuff like &lt;em&gt;Smallville&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Heroes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;, various anime, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those were from the days before streaming though. These days an abundance of content is available online via the streaming services, no need to store all those episodes yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first tried out Netflix during my three-month London stint back in 2015 (which I now realized I never wrote about). Netflix wasn&amp;rsquo;t available in the PH yet, so I took the opportunity to take a free month trial which led to binge watching of shows like &lt;em&gt;House&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; when I had the opportunity to work from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months after I got back from the trip, Netflix became available in the PH, January 2016! I initially figured it might not be feasible at all given how terrible the internet here was, but it performed well enough even with our old 4Mbps BayanDSL. The content library was as expected, a lot smaller than the US one was, but it was a pretty good start. It meant a lot of the Netflix original content, including the Marvel shows, were available to me on demand so it was great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people like to use a VPN so they get access to a larger library, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried that. Honestly, there is already so much content in Netflix PH anyway, and if there&amp;rsquo;s any non Netflix content I wanted to watch, there are other ways rather than a VPN. (The old ways still worked of course.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Netflix is a staple in our household, even my nontechie dad uses it a lot, thanks to the LG smart tv we bought a while back. And the kids section helps entertain the nieces and nephews whenever they&amp;rsquo;re over. For me personally, aside from the old movies and shows I&amp;rsquo;m happy with a lot of the standup content and original shows. I think even with the limited content library, Netflix PH is still pretty good value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not content with Netflix though, I also subbed to Amazon Prime around six months back. Well, back then my primary goal was to get Twitch Prime in order to get some &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/&#34;&gt;Eternal&lt;/a&gt; loot (LOL), Amazon Prime was a nice bonus. I haven&amp;rsquo;t used it too much though. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the new Jack Ryan series, it was &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2018/10/october-2018-watching-lately/&#34;&gt;pretty good&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve also watched a few old movies there, and they have a bunch of comedy series I like such as Community, The Office, Parks, etc. I&amp;rsquo;m coming up on six months for my sub though, which means I&amp;rsquo;m about to lose the discounted new subscriber rate. I don&amp;rsquo;t use Amazon Prime nearly as often as I do Netflix, so I&amp;rsquo;m not yet sure whether I should keep it around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s definitely still a lot of holes in the streaming content available locally though - we don&amp;rsquo;t have Hulu for one thing. And the new services like DC Universe and Disney+ probably won&amp;rsquo;t be available here for a while. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping those companies choose to have Netflix distribute internationally in the meantime. For the regular network shows like the Arrowverse shows, I still have to use traditional less legal methods to keep up weekly. Hopefully we&amp;rsquo;re moving towards a future where international viewers have the same legal streaming options available as the Western world does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I really should cut down on my TV shows though&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Some things I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched &lt;strong&gt;Alita: Battle Angel&lt;/strong&gt;, with the friend who introduced me to the series in the first place. The movie looked fantastic and the fight scenes were great. Plot was supercondensed, several books&amp;rsquo; worth of story combined into one. Ended in a weird place, kinda? Easily the best western live action anime adaptation by far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After watching I immediately passed by a friend&amp;rsquo;s house to borrow these. Must be more than a decade since I last read them&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;7 Feb 2019 2:06pm&#34;&gt;7 Feb 2019 2:06pm&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/02/1093511237898448896/&#34;&gt;View post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;







    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another volume of &amp;ldquo;catching up with older films to improve my geek cred&amp;rdquo;, I watched &lt;strong&gt;The Usual Suspects&lt;/strong&gt; on Netflix. The movie was still really good, despite the internet having spoiled the Keyser Soze twist for me (and countless others) many years ago. I can see why Spacey won an Oscar for his performance here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;strong&gt;Ralph Breaks The Internet&lt;/strong&gt; with the nieces last weekend. The younger one really enjoyed the scenes with the Disney princesses. Movie was pretty good, despite losing the novelty of the first film. Many tropes were visited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over on the Netflix side, I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying &lt;strong&gt;The Patriot Act with Hasan Minaj&lt;/strong&gt;. Highly informative about a wide range of topics, I thought it would be solely about politics, but there were some surprising discussions on things like, uh, shoes? Conservatives may be annoyed by the liberal bias, but otherwise the show does a good job of breaking down complicated topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also had a few seasons of &lt;strong&gt;Family Guy&lt;/strong&gt; up recently, and it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good series to have running in the background while I&amp;rsquo;m working on other stuff so I managed to watch all of it fairly easily. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it&amp;rsquo;s good for my mental health though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Seth MacFarlane shows, I&amp;rsquo;ve caught up with &lt;strong&gt;The Orville&lt;/strong&gt; recently, and this show has been great. It&amp;rsquo;s basically &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; for a newer generation, but with a different (and sometimes more interesting) mythos and history and so on. The show is much more willing to tackle complex ideas relevant to the modern world as well. I hope it does well and goes on for many seasons to come.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quote is from the 1980s cult classic &lt;em&gt;Bill and Ted&amp;rsquo;s Excellent Adventure&lt;/em&gt;. I didn&amp;rsquo;t include this movie in &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2018/10/my-top-10-favorite-movies-of-all-time/&#34;&gt;my top 10 movies post&lt;/a&gt;, but it and the sequel &lt;em&gt;Bill and Ted&amp;rsquo;s Bogus Journey&lt;/em&gt; are still among my childhood faves. These wise words are give by the Wyld Stallyns band composed of the epnoymous Bill and Ted, and form the philosophical basis of the future utopian civilization inspired by their music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like this quote because it&amp;rsquo;s simple and comprises two principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be good to other people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enjoy life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, what more is there? And maybe I&amp;rsquo;m reading too much into it, but it has a profound kind of balance too: each principle holds the other in check: you should enjoy life, but not by hurting other people; and you should help other people, but not to your own detriment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A third movie, &lt;em&gt;Bill and Ted Face the Music&lt;/em&gt; has been greenlighted and might come as soon as end of 2019!)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/s/the-upgrade/why-gen-z-loves-closed-captioning-ec4e44b8d02f&#34;&gt;Interesting article on closed captioning&lt;/a&gt;, or as I like to call them, subtitles. My first exposure to subtitles was anime of course, but these days I vastly prefer having subtitles on any show, even if it&amp;rsquo;s dubbed in a language I do understand. From the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why do you have captions on?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It helps me with my ADHD: I can focus on the words, I catch things I missed, and I never have to go back,&amp;rdquo; she replied. “And I can text while I watch.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have ADHD, that&amp;rsquo;s not something diagnosed very often over here, though I&amp;rsquo;m sure I exhibit a certain lack of focus. But I can relate to how subtitles help me avoid having to rewind a show for something I missed. The subtitles act like a kind of fallback to the verbal/audio cues, helping me when I get distracted (quite easily) and when I&amp;rsquo;m multitasking. They also help with accents and murmured words and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are people who don&amp;rsquo;t like subtitles when they aren&amp;rsquo;t necessary, complaining that having to read distracts them from the film. I imagine those people are the same kind of people who don&amp;rsquo;t like reading books or reading in general.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Some Youtube channels I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying recently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-dGYF1il5OP0lNHChHdhzg&#34;&gt;ComicTropes&lt;/a&gt; is a weekly show that does deep dives into various mainstream comics titles, and often includes the background history of characters and creators, so very interesting stuff for comic book nerds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqJ-Xo29CKyLTjn6z2XwYAw&#34;&gt;GameMaker&amp;rsquo;s ToolKit&lt;/a&gt; talks about video game level design topics. His series &amp;ldquo;Boss Keys&amp;rdquo; does a deep dive into Zelda dungeons and analyzes them based on criteria like linearity. His level design analyses are strongly based on systems and gameplay and how they affect the player experience. Good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVEDzEYSNi5FwEKmLY6LT0Q&#34;&gt;EmGo&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/01/transformers/&#34;&gt;Transformers&lt;/a&gt; toy reviewer that I watch sometimes. I don&amp;rsquo;t buy too many Transformers toys, and watching the toy reviews helps me hold back on buying. There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of such channels and EmGo is one of the more popular ones. He has a particular style of humor that may or may not appeal to everyone, but I like him.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Hardy Boys
</title>
            <link>https://roytang.net/2019/01/hardy-boys/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2019 05:56:56 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Between the ages of 10-12, my reading diet consisted almost exclusively of the teenage-targetted detective series &lt;em&gt;The Hardy Boys&lt;/em&gt;. For me, the term invokes the names Frank and Joe before the Matt and Jeff of WWE fame. We had a fairly wide collection of the blue-hardcovered books of those days. And I believe I made the effort to read every single book in that particular series, through borrowing and such. I think I was successful, but I can&amp;rsquo;t be sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case , that meant this article piqued my interest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/01/reading-hardy-boys-nostalgia-disappointment-racism/581071/&#34;&gt;The Knotty Nostalgia of the Hardy Boys Series&lt;/a&gt;
Why one writer still reads the wildly popular books with a mixture of love and disappointment, 60 years after they were revised to remove racist content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the series as a child, I never felt any serious racist undertones, probably because the versions I had were already torn down. Or more likely, because as a child I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any real concept of race. Sure, Frank and Joe were depicted as white kids on the book covers, but that meant nothing to this brown kid from Asia, even though I was certainly aware of caucasians and blacks by then. As far as I was concerned, I could have been mixed in with their crowd with no issues. I even remember specifically the Hidden Harbor book mentioned in the article, there were some characters who spoke with a southern accent, I guess they were meant to be black? But I never imagined them in my head as any different from their northern visitors. (There was this one character named Grover who in my head looked like a blue muppet&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our copies of those Hardy Boys books are long gone, but like the article&amp;rsquo;s author I still look back at them with a tinge of nostalgia. I did learn a lot from those books, from vocabulary to American culture to different kinds of hobbies. I think the main charm of the Chet Morton character mentioned in the article is that with every book he always had a new, different hobby, and in that way the teenage readers could learn about some new field or possible area of interest. Later on, we also encountered softbound books of a later Hardy Boys series &lt;em&gt;The Hardy Boys Casefiles&lt;/em&gt;, which was more dark (one of the character&amp;rsquo;s girlfriends got killed), but they lacked the charm, templating or formularity of the old ones, and we never got more than a few books from that series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if these books are still available locally, I don&amp;rsquo;t recall seeing them in bookstores. I think they would still be pretty good reading for young boys these days - the Hardy Boys seem like they&amp;rsquo;d be good role models, they&amp;rsquo;re smart, they do well in school, they&amp;rsquo;re friendly and accepting and they obey the law and perhaps most importantly, they exhibit a sense of curiosity and adventure about the world around them, something many kids these days seem to lose as they grow up.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Watching Lately: January 2019

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Some things I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bumblebee&lt;/strong&gt; only came out over here in January (thanks to the usual MMFF shenanigans), and I decided to watch it on a whim. Pretty decent soft reboot, read my &lt;a href=&#34;https://tumblr.roytang.net/post/181926569205/bumblebee-spoiler-free-review-attached-image&#34;&gt;spoiler-free review over on the Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first half of &lt;strong&gt;Young Justice Outsiders&lt;/strong&gt; is out, and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty good. Focus is back on a smaller group after the larger team in YJ season 2. A few new characters are introduced and I learned about a couple of DC heroes I wasn&amp;rsquo;t familiar with before. Probably still the best animated superhero show to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Netflix side, season 2 of &lt;strong&gt;Punisher&lt;/strong&gt; is out as well. I finished watching it but didn&amp;rsquo;t bother posting a spoiler-free review this time. It was okay, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have much commentary. Not as strikingly good as the first one was, but pretty decent. It feels weird now watching these shows knowing they are likely to end soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Season 2 of &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek Discovery&lt;/strong&gt; has also started! Only two episodes in so far, but still very good. Feels a lot more classic Trek than the previous season, and a much lighter tone, not just because their captain isn&amp;rsquo;t afraid of the light anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Netflix history also says I watched Bird Box, which became a bit viral early this month for some reason, but that was just my niece making my mom watch it with her, even after I warned her she would get scared (she did).&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Trailers and Spoilers
</title>
            <link>https://roytang.net/2019/01/trailers-and-spoilers/</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2019 05:56:56 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://roytang.net/2019/01/trailers-and-spoilers/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;The first trailer for &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man Far From Home&lt;/em&gt; dropped last week. I used to pretty hyped for superhero movie trailers, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t bother watching this one yet. MCU still has two more movies coming out before this one, and I&amp;rsquo;m already hyped enough for those, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have hype to spare for a third one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother was complaining to me about the trailer, saying he was spoiled about some elements. Specifically, he wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware that [actor] was in the movie playing [villain]. I keep up with comic book news, so that wasn&amp;rsquo;t news for me, but I can see how disappointing it might be. Also, this seems to be typical - I check the first trailer for &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man Homecoming&lt;/em&gt; and it did show Michael Keaton&amp;rsquo;s Vulture. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to avoid the villain info, few people consider it a spoiler, it&amp;rsquo;s usually right there in the IMDB page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think that trailers these days show too much though. During the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been avoiding watching any trailer beyond the first one that comes out. Although given that I follow comic book news, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to avoid spoilers from succeeding trailer. Starting with the new Spider-Man I&amp;rsquo;m considering not watching any trailers at all (at least until I&amp;rsquo;m forced to watch one before an actual movie).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might also be a problem with these comic book movies that they come from an established IP - so someone familiar with the source material like me basically already has an idea of what stuff might happen. The title alone of &lt;em&gt;Avengers Infinity War&lt;/em&gt; gave me an idea of what happens in the movie after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the perfect trailer for a completely new franchise gives you a taste of what&amp;rsquo;s to come without giving you details of the major conflict and so on. The &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shazam&lt;/em&gt; trailers have been pretty good in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a sequel, the perfect trailer for me would be the first trailer for &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, which basically acted as a &amp;ldquo;story so far&amp;rdquo;, giving no new info that we didn&amp;rsquo;t know from &lt;em&gt;Infinity War&lt;/em&gt;. Other than the actual movie&amp;rsquo;s title at least, which I had been anticipating for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Xenophobia
</title>
            <link>https://roytang.net/2019/01/xenophobia/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2019 05:56:56 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;In a recent episode of &lt;em&gt;The Orville&lt;/em&gt;, captain Ed Mercer of the Union is stuck debating with a member of the Krill, a fanatic and xenophobic race in conflict with Earth&amp;rsquo;s multi-species Planetary Union. He says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Look, from what we&amp;rsquo;ve seen, when planets first achieve space travel and they venture out into the galaxy and discover that they&amp;rsquo;re just one single species among a vast diversity of lifeforms, they usually react in one of two ways: they embrace and adapt to the fact that they&amp;rsquo;re no longer the center of the universe, or they ratchet up their xenophobia. &amp;hellip; I know fear when I see it. You&amp;rsquo;re afraid to face the fact that your superiority may just be a comforting myth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shows like &lt;em&gt;The Orville&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; (from which the first show is inspired) paint the future of humanity with an optimistic brush, a future where we react in the first way mentioned above, we meet up with other spacefaring species and learn to coexist and even form federaions with them. And the intolerant xenophobic aliens are cast as the aggressive antagonists, a problem to be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the current state of affairs, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit hard to be this optimistic about humanity&amp;rsquo;s future. Imagine if first contact with an alien species happened today, with the dominant (yet spiraling) superpower presided over by an openly racist president, and a wave of far-right nationalism across the world facing migrants everywhere. How welcoming would we be towards an entirely alien species, when we can&amp;rsquo;t even be welcoming to our own kind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s been fiction that covered this angle (&lt;em&gt;District 9&lt;/em&gt; comes to mind), but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure there&amp;rsquo;s been any that covered the entire transition - from first contact to xenophobic hate groups to somehow leading to planetary unification and eventually to a Star Trek-like future. It would at least be an interesting story, and if we can speculate about how to bring that future about, it might even help us with our present problems too.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I was at the mall last week and I decided to watch the new Bumblebee movie (it came out late over here because reasons). Here&amp;rsquo;s my &lt;a href=&#34;https://tumblr.roytang.net/post/181926569205/bumblebee-spoiler-free-review-attached-image&#34;&gt;spoiler-free review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the link says, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a big fan of Transformers since I was a kid, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d talk about that for a bit. The 1980s cartoon obviously, though I think only the first two seasons of that aired on local TV. I had quite a few G1 toys as well, though I think some of them may have been Chinese knockoffs. I remember I had an Optimus Prime, a Megatron (yes, the walther ppk with the robot mode with super thin legs), a small Powerglide, something like 3 out of 5 Aerialbots (no Silverbolt!), and so on. During their first trip to the US, my parents bought me a Metroplex, which was huge, that thing brought me so much joy and playtime. So much playtime that at some point I broke the toy at the hip. D:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another favorite was a G1 Sixshot! Shown in this picture:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That toy was borrowed by a kid I knew from the school bus who lived nearby and he never gave it back! I haven&amp;rsquo;t forgiven him to this day lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually have a very large TF toy collection when I was a kid. I know buying the toys back then must&amp;rsquo;ve been quite expensive, so understandably my folks only got me Transformers on special occasions. Even now as an adult with disposable income I find Transformers toys to be a bit pricey, so I fully understand!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I really got into and had a large collection of was the Marvel Transformers comics series. I remember I had the entire 80-issue Marvel run, plus the Headmasters and Universe limited series. It was the first comic series I really followed, I would eagerly look forward to buying the next issue every month. The stories were a lot more compelling and had a lot more continuity than just watching the cartoon. The stories were a lot more complex - in the cartoons, the Autobots were recognized by humans as heroes and the Decepticons as villains. While in the comics one of the main plot points was the humans mistrusting all transformers. Sadly, I have no idea what happened to my collection D:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In modern times though, I have also seriously enjoyed IDW&amp;rsquo;s Transformers line of comics, which had a much more space/Cybertron focus. Freed from the need to sell new toylines every so often, the IDW line was able to give better characterization to the Transformers and had such great writing, especially towards the end. This continuity recently ended and they&amp;rsquo;re starting up a new one I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to this March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently over the past five years or so, I started buying a few modern Transformers toys as well. I&amp;rsquo;m not a big collector or anything, so I only buy one  every so often, preferably when they&amp;rsquo;re on discount/sale, and only the smaller ones. It&amp;rsquo;s fun seeing how they&amp;rsquo;ve updated modern toys to have a lot more articulation and so on. I mostly have them standing on my desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transformers was my first realy fandom, and something I&amp;rsquo;ll probably never get over, no matter how old I get. I have a couple of nephews, when they&amp;rsquo;ve grown up a bit, I plan to be that uncle who always gifts them Transformers, to set up the next generation of robot fans. Despite my lack of love for the Bayverse series of films, I am grateful that those movies led a resurgence in their popularity, leading to more modern-day comics, toys and animated series as well, so even the young&amp;rsquo;uns will be able more&amp;hellip; much more than meets the eye!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about this Konmari thing. I think it&amp;rsquo;s been around for a while, but got a boost recently due to a Netflix special. I think I agree with it in principle, or at least what I know of it from secondary social media commentary. Minimalism is a worthwhile goal, and so is getting rid of things that do nothing for you other than take up space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people aren&amp;rsquo;t reacting well to the idea of throwing away books though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit 22 Jan: The account has gone private, so the previous embedded tweet is no longer accessible. I&amp;rsquo;m quoting the original text here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do NOT listen to Marie Kondo or Konmari in relation to books. Fill your apartment &amp;amp; world with them. I don’t give a shite if you throw out your knickers and Tupperware but the woman is very misguided about BOOKS. Every human needs a v extensive library not clean, boring shelves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Anakana Schofield (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AnakanaSchofiel&#34;&gt;@AnakanaSchofiel&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jaymelynilao/status/1080957281636835328&#34;&gt;January 3, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s missing the point of decluterring though. The idea is getting rid of things that &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t give you joy&amp;rdquo;, so if having books give you joy, then obviously you keep your books, regardless of whether those books are challenging, difficult, depressing etc. Maybe the point is that you have to be constantly re-evaluating whether the hoarding is a positive spin in your life. (And I say this as someone who has a bunch of books waiting to be read just lying around his room.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this kind of decluttering and minimalism doesn&amp;rsquo;t just apply to possessions though. You should also be looking to give up things like friends, relationships, habits, routines, traditions, and so on, that are no longer net positives or &amp;ldquo;bringing you joy&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s sometimes a bigger picture to look at too. Maybe a specific thing doesn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;bring you joy&amp;rdquo;, but your gradnchildren really like seeing that thing when they visit, and seeing them happy brings you joy, so you keep it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the bigger lesson is to not rely on someone from a Netflix show to tell you how to live your life. It&amp;rsquo;s good to take advice from other people, but everyone has different tastes and different things can bring you joy. You decide what brings you joy.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Watching Lately: December 2018

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Some things I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I very much enjoyed &lt;strong&gt;Elseworlds&lt;/strong&gt;, the Arrowverse crossover this year. I mean sure, a lot of it didn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense, but it was like a love letter to DC fans. I actually consider myself more of a Marvel fan than DC, but I still loved it! I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://ireadcomicbooks.tumblr.com/post/181046297550/aquaman-spoiler-free-review-i-came-in-with-low&#34;&gt;a spoiler-free review over on the Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;strong&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/strong&gt; on a couple of &amp;ldquo;Best TV of 2018&amp;rdquo; lists so I decided to catch up with it since it was on Netflix. I was actually two seasons behind. This series is great, and I really enjoy Bob Odenkirk&amp;rsquo;s portrayal, but it might be just a bit overhyped for me. We already know where Jimmy/Saul, Mike, the Salamancas, and Gus Fring end up given &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt;, so that kind of takes away a bit of tension. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s a fine TV show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got caught up with &lt;strong&gt;The Ranch&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a weird show for me to watch given how hillbilly it is, but I find the perspective strangely refreshing. Also, Elisha Cuthbert really helps. I was surprised that they had killed off Danny Masterson&amp;rsquo;s character (oops spoilers), apparently it was a #MeToo thing or such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Into the Spider-Verse&lt;/strong&gt; was great, especially for a fan of the comics. You can read &lt;a href=&#34;https://tumblr.roytang.net/post/181171084805/into-the-spider-verse-spoiler-free-review&#34;&gt;my spoiler-free review on tumblr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched &lt;strong&gt;Aquaman&lt;/strong&gt; with a friend at UPTC, my first time watching at the theaters there. I had low expectations, but the movie was a surprisingly fun spectacle. You can read &lt;a href=&#34;https://ireadcomicbooks.tumblr.com/post/181046297550/aquaman-spoiler-free-review-i-came-in-with-low&#34;&gt;my spoiler-free review on tumblr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home, I watched &lt;strong&gt;Incredibles 2&lt;/strong&gt; with the niece, who has a bad habit of spoiling things for movies she&amp;rsquo;s already seen. To the tune of &amp;ldquo;Oh, did you know &lt;code&gt;Character&lt;/code&gt; is actually &lt;code&gt;Villain&lt;/code&gt;?!?&amp;rdquo;. Still, the movie was nice, exceeded my expectations. It expanded the Incredibles&amp;rsquo; superhero universe and there was even some surprise Bob Odenkirk!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also watched &lt;strong&gt;Solo: A Star Wars Story&lt;/strong&gt; on Christmas eve (since we didn&amp;rsquo;t get a Christmas Star Wars film this year). We didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to finish it before we went to mass though, so I finished the movie myself a couple of days later. I had skipped watching this in the theater given the mediocre ratings, but now that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it, that&amp;rsquo;s a decision I&amp;rsquo;ve come to regret. It&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable movie with a servicable plot, especially given it&amp;rsquo;s basically meant to expound upon a couple of throwaway lines from the original trilogy. The plot even leaves some dangling threads that could have picked up in succeeding movies, had Disney not decided to scrap (at least for now) the Star Wars spinoff movies. The movie compares unfavorably to &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt;, which had the far superior heist scheme. In both movies we expected many of the introduced characters to be killed off, but the Rogue One deaths were much better than the Solo ones. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s an okay addition to the Star Wars universe. I read that it also has some tie-ins to the various animated series, which I&amp;rsquo;m not too familiar with. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get into those someday.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Book Stores
</title>
            <link>https://roytang.net/2018/12/book-stores/</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 20 Dec 2018 02:56:56 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;The other day I was passing through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2018/10/the-qc-memorial-circle/&#34;&gt;QC memorial circle&lt;/a&gt; (as is my wont) and I decided to walk around the &lt;em&gt;tiangge&lt;/em&gt;/flea market that&amp;rsquo;s often there. It seemd larger than usual that day, so I figured I should finally take a look. And in the process I remembered what I dislike about local flea markets: 90% of the stalls are selling some form of clothes (which I have no interest in browsing - maybe if these stalls sold something my size for once!) and maybe 9.9% are selling cheap knockoff toys (which &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; interest me if they were free or such) or cellphone accessories. And maybe, on a rare 0.1% occassion, a stall will have something I&amp;rsquo;m interested in browsing: used books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like browsing books for sale. Never mind that I already have too many books to read already. Used book sales are not very common in Metro Manila. I mean, there&amp;rsquo;s the big franchise stores in the mall like National Bookstore or Fully Booked or Powerbooks, but given that I alreayd have too many books to read and how frugal I am, I rarely buy from those stores these days (though I still do browse through them often).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used books sales, especially of the random pop-up kind, are a different matter. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like treasure hunting in a way, where you&amp;rsquo;re hoping toe be lucky enough to find a bargain (I suppose this is how people who like browsing for clothes feel like at these flea markets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used book sales aren&amp;rsquo;t very common around here, sadly. There&amp;rsquo;s Book Sale branches in the malls of course, but their selection often isn&amp;rsquo;t very good. Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m picky too! I&amp;rsquo;m usually looking for stuff like science fiction, fantasy, or comics. Or maybe an interesting autobiography or nonfiction book - probably the best purchase I ever made at a Book Sale was getting a copy of &lt;em&gt;The Rock Says&lt;/em&gt;, The Rock&amp;rsquo;s autobiography for cheap (I still have that book around here somewhere).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There also used to be a small used book store called Chapter IX at a small commercial center near where I live. They had a very good selection, a lot of it sci-fi and fantasy. Their prices weren&amp;rsquo;t super cheap though, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t buy much from them. My copy of &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; came from there. Sadly it isn&amp;rsquo;t there anymore. I think they&amp;rsquo;re mostly just selling books online via Facebook now. Browsing through book pictures online doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel the same as rummaging through stacks of used books - it feels more like intentional buying rather than the browsing I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another used book store that I sometimes go to called Bookay-Ukay in Teacher&amp;rsquo;s Village. It&amp;rsquo;s okay - the selection is definitely better than Book Sale. They have some comics and sometimes video game guides too (I like those too!). I think I&amp;rsquo;ve bought at least one pocketbook from them and a couple of comics/guides. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if they&amp;rsquo;re still around - the last time I passed by there it was closed, but they seem to have weird hours so IDK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best used book sale I ever found in the Metro was this pop-up stall that I only saw at the Greenfield market near Shaw Boulevard. This was back when Geekfight was doing regular &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2013/03/scenes-from-a-quiz-night/&#34;&gt;quiz nights&lt;/a&gt; on Fridays in that area. A number of stalls would be set up there around the Friday night entertainment. Most of the stalls would be food or clothing (as per usual) but there was always at least one stall, sometimes two, selling used books. They both had pretty good selections too, I ended up buying quite a bit from them. I remember buying a couple of Discworld books, some old-school CYOA and &lt;em&gt;Heir to the Empire&lt;/em&gt; (the first Thrawn book) from there. Geekfight stopped doing their quiz nights there after a while though, and since I no longer work in Ortigas, I never really pass anywhere near that area anymore, so I don&amp;rsquo;t know if those used book stalls are still a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always keep an eye out for book stores, used or not, even when I&amp;rsquo;m travelling in another country. During my first night on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2004/05/so-i-went-to-hk/&#34;&gt;first trip abroad&lt;/a&gt;, I walked a few blocks around the neighborhood where I was staying and was happy to find a small hole-in-the-wall book store just a couple of streets away. Of course, all the books were in Chinese! During &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2015/03/europe-trip-2015/&#34;&gt;my Europe trip&lt;/a&gt;, I remember walking along the Seine in Paris and I came along a series of pop-up stalls in some kind of mini-flea market near the river side. Quite a few of them were selling old and/or used books, many of them French, some in English, and I think there were some Asterix comics in Italian I think. I didn&amp;rsquo;t end up buying anything, but it was fun. I also remember finding quite a few used book stores in the Camden Market in London while I was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, travel tip: you can type &amp;ldquo;book stores near me&amp;rdquo; in Google Maps to see nearby book stores (or any other kind of stores I guess). I do this a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish book stores were more common around here, but I can understand why they aren&amp;rsquo;t too popular. Books often aren&amp;rsquo;t a high priority for the Filipino masses, given all the other challenges in life. I&amp;rsquo;m very lucky to have grown up with parents who not only instilled a love of reading in me, but also had the budget to buy me books all the time. Sadly, these days I don&amp;rsquo;t read too many books anymore (I blame the internet). Hopefully that&amp;rsquo;s something I can correct next year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Watching Too Much TV?

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I read this article about how &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/04/why-bill-gates-gave-up-music-and-tv-for-5-years-in-his-20s.html&#34;&gt;Bill Gates spent 5 years not watching TV or listening to music&lt;/a&gt; in his twenties while building Microsoft. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I watch &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of TV, unapologetically.  Quite possible too much. But I can&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder if maybe I would be more productive if I had the same kind of discipline Bill Gates had, and maybe that would increase the odds that I could focus and create something of consequence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, the idea of cutting off TV completely feels completely ludicrous to me. It&amp;rsquo;s simply something I enjoy too much. Just this past week I was gushing over the Arrowverse Elseworlds crossover which gave me real fanboy delight. But I thought maybe I could review my current regular TV slate and see if I can&amp;rsquo;t trim it a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DC Comics TV: There&amp;rsquo;s from the aforementioned Arrowverse shows (&lt;em&gt;Arrow&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Flash&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Supergirl&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Legends of Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;). I feel like Arrow should have ended a season or 2 ago, but I still mostly enjoy Flash, Supergirl and Legends. There&amp;rsquo;s also &lt;em&gt;Gotham&lt;/em&gt;, which is ending with its next season, and I kinda wanna see how it ends. Aside from those, I also want to watch &lt;em&gt;Titans&lt;/em&gt; (DC Universe) and &lt;em&gt;Krypton&lt;/em&gt; (Syfy); not sure if I should bother with &lt;em&gt;Black Lightning&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marvel Comics TV: The Marvel TV shows don&amp;rsquo;t have as much of a &amp;ldquo;shared universe&amp;rdquo; feel unlike the Arrowverse. There&amp;rsquo;s the Netflix group of shows of course (&lt;em&gt;Daredevil&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Jessica Jones&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Luke Cage&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Iron Fist&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Punisher&lt;/em&gt;), but it looks like we&amp;rsquo;re only getting at most one more season each of Jessica Jones and Punisher, and the rest are already cancelled. &lt;em&gt;Agents of SHIELD&lt;/em&gt; has been great and is up for at least one more season. I&amp;rsquo;m also supposedly watching &lt;em&gt;The Gifted&lt;/em&gt; but I&amp;rsquo;m way behind on season 2. Also looking forward to the next season of &lt;em&gt;Runaways&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve had &lt;em&gt;Legion&lt;/em&gt; on my to-watch list for a while as well, but haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten around to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other: &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt;, but I&amp;rsquo;m behind for the current season, and this has so few episodes per year, it probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procedurals: I used to watch a few more of these that have since ended (&lt;em&gt;Bones&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Castle&lt;/em&gt;). The only one I still follow now is &lt;em&gt;Criminal Minds&lt;/em&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;ve watched almost all of that, so I know the characters well. It might be a fine candidate to drop though. One can only take so much serial murdering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comedies: There&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&lt;/em&gt;, which is some of the best comedy right now on TV. I still watch &lt;em&gt;The Good Place&lt;/em&gt;, which despite all the praise it gets, I&amp;rsquo;m not superfond of it the way I was with &lt;em&gt;Parks and Rec&lt;/em&gt;. I also still watch &lt;em&gt;The Big Bang Theory&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Modern Family&lt;/em&gt; - those shows aren&amp;rsquo;t the best or super laugh out loud, but they&amp;rsquo;re sometimes interesting. The last two might be worth cutting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animated: Really only &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; (out of loyalty) and &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt; (when it decides to come back).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not counting the shows on Netflix I randomly decide to pick and binge (recently: The Ranch, Better Call Saul, Adventure Time)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the comics-based shows form a significant majority of my shows. Just counting those that have full season lengths, it&amp;rsquo;s at least 10 hours a week on TV watching, a nontrivial amount of time. One method I&amp;rsquo;ve been using to better make the most of TV time is what I call &amp;ldquo;side-watching&amp;rdquo;, i.e. having the TV show playing on a secondary screen while I&amp;rsquo;m doing other stuff on a primary screen, like working or playing games. It&amp;rsquo;s a more efficient use of time, but I can&amp;rsquo;t focus as much on the show, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work on all shows. Usually the lighter shows (comedies and animated) are good for these. THe more serious shows I can still &amp;ldquo;side-watch&amp;rdquo;, unless it&amp;rsquo;s an important episode or something where I want to focus on the show (like the aforementioned Elseworlds crossover). This is the same reason I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly stopped watching anime - it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to side-watch since most of it is subbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually now that I&amp;rsquo;ve listed them all out, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem so bad. Anecdotally, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/business/media/nielsen-survey-media-viewing.html&#34;&gt;Americans watch around five hours of TV a day on average&lt;/a&gt; (35 hours per week), so my 10-15 hours per week doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem so bad by comparison, especially since I&amp;rsquo;m often doing other stuff at the same time. And half the year those shows are off anyway (IDK what happens to American TV during the off season). Still a ways off from Bill Gates though. Maybe I should make a note to try to be more focused/productive during the off season?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hm. If I really want to make the most of my time, I might need to do more detailed time-tracking since there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of other leisure activities I also do (gaming, reading, movies, internet browsing), but that seems like a hassle, and it&amp;rsquo;s probably unnecessary. For now, at least.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Watching Lately: November 2018

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Some things I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, I watched two biopics this month. The first one is &lt;strong&gt;Hidden Figures&lt;/strong&gt;, about three black women who were instrumental during the early days of NASA leading up to the Friendship 7 mission piloted by John Glenn. The movie is fairly interesting if you are even remotely interested in either the challenges faced in black history or math and science or the early days of the space program competition between the USA and Russia. It feels even more appropriate to have watched this since it helps me appreciate the recent Insight mission. (The Oatmeal has &lt;a href=&#34;http://theoatmeal.com/comics/insight&#34;&gt;a fun preview of this event&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second biopic was &lt;strong&gt;Bohemian Rhapsody&lt;/strong&gt;. This was a magnificent film, both for the music and the Freddie Mercury story. I guess it appeals more to those who are familiar with Queen music though. I&amp;rsquo;ve read that the movie isn&amp;rsquo;t super accurate especially with regards to the timeline, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s fine. Both the liberties they take and the music serve to construct a compelling narrative. The movie ends with a ten-minute recreation of the 1985 Live Aid concert and they do a good job of communicating the insane energy at Wembley Stadium back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In less-biographical movies, I also watched &lt;strong&gt;Teen Titans Go To The Movies&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of Teen Titans Go, it&amp;rsquo;s way too silly and it&amp;rsquo;s obviously for kids, I much preferred the previous Teen Titans series. I only got a copy of this movie because my niece said they watched this all the time back home, so now they can watch it when they&amp;rsquo;re over here either. I did enjoy the ridiculous plot and the Stan Lee cameo, but this isn&amp;rsquo;t something I would have watched in the theatre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In rewatch land, since I finished the Spider-Man PS4 game lately, I also watched &lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man 2&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Spider-Man 3&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Amazing Spider-Man&lt;/strong&gt;, they&amp;rsquo;re nice movies to have playing in the background while you&amp;rsquo;re working on other stuff. &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2004/07/movies-spiderman-2/&#34;&gt;Tobey 2&lt;/a&gt; was pretty good and I think it aged well, I&amp;rsquo;d say comparable with Tobey 1 even. &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2007/05/spider-man-3/&#34;&gt;Tobey 3&lt;/a&gt; was trying to do way too much what with Venom and Sandman and Harry-Goblin. Andrew 1 had a lot of potential, but I think this series leaned too much into the dark and mysterious and sinister plot route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TV-wise, nothing much other than the usual superhero series, though I&amp;rsquo;m still behind on Gifted and Doctor Who. I caught Trevor Noah&amp;rsquo;s new Netflix special, it was okay, but too exceptionally. Netflix also added a couple of &amp;ldquo;best of&amp;rdquo; seasons of Jeopardy which I thoroughly enjoyed. Watching these makes me think I&amp;rsquo;d never be able to win an episode of Jeopardy, but of course I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s fair to compare myself to some of Jeopardy&amp;rsquo;s all-time champions.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Artists to Follow on Social Media

            &lt;p&gt;During the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve started following more artists (mostly comic-book related) on social media. Seeing the occasional art post wander across my feeds is often a welcome respite from the terrible news in the world today. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share some of my favorites!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Lee&lt;/strong&gt; is a comic book icon and for me his very detailed and elaborate pencils epitomize 90s comic art and his style still heavily influences many newer artists today. He often posts his drawings on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/jimlee/&#34;&gt;his instagram&lt;/a&gt; and he also has &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/jimlee&#34;&gt;a Twitch channel&lt;/a&gt; where he occasionally livestreams himself drawing. I&amp;rsquo;m watching the stream right now as I&amp;rsquo;m typing this post! (Actually I should maybe follow more artists on Twitch&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marcio Takara&lt;/strong&gt; is a relatively new comic book artist I discovered a couple of years ago. I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually read too many of his comic book work, but I am a big fan of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/marciotakara/&#34;&gt;his instagram&lt;/a&gt; where he&amp;rsquo;s always posting finished works and WIPs. His linework isn&amp;rsquo;t as detailed as Jim Lee, it&amp;rsquo;s a completely different and more cartoony style, but I like it. And his coloring is spot-on too! He also has &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.marciotakara.com/&#34;&gt;a website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Rocafort&lt;/strong&gt; was an artist I discovered when DC had their &amp;ldquo;New 52&amp;rdquo; reboot, his DC work includes Red Hood and the Outlaws and Superman. I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of his detailed pencils and his color work. He has &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/mitografia_kr&#34;&gt;an instagram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Mitografia/&#34;&gt;a twitter&lt;/a&gt; and he posts regularly, especially his drawings in a small notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrea Sorrentino&lt;/strong&gt; is an Italian comic book artist. I first encountered him doing the later part of the New 52 Green Arrow for DC. He later went on to do Old Man Logan and Uncanny X-Men work for Marvel. He seems to like working with Jeff Lemire. While writing this post, I found out they&amp;rsquo;re currently doing a series for Image called Gideon Falls, now I want to read it! His illustrations and colors always have this surreal, otherworldly feel. He has &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/and_sorrentino&#34;&gt;a twitter&lt;/a&gt;, but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t post his art there too much (other than sharing posts from others). He has &lt;a href=&#34;http://andreasorrentinoart.blogspot.com/?view=mosaic&#34;&gt;a website&lt;/a&gt; that showcases his work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click Burgundy/Hungry Clicker&lt;/strong&gt; is an artist I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/click_burgundy&#34;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; somehow, I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about him other than he does great character portraits. He has a more anime aesthetic, and he draws mostly anime and fighting game characters, with the occasional character from some other pop culture like comic books etc.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I used to play a lot of JRPGs, especially back during they heyday of the Playstation Era. These days, I only get to play a few, but I still enjoy a lot of the music tracks from this game, often the battle music since I prefer more upbeat tracks. Here are some of my favorite JRPG tracks from recent years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rivers in the Desert (Persona 5) &amp;ndash; easily the best song in the OST for me, and the rest of this OST is amazing so that&amp;rsquo;s saying a lot.&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jaIo82uT0qs&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reach Out to the Truth (Persona 4) &amp;ndash; P4G was the first Persona game I played, and I found the battle music had dug a permanent place into my brain. I sometimes find myself humming this to myself randomly often when I&amp;rsquo;m out walking.&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fu1LCUJMnF0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crazy Chocobo (Final Fantasy XIII-2) &amp;ndash; this is kind of a left-field choice, but this ridiculously metal version of the traditional Chocobo theme leapt out at me the first time I encountered it in-game. I liked it so much that I now use it as my regular alarm tone. It&amp;rsquo;s really hard to sleep through!&lt;figure class=&#34;wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hEUOOgNzOv4&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of other great JRPG tracks I&amp;rsquo;m missing out on. After starting this post, I collected the above tracks into &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmU0vkKslGXisYb3bCSwqYwHezcfQd01A&#34;&gt;a Youtube playlist&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll expand it later on when I encounter other tracks, feel free to recommend some to me!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shogun was the first novel I ever read outside of required school readings and it remains one of favorites to this day after many rereadings. It had it all &amp;ndash; the age of exploration, religious conflict, language barriers, duty, honor, love, betrayal, war, sacrifice, samurai, ninjas, guns, cannons, etc and it still influences my thinking to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite quotes from this book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toranaga: &amp;ldquo;Tsukku-san says that the Netherlands were vassals of the Spanish king until just a few years ago. Is that true?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackthorne: &amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toranaga: &amp;ldquo;Therefore, the Netherlands – your allies – are in a state of rebellion against their lawful king?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackthorne: &amp;ldquo;They’re fighting against the Spaniard, yes, but –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toranaga: &amp;ldquo;Isn’t that rebellion? Yes or no?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackthorne: &amp;ldquo;Yes. But there are mitigating circumstances. Serious miti- &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toranaga: &amp;ldquo;There are no ‘mitigating circumstances’ when it comes to rebellion against a sovereign lord!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackthorne: &amp;ldquo;Unless you win.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toranaga looked at him intently. Then laughed uproariously. &amp;ldquo;Yes, Mister Foreigner…you have named _the one _mitigating factor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I later ended up reading the rest of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Asian_Saga&#34;&gt;Clavell&amp;rsquo;s Asian Saga&lt;/a&gt; (in fact, I believe I still have most of them on my bookshelf), but none of them stuck with me as much as &lt;em&gt;Shogun&lt;/em&gt;. And I just found out there&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a &lt;a href=&#34;https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/fx-alex-garland-devs-limited-series-shogun-1202894554/&#34;&gt;TV adaptation soon&lt;/a&gt;! Hope it&amp;rsquo;s good, looking forward to that one. (I know there was an older TV adaptation before starring Richard Chamberlain and Toshiro Mifune, but I&amp;rsquo;m too lazy to go look for a copy of that.)&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Some things I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Clancy&amp;rsquo;s Jack Ryan (on Amazon Prime)&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; surprisingly good, even if I&amp;rsquo;m not too familiar with the Jack Ryan stuff. I only know John Krasinski from &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoilers for Tom Clancy&amp;rsquo;s Jack Ryan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details class=&#34;spoiler&#34;&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;(Spoilers)&lt;/summary&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The story starts with Ryan tracking down Suleiman&amp;rsquo;s network via financials, but they never follow-up on who was financing his group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what was the point of the whole drone pilot side story (including the weird trip to the casino and the night with the couple), although it was admittedly kind of entertaining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daredevil season 3 (on Netflix)&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; I enjoyed the season a lot. I posted a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ireadcomicbooks.tumblr.com/post/179331448050/daredevil-season-3-spoiler-free-review&#34;&gt;spoiler-free review over on the ireadcomicbooks tumblr&lt;/a&gt;. Over here I can post spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details class=&#34;spoiler&#34;&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;(Spoilers)&lt;/summary&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t familiar with Murdock&amp;rsquo;s parentage from the comics, so the Maggie reveal came as a surprise to me. A+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sad that there was no Bullseye namedrop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ending kind of flubbed it a bit, could have used an explanation of at what point Matt decided not to kill Fisk. It&amp;rsquo;s not clear if it was something he decided on the spot or if the compromise was part of a plan he devised after interrogating Manning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venom&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; I initially wasn&amp;rsquo;t planning on watching this given the terrible early reviews, but eventually I was like, hey I watched &lt;em&gt;X-Men Apocalypse&lt;/em&gt; so might as well watch this too. It turned out not so bad (low expectations helped), although I find the movie&amp;rsquo;s enhancements to the symbiote abilities a bit disconcerting. &lt;a href=&#34;https://ireadcomicbooks.tumblr.com/post/179008685600/venom-spoiler-free-review&#34;&gt;Read my spoiler-free review here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batman Ninja &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://ireadcomicbooks.tumblr.com/post/179485492410/i-found-out-batman-ninja-is-on-netflix-so-i&#34;&gt;I found out this was on Netflix and went ahead and watched it&lt;/a&gt;. The animations and character designs are nice, but the plot is just ridiculous lol. Feels like someone wrote a Batman fanfic.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Superhero shows being political

            <guid>https://roytang.net/2018/10/superhero-shows-being-political/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Comic books and superheroes have always tended to skew towards liberal philosophies, given how writers and artists tend to support ideals like individualism and free expression. So it&amp;rsquo;s not surprising that the derivative shows tend to lean the same way. Not only do many of the shows promote diversity, but many are becoming overtly political as well. Some recent examples. (Spoilers for current seasons of Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow and Daredevil follow)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The current season 4 of Supergirl seems to be focusing on anti-alien sentiment, a thinly-veiled allegory towards the anti-immigration movement propagated in far right &amp;ldquo;nationalist&amp;rdquo; circles. Similar to real-life, hatemongers are portrayed riling up crowds frustrated with losing jobs and threats to law and order due to the presence of &amp;ldquo;aliens&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pilot episode of Legends of Tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s season 4 includes a short segment where one of the characters visits her mother, a Muslim immigrant in the US, and wishes she could warn her to move to Canada before &amp;ldquo;this country turns against her.&amp;rdquo; Do the Legends know about things to come? (Of course, during the previous season, the showrunners &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/aug/4/dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-producer-admits-muslim-cha/&#34;&gt;admitted that the Muslim character in question was introduced precisely as a response to Trump&amp;rsquo;s election&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally, in the fantastic Daredevil season 3, Wilson&amp;rsquo;s Fisk&amp;rsquo;s being billeted in the &amp;ldquo;Presidential Hotel&amp;rdquo; and his calling out his supposed crimes as politically-motivated &amp;ldquo;fake news&amp;rdquo; reminds a lot of people of the current American president. If that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, &lt;a href=&#34;http://boundingintocomics.com/2018/10/18/daredevil-season-3-showrunner-compares-wilson-fisk-to-donald-trump/&#34;&gt;even the showrunner compares the Kingpin to Trump&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it&amp;rsquo;s not a completely new thing I&amp;rsquo;m glad the showrunners are willing to make their political opinions known. This, despite the existence the so-called ComicsGate movement among a minority of superhero fans, which is a self-described revolt against &amp;ldquo;liberalism&amp;rdquo;. I wonder if these ComicsGate people also hate the TV shows?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been re-watching The Office (US) lately (it&amp;rsquo;s a good show to leave running in the background while you&amp;rsquo;re doing other stuff), and I just find the character of Michael Scott fascinating. He&amp;rsquo;s funny and well-written and basically just a big bag of human flaws that somehow bumbles his way into managing an office. He&amp;rsquo;s self-centered, attention-hungry, easily distracted, and refuses to acknowledge any bad news, yet despite all of that he loves his workmates like a family.&lt;/p&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#dfb6cc8c63b0be98f1f267fa0f1b1869-lightbox&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;dfb6cc8c63b0be98f1f267fa0f1b1869-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing I find most relatable is his complete self-confidence that he can be good at everything. Not just his job as a manager and as a salesman, but everything he chooses to do. As an example, he auditioned for a play (&lt;em&gt;The Demon Barber of Fleet Street)&lt;/em&gt; and automatically assumed he was getting a part. He also made a movie which fell into the so-bad-its-good category (&lt;em&gt;Threat Level Midnight&lt;/em&gt;) and was pissed off that his girlfriend didn&amp;rsquo;t care much for it. He also claims to have written a business book and an HBO comedy special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find the above relatable because I have this similar flaw of wanting to do everything and yet feel bad when I fall short. Like Michael Scott, I often don&amp;rsquo;t have the patience for grinding through the beginner stages of some new thing I&amp;rsquo;m trying out &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;m working on improving. I&amp;rsquo;m sure both Michael Scott and I could stand to learn from &lt;em&gt;Adventure Time&lt;/em&gt;‘s Finn the Dog:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a copy of this book for quite a while now, but for some reason only got around to starting on it three days ago. It&amp;rsquo;s not a particularly long book, but I pretty much devoured it in twenty four hours.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mandatory screenshot of old-school Doom&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;14 Oct 2018 1:00am&#34;&gt;14 Oct 2018 1:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book traces the paths of the lives of John Romero and John Carmack &amp;ndash; two legends of the software development world that changed PC gaming forever. It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic read for anyone who grew up playing PC games during the 80s and 90s. It gives us a birds-eye view of what the burgeoning gaming industry was like back then, not just with the technical and business aspects, but a lot of the human aspects as well: there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of drama, conflict, and betrayal to go around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book&amp;rsquo;s narrative does a good job of contrasting the Two Johns: Carmack was a programmer, a technical wizard who pushed the boundaries of game programming where no one else dared go. He was interested purely in the programming and in the creation of virtual worlds and preferred a smaller, leaner, ruthlessly efficient company focused on making the most of his technology. Romero was a gamer first, and an ambitious and competitive one. He was the number one competitor on their own deathmatch games and dreamt of building a gaming empire, living the life of a rock start among the gaming community as the front man of id software. Together their complimentary skill set would take them through a dizzying rise to fame and fortune in the game development world as they blazed new trails, defined new genres, and inspired a new generation of competitors. At the same time, their differences would ultimately cause them to go down different paths &amp;ndash; knowing full well in advance how the story ended for their partnership made me turn the pages quicker as I dreaded the inevitable split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a gamer since the late eighties, and though I never considered myself particularly good at first-person shooters, I did play most of the games that comprised id software&amp;rsquo;s wonder years &amp;ndash; Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Doom II, Quake and Quake II. I will freely confess I mostly used the build-in cheat codes to just fool around in most of these games, although I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I finished Quake II&amp;rsquo;s single-player campaign legitimately. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have good internet back then, so the only opportunity I ever had to play Deathmatch back then was split-screen on a console at a friend&amp;rsquo;s house, even then it was helluva fun. Post-Quake II, I never played FPSes much again, though I did enjoy reading about John Romero and Ion Storm and was looking forward to their promised RPG Anachronox and only later heard about what a failure Daikatana turned out to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have this lingering dream of breaking into game development somehow. Though I&amp;rsquo;m not envious of the death march crunch mode periods typically described in the book, I am a bit envious of what a huge advantage it was for geniuses like Carnack and Romero to have been at the right place and time for the nascent games industry to turn them into legends. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;d have had the technical chops to compete with them if I had the same opportunities, but I surely would have given it a go. I consider myself closer in temperament to Carnack than Romero &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m more interested in the technical side and could probably use some help in the promotion and game design and level design stuff. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;ll ever actually get there, but I take solace in this quote from the penultimate chapter of the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;wp-block-quote&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Carmack disdained talk of highfalutin things like legacies but when pressed would allow at least one thought on his own. &#34;In the information age, the barriers just aren’t there,&#34; he said. &#34;The barriers are self-imposed. If you want to set off and go develop some grand new thing, you don’t need millions of dollars of capitalization. You need enough pizza and Diet Coke to stick in your refrigerator, a cheap PC to work on, and the dedication to go through with it. We slept on floors. We waded across rivers.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;This started as one of those silly Facebook memes where you post one thing every day and didn&amp;rsquo;t have to explain and you tagged other people and they continued with the meme. I was very bad at following the meme instructions, but I did find the exercise interesting. I found it difficult to identify 10 specific movies, and since I didn&amp;rsquo;t explain during the FB posts, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d make a blog post about them instead. So here we go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started the meme, this was the only movie I was sure would be on my list, the only real easy pick. The rest of the list took a lot more thinking. Back to the Future (and the rest of the trilogy, really it&amp;rsquo;s hard to take them separately) is undoubtedly my favorite movie of all time. (And unquestionably the best time travel of all time, fight me!) There is not much to say: it came out when I was growing up and instilled with me a great love for time travel stories of all kinds. I was especially fond of how cleverly all three movies tied together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Star Wars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of both Star Wars and Star Trek, but was a fan of light sabers before phasers. The original Star Wars actually came out the year before I was born, and I never saw any of the original trilogy in the theaters (or at least I don&amp;rsquo;t remember doing so). My earliest memory of these movies was watching A New Hope via betamax at my &lt;em&gt;ninong&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; house during one of our visits there when I was a child.  ANH is my choice here, but Empire and Jedi hold up really well for me as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dark Knight is still easily the best superhero film of all time. Marvel&amp;rsquo;s MCU films have been good and entertaining, but nothing still comes close to Nolan&amp;rsquo;s second outing with the Batman. It&amp;rsquo;s the sort of movie where I wish I could watch it again for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Few Good Men&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may or may not have reenacted that final showdown between Caffy and Jessop more than once. This movie is my favourite lawyer movie and/or show of all time, and was a big reason why I enjoyed lawyer shows like &lt;em&gt;The Practice&lt;/em&gt; moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoolander&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certain elements of pop culture that have a shared special meaning for certain groups of people. Zoolander is one of them. For some reason, me and a group of work friends latched onto the movie and kept quoting it in our internal chats for ridiculous reasons. The movie isn&amp;rsquo;t of the best quality, but it&amp;rsquo;s hilarious and we still randomly say &lt;em&gt;Merman!!&lt;/em&gt; when we see each other. (The sequel did not make any particular impression on our group.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toy Soldiers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of those weird instances where I can&amp;rsquo;t tell why I like this movie so much. I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen it in the theatres or TV nor do I have any digital copy, but I do believe we had a betamax copy of it back in the day and that me and my brother watched it several times. I have fond memories of this movie and being especially excited at the sequence where they use the flying drone thing to create a distraction while one of the kids sneaks out avoiding the hostage takers in order to communicate information to law enforcement, and he has to sneak back in in time for roll call, which he misses and he has to pretend he was in the shower all along. Actually, that&amp;rsquo;s mainly the only part of the movie that I can clearly remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groundhog Day&lt;/p&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#17915e2f8b54952267619aeb9d3f2f58-lightbox&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit strange for me to have a kind of a sappy romance movie on this list, but it&amp;rsquo;s also an awesome time loop movie that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen many, many times. I thought about putting &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt; on this list as the representative Bill Murray movie, and it was close but &lt;em&gt;Groundhog Day&lt;/em&gt; won out, probably because I really really like stories that mess with the flow of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captain America: Winter Soldier&lt;/p&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#35cceb2d82c2bc44c509e0b7744cd9e1-lightbox&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve greatly enjoyed the MCU over the past ten years, so I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure it deserved at least one slot on this list. I waffled between choosing &lt;em&gt;Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; for this, but while the space adventure was fun, I chose the Captain America one because of the timely themes of government surveillance and the government being controlled by evil Nazis and well-meaning civil servants having to defy orders to save the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;Zoolander&lt;/em&gt; was the cult classic for my work friends, &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter The Movie&lt;/em&gt; is the so-bad-its-good cult classic for me and my high school friends. The person who tagged me to make this list had to comment that he wishes he had added this one to his list since we basically quote it all the time whenever we get together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transformers the Movie&lt;/em&gt; is basically a summary of everything that was awesome about childhood pop culture in the 1980s. It&amp;rsquo;s too bad no one ever thought about making a series of live-action movies in this franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started this list I had trouble getting beyond the first item, but after having thought about it a while, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of other movies I&amp;rsquo;d have liked to be able to fit in this list. _Ghostbusters, Die Hard, the Indiana Jones trilogy, Con Air, Shawshank Redemption, Inception, Infinity War, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, _and that&amp;rsquo;s just off the top of my head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading! What are your top ten favourite movies of all time?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The meme was supposedly to post movie posters, but for the first few ones I was feeling inspired enough to try to draw the movie posters instead.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Book Review: The 1-Page Marketing Plan by Allan Dib

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I realise it&amp;rsquo;s a bit weird for me to be reviewing a marketing book, given my self-proclaimed aversion to marketing and sales. A while back I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2018/06/book-review-tribe-of-mentors-by-tim-ferris/&#34;&gt;review for Tim Ferris&amp;rsquo; book Tribe of Mentors&lt;/a&gt; on this blog, and for some reason someone decided to contact me citing this review and asked if I would review this other book and they would give me a complimentary copy. This was something new to me, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try it out! (I guess this a thing I do know. Feel free to send me books on random topics to review!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/1-Page-Marketing-Plan-Customers-Money/dp/1989025013/ref=la_B01B715MGW_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1529560817&amp;amp;sr=1-1&#34;&gt;Link to the book on Amazon.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on to the book: It&amp;rsquo;s relatively short, it only took me a while to get through it because of general busy-ness. Coming from someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much experience in marketing and sales, I think the book gives a decent overview of this space. I have some prior informal knowledge of many of these concepts, but it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have a more structured idea of how the general flow of marketing works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find a lot of modern marketing techniques distasteful. I&amp;rsquo;m not especially fond of people aggressively push-marketing to me via cold calls or pushing flyers in my face. To the book&amp;rsquo;s credit, it points out that such blind-shotgun techniques are wildly ineffective. And while it doesn&amp;rsquo;t go into too much detail about each particular area, I think having a more solid understanding of modern marketing techniques and mentalities will help me &amp;ldquo;understand the enemy&amp;rdquo; better, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to the 1-page marketing plan itself: I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough marketing knowledge to say whether it&amp;rsquo;s really an innovation in implementation as the author claims, but it seems like a reasonable checklist for a business to consider when planning out their marketing activities. If I ever manage to talk myself into starting a business, the overview given by this book would certainly be useful. The book itself isn&amp;rsquo;t very expensive, so I think it&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable buy for someone new to the marketing space.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Book Review: Tribe of Mentors by Tim Ferris

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;This book was on sale on Amazon Kindle a while back, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d give it a whirl. Some years ago I had read one of the author&amp;rsquo;s previous books, &lt;em&gt;The Four Hour Workweek&lt;/em&gt;, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too impressed. It was interesting at least, but a lot of the advice seemed either difficult to apply to my personal situation or involved doing stuff I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really interested in (i.e. sales and marketing and whatnot). But this new book intrigued me &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a collection of life advice from &amp;ldquo;mentors&amp;rdquo;, basically successful people from a wild variety of fields including entrepreneurs, celebrities, venture capitalists, athletes, chefs, scholars, bloggers, authors, and so on. I&amp;rsquo;m always a sucker for this sort of thing &amp;ndash; even if I don&amp;rsquo;t learn anything myself personally, it&amp;rsquo;s always interesting to learn how other people approach life. Spoilers: I enjoyed the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s some common themes that are often repeated among the different mentors in the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many recommend some form of meditation, whether it be transcendental or something else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many stress how important it was to them to be able to say &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; to unnecessary commitments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of them recommend some form of nonconformity and taking the time to find your own path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some great examples of learning from failures and really makes you think about how we often overreact to failures that later on turn out to be not that big a deal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was often pleasantly surprised by how well-read some of the celebrities turned out to be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each mentor also gives a short list of books they often give out as gifts, and there&amp;rsquo;s a *lot* of interesting books mentioned, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably try to read quite a few of them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also started using this function in the Kindle app which let&amp;rsquo;s me highlight some parts and save them for later. I would send those quotes to Google Keep. (Although to be honest there were a lot I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to note down, mostly because I was lazy.) Here are the ones I did manage to save:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.&amp;rdquo; –Steve Jobs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I say no to nearly everything. I make a lot fewer short-term compromises. I aspire to only work with people who I can work with forever, to invest my time in activities that are a joy unto themselves, and to focus on the extremely long term.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Naval Ravikant, CEO and co-founder of AngelList&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;God will not have his work made manifest by cowards.&amp;quot;—Ralph Waldo Emerson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Desire is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Naval Ravikant, CEO and co-founder of AngelList&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;First, whenever possible, connect with others. Second, with enthusiasm, strive always to create fun and delight for others. And third, lean into each moment and encounter expecting magic—or miracles.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Adam Robinson, educator, freelance author, and US Chess Federation life master&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_&amp;ldquo;Too often, I hear people effectively given advice that is consistent with sunk cost fallacies. I certainly heard it a lot. &amp;ldquo;You’ve spent X years learning Y, you can’t just up and leave and now do Z,&amp;rdquo; they say. I think this is flawed advice because it weighs too heavily the time behind you, which can’t be changed, and largely discounts the time&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Peter Attia, Surgeon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_&amp;ldquo;Yet change is usually stressful, and after a certain age, most people don’t like to change. When you are 16, your entire life is change, whether you like it or not. Your body is changing, your mind is changing, your relationships are changing—everything is in flux. You are busy inventing yourself. By the time you are 40, you don’t want change. You want stability. But in the twenty-first century, you won’t be able to enjoy that luxury. If you try to hold on to some stable identity, some stable job, some stable worldview, you will be left behind, and the world will fly by you. So people will need to be extremely resilient and emotionally balanced to sail through this never-ending storm, and to deal with very high levels of stress.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Yuval Noah Harari, author of Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_&amp;ldquo;So you have no choice but to really get to know yourself better. Know who you are and what you really want from life. This is, of course, the oldest advice in the book: know thyself. But this advice has never been more urgent than in the 21st century. Because now you have competition. Google, Facebook, Amazon, and the government are all relying on big data and machine learning to get to know you better and better. We are not living in the era of hacking computers—we are living in the era of hacking humans. Once the corporations and governments know you better than you know yourself, they could control and manipulate you and you won’t even realize it. So if you want to stay in the game, you have to run faster than Google. Good luck!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Yuval Noah Harari again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I read a book like this it refreshes me a little bit and gives me a better sense of perspective and inspires me to do more things that I want to do and maybe live life a little bit more on my own terms. (Whether I actually execute on that, well that&amp;rsquo;s a different matter all together.)&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Spoiler Alert!

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;When Game of Thrones entered its sixth season in 2016, it was true spoiler territory for those of us who had read the GRRM books before HBO&amp;rsquo;s TV adaptation turned the property into a worldwide phenomenon. Due to the author&amp;rsquo;s glacial writing pace, at this point the TV series went past the point that the novels had reached. Thus nobody &amp;ndash; book readers or tv viewers &amp;ndash; knew what events would unfold in the story. I usually don&amp;rsquo;t watch the episodes until a few days after they air. On the day the first episode aired I found while scrolling through my social media feeds that one of my friends (who shall remain nameless) posted what turned out to be the resolution to the cliffhanger ending of both the previous TV season and the last available book. It was of course followed by immediate comments of &amp;ldquo;Spoiler!&amp;rdquo; from me and a few other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people might say, what&amp;rsquo;s the big deal? When you&amp;rsquo;re invested in a story, getting unintentionally spoiled as to future plot points is a terrible feeling. It robs of you of the the experience, as you now go into the story with certain expectations. You only ever get one chance to watch/read/experience a story for the first time. If you enjoyed that experience, you should be considerate of others and not take that same experience away from them. (Unless they ask for it of course.) Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s just a story. But hey, life is stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to talk about what happened in a story is certainly understandable. You&amp;rsquo;re excited about the story and you can&amp;rsquo;t wait to talk to people about it and tell them what you think and speculate about what happens next and so on. It&amp;rsquo;s akin to coming back to school/work on Monday and discussing what happened in your favorite TV shows over the weekend. (Back in high school we probably had multiple Monday morning conversations along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Can you believe Goku is still running down the snake road?&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when it&amp;rsquo;s you and your buddies talking about it over the water cooler after everybody&amp;rsquo;s seen the episode in question that&amp;rsquo;s fine. But in the modern age, we have social media, and with social media comes the tendency to broadcast your thoughts to the world. If you&amp;rsquo;re not careful you&amp;rsquo;re going to accidentally spoil everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing about this because of Avengers Infinity War of course. I normally post a spoiler-free review on Facebook after watching a movie, but there&amp;rsquo;s so much to unpack in this movie I had to get down my thoughts and write &lt;a href=&#34;http://nedstarkdies.com/avengers-infinity-war/&#34;&gt;a spoiler-filled review over on NedStarkDies.com&lt;/a&gt;. Marvel themselves were well aware of the dangers spoilers poised in ruining people&amp;rsquo;s experience of the movie. In the weeks running up to the movie, they ran a campaign to encourage people to avoid spreading spoilers using the hashtag &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ThanosDemandsYourSilence&amp;amp;src=typd&#34;&gt;#ThanosDemandsYourSilence&lt;/a&gt;. The campaign included a letter from the Russo brothers and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhLsx3BzsvY&#34;&gt;video message from the cast&lt;/a&gt;. The campaign seems to have been largely successful, which is amazing to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to watch the movie on the opening day, so it was a bit brave for me to still be scanning my feeds in the days before I was able to watch. But I think I got away mostly unscathed. I will say however, that I do consider as mild spoilers reactions like &amp;ldquo;I need a hug&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;that wasn&amp;rsquo;t good for kids&amp;rdquo;. I mean, that already implies the tone of the ending. But then again, I&amp;rsquo;m probably more finicky about spoilers than most &amp;ndash; these days I tend to avoid all but the first trailer for any movies I plan to watch since I feel that succeeding trailers already tend to spoil too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last spoiler-related anecdote: my brothers and I are big fans of profession wrestling (WWE). We used to follow all the storylines and whatnot. Back in 2005, up-and-comer Dave Batista (who also happens to appear in Infinity War) got his first title shot at Wrestlemania 21. One of my brothers was unable to watch the show at the time that it aired on local TV. But he didn&amp;rsquo;t want us to spoil the match outcome for him until he got a chance to find a copy that he could watch. We didn&amp;rsquo;t want to download it because it would have taken too long on our very slow internet back then. It took him a couple of months to find a store that had DVD copies of the event. As the lady behind the counter handed him the DVD she commented something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Batista was so good in this event sir, he became the champion!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Last weekend I watched Aureus Solito&amp;rsquo;s movie &lt;em&gt;Pisay&lt;/em&gt; at the UP film center with a couple of friends (both of whom were my Pisay batchmates of course).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated &lt;em&gt;Pisay&lt;/em&gt; is the nickname for our beloved _Philippine Science High School. _It&amp;rsquo;s a system of government-run schools with a special focus on science and math subjects. There&amp;rsquo;s a highly-competitive entrance exam and we&amp;rsquo;ve always been told that students who make it in are considered the &amp;ldquo;cream of the crop.&amp;rdquo; (I don&amp;rsquo;t know that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard anyone outside Pisay say that though.) Students are given full scholarships and a modest stipend, and are required to take a science course upon graduation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie was pretty good. It was more or less four short stories tied together, each one focused on a different year and following a particular batch of students through their stay at Pisay. Each story covers themes central to the Pisay experience: the difficulty of getting in, balancing academics and relationships, stipends, homesickness, trying to pass and failing, wanting to take a non-science course, and so on. The movie takes place during the school years from 1982-1986, basically during the fall of the dictatorship. So it also gets to cover some of the major events during that period and the senior year story has a stronger focus on activism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that the movie will be a lot more appreciated by people who actually went to Pisay or people who lived through the 80s. (I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if teenagers in the 80s really used that much slang though.) I&amp;rsquo;m also not sure how accurate it is as a reflection of what it was to be a Pisay student in the 80s &amp;ndash; some things felt deliberately dramatized for the film&amp;rsquo;s sake. (That&amp;rsquo;s fine though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This movie hits all the nostalgia points even though it takes place in a completely different time period than when I was there. I look back fondly on my days in Pisay and consider that an important formative period for me. It was challenging and rewarding and it was great to be among peers that shared many of my interests and many lifelong friendships were formed. Maybe someday I&amp;rsquo;ll write about the experience more, but probably one blog post wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;First, the spoiler-free summary (spoilers after this part):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overall a very entertaining movie to sit down and watch popcorn and to enjoy the jokes and the space battles and the different colored lights and the tiny adorable tree creature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GOTG&amp;rsquo;s humor was one of its strong points and for the 2nd movie, they push the comedy up a notch, perhaps a little too much in some places. Lots of funny gags and one-liners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I felt like some of the character/background development stuff was pushed a bit too hard as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the movie&amp;rsquo;s plot also felt a bit thin and straightforward. I mean, you could see some of the major plot points coming a mile away. Maybe from the trailers even&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star Lord was ok. Gamora/Nebula felt poorly written. Rocket was a bit annoying. Drax and Mantis were ok, although the space they have for Mantis&amp;rsquo; character overlaps with Drax a bit. I&amp;rsquo;m still not super happy with how Drax and Gamora are characterized in the MCU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m less happy with this movie&amp;rsquo;s soundtrack compared to the first one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Certainly not. In fact, she chose to derp around the mall instead of coming with me and my cousin to watch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IMAX or not: Some visuals used the 3d effect, but nothing too exaggerated or critical. I&amp;rsquo;d say IMAX optional, but it definitely adds something to some scenes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are five extra scenes near the credits (one of them is right before the credits roll, so I can&amp;rsquo;t really say &amp;ldquo;post-credit&amp;rdquo; screens). Most of them are just setting the tone for the inevitable GOTG3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, just pay attention to the background of the credits roll as well, it&amp;rsquo;s great&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I felt the movie was ok, it&amp;rsquo;s kind of just more of the same of what we got with the first movie, which felt a lot stronger overall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoilers follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would have been silly to expect Ego the Living Planet to have his Marvel comics appearance of a planet with a face, but guess what, we actually got it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stallone as Starhawk and Yondu being officially a member of the &amp;ldquo;original Guardians&amp;rdquo; team was great. Oh and apparently Michael Rosenbaum was Martinex!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Stan Lee cameo here was really meant to push the &amp;ldquo;Stan Lee has been playing the same character in all his cameos&amp;rdquo; narrative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giving Peter a Zune was a cruel joke on Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s expense, but sets us up for more music (maybe from later decades even!) for the 3rd movie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of random other Marvel fan-service cameo appearances too: Watchers, Cosmo, Howard the Duck, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure I missed/forgot quite a lot more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
