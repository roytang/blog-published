            &lt;p&gt;Cleared and starred :d&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took me a couple of tries. Nice usage of skewers.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Cleared and starred :D Nice final boss, took me a couple of tries. Also didn&amp;rsquo;t notice the first few times there was a faster skull platform hidden almost in the lava LOL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two branching paths. Also, there&amp;rsquo;s mushrooms hidden in invisible blocks in a few places to help you along the way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: Since the actual level may be taken down at some point in the future, here&amp;rsquo;s a video of the level being cleared by a helpful redditor:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Some of those early vine jumps were way too tight, making the first part way harder than the rest of it lol. Boss fight was nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you make that large fireball with wings that&amp;rsquo;s followed by some smaller fireballs with wings?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a revision of a previous one I submitted. I hope it&amp;rsquo;s not too difficult :)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I uploaded a new version here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://supermariomakerbookmark.nintendo.net/courses/2585-0000-01F7-0982&#34;&gt;https://supermariomakerbookmark.nintendo.net/courses/2585-0000-01F7-0982&lt;/a&gt; if you still want to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve tried your level, it&amp;rsquo;s fun and seems to be just the right amount of difficulty, although I had a bit more retries at the last room than I was happy with haha. Cleared and starred!&lt;/p&gt;
