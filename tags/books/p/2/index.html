Surely You&rsquo;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character by Richard P. Feynman My rating: 5 of 5 stars
After reading this book, I&rsquo;m quite envious of Feynman&rsquo;s life haha. He&rsquo;s lived a very interesting life and the stories are told with a general down-to-earth tone despite the fact that he often has to explain the math and theoretical physics which may be less accessible for laymen. For science-oriented people, this may be one of the best biographies to read  View all my reviews

A Briefer History of Time by Stephen Hawking My rating: 5 of 5 stars
I&rsquo;ve restarted reading this book (and the original) a few times since I was still in school. In fact, when I opened my iBooks copy that I&rsquo;ve left alone over the past few years, it was at around halfway through. I started over again and managed to finish it this time.
Not sure why I had trouble finishing it before, it&rsquo;s a fairly short book and the subject matter is interesting to anyone who has even a passing interest in science.

Perdido Street Station by China Miéville My rating: 3 of 5 stars
Perdido Street Station is a difficult book to read, which is why it took me a lot of time to get through it (and this was my second attempt too! I had to restart because I did not even get very far the last time and did not retain anything). Not because the plot is convoluted or anything like that.

John Dies at the End by David Wong My rating: 3 of 5 stars
2016 book #12: John Dies at the End by David Wong. This book is all kinds of weird. It&rsquo;s a bit like the author tried to think of as many weird things as he possible could then ties them together with an impossible plot that he doesn&rsquo;t even fully resolved. It&rsquo;s like the author was on crack while he was writing most of this (apt, since he&rsquo;s apparently and editor at cracked.

Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies by Jared Diamond My rating: 3 of 5 stars
2016 Book #10: Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond. I actually started this a few years back, thought I&rsquo;d actually get around to finish it. The book is an analysis of history, of what geographical advantages certain civilizations had that allowed them to triumph over others. He presents a lot of interesting topics covering linguistics, animal/plant domestication and food production that may explain these differences.

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince by J.K. Rowling My rating: 5 of 5 stars
2016 Book #8: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Someone had already spoiled me ahead of time about the death at the end of this book, although I hadn&rsquo;t known when it would happen. But it started to become obvious as the book went on, so I wasn&rsquo;t too surprised by the end. This book fleshes out the back story of the series&rsquo; villain Voldemort and finally tries to make Draco Malfoy do something of consequence.

2016 Book #9: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The book starts off with a lot of action before settling into a phase where the three protagonists wander around a lot and sleep in tents and finally into a big showdown at Hogwarts with virtually every character in the series showing up for one big brawl.

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix by J.K. Rowling My rating: 3 of 5 stars
This is a long book, roughly three times as long as the first Harry Potter book was. That wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad if it wasn&rsquo;t so painful to read. Harry here is like a completely different character compared to the previous books, he&rsquo;s irritable and whiny and keeps worrying about how other people aren&rsquo;t treating him well.

Triumph of the Darksword by Margaret Weis My rating: 3 of 5 stars
I read the first two books of this trilogy back in high school, and I recently decided to get a used copy from Amazon. I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to dive into the third book without having to re-read the first two, with a general recollection of the events from the first book still intact.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban by J.K. Rowling My rating: 5 of 5 stars
The series started off a with rather straightforward stories that made obvious that JK Rowling was new to this business at the time, but Prisoner of Azkaban kicks off the world-building to a larger degree. Many elements of the world are expanded upon and added to and by now we get a better sense of the sort of wonders the world of Harry Potter represents.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&rsquo;s Stone by J.K. Rowling My rating: 4 of 5 stars
I had next to no Harry Potter knowledge before reading this book, save what I read in passing on the internets. Yup, I haven&rsquo;t seen the movies either. Finished reading this in under 3 hours; I had been told ahead of time that it was a light read and that I can confirm. A welcome respite from the last book I read, this book has a straightforward plot, nothing too deep here, it&rsquo;s very much meant for kids/young adults.

Words of Radiance by Brandon Sanderson My rating: 5 of 5 stars
The first book I read for 2016 was Words of Radiance by Brandon Sanderson second book of the Stormlight Archive. It&rsquo;s a huge book, and the first half took me more or less three weeks to slog through (I started it in late December), but by the time I got to the middle of the book, a lot of exciting things were happening and my pace improved considerably.

Steelheart by Brandon Sanderson My rating: 4 of 5 stars
This is my second Sanderson book after The Way of Kings, which made me a fan of his world-building. Given that this book is set in a dystopian near-future, the scale of the world-building here isn&rsquo;t as large as that fantasy epic, but still gives Sanderson enough room to carve out a unique setting in the city of Newcago.
Newcago, yes, that name is ridiculous.

<p>Due to an inordinate amount of time spent in a waiting room, i managed to finish Sanderson&rsquo;s Way of Kings today. Great book that I really enjoyed despite taking three months to finish it. The author shows off some great world building and gives us great protagonists to follow. Hopefully I can find a hardcopy of the second book somewhere</p>

<p>This week&rsquo;s book was Mort (from the Discworld series). I&rsquo;ve read the first few Discworld books, and some of the random later ones, but I figured I should start reading them in order and maybe I&rsquo;ll be finished sometime before I die if Pratchett slows down a bit. I also have a couple of unread physical books in the series, but they&rsquo;re a bit ahead of the sequence. The Discworld books are quick reads anyway (I finished Mort in around three hours while doing other stuff), so it shouldn&rsquo;t take too long, hopefully&hellip;</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>The biggest jump is between Ender&rsquo;s Game and Speaker of the Dead, not only in terms of time (since Speaker takes place way in the future where only Ender and Val are carried over from Ender&rsquo;s Game&rsquo;s cast), but also in terms of story style.</p>
<p>I would recommend reading first Ender&rsquo;s Game, then Ender&rsquo;s Shadow. After that, decide whether you want to follow Ender branch (this is far future space exploration, dealing with aliens stuff) or Bean branch (this is more of post-Ender&rsquo;s Game earth politics/warfare)&hellip; I would guess that if you liked the battle school aspect of Ender&rsquo;s Game with the kids being all smart and tactical, you would prefer Bean branch first. if you prefer the sci-fi aspect of it all, then you would probably prefer the Ender branch.</p>
<p>Ender branch is (in order of the story timeline): Ender&rsquo;s Game -&gt; Ender in Exile -&gt; Speaker for the Dead -&gt; Xenocide -&gt; Children of the Mind</p>
<p>Bean branch is Ender&rsquo;s Shadow -&gt; Shadow of the Hegemon -&gt; Shadow Puppets -&gt; Shadow of the Giant -&gt; Shadows in Flight</p>

<p>James Clavell&rsquo;s Shogun was the first full-length novel I ever read (unless you count Hardy Boys books or something), I&rsquo;ve probably gone through the whole book around 8-10 times now, that&rsquo;s not counting times I went back and just re-read some chapters I liked</p>

It&rsquo;s the end of the year, so it feels like a good time to look back at the books and games I&rsquo;ve gone through in 2013.
I guess it&rsquo;s my lack of focus really but my reading rate has really gone down over the past few years, I guess in favor of TV, comics and games. (I guess comics count as reading too, but I&rsquo;m talking about full-length novels.
For 2013 as far as I can tell I only finished reading the following novels:

It&rsquo;s a satisfyingly good ending. The book is action-packed, with 80-90% of the book just bloody, bloody fighting, and very little of the whiny manipulative bitchiness that characterized some of the weaker books in the series. As far as I can tell most of the dangling points are wrapped up neatly, many characters get to be heroes and die, etc. Part of me wonders whether I&rsquo;d be this satisfied if Jordan had managed to finish everything himself.

My reading lately has comprised of Orson Scott Card&rsquo;s excellent Ender&rsquo;s Game series. I got a copy of six of the books from an officemate a couple of months back, and I&rsquo;ve just finished the seventh book today. I don&rsquo;t usually go through books that quickly, so it&rsquo;s a sign that I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed this series. (If I don&rsquo;t enjoy a series, I typically lose interest before even finishing the book &ndash; I have a copy of Sword of Shannara around here to prove that.

I was going through the bookstores at yesterday&rsquo;s sale day at SM North, hoping to find some bargains. I found a copy of The Rock&rsquo;s book, The Rock Says going for the bargain basement price of 50 pesos (roughly 1 US dollar). What a steal!
In case you&rsquo;ve been living under, well, a rock, you&rsquo;re probably aware that The Rock was one of the most popular, most electrifying men in professional wrestling, lovingly termed &ldquo;sports entertainment.

What a long, arduous journey it has been for Roland of Gilead, last gunslinger, in his inexorable quest for the Dark Tower. And now that I&rsquo;ve read the final volume of Stephen King&rsquo;s magnum opus, I find out that it is an even crueler fate that awaits him at the end of the seven books.
I dare not spoil it, though Wikipedia has a nice summary, say thankya. Save to say that Stephen King seems to be correct &ndash; the ending of the Dark Tower series does seem to be the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; one, despite some disappointments in writing.

I was holding off on buying the sixth installment of the Dark Tower until I could find a printing which matched the previous five books, but as I was browsing through the new Fully Booked at SM North I felt a compulsive urge to buy *something*, and lo and behold, Stephen King was on the shelf right beside me!
As usual, the tale of Roland and his party on their quest for the Dark Tower is quite the page-turner, especially since this particular piece of fiction intersects with the real world in an intruiging way&hellip; the author himself, Stephen King, appears in this book as the would-be creator of Roland&rsquo;s world!

Books I&rsquo;ve finished reading in the past few months:
Rapid Development by Steve McConnell &ndash; I was browsing through my company&rsquo;s small library of development books and found this little gem among the usual language-specific tomes. A bit old, but I know from Code Complete that Steve McConnell really hits in the mark with regard to software best practices. This book is aimed mainly at technical leads — coincidentally, that was my role at the time.

This was Scott Adams&rsquo; first non-Dilbert book. If you&rsquo;re used to reading Adams go on about Induhviduals and stupid managers, or if you&rsquo;ve never read Adams trying / pretending to sound philosophical in one of his books, then this isn&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;d expect.
Adams describes it as a &ldquo;thought experiment&rdquo; of sorts, one where he tries to provide some sort of explanation for basically life, the universe and everything. Although it&rsquo;s a work of fiction, it sounds like Adams is trying to see how people will react to his form of philosophy — it seems to be one of his favorite things to do something just to provoke reactions.

I&rsquo;ve never really read much Neil Gaiman before — I&rsquo;m not a particular fan of the Sandman series, for which he is most known. But I know some people who are big fans, so I respect his work at least. Neverwhere is only the second Gaiman book I&rsquo;ve read (well, third maybe, I think I read that thing he co-wrote about the apocalypse), and I&rsquo;m pretty much satisfied so far.

&ldquo;There will be water if ka wills it.&rdquo; &ndash; Roland of Gilead
I had a Powerbooks gift certificate the other week, and the Powerbooks at Megamall happened to have a sale, so I took a look around. And lo, I was lucky enough to find a copy of the fifth book of Stephen King&rsquo;s epic western fantasy, The Dark Tower. It was a huge book, larger than my copies of the first four, but with the same cover style and by the same publisher, so it was the copy I wanted.

Haven&rsquo;t read Robert Jordan in a while. Someone gave me Crossroads of Twilight as a gift, so I read it and hope that his pacing has improved. It has not. He writes well enough, dialogue is nice, descriptions are more than adequate, but I expect some things to happen in his books! He has so many plots running at once, he should at least resolve two or three per book. Perrin, Mat and Elayne get a lot of chapters, but they barely get anything done.

<div class="content p-summary">
A while back I blogged about Bob Ong&rsquo;s first book. A short while after, I also picked up his next two books, Bakit Baliktad Magbasa ng Libro Ang Mga Pilipino? (Why Do Filipinos Read Backwards?) and Ang Paboritong Libro ni Hudas (Judas&rsquo; Favorite Book).
&ldquo;Bakit Baligtad&rdquo; focuses on the Philippines, its people, its quirks and its problems. &ldquo;Paboritong Libro&rdquo; is a lot harder to classify, as it jumps across several topics, with the unifying theme being the chapters named after anagrams of the seven deadly sins.

Picked it up as an impulse buy from National Bookstore a couple of weeks ago. Anyone who grew up in the 80s will appreciate Bob Ong&rsquo;s trip back to his elementary/high school/college days. His tales of school will ring true to anyone from around the same era; younger folk may not appreciate it so much. (My younger brother seems to have no idea what Spin-a-win is/was, although he is aware of SOS, Flames, etc.

I went to the dentist yesterday (irrelevant), and at National Bookstore Shangri-la, I found a copy of The Waste Lands, a day after I blogged about looking for it! They also had a copy of the fourth book Wizard and Glass, but I only had enough cash for one.
On a website note, if you&rsquo;ll notice, I added entries from my del.icio.us account to the blog. It&rsquo;s done using the excellent Feed2JS tool.

Really. I&rsquo;ll read most anything. Books, comics, magazines, newspapers, leaflets, articles, essays. Well, anything well-written at least. When I first got access to the Internet, I was overjoyed. &ldquo;Wow! Lots of stuff to read!&rdquo; And I read a lot online. I started mostly with anime fanfiction, but pretty soon I enjoyed reading discussions on mailing-lists, message boards, news sites, etc. The internet is a treasure trove for one who always strives for information.
