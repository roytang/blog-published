            &lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a one-off night of no matches found that prompted me to post, this has been the general case for me for about the past two years/seasons, I think. I&amp;rsquo;m occasionally able to fight a match, but most of the time it takes me a long time to look for one, then I just give up out of frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time last night, but I did actually manage to fight *one* guy (well, best of 3). Took me ten minutes to find that match, and after playing our 3 matches, I tried waiting another 10 minutes or so, couldn&amp;rsquo;t find another so I gave up. I did lower my settings to 3-5 for this one, so maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll just try that for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the advice!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I lent out my PS4 copy a while back and can&amp;rsquo;t get it back easily now due to some kind of pandemic lol. Also, most of my unlocked last DLC from the last 2 seasons is on Steam now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would streaming (Netflix, Youtube, etc) interfere with the matching? I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;m the only one who&amp;rsquo;d be doing large downloads in the household, so I can certainly avoid that, but other people are almost always streaming video when I&amp;rsquo;d want to be playing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I have a decent fiber connection, something like 60 Mbps down, 45 down, I know that&amp;rsquo;s not as good as some countries, but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty good for where I am. I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll just try lowering my settings though, since the other replies here imply I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be having trouble finding a match. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Wait, so having the icon is good, right? I checked just now and I do have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filthy casual here. I haven&amp;rsquo;t booted up the game in a while, I play on Steam (though I also have the PS4 copy&amp;hellip; somewhere). Tried to find a match (ranked) last night, around 10pm. My settings are connection 4-5, platform any. Waited for 10 mins, couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a match. Not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;m low ranked (ultra bronze i think) while everyone&amp;rsquo;s already silver and up or something? Or are there so few people playing nowadays that it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to find matches. Or is it because I&amp;rsquo;m in southeast asia? Is it harder to find matches here? Or is my connection terrible? Or should I try various times of the day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the reason I haven&amp;rsquo;t played in a while anyway, I always find it difficult to find matches. The whole reason I booted up was I was tempted by the s5 character pass, since the idea of queueing with random select via Eleven was appealing to me. But if it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to find matches, there&amp;rsquo;s no point.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I wouldnt mind having her Alpha 3 costume available in SFV&amp;hellip; or is it there already (she has so many costumes!)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Do these PC mods not affect online play? What does the opponent see on their side?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I wonder how much code these beat em up games had in common. They&amp;rsquo;re all from the same era and I guess roughly the same mechanics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure if such a post is allowed here. If not, kindly tell me where I can post instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t played SF5 in more than half a year, but I decided to give it a go again since I actually had the S2 season pass. However, my arcade stick (a PS3 Hori RAP V3-SA as mentioned above) suddenly won&amp;rsquo;t work correctly. The D-stick input is not recognized by the game, although the button inputs are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to be able to use this same stick with the game so IDK what happened. Was there some kind of update that broke such support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tried playing GG:Revelator with the stick, and it works fine there, so it&amp;rsquo;s definitely something with SF5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any advice? Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I understand the theory behind it, and will try these things to practice my own meaty setups, but one of my concerns right now when playing ranked (I&amp;rsquo;m only in Super Bronze so I&amp;rsquo;m not particularly good) is that against higher-ranked players, I often find myself helpless on waking up because of meaty attacks in particular. So I&amp;rsquo;m a bit more interested in what one can do when the opponent knows these setups inside and out. Do I just try to predict whether he is going for the meaty and block then punish?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;If it&amp;rsquo;s a meaty attack, does that mean any wakeup by the opponent will get snuffed? The opponent must block to avoid getting hit (leaving himself open to a throw)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, some of these setups are different depending on whether the opponent quick rises or not. Will I be able to tell ahead of time if he is quick rising, or I need to decide which setup to use on reaction (i.e. if I see him rising quickly, I switch to the quick rise setup)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry if noob questions!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d do more of these trials if I could wait for fight requests while doing them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does finishing them unlock something? Fight Money, or characters gain EXP or Titles?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Just a fun thing: the stage the screenshots are on is the one where there used to be an Alex-looking character in the background and he&amp;rsquo;s no longer there&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;For those unaware, it&amp;rsquo;s a reference to the Street Fighter character E. Honda&lt;/p&gt;
