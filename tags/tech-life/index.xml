            &lt;p&gt;Google Chrome is adding a new feature that lets their browser target you with ads without using third-party browser cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s some more info: &lt;a href=&#34;https://plausible.io/blog/google-floc&#34;&gt;How to fight back against Google FLoC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But basically it comes down to: if you&amp;rsquo;re a web user who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want your browsing history to be used to target you with advertisments, stop using Google Chrome. There are many alternatives. I&amp;rsquo;m a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; boy myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For site owners, you can add a &lt;code&gt;Permissions-Policy: interest-cohort=()&lt;/code&gt; response header to opt-out of your site being included in the data collected about your Chrome visitors. I&amp;rsquo;ve updated this site to add the header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update 4.18] &lt;a href=&#34;https://seirdy.one/&#34;&gt;sierdy.one&lt;/a&gt; says the &lt;a href=&#34;https://seirdy.one/2021/04/16/permissions-policy-floc-misinfo.html&#34;&gt;fears about FloC aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly accurate&lt;/a&gt;, and that webmasters don&amp;rsquo;t really need to add the response header as long as they aren&amp;rsquo;t using third-party scripts anyway? I&amp;rsquo;ll just keep it around though.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without Their Permission&lt;/em&gt; is a 2013 book by Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian. The central thesis of the book is that modern-day internet breaks down barriers and allows anyone to accomplish great things without having to go through traditional gatekeepers like publishers and such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually read the first part of the book a few years ago, and just resumed reading the book now because I saw in iBooks that it remembered where I had stopped. The first part covered mostly the author&amp;rsquo;s involvement in two successful startups - Reddit and Hipmunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle part of the book is dedicated to the central idea that &amp;ldquo;all links are created equal&amp;rdquo; and as long as you make something that other people want and make it accessible on the internet, success is possible. The author extols how the modern internet has made it easier for anyone to start something big, the same way he and his cofounder built Reddit. The funny thing for me is he cites a number of interesting startups that he&amp;rsquo;s invested in, but I&amp;rsquo;ve not heard of most of them, so presumably they didn&amp;rsquo;t actually succeed in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last part of the book covers the then-online community&amp;rsquo;s protests against the SOPA and PIPA bills, lobbyist-fueled IP protection laws that would have stifled the open internet, the precursor of the modern DMCA. While the defeats of SOPA and PIPA were early successes for online freedom, these days there are still other insidious challenges such as surveillance capitalism  and the deliberate spread of online misinformation and conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I don&amp;rsquo;t object to this central idea, I feel like it should be tempered with the fact that despite the open internet, success is still much harder than the book might portray it. And despite the waning power of traditional gatekeepers, these days there are online gatekeepers as well that can hinder your success. Online gatekeepers include App Store reviewers, closed platforms like facebook that have unclear moderation policies, censorship from governments, algorithms that decide what to surface to other people, and so on. It&amp;rsquo;s still probably better than the old days, but there are still a lot of challenges on the modern internet. To be fair, the book was released in 2013, which was a lifetime ago on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;During a recent session of spelunking through old web stuff, I managed to find some older versions of the blog that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t found before (and hence aren&amp;rsquo;t available in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/archives/ancient/&#34;&gt;ancient archives&lt;/a&gt;). Screenshots of those old versions have been &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2004/12/layouts-2004/&#34;&gt;inserted back in the timeline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it&amp;rsquo;s one of those things I never bothered to archive because in theory all of that content had already been exported from &lt;a href=&#34;https://roywantsmeat.blogspot.com&#34;&gt;Blogspot&lt;/a&gt; to Wordpress and eventually to the current site. But there was some content from this archive I hadn&amp;rsquo;t recovered before: the list of blogs I link to in the sidebar! This content was exported from Bloglines, an RSS reader service available at the time (Google Reader had yet to be invented!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of these old blogs no longer appear in my current follows. I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to look at each of them and see where they are in the current web, both as a look at the kinds of stuff I (used to) follow and as a commentary on how very few blogs last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;around-here&#34;&gt;around here&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is blogs of people who I knew to also be in the Philippines, though not all of them I knew personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the beautiful rookery&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a blog written by a batchmate of mine from HS, hosted on blogspot. The blogspot account apparently still exists, but you need to be invited to be able to access it, so IDK what&amp;rsquo;s going on there. I still follow the writer on social media like Insta.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Entertainment Capital of UP Village&lt;/strong&gt; - another HS batchmate, this blog was hosted on LiveJournal which means it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://zukeeper.livejournal.com/&#34;&gt;still accessible online&lt;/a&gt;! He hasn&amp;rsquo;t written anything there since 2015 though. We are still good friends and are in constant contact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sassy Lawyer&amp;rsquo;s Journal&lt;/strong&gt; - this was the blog of a female lawyer in Metro Manila; IDK who it was, and the site is no longer accessible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sachachua&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/strong&gt; - I didn&amp;rsquo;t know Sacha personally, although I knew some of her batchmates. Her url is still active and redirects to her &lt;a href=&#34;https://sachachua.com/blog/&#34;&gt;current blog&lt;/a&gt;, where she writes mostly about Emacs stuff, something she&amp;rsquo;s been doing since 2004 apparently, so that&amp;rsquo;s a bit of dedication there. I think she also used to write about some productivity stuff, but I stopped following her when she started focusing mostly on Emacs, since that&amp;rsquo;s not an interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the babel machine&lt;/strong&gt; - hosted on blogspot and written by a guy called Joey Alarilla. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I knew him personally. He wrote mostly about games and tech and such. The blogspot site is no longer accessible. Looks like he moved to a wordpress site in 2006 and to a personal domain in 2009, but neither are accessible now. He founded a digital media startup called &lt;a href=&#34;https://digitallifeasia.com/&#34;&gt;Digital Life Asia&lt;/a&gt; and I found him &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/joeyalarilla&#34;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clair&amp;rsquo;s Tech Blog&lt;/strong&gt; - I knew Clair from HS, though we weren&amp;rsquo;t batchmates. She used to write about Linux, Emacs, tech, blogging, etc. Her site is no longer available, but I still follow her on Insta. She does art stuff on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/claircolors/&#34;&gt;public instagram&lt;/a&gt; and takes commissions, if that&amp;rsquo;s your thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;general-purpose&#34;&gt;general purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waxy Links&lt;/strong&gt; - by Andy Baio. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://waxy.org/category/links/&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt; to this day and still on my follows!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J-Walk Blog&lt;/strong&gt; - by John Walkenbach, well-known for his Excel knowledge. His blog was &amp;ldquo;all sorts of things&amp;rdquo; kind of blog, and he was prolific, blogging daily. Looks like he &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bitsandpieces.us/2011/10/14/the-end-of-an-era/&#34;&gt;stopped blogging in 2011&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://j-walkblog.com/&#34;&gt;domain is still up&lt;/a&gt;, but IDK if it&amp;rsquo;s still by the same person - the posts seem like the sort of thing I&amp;rsquo;d expect to find in like copy-paste blogs out to earn money from advertising. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any social media presence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boing Boing&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://boingboing.net/&#34;&gt;Boing Boing&lt;/a&gt; is still up, but no longer written primarily by Cory Doctorow I think. Doctorow now writes a new daily blog on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pluralistic.net/&#34;&gt;Pluralistic&lt;/a&gt; and is still one of my follows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tech-blogs&#34;&gt;tech blogs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Daily WTF: The Daily WTF&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a blog that highlighted one programmer&amp;rsquo;s mistakes every day, some of them were funny. &lt;a href=&#34;https://thedailywtf.com/&#34;&gt;The site is still up&lt;/a&gt;! I think I stopped following them a while ago because I kind of lost interest in that kind of thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Blog&lt;/strong&gt; - I think this blog used to cover mostly Google&amp;rsquo;s tech and engineering stuff. The site is still up at &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.google/&#34;&gt;a slightly different URL&lt;/a&gt;, but because of how much stuff Google is into now, it feels like many of their posts aren&amp;rsquo;t of interest to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joel on Software&lt;/strong&gt; - Joel wrote a lot about running a software company back in the day, and his writing certainly influenced a lot of the dev culture at the time (for better or for worse?). His &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt;, but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t post very often these days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ned Batchelder&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/strong&gt; - Ned wrote about tech / programming stuff; his &lt;a href=&#34;https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/&#34;&gt;blog is still up&lt;/a&gt; (and still has roughly the same layout!). I still follow him and he mostly writes about Python these days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scobleizer: Microsoft Geek Blogger&lt;/strong&gt; - Robert Scoble was a tech evangelist for Microsoft I believe. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I followed him for too long, as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t super interested in Microsoft tech stuff back then. A few years ago he was embroiled in a #MeToo controversy and apparently no longer has a social media presence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;interesting-blogs&#34;&gt;interesting blogs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Troutgirl&lt;/strong&gt; - Troutgirl worked in the tech industry, but her blog was a combination of tech stuff, industry stuff and other nontech things. At some point she moved from her own domain to &lt;a href=&#34;https://troutgirl.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;a Wordpress blog&lt;/a&gt;, which is now only sporadically updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ButtUgly&lt;/strong&gt; - ButtUgly is a Finnish blogger who ran his blog on JSPWiki. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ecyrd.com/ButtUgly&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt; but the last post is from 2017.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Section&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a blog by Ole Eichhorn, who was very prolific, multiple posts a day, posts whatever interesting things he find, that kind of thing. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://w-uh.com/&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt; and regularly updated and even has the exact same layout!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extraordinary Ordinary Guy In Japan&lt;/strong&gt; - this is a well-written English blog by a Tokyo native. I guess I followed him for more exposure to Japanese culture. It looks like he stopped blogging in 2004. The site &lt;a href=&#34;https://xogij.blogs.com/xogij/&#34;&gt;is still up&lt;/a&gt;, but the actual post contents don&amp;rsquo;t seem to load, I can only see sidebars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gapingvoid&lt;/strong&gt; - a blog by Hugh MacLeod who got some traction back then for drawing cartoons on the back of business cards. He is the source of one of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/3ac092f01e360750d83d1beb1112efa0/&#34;&gt;my favorite quotes&lt;/a&gt;. His domain currently resolves to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gapingvoid.com/&#34;&gt;company site&lt;/a&gt;, where he is listed under the staff. It looks like &lt;a href=&#34;https://thejerusalemseries.com/&#34;&gt;he&amp;rsquo;s writing elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MarkTAW&lt;/strong&gt; - Mark blogged about a variety of topics including economics, psychology, marketing, music, etc. For some reason his domain now redirects to Amazon. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any instance of him writing elsewhere recently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WIL WHEATON dot NET&lt;/strong&gt; - Wil Wheaton is of course of Star Trek fame. Followed him mostly for interesting showbiz-adjacent stories. I believe I kept following him until recently during the Trump era, when his content started becoming mostly about anti-Trump rants. That content is fine with me, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t subscribe to it. His site is still up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neil Gaiman&amp;rsquo;s Journal&lt;/strong&gt; - Gaiman is of course a well-known fantasy writer, even back then. He&amp;rsquo;s still &lt;a href=&#34;https://journal.neilgaiman.com/&#34;&gt;journalling regularly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GELATOMETTI&lt;/strong&gt; - I think this guy was some kind of comic book artist. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://gelatometti.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;blogspot site&lt;/a&gt; is still up, but the content seems different from what the internet archive has, and hasn&amp;rsquo;t been updated since 2005.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fishbowl&lt;/strong&gt; - Another blog by a dev, writing mostly about dev stuff. &lt;a href=&#34;https://fishbowl.pastiche.org/&#34;&gt;The site is still up&lt;/a&gt; and is still being updated. Not sure why I&amp;rsquo;m no longer following his blog, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really subscribe to blogs with mostly dev content anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GirlHacker&amp;rsquo;s Random Log&lt;/strong&gt; - she works in tech, but her blog is more general purpose, things of interest stuff. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.girlhacker.com/&#34;&gt;site is still up&lt;/a&gt;, but she hasn&amp;rsquo;t posted there since 2014.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in my mind&amp;rsquo;s zen garden&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a blog by a guy called randomguru on a site called RiceBowlJournals, which was kind of like a community for Asian blogs. Both sites are no longer accessible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kottke&lt;/strong&gt; - kottke.org is still up and running and going strong, still blogging after all these years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tricks of the Trade&lt;/strong&gt; - this was a weblog that posted tips and tricks for different professions. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it lasted very long. The domain currently returns an error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s actually a few more categories in the blogroll there, but they&amp;rsquo;re mostly gaming related, lifehacks stuff, or webcomics. And this post is fairly long already. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to them in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of old blogs from that blogroll that are still active is actually more than I expected! Though still a lot of them that are dead or inactive now, which says a lot about how pervasive &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/link-rot/&#34;&gt;link rot&lt;/a&gt; is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should make sure to archive a present-day version of my current blogroll and check those sites out around a decade from now, at which time I would hopefully still be blogging!&lt;/p&gt;

            <pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2021 07:18:03 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/2021-site-update/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of weeks or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve made quite a few changes to the site, mostly focused on frontend/layout/UI changes. The changes are more or less done, so here&amp;rsquo;s a changelog entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main driver of the changes was this post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://seirdy.one/2020/11/23/website-best-practices.html&#34;&gt;best practices for text websites&lt;/a&gt;. Not all of it applies to the site, since I do have a bunch of image content around as well, but enough that I was spurred to apply many of the points and also include some additional changes I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do. Secondary objectives include: improving site performance, accessibility, and code output; and hopefully making the site menus more organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layout changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplified top header content. V-card and some other stuff moved to the footer. Merged &amp;ldquo;Blog&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Notes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Links&amp;rdquo; into &amp;ldquo;Posts&amp;rdquo; for shorter menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed sidebar. Most of the sidebar links for my own use/benefit anyway, and not for the potential blog reader. Most of the content has been moved into the home page, footer, and the new explore page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added submenus to most listing pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standardize display of page title/description where possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added support for &amp;ldquo;prefers-color-scheme: light&amp;rdquo;. I still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/4d1fb5fa3502d4df0ff4f70f9891a7c3/&#34;&gt;default to dark mode&lt;/a&gt; though!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switched to a monospace font. Honestly I find it hard to decide whether I like monospace or sans-serif more, but let&amp;rsquo;s go with this for now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaned up/reduced the meta info at the bottom of each post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Client-side performance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;full-size images are now set to lazy load, so the browser doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to download them all immediately for example when &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook&#34;&gt;viewing an album&lt;/a&gt;. Only the thumbnails are loaded immediately, full-size images are shown only when activating &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/hugo-lightbox/&#34;&gt;the lightbox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;featured image for blog posts now use a thumbnail when shown in list view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also wanted to improve &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.webbloatscore.com/&#34;&gt;the WebBloat score&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s currently fine for text-heavy blog posts, but I guess I can&amp;rsquo;t avoid a higher score for image-heavy content since the crawler they use ignores the fact that I lazy load the full-size images and they are initially hidden. Something to consider in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new front/home page with content samplers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;added &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/explore&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Explore&amp;rdquo; page&lt;/a&gt; where I can put links that don&amp;rsquo;t belong in any of the submenus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improved &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/now&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now&amp;rdquo; page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cleaned up some out of date stuff in the About pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use profile photo as favicon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backend/code changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML Validation: Most pages should now validate without warnings/errors on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://validator.w3.org/nu&#34;&gt;W3C HTML validator&lt;/a&gt;. There was actually a lot of broken HTML I had to fix (due to me mistyping things and so on.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made sure most images had alt-text, even if just default values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Score of 75/100 on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/roytang.net&#34;&gt;Mozilla Observatory&lt;/a&gt;. It was at 20/100 before. The only thing I hadn&amp;rsquo;t implemented yet was the Content Security Policy (CSP) header, as it would have caused some issues on certain pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also tried to generally reduce the page weight, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually that high before, so I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s any measurable change there. Minifying HTML/CSS was a possibility, but that just makes it harder for me to debug things, and really feels like something too serious for a hobby site like this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripts and cookies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the site already uses minimal JS in a few places: there&amp;rsquo;s a captcha for comments, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/locations&#34;&gt;locations page&lt;/a&gt; requires JS, and some of the stat pages load data remotely via JS, but that should be it. 99% of the pages of the site should be JS free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also don&amp;rsquo;t use any cookies myself. But I do have Cloudflare enabled on the site, and they do add a &lt;code&gt;__cfduid&lt;/code&gt; cookie, supposedly to detect bots. This &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.cloudflare.com/deprecating-cfduid-cookie/&#34;&gt;cookie is being deprecated by May 2021&lt;/a&gt; though, so by then the site should be cookie-free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should be it! I had some other features in mind to implement (never ending scope creep when you have a personal project really), but I&amp;rsquo;ve already spent too much time on this and need to work on my other shenanigans as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing: attaching some images so that I can compare to the future look of the website:&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Walkaway-Novel-Cory-Doctorow-ebook/dp/B01FQQ47OC/&#34;&gt;Walkaway&lt;/a&gt; is a novel by blogger Cory Doctorow. It tells the story of a near-future world and a trend of people going &amp;ldquo;walkaway&amp;rdquo;. This term means walking away from what they call &amp;ldquo;default society&amp;rdquo;, characterized by late stage capitalism, massive inequality, ever-present surveillance, and a world controlled by what they call the zottarich, or simply zottas. Not too far from our own present reality of course. Later, the novel also delves into the near-future (?) concept of humans being to upload their consciousness into machines, effectively allowing them to cheat death by running as a &amp;ldquo;brain in a jar&amp;rdquo; on a cluster of computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going walkaway means giving everything up and deciding to live communally and off the land, as it were. This near-future world makes this possible due to the abundance of materials and equipment that have been left behind or abandoned due to failed cities, institutions or companies. Resources that are presumably being wasted or going unused because of insane things like copyright controls, patents, and so on. Walkaways are shown building entire communities by sending out drones to seek out and gather nearby raw materials and constructing machines like fabricators that can spin out food and clothing, all powered by open source code that is freely shared and improved upon by walkaways worldwide via a highly distributed and decentralized walkaway network. &amp;ldquo;Default&amp;rdquo; society and media portray walkaways as anarchists and terrorists, living on the fringe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot centers upon a small group of twenty-somethings (including one zotta heiress) who initially flirt with the idea of going walkaway, and then decide to jump right in. Under that thin veneer, the novel feels mostly like an opportunity to explore how such an idea could work, and how it could bridge the gap between our current society and an idealized future, post-scarcity and even post-human. That gap is not bridged easily of course. Discoveries in walkaway culture and science such as human mind uploads threaten to overturn the &amp;lsquo;default&amp;rsquo; society and thus draws the ire of the zottas, who send in mercenaries and even armies to disrupt, arrest, and take down walkaways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author is a blogger I&amp;rsquo;ve known about for a while, and his interest in various kinds of technology and possible future applications to help supplant late-stage capitalism are made obvious through the novel. I initially thought it was being a bit too preachy and idealistic about walkaway culture being the right path for humanity. The story argues that there is plenty to go around, and that people shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be coerced to work and should have an abundance mentality, freely helping and giving away to others, something that works in the novel because of the existence of fabricators and the apparent abundance of raw materials, but which I am unsure would be true in the real world. This is why we still have a lot of people arguing against things like UBI and so on. The novel anchors itself from a point where the scarcity issue is mostly addressed, what&amp;rsquo;s left is to overcome the regressive &amp;ldquo;default&amp;rdquo; capitalist systems holding us back from a brighter future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kind of find myself aligned with the author in terms of ideology; I am very much hoping we as a society find a way past the perils of capitalism, but I&amp;rsquo;m not yet so optimisci that it could work. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure whether the story should be classified as a dystopia - it certainly describes a very dystopian status quo, but that status quo is not too far from our current one. And ultimately, despite all the trials and tribulations our walkaway protagonists are subject to, the novel still exudes optimism about humanity&amp;rsquo;s future. So, a hopeful dystopia, a dystopia that can be defeated? A dystopia that is merely a stepping stone towards what the walkaways call &amp;ldquo;the first days of a better nation&amp;quot;

            <title>Decentralization
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/decentralization/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2021 05:50:47 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/decentralization/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Will Schreiber argues that &lt;a href=&#34;https://secondbreakfast.co/decentralization-is-a-narrative-mirage&#34;&gt;decentralization is a narrative mirage&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human history is a story of increasing centralization. From roaming the plains of Africa, to settling down and building homes, to buying food in central markets, to instituting courts of law. Progression is compression. &lt;em&gt;How can I make it so everybody isn’t making their own shirts? Deciding their own justice? Tabulating their own spreadsheets?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve argued a few times on here in favor of decentralization (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/03/rethinking-facebook/&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/08/blogging-and-the-decentralized-internet/&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/tech-censorship/&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;), and the whole concept of movements like &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/&#34;&gt;Indieweb&lt;/a&gt; is a preference for a decentralized internet where everyone has his or her own personal site, instead of reliance on centralized large silos like Facebook or Twitter or whatever. In fact, I still believe in that ideal for the internet as it was conceived. (See also: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/badnetworker/status/1133363823728091136&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;four websites, each filled with screenshots of the other three&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I can see Will&amp;rsquo;s point. Human history definitely means we trend towards centralization in the long term. (Although our cultural and nationalistic differences are still too wide to tend towards centralized government for the planet&amp;hellip;) Still, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean there isn&amp;rsquo;t room for decentralized networks to also still exist, perhaps on the fringe. After all, not everyone wants to live in the big cities, there are still people who like growing their own food, people who prefer independent films over the ones made by big blockbuster conglomerates, people who want to support the small mom-and-pop stores over the big retail chains, etc. Even as culture and society consolidate and centralize, counter-cultures can still exist and even thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just because things towards centralized platforms doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we have to accept the current platforms as the end state, we can still ask for something better. If the analogy was to compare online platform centralization to the tendency towards people living in large metropolitan areas, then something like Facebook could be considered analogous to the worst of industrialized cities: over-populated, polluted, scammers and other shady characters abound trying to see if they can make a quick buck off of you, strangers shouting at each other, law enforcement going after you for arbitrary reasons, and so on. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be like this. The same way we are trying to have better, well-designed cities with better, cleaner systems to better support populations at scale, we also need to work hard to have better centralized silos and platforms, ones that work for us instead of against us. If we have to in a city, it might as well be a good city.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Newsletters, Redux
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/newsletters-redux/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2021 05:35:04 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/newsletters-redux/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A while back I wrote about how &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/08/podcasts-audiobooks-newsletters/#newsletters&#34;&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big fan of the recent trend of newsletters&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized Substack actually publishes RSS feeds for their newsletters, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been following a a bit more of them. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d recommend a few that I&amp;rsquo;ve found to be quite interesting/useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine&#34;&gt;Money Stuff&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/matt_levine&#34;&gt;Matt Levine&lt;/a&gt;. The only non-substack entry on today&amp;rsquo;s list, this Bloomberg column covers financial matters like stock market and investment stuff. (It was certainly useful when following the whole Reddit/Gamestop stock market saga!) Levine likes to go in-depth and long-form, so his columns are usually quite long and cover multiple topics. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that this kind of thing isn&amp;rsquo;t really my specialty, and most of the time I have trouble even getting to the end of any single entry without my eyes glazing over, but I do feel like I learn a lot every time and I hope to someday finish a column claiming I fully understand it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://noahpinion.substack.com/&#34;&gt;Noahpinion&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/noahpinion&#34;&gt;Noah Smith&lt;/a&gt;. Noah Smith writes mostly about economics and US politics. The articles are fairly in-depth (not as much as Money Stuff), and I&amp;rsquo;ve found them generally informative and educational on topics I&amp;rsquo;m not especially familiar with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.todayintabs.com/&#34;&gt;Today in Tabs&lt;/a&gt; by Rusty Foster. I used to consider myself &amp;ldquo;extremely online&amp;rdquo; and aware of most everything on the internet. That might have been true back in 2010, back before all these youngsters came online and added all their vlogs and tiktoks and whatnot. This newsletter (and the next one) helps me keep up with all of the modern internet&amp;rsquo;s day-to-day nonsense. Each issue of Today in Tabs is dense and jam-packed with a whole bunch of recent cool internet things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.garbageday.email&#34;&gt;Garbage Day&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/broderick&#34;&gt;Ryan Broderick&lt;/a&gt;. I first encountered this newsletter when someone shared his &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.garbageday.email/p/everything-you-need-to-know-about&#34;&gt;article giving an explainer about the Tumblr subculture&lt;/a&gt;. It covers a variety of internet-focused topics, but each issue focuses on less&amp;hellip; things than Today In Tabs, albeit covering each item with just a bit more depth. Together, both newsletters give me a good idea of what&amp;rsquo;s happening on the internet on a regular basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://vicki.substack.com/&#34;&gt;Normcore Tech&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/vboykis&#34;&gt;Vicki Boykis&lt;/a&gt;. The author&amp;rsquo;s background is in data science, and from their own description, the newsletter offers &amp;ldquo;takes on tech news that are rooted in humanism, nuance, context, rationality, and a little fun&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t write a better explanation than that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    On 
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/23ef43058c482c829265e01e331d53c2/&#34;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&#34;2021-02-03 15:11:53&#34;&gt;3 Feb 2021 3:11pm&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    I wrote:
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Please write more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just on social media, FB, Twitter, whatever. Write on your own sites and blogs. On your tumblrs, wordpresses, whatever. Long-form, rambling, incessant. The world could use more sincere blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

        






    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above was written mostly as a response to finding &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/link-rot/#2&#34;&gt;so many of my friends&amp;rsquo; old and inactive blogs in my RSS reader&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the term I coined there, &amp;ldquo;sincere blogging&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;d define it as any blogging that isn&amp;rsquo;t for any kind of commercial purpose like for selling something or to generate ad revenue. Sincere blogging can be intended as informative or aspirational or purely for self-expression, as long as it&amp;rsquo;s not mainly commercial in purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it served as reminder to me, as I haven&amp;rsquo;t been writing here as often as I could have. I feel like in the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve filtered my writing a bit by only writing blog posts when I feel like I have something longish or elaborate or profound to say, and that led to making it harder to write posts when I was low on energy or whatever. Most probably a consequence of the proliferation of microblogging, as if a post needed to justify it&amp;rsquo;s length so that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get relegated to the ranks of &amp;ldquo;notes&amp;rdquo;. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been restricting myself to at most one post a day, which is a bit arbitrary and entire meaningless. So, let&amp;rsquo;s change all that, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping. I should be free to post more than once if I want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am with my nonsense again, if you&amp;rsquo;ll have me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Not like I ever left, mind you&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/book-review-the-year-without-pants/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Year Without Pants&amp;rdquo; is a book by writer Scott Berkun about his time as a team lead at Wordpress.com back in 2010-2012. This book came out in 2013, and the conceit of the book back then was that Wordpress.com, run by Automattic, was a fully remote company, something that was still a rarity at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s weird reading this book in the context of the current pandemic, where remote work is now the norm among tech companies. So one of the things I like about the book is it&amp;rsquo;s kind of a time capsule back to an era when remote work was a novelty and not an everyday part of our modern dystopia. That and the stories about the culture at Automattic and Wordpress, arguably one of the main drivers of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/blogging/&#34;&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt; phenomenon at its peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wordpress.com was a force back in the day, and maybe it still is, as Wordpress still powers a good number of sites online I think. I&amp;rsquo;d be eager to read an updated take on what life is like at Automattic/Wordpress.com these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t really recommended the book to anyone who isn&amp;rsquo;t interested in the internet history and the whole tech side of it, but if that&amp;rsquo;s you, it&amp;rsquo;s an entertaining enough read.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h4 id=&#34;1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while now, I&amp;rsquo;d been meaning to go through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/links/&#34;&gt;links section&lt;/a&gt; of this site and clean up/organize all the bookmarks I&amp;rsquo;ve logged there over the years (first via &lt;a href=&#34;https://del.icio.us/&#34;&gt;delicious&lt;/a&gt; and later via &lt;a href=&#34;https://getpocket.com/&#34;&gt;pocket&lt;/a&gt;). One of the first things I had to do was to go through and identify any broken links. So I wrote a quick Python script to ping the URLs and it turns out there were a lot of them, unsurprising given the archives go back to 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not happy with it, but I know link rot is a natural part of the internet, especially as time goes by. Websites fall out of maintenance, run out of funding, get restructured and so on, and the links to those pages break and rot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of link rot is proportional to age: almost half of all the links back in 2004 are now inaccessible, and the percentage drops quickly as we get back to modern day:&lt;/p&gt;

class=&#34;keyText&#34;&gt;Broken links&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been meaning to update the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/blogroll/&#34;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt; on the site, since I haven&amp;rsquo;t added things there in a while. So I went through the good old RSS reader to find items to add to the blogroll, and I noted with sadness a number of blogs from old friends/people I knew who were still on my follows and were no longer active. But at least they were still there and I can still revisit all their old posts and thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse than the inactive ones are those that are no longer accessible at all, either because their domains were no longer renewed, or their accounts on platforms like wordpress.com have been deactivated. Just another form of link rot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s one of the disadvantages of the whole &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/personal-domain&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;owning your personal domain&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; principle promoted by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/&#34;&gt;Indieweb&lt;/a&gt;. Domains require maintenance, which means money, and which also means such personal sites can easily fall out of maintenance and thus contribute to link rot. Granted, running your website on one of the silos has no guarantees either (see: Geocities), but at least those silos have more resources than any individual and are likely to give you a chance to archive your data before they shut down, if ever. (Well, IDK if Parler let their users do that&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Link rot is one of the reasons that when I no longer use Twitter embeds on this site, since if the source tweet is deleted or the account gets banned or goes private, the embed breaks (and back when I was using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; it would even break the build completely)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Link rot is inevitable, as I said. It&amp;rsquo;s part of the nature of the internet. Despite services such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/&#34;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s probably impossible to keep the entire web of the internet online at the same time. Links will break and rot as time goes by. Maybe trying to avoid link rot completely is an impossible ideal, akin to wishing people never die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I guess that it&amp;rsquo;s also a bit selfish of me to want everything to be preserved no matter what. People have a right to want their content off the internet or be private if that&amp;rsquo;s what they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for my own content, I am well aware of my own mortality, and hope all this nonsense I write, such as it is can somehow survive beyond me. Aside from my current hosting, a mirror of all the site content is currently published to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/&#34;&gt;mirror.roytang.net&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, that&amp;rsquo;s still under my domain, so if I ever slip and lose the domain, or if I kick the bucket, it won&amp;rsquo;t be accessible either. But at least all my content exists in source form on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/roytang/blog/&#34;&gt;github repo for this blog&lt;/a&gt;. And a good chunk of that has already been preserved in &lt;a href=&#34;https://archiveprogram.github.com/&#34;&gt;Github&amp;rsquo;s Arctic Code Vault&lt;/a&gt;, so at the very least if all of humanity perishes, some record of me personally may still survive.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Discussions on tech censorship came to the forefront in recent weeks due to the aftermath of the Jan 6 capitol insurrection in the US. I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing down a bunch of thoughts about the complicated issue, let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can hammer them into a blog post. (I also wanted to defer posting about it until after the Biden inauguration, in case more things of interest happen.) Here&amp;rsquo;s where I am now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;trump&#34;&gt;Trump&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so first Trump (or anyone) getting kicked off Twitter (or any service) for TOS violations (inciting violence etc). it&amp;rsquo;s kind of a free speech issue, except the censorship is being done by a private entity, so it specifically doesn&amp;rsquo;t violate the US first amendment. I think that without question, I agree that social media platforms have a right to pick and choose what they allow on their platforms (except those that they aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to discriminate against, by law, like race, religion, etc). And Trump absolutely violated ToS by inciting the Jan 6 riots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are thinking this is a free speech issue because being deplatformed feels similar to being escorted off and banned from a public square. Of course, if you were on a public square goading people to raid govt buildings and kill elected officials, a lot of people would you want you dragged away from there anyway. That being said, I think the bigger issue is why have we these tech companies/platforms that are being treated as de facto public squares in the first place. It feels like we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have allowed them to grow to this size/amount of influence in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re on the fence as to whether this was a correct decision, there is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/misinformation-dropped-dramatically-the-week-after-twitter-banned-trump/ar-BB1cOqVP&#34;&gt;research that says misinformation dropped drastically after Twitter kicked off Trump&lt;/a&gt;, so that as you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll circle back to social media platforms/public square stuff in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;parler&#34;&gt;Parler&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Parler. In theory, Parler could have become a competing public square, in fact that&amp;rsquo;s one of the things it&amp;rsquo;s doing. But Parler itself has been deplatformed, not just by Google/Apple, but by the webhost, AWS. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any opinions either way about the app stores kicking them out (although I will say Apple is more egregious, since there&amp;rsquo;s no alternative to Apple&amp;rsquo;s app store on iOS), but AWS kicking them out seems more problematic. It is a bit analogous to a landlord kicking out a tenant from their building because they are doing illegal things, like maybe running a meth lab? So by that analogy it can be justified. Technically, the discussions on Parler aren&amp;rsquo;t directly violent, but they are planning violence. So, can a landlord evict a tenant because his space was being used to plot violence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the landlord analogy, they could always just find another landlord, but few compare in scale and capability to Amazon. So this may be another case of monopolies being problematic. They could also just host the content themselves, build their own datacenter etc. It&amp;rsquo;s akin to saying you can just buy/build your own house if no one is willing to let you rent one. It&amp;rsquo;s true, but not very pragmatic in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My gut is that AWS kicking Parler off was justified, because Parler wasn&amp;rsquo;t making a good-faith effort to manage harmful content on their platform, but it still leaves a worse taste in the mouth than the Trump/Twitter. scenario&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s super dumb to be planning these things in public anyway! Why don&amp;rsquo;t they get private forums, those are still things right? Or even a private FB group. Can FB ban them for discussions in a private group? Maybe. Or why don&amp;rsquo;t they all join those QAnon forums or whatever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-should-social-media-platforms-change&#34;&gt;How should social media platforms change?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circling back to my earlier assertion, I don&amp;rsquo;t think social media platforms should be liable for what their users post. To me, this seems sensible on its face, otherwise no one would bother hosting content posted by other people (which I don&amp;rsquo;t mind, I have a website.) I also think platforms are well within their rights to filter what is or is not allowed to be posted on their platforms. (See above.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(There&amp;rsquo;s a whole side discussion about section 230 of the US CDA where conservatives are thinking repealing platform protections provided by that law would step them from censoring people, but that seems completely wrong. I&amp;rsquo;m not an American though, so I don&amp;rsquo;t particularly care.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think however, that platforms should be held responsible for promoting, recommending or otherwise broadcasting harmful content via their algorithmic &amp;ldquo;timelines&amp;rdquo;, as that is more of an editorial decision than anything else. Think of it in terms of, if I was a content curator who recommended stuff to my followers, and I started recommending or promoting things illegal things like child porn or criminal stuff, I should absolutely be held accountable. The less that platforms promote harmful material, the less likely they are to gather steam and influece. Don&amp;rsquo;t give harmful people megaphones! &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hankgreen/status/1351736509095792640&#34;&gt;Related twitter thread I read recently talking about this very same thing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the platforms aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to use recommendation engines, what then? I would suggest that strictly chronological timelines should be fine, with no judgment made by the platform as to whether individual posts should be seen outside of that order or by people who aren&amp;rsquo;t subscribed to those sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ads, I think platforms should be liable for what ads they allow to run. And information should be publicly available for whoever paid for the ad. If someone advertises something illegal in real life, law enforcement needs to be able to track them down. And probably we should avoid targeted advertising as well. I think showing ads depending on what topics the user follows might be ok, assuming the topics aren&amp;rsquo;t super specific. For example, if the user follows a lot of politics, showing political ads might be ok, as long as the user is exposed to all flavors of political ads (i.e. ads from all sides). Definitely something that can still be refined. (And it goes without saying, if the platforms can&amp;rsquo;t do targeted advertising, they would be less inclined to siphon off all your personal data? Or is that too naive?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think stuff like Twitter&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;trending topics&amp;rdquo; section is fine, as long as it&amp;rsquo;s not super localized, i.e. you get a sense of what everyone is talking about, not just people in your bubble or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: I will agree not all algorithmic recommendations are bad. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching a lot of British TV show clips on Youtube recently, and YT keeps recommending more, so I watch more, and it&amp;rsquo;s fine, it&amp;rsquo;s entertaining. That said, I would willingly give up those recommendations in exchange for the above. After all, people can always curate and provide recommendations manually (and they can be held liable or banned if needed!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;regulation-and-monopolies&#34;&gt;Regulation and Monopolies&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately social media platforms aren&amp;rsquo;t likely to do the above changes on their own, as avoiding algorithmic recommendations cuts into their &amp;ldquo;engagement&amp;rdquo; or whatever BS metric they choose to use. So it would have to be enforced by some kind of government regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of talk about regulating big tech in the US government, but most of it centers on splitting up larger companies like Facebook and Google. I think that while this is not necessarily a wrong approach, it won&amp;rsquo;t be super useful. The monopoly power these large companies have doesn&amp;rsquo;t come directly from the services they offer but rather from the size of their userbase. (Which admittedly, is influenced by the services they offer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would suggest instead is to cut into that userbase monopoly by requiring the platforms to implement open standards for external services to subscribe/follow publicly-available content published on their platform. It can be something simple like RSS or something a bit more complicated like how Mastodon implements ActivityPub. Private comms/DMs can be via open protocols too like XMPP. (Or email! Remember email?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is, if I want to follow someone on Facebook, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to be required to have a Facebook account. This is part of the reason why so many people find it hard to leave Facebook - a lot of the people they follow and want to keep in touch with are there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t believe it would be necessary to require platforms to do the opposite thing - allow their users to follow users on other platforms - because users would just naturally prefer any platform that does implement such a feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requiring open protocols would remove the whole &amp;ldquo;public square&amp;rdquo; problem because now instead of having 1 or 2 de facto public squares, we can have as many as we want. Official government feeds could be hosted on their own servers instead of being forced to publish via Facebook or Twitter, and the public could still follow them from the platform of their choice. Same goes for influencers, brands, companies, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might think this would make it easier to distribute harmful content and harder to censor it, but as we can see on the open web, the opposite is true: harmful content is difficult to stumble upon normally (you have to be specifically looking for it) and can easily be punished, which is why we don&amp;rsquo;t see a lot of openly operating child porn websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;in-conclusion&#34;&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a whole lot of words, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have a conclusion. Like I said, complicated issue. (And I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are some easy flaws in my assertions above, I haven&amp;rsquo;t spent more than an hour thinking these through.) But these are discussions we should be having, and at least some of what I&amp;rsquo;ve outlined are above are options that are worth considering, given how harmful and divisive we have found the current social media paradigm to be. I still believe in the promise of the internet in bringing people and the world together - but we need to be doing it in a smart and responsible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;rrl&#34;&gt;RRL&lt;/h4&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;One habit I now have that I wish I had started much, much earlier in life would be conducting regular, periodic reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These reviews are a sort of written introspection of the time period in question, the target audience being future me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of the important of this because I had been going through old files the last few months and I really enjoy reading through some older entries and basically traipsing through younger me&amp;rsquo;s mind. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of a time machine in a way. And it helps me by providing a sort of foundation for my thinking, so I understand how my thinking has (or has not) evolved through the years, what mistakes I&amp;rsquo;m still prone to, or which ones I&amp;rsquo;ve overcome, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to start this habit on and off again since basically the early 2000s. This blog is part of that effort, as you can see by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/archives/&#34;&gt;archives&lt;/a&gt;. (Although, not everything can be logged publicly in a blog.) I really only managed to get into a regular discipline of reviews starting around 2017 though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current regular reviews/tracking systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;daily tracker. This is a custom system I built for myself basically just to log things on a day-to-day basis, with categorization, search and summary metrics and graphs. Most useful for expense and tracking what I eat. This tracker is the reason I have a pretty good idea of where my money is going. (I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are OTS systems that can do this, building your own isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;weekly reviews. For things I&amp;rsquo;ve done throughout the week, any big expenses, etc. Helps me remember when I did things. I used to do this privately, via text files, but last year mostly moved it to regular weekly blog posts called &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/weeknotes&#34;&gt;weeknotes&lt;/a&gt;. Having the weekly reviews on the blog gave me a regular public cadence. Most of the things I log in weekly reviews are ok to be public anyway; any private stuff stays in the daily tracker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;monthly finance checks. This is the review habit I&amp;rsquo;ve had the longest, but it&amp;rsquo;s also evolved a lot along the way. Basically I just go through all my bank accounts and credit cards and billing statements, make sure all transactions for the month check out/are legit, check if there are loans/investments I need to follow up on, make sure all bills are paid, and get a snapshot of what my current financial status is. I can cross check the deltas with the numbers from the daily tracker, to make sure there&amp;rsquo;s not any money I&amp;rsquo;m losing unnecessarily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yearly reviews. These are on the blog as &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/yearnotes&#34;&gt;yearnotes&lt;/a&gt;. There are entire years of my early career that seem like a blur - I have very little idea what I was up to in those years. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose that kind of time again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to all of that, I&amp;rsquo;ve recently also resumed doing &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/03/750words/&#34;&gt;750words&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because the old export files from that service were among the old files I was going through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this might seem overmuch for most people, but I find it works for me. It helps me with my thinking, helps me manage my anxiety, and having the past to scroll through is certainly better than doomscrolling all the time. (There is probably some danger of becoming too obsessed with the past, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth it as long as you&amp;rsquo;re aware of the risk.) The past informs the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;(there&amp;rsquo;s probably more. Not even I can keep up with all the things I write&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Word clouds! They used to be a thing right? I was reminded of them yesterday and I wish I had thought of this in time for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/2020-year-in-review/&#34;&gt;2020 year in review&lt;/a&gt;, but here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;rsquo;d generate some word clouds for the blog anyway!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the word cloud for all my blog posts for the year:&lt;/p&gt;








  




&lt;a href=&#34;#1e4410ff92a9c9ded87f6be7974f145f-lightbox&#34;&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;2020 blog post word cloud (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;1e4410ff92a9c9ded87f6be7974f145f-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s a word cloud for all my tweets for the year:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if these word clouds are supposed to mean anything, except possibly that I use the words ONE TIME all too often? Oops, I did it again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud&#34;&gt;this library&lt;/a&gt; for the actual generation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I remember to do this again for succeeding year in review posts!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Goodbye Flipboard
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/goodbye-flipboard/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/goodbye-flipboard/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the Flipboard iOS app as my daily morning news reader pretty much since &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2010/10/ipad-first-impressions-and-snap-judgments/&#34;&gt;I first got an iPad&lt;/a&gt;. It offered a nice, magazine like UI where you can flip through pages full of images and short article blurbs until you can find something you want to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past couple of years and iOS versions though, the app has been performing terribly. Crashes a lot, reader view often fails to load, or flickers and reloads continuously and so on. Just not a very good experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;s not entirely their fault; recent iOS versions (starting from 13 I think?) have become more agressive with their memory management and garbage collection, so app processes seemed to regularly get killed for some reason. It sometimes happens in other apps too, but by far Flipboard is the worst offender. Maybe their code is poorly optimized, IDK. Oh, and they&amp;rsquo;ve started to have a lot more ads! In any case, I&amp;rsquo;ve had enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most relevant Flipboard reading consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;latest world news/headlines (main)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tech news (secondary)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;comics/gaming news (when I just feel like scrolling through Flipboard)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a replacement, I assumed I could simply take their most common sources in each of the above categories and import them into my RSS reader of choice (right now that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.inoreader.com&#34;&gt;Inoreader&lt;/a&gt;). But after doing that, I realized this won&amp;rsquo;t work, because I treat my mealtime news reading differently from feeds I follow via RSS. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have unread counts for the news stuff, just see what&amp;rsquo;s the most recent stuff and move on. I decided instead to revive my &lt;a href=&#34;https://feedly.com/&#34;&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt; account, and import the news feeds there, and use the Feedly iOS app for my morning news reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have been doing this for a few days already; not all of the feeds render well (particularly some websites that did not have RSS feeds, I had to do workarounds), but it seems acceptable for now. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll revisit Flipboard again in a future iOS version and hope they get their stability together.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Last week, Twitter added Fleets, their own version of stories (short-lived posts). As could be expected, it&amp;rsquo;s not something I can relate to. I did post one (saying &amp;ldquo;This is dumb.&amp;quot;) just to see what the interface was like, but that&amp;rsquo;s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about writing a blog post about how I dislike this sort of ephemeral social media, but it turns out that &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/08/ephemeral/&#34;&gt;something I&amp;rsquo;d already written about before&lt;/a&gt;. Things don&amp;rsquo;t change I guess, and they just come around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still can&amp;rsquo;t relate to this kind of thing, since I really prefer having a record of things I&amp;rsquo;ve posted for future reference. It&amp;rsquo;s generally my favorite feature of social media platforms; even when I was winding down my usage of Facebook, I was still using it regularly for the &amp;ldquo;On This Day&amp;rdquo; feature. And I even put an &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/onthisday/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;On this day&amp;rdquo; feature&lt;/a&gt; on this very site as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People do seem fond of this kind of thing though, a lot of my Twitter follows are already posting fleets. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind looking through other people&amp;rsquo;s fleets or stories, there&amp;rsquo;s some fun stuff there sometimes. So this might be the sort of feature we can expect social media platforms to keep putting out in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Server Setup Notes: Ubuntu, Nginx, Django, MySQL

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I recently did &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/site-migration-to-django/&#34;&gt;a server migration&lt;/a&gt; since I moved to new hosting, The move was from managed/shared hosting to a VPS, these are some notes I took during the process, which I figure might be helpful if I ever tried to  do this again. (And maybe someone else finds it helpful too). Links and references to helpeful resources are included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-up-a-webserver-and-wsgi-container&#34;&gt;Setting up a webserver and WSGI container&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already knew I wanted to use Nginx (managed hosting on the old server always used Apache), that meant needing to choose a WSGI container for the Django apps. The choices were either gunicorn or uwsgi. Readings suggest minimal performance difference between the two. I did try setting up both, and found uwsgi&amp;rsquo;s setup much more straightforward and with more helpful step-by-step documentation: &lt;a href=&#34;https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html&#34;&gt;https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nginx itself was pretty straightforward to set up. This &amp;ldquo;common pitfalls&amp;rdquo; article was helpful in resolving issues: &lt;a href=&#34;https://origin-www.wp.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/config_pitfalls/&#34;&gt;https://origin-www.wp.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/config_pitfalls/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I will note that&amp;rsquo;s not in the article above is that for static files to be served by Nginx, it was easier to just have everything be under /var/www, for permission purposes. I initially had static files in a different folder in my user root, but really there&amp;rsquo;s no reason for that since you&amp;rsquo;re going to serve them statically anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-up-php-on-nginx&#34;&gt;Setting up PHP on Nginx&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed PHP since I had a few minor scripts/pages and a Wordpress install that needed PHP. For the setup on Nginx, I found this guide from askubuntu super helpful: &lt;a href=&#34;https://askubuntu.com/questions/134666/what-is-the-easiest-way-to-enable-php-on-nginx&#34;&gt;https://askubuntu.com/questions/134666/what-is-the-easiest-way-to-enable-php-on-nginx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide from DigitalOcean was also helpful: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-nginx-mysql-php-lemp-stack-in-ubuntu-16-04&#34;&gt;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-nginx-mysql-php-lemp-stack-in-ubuntu-16-04&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was encountering some issues with fastcgi not mapping requests to the correct PHP script if the Nginx location block was aliased. This was with me using the default &lt;code&gt;snippets/fastcgi-php.conf&lt;/code&gt; that was provided with the fastcgi install. I resolved the issue by adding an additional fastcgi_param to the php location block like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    location /sample-path {
        alias /var/www/sample-path;
        # autoindex on;

        location ~ \.php$ {
                include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
                fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME    $request_filename;
                fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
        }
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution for this came from the Nginx common pitfalls article listed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wordpress-specific&#34;&gt;Wordpress-specific&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Added 1/21/2021)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wordpress worked well enough for the most part. Except permalinks didn&amp;rsquo;t work! I had to add a directive to the nginx config file for unknown urls to be redirected to index.php:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://nginxlibrary.com/wordpress-permalinks/&#34;&gt;https://nginxlibrary.com/wordpress-permalinks/&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s also mentioned in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/support/article/nginx/&#34;&gt;official Wordpress docs&lt;/a&gt; , but buried in a bunch of other stuff so less helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;choosing-a-database&#34;&gt;Choosing a database&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially wanted to use PostgreSQL (since that&amp;rsquo;s what I was using locally) and set that up first. Then I realized I had a Wordpress install I wanted to carry over, and apparently Wordpress needs MySQL, so oops. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have two databases running, so that was out. Plan out your database usage boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-up-mysql-for-django&#34;&gt;Setting up MySQL for Django&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created the initial MySQL database with character set &lt;code&gt;utf8&lt;/code&gt;, which apparently had the dumb implementation of only supporting 3 bytes for multibyte characters. This led to errors when I tried importing records into Django that had emojis and the like in text. Apparently the &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; character set to use is &lt;code&gt;utf8mb4&lt;/code&gt; (mb4 -&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;multibyte 4&amp;rdquo; I guess?). It&amp;rsquo;s kinda dumb that they had to invent a &amp;ldquo;more utf8 character set&amp;rdquo; because of their initial dumb implementation. It&amp;rsquo;s also dumb that I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize this when apparently the MySQL databases on the old server were already using &lt;code&gt;utf8mb4&lt;/code&gt;! On the Django side, you need to specify the charset in the database settings. Helpful for resolving this issue was donturner&amp;rsquo;s answer on this SO question: &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2108824/&#34;&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2108824/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some initial testing, I also encountered a &amp;ldquo;MySQL has gone away&amp;rdquo; every so often. Turns out Django was holding on to connections for too long, so a timeout had to be set in the database settings as well. SO reference: &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26958592/&#34;&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26958592/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: I just encountered this a few hours after I wrote this post, when I tried to make the site display all times in Manila local time. Apparently, even if I set my Django app to be timezone, aware, additional setup needs to be done on the MySQL side so it knows what the actual timezones are (feels like they should really do this as part of the install!). Basically you need to run &lt;code&gt;mysql_tzinfo_to_sql&lt;/code&gt; to load the OS timezone info into the database. This is in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://django.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ref/databases.html&#34;&gt;Django documentation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-tzinfo-to-sql.html&#34;&gt;MySQL documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;misc-stuff&#34;&gt;Misc stuff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used cron to set up most of the batch jobs I usually run (like the Twitter bots, etc). Initially I had problems where it seemed like cron wasn&amp;rsquo;t running the jobs, even though syslog showed me the cron daemon was actually running. I don&amp;rsquo;t have notes on how I resolved this, but mentioning it here so that if this happens again in the future, I know to actuall take notes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up log files for my cron jobs: I did it this way: &lt;code&gt;0 * * * * /path-to-batch/hourly.sh &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /var/log/cron/my-log-file.log 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1&lt;/code&gt;. The &amp;ldquo;2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1&amp;rdquo; at the end is necessary so that stderr is redirected to the same file (otherwise you&amp;rsquo;d only get stdout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log rotation: these is the kind of thing you don&amp;rsquo;t realize you need to do when you&amp;rsquo;re managing your own server. Anyway, I found this guide helpful: &lt;a href=&#34;https://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/setup-log-rotation-logrotate-ubuntu/&#34;&gt;https://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/setup-log-rotation-logrotate-ubuntu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to set up AWStats on the new server (and migrate data from the old server). This guide was helpful: &lt;a href=&#34;https://larsee.com/blog/2020/06/awstats-on-ubuntu-20-04-with-nginx/&#34;&gt;https://larsee.com/blog/2020/06/awstats-on-ubuntu-20-04-with-nginx/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When migrating the old AWStats data files, the filename format from the oldserver was slightly different (new install needed to end with &lt;code&gt;*.roytang.net.txt&lt;/code&gt;), so I learned a bit of bash scripting to do the batch rename:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;for i in /path-to-tmp/awstats/*.txt ; do cp &amp;quot;$i&amp;quot; &amp;quot;/path-to-tmp/awstats/out/$(basename &amp;quot;$i&amp;quot; .txt).roytang.net.txt&amp;quot; ; done&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt SSL on Nginx: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nginx.com/blog/using-free-ssltls-certificates-from-lets-encrypt-with-nginx/&#34;&gt;https://www.nginx.com/blog/using-free-ssltls-certificates-from-lets-encrypt-with-nginx/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect from the migration from shared hosting to a VPS is how much memory I&amp;rsquo;d need. My old hosting plan was only on 512MB ram, and the lowest DigitalOcean droplet had 1GB RAM, so I figured that was fine! But MySQL occasionally had out of memory errors on startup even at 1GB ram, so I bumped up to the next level (2GB RAM). I guess the database RAM usage didn&amp;rsquo;t count against my limits on the shared hosting! The next tier isn&amp;rsquo;t much more expensive and is still manageable for my casual/hobby hosting purposes, but I will probably try to look into more detail into the memory situation at some point to see what I can optimize.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;h3 id=&#34;leaving-hugo&#34;&gt;Leaving Hugo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit under two years since &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/11/site-migration-to-hugo/&#34;&gt;I migrated the site from Wordpress to Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. As discussed in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/11/one-year-with-hugo/&#34;&gt;this post one year ago&lt;/a&gt;, I was very happy with the general workflow of managing posts through markdown files in git, but had big problems with the Hugo build time, largely a consequence of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/10/archive-of-my-own/&#34;&gt;my social media archiving&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to invest effort into migrating to a different backend, but the problem has only gotten incrementally worse since then, so I decided to take the jump and started working on it last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;migration-goals&#34;&gt;Migration goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main goal is to get rid of the unnecessary build time. I also don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to store all the pre-generated HTML files. It&amp;rsquo;s fine for a small site, but with the large number of posts here, there&amp;rsquo;s a large amount of unnecessary duplication, considering listing pages and such. That means reverting to a system where each page is generated on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to retain the current workflow of managing content via markdown files, so that rules out something like Wordpress. Still, I figured I needed some kind of database for indexing, so that things like listing and archive pages work properly. Given that we would be migrating away from a static site, I fully expect a performance hit, at least initially, but ideally it&amp;rsquo;s not too bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d also like to retain the current content written for Hugo as much as possible. This means the new system will need to be able to parse the custom Hugo shortcodes I&amp;rsquo;d set up for the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also be migrating to a new server which I would be managing myself, which means I would need to set up the deployment myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-django&#34;&gt;Why Django&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I naturally fell back on Django, it&amp;rsquo;s my ORM+backend framework of choice, and the one I&amp;rsquo;m most familiar with. Also, I already had a handful of small Django apps that I needed to migrate to the new server as well, so no matter what I needed to have a Django app on the server anyway. I also had a bunch of Python scripts that were doing already doing support functions for the site like search and ingestion of social media content, so that&amp;rsquo;s something to fold into the new backend as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-bother&#34;&gt;Why Bother?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will fully admit I spent far too much effort unnecessarily doing this, but the realization is that it&amp;rsquo;s actually work I enjoy. This site is primarily a project for myself, and I enjoy the time working on it and learning stuff and improving things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, the effort wasn&amp;rsquo;t too much. There was a lot of code to reuse and migrate, so most of the effort was testing and making sure things worked. Most of the new code was for parsing the markdown files to render the hugo shortcodes as HTML; I basically wrote Django templates for each Hugo shortcode to be supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;changes&#34;&gt;Changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The migration was largely done in-place: site design remains mostly the same, post URLs should be more or less retained. I did take the opportunity to make one nontrivial change: Photos are now under &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/a&gt; category. I really only had a separate photos category before because in Hugo I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a way to query posts that have attached images. Even with everything under Notes, since I have a database now, I can do silly things like show &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/photos/random&#34;&gt;random photos&lt;/a&gt;. Also, now the notes section is closer to a microblog/tumblr-like feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source for the site content will still be &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/roytang/blog&#34;&gt;available publicly via Github&lt;/a&gt;, as it was before. Unfortunately, I am not ready to make public the source for this site, because (a) a lot of it is old code that I reused so it looks terrible; and (b) some level of security by obscurity I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that the site needs to be secure; there isn&amp;rsquo;t actually any critical/important data being stored anywhere. But the fact that a database now exists means I need to follow some kind of security practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The server is now hosted on DigitalOcean. Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://m.do.co/c/6c2e6b11b260&#34;&gt;my affiliate link&lt;/a&gt;. Since I&amp;rsquo;m on a self-managed VPS now, that means Github webhooks now work, so whenever I push new posts, they take less than a minute to now appear on the site. This is a vast improvement over the old system where it would take anywhere between 30-60 minutes depending on how Travis was feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Travis, I set up a new mirror, Travis now publishes to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net&#34;&gt;https://mirror.roytang.net&lt;/a&gt; once a day, hosted on Netlify. The mirror is still generated using Hugo! I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long I can keep up having the content generate correctly for both builds, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this actually went out much smoother than I thought it would. Took less effort than expected, deployment was a breeze. The listing pages have slightly worse performance, but individual pages are hitting 100 on Pagespeed, so that&amp;rsquo;s mostly fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was just the overview of the site changes. There&amp;rsquo;s still a bunch of technical notes to be written up, so that&amp;rsquo;s stuff for a future blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time I used a Django backend for my website was &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2008/12/roytang-net-site-update/&#34;&gt;waaaay back in 2008&lt;/a&gt;, and that didn&amp;rsquo;t last more than a year before I switched to Wordpress. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how long this one holds out!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>On Mobile App Development
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/09/mobile-app-dev/</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 03 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;This post is just quite a few thoughts on mobile apps and mobile app development, all mishmashed together. I don&amp;rsquo;t claim to be a mobile app specialist, at best I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;em&gt;dabbled&lt;/em&gt; in them, but enough to form some opinions I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-bit-of-history&#34;&gt;A Bit of History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first exposure to mobile app development when I got pulled to help my then-company&amp;rsquo;s then-fledgling mobile team with cleaning up the codebase for their iOS app. This was back in maybe 2011? It was one of those projects where some devs built a quick proof-of-concept demo using new technology, then management liked it and asked for new features and they kept adding new features haphazardly until there was just this huge unmaintainable mess of code. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a knock against Objective-C or iOS development specifically or the dev team; the fact is they were new to the stack and were learning as they went while still trying to meet deadlines. I also spent some time reviewing the corresponding Android team&amp;rsquo;s code as well. This was the bulk of my exposure to native mobile dev on iOS/Android. (This was before Swift, so I never got to experience that. Language looks neat though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from a web dev background, I&amp;rsquo;ve always found the fragmentation of platforms annoying. Basically your effort gets multiplied by the number of platforms you have to support, and what would work well on iOS may not work well on Android and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, this concern was alleviated a bit with the rise of common frameworks that could publish to both iOS and Android. The first one I tried of these was React Native. I tried it for a small mobile project I did around 3-ish years ago. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t tremendously happy with the experience. My mistake was probably diving head-first into React Native, when this was my first experience with React and front-end frameworks in general (something new to someone with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/02/old-web/&#34;&gt;my jQuery background&lt;/a&gt;!), so a lot of concepts were new to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, the React Native docs at that time seemed to assume some familiarity already with React, or at least similar frameworks like Angular. I had a bit of confusion with whether I should be using Expo or not, and how to eject, and it resulted in having to restart the project a couple of times. It was also my first encounter with NPM&amp;rsquo;s dependency management, and that annoyed me a lot. A lot of the third-party dependencies I used back then were still immature too, so I often had problems with things like accessing the camera roll and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it was experience, and the ability to publish cross-platform to iOS and Android was invaluable. I went on to use React Native as my go-to mobile framework I would recommend for other projects afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had to do a UI revamp for that small mobile app I wrote three years ago, and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t touched it for a while so I had some trouble with NPM trying to get it to run. In frustration, I gave up on it and decided to rewrite it in Flutter, of which I&amp;rsquo;ve heard good things. Flutter turned out to be great, and it took me just a little over two weeks, part-time to rewrite the app, probably slightly less effort than it took me to write it in the first place. I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough experience yet to have a detailed review of Flutter, but I was generally much happier with the experience compared to React. Part of that may be I&amp;rsquo;m much more familiar with the mobile landscape now and have a better idea of what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, but I really did encounter much fewer points of friction and Flutter seems to have much better documentation. I believe it will be my first choice of frameworks moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;not-everything-needs-to-be-a-native-app&#34;&gt;Not Everything Needs to Be a Native App&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that annoys me about mobile apps is that people/companies unnecessarily want things to be native mobile apps when they would work perfectly fine as web apps. I can understand applications such as Uber may need numerous native functionality (GPS, timely notifications, offline functionality), so that&amp;rsquo;s fine (although many of those things are available using modern browser APIs as well!). Things like online newspapers, forums like Reddit, and so on, are perfectly fine as normal web apps, and should stop prompting me to install their native apps when they detect I am on mobile. Granted that you may get a much better UX experience with a native app, but you also have to install it locally and grant it more access than what the browser&amp;rsquo;s sandbox provides, and that feels like a tradeoff decision that the user needs to make, and not something to nag the user about constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess part of it is that I grew up with the open web and have a significant bias towards it. In general, if I can just access an app via web, I will prefer that, unless the native app experience is vastly superior or otherwise necessary. And this focus on native apps can be bad for the web. This is apparent in apps like Instagram, which don&amp;rsquo;t allow you to use their primary function - uploading images - on a desktop browser. I also had a similar discussion with a freelance client a few years ago, when they wanted to make a mobile app, but not a corresponding web platform, when all of the app&amp;rsquo;s functionality was simple stuff that web could do easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;different-platforms&#34;&gt;Different Platforms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differences in iOS and Android are particularly annoying to me as a developer, especially since I&amp;rsquo;m used to web development. With web, everything is open and standards-based, so you generally write everything using a single stack, and any reasonably standards-compliant web browser will work with the web app in a reasonably consistent way. (Granted, there will be browser-specific issues, but nowadays those aren&amp;rsquo;t too common.) With iOS and Android, you have to test on both platforms extensively, and the build processes and distribution methods are different for each. Frameworks like React Native and Flutter lighten this load considerably, but you still really have to devote more time and resources to testing on the different platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;backward-compatibility&#34;&gt;Backward Compatibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, this one may be an unfounded concern of mine since I don&amp;rsquo;t have much experience in the matter, but I have this worry that native mobile apps tend to &lt;em&gt;rot&lt;/em&gt; more easily, and by &lt;em&gt;rot&lt;/em&gt; I mean, get worse with time, as the mobile OSes upgrade themselves very rapidly. Unlike, say, Windows, which gets a new major version every few years, iOS and Android are constantly getting new versions and more importantly, deprecating APIs and adding new ones! Hence my worry that unmaintained, a perfectly functional app may become unworkable a few years down the line and no longer work on the latest mobile OSes. It&amp;rsquo;s my totally unfounded belief that this is a significant reason why &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/itunes-purchases/&#34;&gt;more than 50% of my lifetime App Store purchases are no longer listed on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. (And also why I&amp;rsquo;ve pretty much disavowed making mobile purchases again.) Say what you will about Windows, but at least they have a pretty good record of backward compatibility when software I&amp;rsquo;ve written for Windows in the early 2000s is still very likely to run on Windows today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;closed-platforms&#34;&gt;Closed Platforms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue I have with native apps is that I have been used to working on open platforms. Windows, for all its faults, is still an open platform, and anyone can write software for it and distribute it using whatever method they desire. And the web is even more open and standards-based (for now at least). For mobile, Android is mostly open, but iOS is mostly a closed platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&amp;rsquo;s tight control over the iOS platform has been in the tech news recently. First was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation&#34;&gt;the kerfuffle with hey.com&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago, and more recently, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/&#34;&gt;their removal of Fortnite and battle with Epic&lt;/a&gt; due to Epic&amp;rsquo;s objection to Apple taking a cut of all purchases on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a mobile developer, the most annoying things about Apple&amp;rsquo;s tight control over iOS apps are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that $100 annual fee for an Apple Developer account. If you&amp;rsquo;re a 1st world developer, that cost isn&amp;rsquo;t much, but if you&amp;rsquo;re a young hobbyist developer in a poorer country who just wants to try making an app, it can be a significant hurdle. Google also charges you some token amount for Play Store access, but at least it&amp;rsquo;s just a one-time fee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the fact that you need to use a Mac to publish apps to the App Store. This is another significant hurdle for hobbyist developers; Macs are typically very expensive computers. Granted Android development requires a beefy setup too, but at least you get a choice of platform for Android development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App store review can be unpredictable; sometimes things that were perfectly fine during a previous release are now flagged in the next review. It feels like you need to get lucky with the reviewer you get. And if the reviewer is unfair to your app, you may be out of luck unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big company like Epic or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/wordpress-developers-says-apple-wants-30-percent-of-its-profits-from-app-store/&#34;&gt;Wordpress that can raise a stink about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the issues that could be levied against Apple for their monopoly over the App Store could be largely addressed if the platform allowed users to install apps via alternative methods, the same way Android does. I fully understand that Apple&amp;rsquo;s tight controls enable a safer environment for naive end users (presumably, assuming they don&amp;rsquo;t screw up), and I actually approve some of their controls like their iOS14 plans to restrict targetted advertising. But more advanced users should be given the option to use alternative methods if they so choose. They can still flag apps installed via alternative methods as &amp;ldquo;potentially unsafe&amp;rdquo; and add hurdles to prevent less capable users from being easily tricked by malicious actors, (Android does this, I believe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-conclusion&#34;&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really have a point here. Maybe I just want everything to be open? I like open platforms lol.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Filed under &amp;ldquo;Things I Don&amp;rsquo;t Really Grok&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;podcasts-and-audiobooks&#34;&gt;Podcasts and audiobooks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These 2 are kind of in the same boat. Their main sin is that they are audio-only. When consuming content, my order of preference for formats is roughly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;text (+images I guess) (most preferred)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;video (with audio)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;audio only (least preferred)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think these preferences have to do with information density: I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I prefer text because text can convey the most amount of information in the least amount of bits. I&amp;rsquo;ll also watch informative videos, to a point. If it&amp;rsquo;s movie-length, it better be damn entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves us with audio. I don&amp;rsquo;t see the appeal. I try podcasts, sometimes, when I&amp;rsquo;m out walking or such. Audiobooks, I&amp;rsquo;ve never tried. My main concern is the amount of attention you have to give the content. Because you only have the audio as a source of information, if you lose track of it, then why are you even bothering? And if I try to listen to an audiobook or podcast while doing something else that requires my attention, there&amp;rsquo;s a very low chance I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to absorb anything from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the few times I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to listen to podcasts while I&amp;rsquo;m out walking, I only dare to if I&amp;rsquo;m walking in this safe, short, and circular route inside our subdivision. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t dare do it in the streets outside where there&amp;rsquo;s real traffic. That seems like a recipe for being distracted while crossing the road, which CAN LEAD TO DEATH! Granted, the odds of such a disaster are fairly low, but why risk it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe if I still had a regular 2-hour commute (one way) to work, then audiobooks/podcasts would be more appealing while I sit in the back of an FX in Metro Manila traffic. But even then, I think I&amp;rsquo;d rather nap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make an exception for listening to music of course. Listening to music doesn&amp;rsquo;t take much concentration, and can easily happen as a background task, so that&amp;rsquo;s fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I just haven&amp;rsquo;t found the right podcast to follow? IDK, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a few. Never could keep it up as a habit. Also, can I subscribe to podcasts using RSS feeds? I think I can, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never tried it. Like, if I find a podcast on Spotify there doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be an RSS option?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;newsletters&#34;&gt;Newsletters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &amp;ldquo;Newsletters&amp;rdquo;, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean those popups that appear on news sites or commercial blogs asking you to subscribe to get updates or such. Those are just spammy marketing BS and I have no interest in such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &amp;ldquo;Newsletters&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;m referring to a recent trend in the tech/online world of people moving their writing from websites/blogs to newsletters via platforms such as substack. These have some merit, as it basically involves the type of blog writing I like to consume, except in email newsletter form. There are some such newsletters whose posts I&amp;rsquo;ve read and I do find their content interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s the problem? The problem is I want to treat this type of content the same way I treat blog posts and newspaper editorials - as casual reading that I can pick up and read at my leisure. And (for me at least), casual reading doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong in my email inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an inbox zero policy, and to achieve that I&amp;rsquo;m very strict about what I let in my email inbox. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly limited to actual conversations with people and important notifications. The email inbox is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; where I&amp;rsquo;d like to consume casual reading that I can pick up whenever I&amp;rsquo;d like. Just the idea of leaving them there while having unread markers is annoying. In theory I could filter them to a subfolder and then the unread count would accumulate there, but I don&amp;rsquo;t like unread counts even in my email subfolders!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have nothing against the Substack business model (writers gotta earn a living I guess) and I&amp;rsquo;m sure a lot of people don&amp;rsquo;t mind consuming casual reading content via email, but Substack (and similar platforms) should provide alternate ways to consume their content, preferably RSS feeds. In the meantime I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a service called &lt;a href=&#34;https://kill-the-newsletter.com/&#34;&gt;Kill the Newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe to a few newsletters I like. It works well enough (though I checked just now and one of the feeds, on a nonsubstack platform, seems to have stopped last June. I just created a new inbox in KTN for it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(It would be even better if the content writers made their content available on their own websites, instead of centralized in a silo like Substack!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, are there any newsletters anyone can recommend that might be relevant to my interests?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>On Mozilla and Firefox

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Mozilla made the tech news recently for laying off a whole lot of people. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/&#34;&gt;Official statement&lt;/a&gt;). People were alarmed and worried about the future of what is the last major independent browser and the open web, bit it looks like it isn&amp;rsquo;t that bleak. Most of the layoffs were to teams other than those working on Firefox, things like the experimental browser engine Servo, devtools, and MDN. The core Gecko team seems to be unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that these things aren&amp;rsquo;t important. MDN, if you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, is a set of documentation of web standards and browser support, &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/&#34;&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt;, that is one of the best resources for web developers working on cross-platform things. Mozilla no longer funding it&amp;rsquo;s maintenance is a big deal, it means it&amp;rsquo;s less likely to be kept up-to-date, even though community work can still continue. Peter-Paul Koch, writer of &lt;a href=&#34;https://quirksmode.org&#34;&gt;quirksmode.org&lt;/a&gt;, which was the original resource for cross-browser compatibility back in the heyday of the browser wars, wrote an article about Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s problems titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2020/08/the_cult_of_the.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Cult of the Free&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; where he argues that it&amp;rsquo;s time to step out of this mentality that all these resources must be maintained for free by &amp;ldquo;the community&amp;rdquo;, but that we as consumers must get used to the idea of paying or donating to support these resources. Expecting &amp;ldquo;the community&amp;rdquo; to step in and maintain these resources &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2020/08/i_love_mdn_or_t.html&#34;&gt;also devalues the work of technical writers.&lt;/a&gt; Trying to get more people to support these &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; resources is a good idea, but I worry it goes against the grain of years of internet culture which has conditioned people to expect online content for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of contributing, a while back I had considered looking for open source projects I could contribute to, and preferred projects that I actively use. Given that I&amp;rsquo;d been using Firefox &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2004/10/firefox-1-0-on-november-9/&#34;&gt;since before version 1.0&lt;/a&gt;, one of the projects I considered was Firefox. I went through the whole rigmarole of &lt;a href=&#34;https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/windows_build.html&#34;&gt;their instructions to set up my machine for the Windows build&lt;/a&gt;, and just the setup process, which involved setting up and checking out code took more than an hour. That was fine for initial setup, but actually building and running Firefox itself took an additional hour or so. Might have been more than that even, it was a while back so I don&amp;rsquo;t clearly remember, but I do remember thinking that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time for these hour-long build times. The whole set up also took up a nontrivial amount of my SSD disk space (imagine how much worse the build time would have been if I had used my non-SSD drive!), which I am always dangerously low on. These 2 factors led me to shelve the idea for the time being; perhaps I could revisit the idea of contributing to Firefox when I upgraded my computer or had more SSD space available. (TBF, I kind of gave up real quick after the first build, maybe the builds get faster on succeeding runs?). So that&amp;rsquo;s my personal &amp;ldquo;contributing-to-Firefox&amp;rdquo; story, for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer size of the codebase and the long build times just drive home the point of how much modern browsers are these large complex beasts that are doing so much. They are pretty much an OS of their own since they host a ton of features and web applications and JIT JS and all of that. This means it&amp;rsquo;s really difficult for independent browser efforts to hit feature parity with modern web browsers - even just working with JS and CSS standards, there are so many to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drew DeVault laments that &lt;a href=&#34;https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/13/Web-browsers-need-to-stop.html&#34;&gt;Web browsers need to stop&lt;/a&gt; with all these new functionalities and APIs that add scope and complexity, and maybe focus more on performance, efficiency, etc. I do agree - if I was contributing to Firefox, I would want to find a way to reduce the massive memory footprint it always has. I don&amp;rsquo;t even use that many tabs, and I already feel burdened by Firefox&amp;rsquo;s memory footprint. (Pretty sure Chrome is pretty bad in this regard as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why care about Mozilla/Firefox at all? Why not just use Chrome, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty good right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, no, Chrome is not necessarily &amp;ldquo;pretty good&amp;rdquo;, given how it props up a surveillance capitalsm engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, even if you didn&amp;rsquo;t dislike Google, having a browser (engine) monoculture is not a good thing. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/02/old-web/&#34;&gt;got my start in web development&lt;/a&gt; at around the height of Internet Explorer 6&amp;rsquo;s dominance, and I&amp;rsquo;d rather not find my way back there. Granted, one of the issues back then was that IE6 was a stagnant platform that upstarts Firefox and eventually Chrome left behind. No such problem exists now, since Chrome is still in active development and still pushing new web standards forward. And the fact that Chrome is an open-source platform means in theory someone could just fork it if ever Google goes off the rails or such. (And people have already built indie browsers on top of Chrome of course!) But it&amp;rsquo;s still dangerous for a single company and/or codebase to be the sole major implementer of web standards. A single company dictating the future of the web isn&amp;rsquo;t a good thing, and is the very opposite of the idea of an &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: Maybe I should try building Chromium too, just for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&amp;rsquo;s all my ranting for today. In conclusion: reduce your surveillance capitalism footprint and support the open web, use Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>In Which I Review Everything I Purchased from the iTunes App Store
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/itunes-purchases/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/itunes-purchases/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I was going through some old emails and found some receipts for things I had purchased from the iTunes App Store for my iPad, and I wondered how much have I actually spent on apps/games on the App Store? I went through all the receipts and decided to write mini-reviews for each item as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Purchase Date&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Price (USD)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Still Available on App Store?&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Notes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/10/30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Alien Blue HD - Reddit Client (Unofficial), v1.1.0, Developer: Morrissey Exchange Pty Ltd (17+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Wow, my first ever App Store purchase was a Reddit app! Appropriate since I reddit a lot. This app was much better than the official client available at the time. Eventually Reddit bought the app and phased it out in favor of a new, official Reddit client.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/11/24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Covers of Spider-Man, v1.0, Developer: Philipp Lenssen (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This was some lame app that just showed you a lot of Spider-Man covers. It was an accidental purchase and the only one I ever had refunded from the app store. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I said to the support: &amp;ldquo;Someone gave me a promo code for this application (Promo code: KAP3KXHM7HH3) and I was trying to figure out how to use it from the app store and accidentally bought the app. &amp;quot; (Noob!)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/11/27&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The Settlers HD, v1.0.4, Developer: Gameloft (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Wow, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember this one at all. One of those &amp;ldquo;eh, why not it&amp;rsquo;s cheap&amp;rdquo; purchases I guess?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/11/27&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Zombie Neighborhood for iPad, v1.0, Developer: Mo-Star Information Technology Co., Ltd. (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;As above&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/11/30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition, for iPad, v1.1, Developer: Lucasfilm International Services Inc. (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the LucasArts adventure games, so I was willing to pay for the chance to play these classics on the go. As is typical of me, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever got around to it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/11/30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Monkey Island 2 Special Edition: LeChuck&amp;rsquo;s Revenge for iPad, v1.1, Developer: Lucasfilm International Services Inc. (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;As above.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/12/18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Instapaper, v2.3.2, Developer: Marco Arment (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still using this app occasionally. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty nice, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really fit into my flow, since I tend to just read things immediately instead of setting them aside for later. That being said, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I have a bunch of still unread stuff saved here.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/12/18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SCRABBLE for iPad, v1.1.55, Developer: ElectronicArtsBV (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The Scrabble app situation is always a mess since the rights to Scrabble are complicated internationally. I grew up with Scrabble, but these days I just play Words with Friends.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/12/18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Enigmo 2, v2.2, Developer: Pangea Software, Inc. (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I think this was some kind of physics sandbox puzzle game, sorta like Incredible Machine? I can still download it, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get back into it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/12/18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Heroes 2 HD!, v1.2, Developer: Pavel X (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lol this was some port of the original PC Heroes 2, I suspect wholly unlicensed so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t surprising that it got kicked off the store.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/12/23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Words With Friends HD, v3.14, Developer: newtoy, inc. (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The original version of the app is no longer available; I believe I paid to get rid of ads. I have version 2 now, which I still play regularly, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have a record of paying for it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/12/25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Battle for Wesnoth HD, v1.5, Developer: Kyle Poole (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I was looking for some tactical battle game to play on the go, and this seemed promising, but I never got into it. It&amp;rsquo;s still available on the App Store, but might be a different SKU, as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t recognize my previous purchase.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2010/12/27&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;iCab Mobile (Web Browser), v4.2.1, Developer: Alexander Clauss (17+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I believe I got this at the time because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use Safari, and it had a download feature that other browsers didn&amp;rsquo;t have? It&amp;rsquo;s still available, but there&amp;rsquo;s Firefox on iOS now so that&amp;rsquo;s what I use.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/02/02&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Penultimate, v2.2, Developer: Cocoa Box Design LLC (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The first of several note-taking apps I had purchased in hopes I could be a productive note taker. It was not to be. This was pretty neat though. It&amp;rsquo;s linked to EverNoteso if you use that this might be good.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/02/07&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SketchBook Pro, v1.3.1, Developer: Autodesk (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;There is a free Autodesk Sketchbook app still available on the store, can&amp;rsquo;t find the pro version anymore. I tried this for a bit, but had trouble with the learning curve. I eventually settled on using the Procreate app for my sketching instead; it&amp;rsquo;s really good and IDK if it&amp;rsquo;s free, but there&amp;rsquo;s no record of me ever paying for it. It&amp;rsquo;s too good to be free! Here are &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/procreate&#34;&gt;some of my sketches using Procreate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/02/11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;STREET FIGHTER IV, v1.00.06, Developer: CAPCOM Co., Ltd (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for Street Fighter things so I tried this out. Don&amp;rsquo;t remember much about it though.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/02/11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;World of Goo HD, v1.2, Developer: 2D BOY (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Kinda boring for me, but my niece liked playing around with it while she was growing up, so that&amp;rsquo;s something.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/02/21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tilt to Live HD, Full Version 2.0, Developer: One Man Left&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Probably my all-time favorite iOS game, well worth the purchase. It&amp;rsquo;s simple and easy to play, but hard to master, and you can play it in short bursts easily at any time. You can hand the game to someone with minimal explanation and they&amp;rsquo;ll grok the game quickly.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/02/26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Battleheart, v1.0.5, Developer: Kelli Bordner&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Maybe my second-favorite iOS game, I played this a bunch. Basically it&amp;rsquo;s party battles where you click and use abilities etc.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/05/08&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Notes Plus - Handwriting, Note Taking, Shape Drawing, and Sound Recording, v2.3, Developer: Viet Tran (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Another note-taking app! I think I liked this one best, as I had a bunch of notes in it, but it looks they made some sort of breaking format change in 2019 and now my older notebooks can&amp;rsquo;t be viewed as notebooks in the app? Maybe I can figure it out later. I remember it had some neat features like handwriting recognition so it can automatically convert your handwriting to text? Not sure how well that worked with my chicken-scratch handwriting though.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/05/19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Infinity Blade, v1.3, Developer: Chair Entertainment Group (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This was a big deal when it came out, as it was one of the first iOS games with true 3d rendering. I think I only played it a little bit.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/06/30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;STREET FIGHTER IV Volt, v1.00.00, Developer: CAPCOM Co., Ltd (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t remember much, purchased because Street Fighter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/07/30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;X-Men, v1.0.2, Developer: Konami Digital Entertainment (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I believe this was a port of the old-school X-Men arcade game. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I played this version much.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/08/26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Aralon: Sword and Shadow HD, v3.12, Developer: Crescent Moon Games LLC (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;For a while I was hoping to find a good RPG to play on the go, but never really found the time to get into any of the ones I tried.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/08/28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rimelands: Hammer of Thor, v1.31, Developer: Crescent Moon Games LLC (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;As above&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/10/13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Avadon: The Black Fortress HD, vv1.0.2, Developer: Spiderweb Software (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;As above. I was a fan of the SpiderWeb games back in the day, but haven&amp;rsquo;t really managed to play any of their newer games to a finish. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ve outgrown them?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/10/13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dungeon Hunter 2 HD, v1.0.0, Developer: Gameloft S.A. (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t remember playing this at all.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/10/29&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sid Meier&amp;rsquo;s Pirates! for iPad, v1.0.4, Developer: 2K Games (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I played the PC version of this a bunch, the iPad version not so much I think.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/12/21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Civilization Revolution for iPad, v2.2.8 (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Big fan of the Civ series, and getting this version was cheaper than the alternative which was on NDS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2011/12/29&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Puzzle Quest 2, v1.2.0 (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This was a match-3 type puzzle game with a thin veneer of fantasy role-playing flavor on top of it. I played this a bunch.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2012/01/07&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;MONOPOLY for iPad, v1.0.6 (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I think I only got this because a friend wanted to try playing remotely. However, Monopoly is a terrible board game.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2012/01/21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Comic Zeal Comic Reader, v5.0.36 (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Second most expensive purchase here, but one I&amp;rsquo;m still using up to now! I used to use some free open-source comic reader app whose name I can&amp;rsquo;t remember now, but I liked Comic Zeal because it had support for uploading files via web browser&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2012/02/04&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Notability, v4.1 (4+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yet another note-taking app. Maybe someday when I actually get into a decent habit of note taking I&amp;rsquo;ll actually review them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2012/08/05&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Another World - 20th Anniversary, v1.2 (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I played the original on PC back in the day. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I finished this version.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2012/12/26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;STREET FIGHTER X TEKKEN MOBILE　, v1.01.00 (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yet another &amp;ldquo;purchased because Street Fighter&amp;rdquo;. The Vita version has served me better.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2013/01/02&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Scribblenauts Remix, v2.6 (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Can be fun, but gets boring after a bit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2013/01/11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate: Enhanced Edition, v1.0.2007 (12+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The most expensive purchase on this list! I haven&amp;rsquo;t finished this version though.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2013/01/14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer, Return of the Fallen expansion&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ascension was one of the original deckbuilding games, so I wanted to try it. I played the iOS version a fair amount, since I had some other friends playing it too. Enough to justify purchasing a couple of expansions.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2013/01/14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer, Storm of Souls expansion&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;As above&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2013/01/18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer, Promo Pack 1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;As above&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2013/05/28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rebirth of Fortune 2, v1.02 (9+)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yet another &amp;ldquo;hoping I could play RPGs on the go&amp;rdquo; purchase. Don&amp;rsquo;t remember it at all.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I first got an iPad in 2010, and still use one (not the same one) up to this day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all prices are in USD because these purchases were made on the US app store; I believe there was yet no PH app store at that time. All checking of whether they are still available however, is done on the PH app store, since that&amp;rsquo;s where my Apple ID is currently linked. So maybe that causes some inaccuracy somewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;total amount spent over 3 years: $89.59. Which is not too bad, considering that&amp;rsquo;s roughly one and a half brand new PS4 games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;majority of the purchases (31 out of 41) are games. A lot of these games were &amp;ldquo;impulse purchases&amp;rdquo; too, unsurprising since most mobile apps are priced so low. The tradeoff for this low price is the high risk of the games going unmaintained and getting delisted. My roots as a PC/console gamer work against me, as I am apparently less inclined to play through RPGs and such on a tablet. These days I really only play free multiplayer games like Words with Friends on the iPad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;22 out of my 41 purchases are no longer available on the App Store as of today. This is one of the reasons I stopped paying for App Store things altogether: the pace of development for mobile OSes is very quick and backwards compatibility is not a priority, so apps and games can easily be out of date or no longer compatible with newer versions of the OS. For apps/games with low prices/profit margins, it&amp;rsquo;s simply not worth it to keep updating these apps/games every time, so they simply delist them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have any purchases on the Google Play store, mostly because I don&amp;rsquo;t like gaming on the phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Using Hugo to Automatically Update Your Github Profile
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/hugo-update-github-profile/</link>
            <pubDate>Sat, 11 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/hugo-update-github-profile/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;So recently Github secretly rolled out a new feature where you can create a file named &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; in a repo named &lt;code&gt;github.com/&amp;lt;your github username&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;your github username&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and that markdown file would be rendered on your Github profile page. It means, you can now put basically anything you want on your Github profile!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just read this &lt;a href=&#34;https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/10/self-updating-profile-readme/&#34;&gt;post from Simon Willson&lt;/a&gt; about using this new feature + Github actions and a Python script to automatically generate and update his Github profile. That seemed neat so I thought about how I would do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blog is already setup to publish using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://travis-ci.org/&#34;&gt;Travis-CI&lt;/a&gt; whenever I push a commit, so I figured I could just ride on that framework. You can already see this in action on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/roytang&#34;&gt;my Github profile page&lt;/a&gt;! Basically, I publish the &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; using my regular Hugo build, then my Travis script will deploy it to the appropriate repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re new to Hugo, the trickiest part of this might be using a custom output format to generate the README.md. This is basically just a bunch of settings in your Hugo config file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define a new Markdown media type under &lt;code&gt;mediaTypes&lt;/code&gt; in your config file. For a TOML config file, that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-toml&#34; data-lang=&#34;toml&#34;&gt;    [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;mediaTypes&lt;/span&gt;]
        [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;mediaTypes&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;text/markdown&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;]
            &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;suffixes&lt;/span&gt; = [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;md&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define a &amp;ldquo;readme&amp;rdquo; output format (or whatever you want to name it) under &lt;code&gt;outputFormats&lt;/code&gt; in your config file. For a TOML config file, that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-toml&#34; data-lang=&#34;toml&#34;&gt;[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;outputFormats&lt;/span&gt;]
  [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;outputFormats&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;readme&lt;/span&gt;]
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;baseName&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;README&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;mediaType&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;text/markdown&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;baseName&lt;/code&gt; here controls the output file name, while the extension is controlled by the suffixes in step 1. The &lt;code&gt;mediaType&lt;/code&gt; you use here should match the one in step&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next is to specify which pages should have this custom output format. I used my home page for this, so under &lt;code&gt;outputs&lt;/code&gt; in the config file I added the name of the output format (&amp;ldquo;readme&amp;rdquo;) in my case under &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-toml&#34; data-lang=&#34;toml&#34;&gt;[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;outputs&lt;/span&gt;]
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;home&lt;/span&gt; = [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;HTML&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;RSS&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;jsonfeed&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;hfeed&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;readme&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last step, in your theme or your layouts folder, create a file named &lt;code&gt;index.README.md&lt;/code&gt;. This will be the template used to generate the README file. Remember that this is a template to generate markdown. You can use all the normal Hugo template functions, but your output should be markdown. Here&amp;rsquo;s part of what I put in my template, which generates a list of my most recent blog posts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go-html-template&#34; data-lang=&#34;go-html-template&#34;&gt;Latest blog posts:
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;$pages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;.RegularPages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Type&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;post&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;$pages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
- [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;.Title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;](&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;.Permalink&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;

[View all posts](&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;.Permalink&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;blog)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not yet too familiar with Hugo templates, you can maybe just use the above example directly first to see what it outputs. (You might need to replace &lt;code&gt;post&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;posts&lt;/code&gt; or whatever your main post type is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have these setup, just run your usual hugo build and check the output folder to see if the README.md file was generated correctly. It should be in the root of the output folder, same place as the &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; for your home page. One problem I encountered with Hugo is that it insists on lowercasing all the output files, so the output file in my case is always &lt;code&gt;readme.md&lt;/code&gt; and not &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt;. I just solved this by renaming it during the Travis build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t discuss the travis deployment process anymore here; if you&amp;rsquo;ve done CI with Travis and Github integration before, it&amp;rsquo;s relatively straightforward to add a step to copy the readme file from the Hugo build output to the appropriate repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After setting this up, my Github profile page now automatically updates with my latest blog posts/notes/shared links! (I didn&amp;rsquo;t include photos to keep things simple). The update happens every time my site itself gets a new build, so that&amp;rsquo;s pretty neat. I&amp;rsquo;ve attached an image of the new Github profile page for reference!&lt;/p&gt;

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/scraping-facebook/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I had been meaning to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/quitting-facebook/&#34;&gt;quit Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for more than a year maybe, but I kept putting it off. The main reason being that I like having backups of my own digital data (still very much a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2007/12/pack-rat-mentality/&#34;&gt;pack rat&lt;/a&gt;), and Facebook&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/03/export-your-social-media-data/&#34;&gt;social media export&lt;/a&gt; is less than ideal, for me at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than ideal why? It doesn&amp;rsquo;t include a lot of content I would like backed up, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;comments on my posts (there have been some good conversations with friends over the years I would prefer to preserve)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;things I&amp;rsquo;ve reposted from other people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;content of certain groups I&amp;rsquo;m members of (again, mostly for some interesting discussions over the years)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pictures posted by other people that I&amp;rsquo;ve been tagged in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while I looked around for scraper programs/scripts to this for me, but none really did what I wanted. Early this month I finally wrote my own scraper scripts to pull that data out of Facebook, as a supplement to the actual FB export. It seems unlikely that these will be helpful to anyone else, especially since web scraping is an inherently brittle activity; any slight change in the FB HTML generation will break the scripts. In spite of that, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share them publicly anyway, via Github gists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/roytang/a5b4a8e4d511e97b9d25cb190f9dfb5d&#34;&gt;Script to export FB timeline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/roytang/1cb3a682a2c223e569e3009aceb0e319&#34;&gt;Script to export FB group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are basically the same file, with minor changes between configuration and some scraping details. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting to need these scripts again in the future so I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother with any kind of reusability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other notes about these scripts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;made with Python! Using my favorite HTML parsing library, BeautifulSoup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the scripts run against the mobile web version m.facebook.com. The main web version is troublesome because it executes JS to do its infinite scroll and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to waste time reverse engineering that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are some variables near the start that you should probably set. Most of it is output folders and group details, but the main one is the FB login cookie - basically you need to login to FB, then use dev tools or whatever to copy your cookie string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the main output file is a gigantic JSON. There is no specified schema, basically I made things up as I went along. I&amp;rsquo;ll figure out how to process this at a later date lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a secondary output, there is also a cache folder that should contain the raw HTML parsed for each page. These aren&amp;rsquo;t necessary to retain, as all the information they have should also be in the JSON. Images from posts are also downloaded into a &lt;code&gt;dls&lt;/code&gt; folder. (The JSON will include the download path for the images from each post.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;running the timeline export on my machine took the better part of 2-3 hours, for roughly 13 years worth of FB content. The output JSON was around 22 MB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;running this might be considered spammy behavior by Facebook (understandably, but it&amp;rsquo;s their fault they won&amp;rsquo;t me do this via API), but the only consequence I&amp;rsquo;ve seen was that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to view other people&amp;rsquo;s profiles for some minutes after running the script&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for what I&amp;rsquo;m going to do with this data, that&amp;rsquo;s still to be determined. The nonpublic content can be imported into the archive on this blog (if it isn&amp;rsquo;t there yet), but that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of manual work. As for the scripts, hopefully I won&amp;rsquo;t have to use them again in the future, but maybe they can be useful to someone else!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Why Twitter?
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 02 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Alright so someone responded to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/quitting-facebook/&#34;&gt;my previous post on quitting facebook&lt;/a&gt; asking why I&amp;rsquo;m quitting facebook but keeping Twitter. This is a fair question; after all, Twitter also makes its money off targetted advertising, can also get you addicted to engagement (likes/RTs), the Twitter app can also be dumb, and there can also be a lot of toxic people on this platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are my reasons for keeping Twitter, and you may also get some tips for improving your twitter experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;twitter-allows-you-to-completely-disable-targetted-advertising&#34;&gt;Twitter allows you to completely disable targetted advertising:&lt;/h3&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#c91c00253ad1ae9b056d9bfae5126930-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/IMG_0841_hufd3da52f36486a42feb03bb7adb0c498_332696_300x0_resize_box_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;c91c00253ad1ae9b056d9bfae5126930-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/IMG_0841.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;2 Jun 2020 12:00am&#34;&gt;2 Jun 2020 12:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these settings disabled, they don&amp;rsquo;t expose any of your data to advertisers, and they don&amp;rsquo;t track you offsite. Twitter also by its design gathers less specific personal information about you. They don&amp;rsquo;t have fields to store your educational background or religious preference or other such demographics. Such things can be inferred from your activity though, but if I don&amp;rsquo;t enable targetted advertising, they really have no reason to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;twitter-provides-more-fine-tuned-controls-for-you-to-filter-who-can-interact-with-you&#34;&gt;Twitter provides more fine-tuned controls for you to filter who can interact with you.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can disable notifications from low-quality accounts:&lt;/p&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#07cf616a69da0b3bf903d9ad4dfbf378-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/IMG_0842_hua2344dafbc09a3b3f08ab49369d6511f_150532_300x0_resize_box_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;07cf616a69da0b3bf903d9ad4dfbf378-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/IMG_0842.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;2 Jun 2020 12:00am&#34;&gt;2 Jun 2020 12:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helps to filter out trolls and newly-created accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also mute particular keywords to avoid seeing topics you dislike:&lt;/p&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#c23e7fe814d897f4f20dcfbe1b1c6840-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/IMG_0843_hu3cb436bee07e5a0942209acde8a06545_145657_300x0_resize_box_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;c23e7fe814d897f4f20dcfbe1b1c6840-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/IMG_0843.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;2 Jun 2020 12:00am&#34;&gt;2 Jun 2020 12:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The ff7 one is there because I haven&amp;rsquo;t played the remake yet and don&amp;rsquo;t want spoilers lol.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;suggest_activity_tweet&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;suggest_recycled_tweet_inline&amp;rdquo; are hacks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/9gxxaq/lpt_twitter_mute_suggest_activity_tweet_and/&#34;&gt;prevent &amp;lsquo;liked by&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;followed by&amp;rsquo; tweets from appearing on your home timeline&lt;/a&gt;. (IMHO you should never be on your home timeline anyway and always on &amp;ldquo;Latest Tweets&amp;rdquo;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can also make your account completely private (only followers can interact with you), but that&amp;rsquo;s not for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tweetdeck-exists&#34;&gt;Tweetdeck exists&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default Twitter app sucks for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it occasionally shifts you back to &amp;ldquo;Home&amp;rdquo; when &amp;ldquo;Latest Tweets&amp;rdquo; i.e. chronological timeline is far superior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it shows you ads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lists, one of Twitters best features, aren&amp;rsquo;t first-class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter is a lot more tolerable if your main use of it is through the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/&#34;&gt;Tweetdeck site&lt;/a&gt;. Tweetdeck lets you arrange your interface into columns, which means you can make lists front and center. Here&amp;rsquo;s a sample of my Tweetdeck setup:&lt;/p&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#427089e48245315f5fbde69259ca403f-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/tweetdeck_hub6bbe349cf5268ed82f4dae746d7a278_932018_300x0_resize_box_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;427089e48245315f5fbde69259ca403f-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/tweetdeck.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;2 Jun 2020 12:00am&#34;&gt;2 Jun 2020 12:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part of Tweetdeck is that it never shows ads, and everything is always chronological!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;twitter-is-slightly-harder-to-use-than-facebook-and-doesnt-benefit-from-free-data-policies-in-the-philippines&#34;&gt;Twitter is slightly harder to use than Facebook and doesn&amp;rsquo;t benefit from free data policies in the Philippines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, this is gonna be a bit elitist, but these &amp;ldquo;disadvantages&amp;rdquo; mean using Twitter has a higher barrier of entry than Facebook, which in theory means a higher quality of discourse. I have no data or analytics to back up this assertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;twitter-has-an-open-api&#34;&gt;Twitter has an open API.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is a more technical reason. Having an open API allows me to cross-post from my site to Twitter every time I write a blog post, and also archive all my tweets from that platform back into my own site. FB API used to be a lot more open as well, but as they continued to flub their personal data management, their API got more and more closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open API also means services like &lt;a href=&#34;http://rssbridge.chamallow.com/&#34;&gt;RSS Bridge&lt;/a&gt; can exist, allowing Twitter feeds to be followed via open formats like RSS/Atom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;twitter-moderation-is-less-evil-than-facebook-moderation&#34;&gt;Twitter moderation is less evil than Facebook moderation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of them are actually fairly terrible and inconsistent (surely a consequence of operating at that scale without corresponding scaling up of moderation efforts), but at least Twitter is not afraid to at least fact-check Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;twitter-has-better-public-content&#34;&gt;Twitter has better public content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, this one might be totally subjective or anecdotal based on my own Twitter follows and setup, but I find that public discourse is generally better on Twitter compared to Facebook. It might be due to some of the factors above, and maybe some level of luck/privilege/good filtering on my part. I mean, you can find bad actors and low-quality discussions if you go looking for them, but why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not saying Twitter is perfect. There is certainly a lot of room for improvement, especially technically. But compared to Facebook, I think Twitter is much less of a garbage fire maybe because (a) I don&amp;rsquo;t feel constrained to follow mainly family and friends; Twitter feels more like it can be a window to part of the larger world; and (b) the existence of Tweetdeck and better filtering tools means I don&amp;rsquo;t have to suffer through ads or other such inanity every few posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: It seems a bit weird to be publishing this right now when the world seems to be on fire. I follow a lot of Americans so a lot of the racism and police brutality-inspired chaos dominates my Twitter timelines at the moment (as can be seen in the Tweetdeck screenshot above). But I think this is also a good illustration of how useful Twitter&amp;rsquo;s filters and options are. If you chose to, (or needed to temporarily, for your sanity maybe?) you can probably block out these events from your timeline completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is certainly a lot of room for improvement especially from the technical side; &lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.technology&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; comes to mind as a superior platform in this regard, but that platform doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the scale of Twitter yet, which limits the interesting interactions that can come up. I find a lot of smart and interesting interactions still happen on Twitter, so it&amp;rsquo;s not yet something I&amp;rsquo;m willing to give up.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Quitting Facebook
</title>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This will be cross-posted to my Facebook account.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been long overdue, but I&amp;rsquo;m quitting Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not you, but it&amp;rsquo;s not me either. It&amp;rsquo;s Facebook. There&amp;rsquo;s a ton of reasons for quitting Facebook, but here are some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook is dumb. The site is barely usable and the app is a big battery hog. And posts don&amp;rsquo;t even support formatting so now you&amp;rsquo;re getting this one in Markdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook uses your personal information to earn money, and they&amp;rsquo;re &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal&#34;&gt;not even very good at keeping that information safe&lt;/a&gt;. Their tech tracks you all over the internet, even when you aren&amp;rsquo;t logged in to FB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook is evil:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CEO Zuckerberg thinks their users are &lt;a href=&#34;https://gawker.com/5636765/facebook-ceo-admits-to-calling-users-dumb-fucks&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;dumb fucks&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook is divisive. They &lt;a href=&#34;https://geeknewscentral.com/2020/05/26/facebook-executives-dismissed-efforts-to-make-the-site-less-divisive/&#34;&gt;know it and choose to do nothing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-for-the-first-time-acknowledges-election-manipulation/&#34;&gt;used for election manipulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CEO Zuckerberg &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/28/zuckerberg-facebook-police-online-speech-trump&#34;&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t think they need to police fake news and harmful speech by politicians&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook is a breeding ground for paid trolls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook teaches us bad habits like responding to trolls and gets us addicted to likes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had initially planned to just stop using Facebook and keep my account data there indefinitely, in the interest of reducing link rot on the web. But as long as it stays up, there&amp;rsquo;s always the temptation to use it, and it still supports Facebook&amp;rsquo;s surveillance capitalism machine, even a little. So it&amp;rsquo;s time to cut the cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-can-i-keep-in-touch-or-know-what-youre-up-to&#34;&gt;How can I keep in touch or know what you&amp;rsquo;re up to?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still actively post on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/&#34;&gt;own website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/page/about/elsewhere/&#34;&gt;other services&lt;/a&gt; and have an actively &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/page/about/contact/&#34;&gt;maintained contact page&lt;/a&gt;. Every email address I&amp;rsquo;ve had since 2003 is still being checked regularly. If you have my phone number (ends in 09) I&amp;rsquo;m on Viber and Signal. I&amp;rsquo;m very easy to reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-about-messenger-and-instagram&#34;&gt;What about Messenger and Instagram?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m keeping Messenger around for a bit, maybe until the whole quarantine situation blows over or until I can convince the people who still communicate with me there to move to a different service. Yes, you can keep using Messenger even if you deactivate your FB account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to do with Instagram yet. I should probably quit it too, it&amp;rsquo;s not really important, but one thing at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;should-i-also-quit-facebook&#34;&gt;Should I also quit Facebook?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you what to do. Do you even really derive any meaningful benefit from this site that you can&amp;rsquo;t get elsewhere? Enough to justify continuing to support and feed their network? That&amp;rsquo;s for you to decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, yes you should quit Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;but-if-i-quit-how-can-i-keep-in-touch-with-my-friends&#34;&gt;But if I quit how can I keep in touch with my friends?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start a group text. Or an email chain. Or a discord server. Or a Viber/Signal/Skype group. There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of alternatives, I&amp;rsquo;m sure I missed a lot. Pick one and go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend: Whatsapp (owned by FB), WeChat (Chinese spyware), Messenger (hypocrisy!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;but-what-if-i-want-to-share-my-thoughts-to-the-world&#34;&gt;But what if I want to share my thoughts to the world?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, alternatives: Twitter, Mastodon, Wordpress.com, Tumblr, Reddit, micro.blog, Blogger, etc. Even LiveJournal is still around! All of them free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend: Medium (ew!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;but-if-people-use-so-many-different-websites-and-services-it-becomes-hard-to-follow-them-all&#34;&gt;But if people use so many different websites and services it becomes hard to follow them all!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use a feed reader service like InoReader or Feedly to follow most such services. Another reason Facebook sucks is that they&amp;rsquo;re a black hole that doesn&amp;rsquo;t contribute back to the open web: you can&amp;rsquo;t easily follow someone on Facebook from outside Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;but-i-need-facebook-for-workto-promote-my-brandbusinessside-hustle&#34;&gt;But I need Facebook for work/to promote my brand/business/side hustle!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you really? There may be alternatives you haven&amp;rsquo;t considered. A lot of small business can just as easily spread through word of mouth etc. But I&amp;rsquo;m not an entrepreneur (and don&amp;rsquo;t care to be), so IDK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If yes, sad. If you like, you can just create a new account with no personal information, don&amp;rsquo;t add your friends, create a page for your business things, don&amp;rsquo;t post anything personal ever and only use it for work/business things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;but-how-will-i-know-when-peoples-birthdays-are&#34;&gt;But how will I know when people&amp;rsquo;s birthdays are?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just don&amp;rsquo;t greet anybody, I&amp;rsquo;m sure it will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;all-of-that-seems-too-complicated-maybe-ill-just-stick-with-facebook&#34;&gt;All of that seems too complicated, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll just stick with Facebook.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s fine. Do whatever you like. I&amp;rsquo;m not your mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-what-now&#34;&gt;So what now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan is to leave this account and this post up for maybe until the end of June. After that I&amp;rsquo;m deactivating the Facebook account. Then at some point afterwards, I&amp;rsquo;ll delete the account (probably when I no longer need Messenger.)&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Migrating away from GMail
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/gmail-migration/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/gmail-migration/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve basically been using GMail as my main email account since I first got access in 2006ish. &amp;ldquo;Main email account&amp;rdquo; means I use it as the primary access point for all my other online accounts. GMail was certainly revolutionary when it came out, and had a lot of benefits: it was fast, easily searchable and had a lot of free storage. But in the modern day, there are significant disadvantages to using GMail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you don&amp;rsquo;t control your account; it&amp;rsquo;s rare, but anecdotally people have lost access to their GMail accounts for some perceived infraction, and when that happens you have no way of recovery or appeal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you&amp;rsquo;re fueling a surveillance capitalism machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it can &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/1263160405737607170/&#34;&gt;look unprofessional&lt;/a&gt; to be using free email, especially for official or business correspondence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first bullet point is the biggie for me. One such story came across the Hacker News front page a while back and I can only imagine the nightmare it would be for me to lose access to my Google account. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve started a conscious effort to slowly but surely decouple myself from my dependencies on Google Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That meant migrating my online accounts to use another email, primarily one I control. I already had this domain &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net&#34;&gt;roytang.net&lt;/a&gt;, so there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to not use emails with that domain. The only risk to using an email on your own domain is that if you forgot to renew your domain, or otherwise lose control, you are screwed. So&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t let that happen I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only question was what email service provider to use? I&amp;rsquo;m still on Webfaction hosting, and they do provide email accounts, but I&amp;rsquo;m planning to move away from them before the end of the year &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/03/rip-webfaction/&#34;&gt;due to the GoDaddy purchase&lt;/a&gt;, so probably best not to be reliant on their email service. If I wanted more control over the risks, I could of course run my own mail servers, but I&amp;rsquo;m not ready to go that far yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one I tried was &lt;a href=&#34;https://protonmail.com/&#34;&gt;ProtonMail&lt;/a&gt; because yay, end-to-end encryption! I used it for a couple of months first before paying for anything (using a custom domain email requires a paid plan). Unfortunately, I felt like the additional security wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth the trouble of not being super portable. Accessing via mobile required their app, can&amp;rsquo;t use any generic email client. I also wanted to be able to access via a desktop client like Thunderbird or Mail on the Macbook Air, but that required some sort of SMTP bridge, and it seemed like a bother. Every time I set up a new machine I&amp;rsquo;d need it? I&amp;rsquo;m not super security-conscious, so I decided to keep the protonmail account as a secondary account, in case I did come to a situation where e2e encryption was absolutely critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I next tried &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.migadu.com&#34;&gt;migadu.com&lt;/a&gt; as an email provider, based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://cmpwn.com/@sir/102452352875414214&#34;&gt;this recommendation thread&lt;/a&gt; by Drew Devault over on Mastodon. Their web settings aren&amp;rsquo;t super refined, but everything was relatively easy to setup. And their free tier includes support for custom domains and multiple mailboxes per domain, so that&amp;rsquo;s a big plus. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using them now for a few months and am generally happy with the service. (They did have a short bout of server access issues around the time the covid19 thing started getting around, but they resolved it pretty quickly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After choosing an email service provider, the next step was setting up emails and shifting over all my online accounts. Migadu&amp;rsquo;s support for unlimited mailboxes meant I could have separate email addresses for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contact email for other online accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publicly accessible contact email on the website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;private email for communication with friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up updating over 50 online accounts to point to the new domain email. Not all in one go, as that&amp;rsquo;s terribly boring, but a few at a time over the course of the last few months. That covers social media services, gaming services, financial services, dev tools, and so on. The upside of all this effort is I got to do a kind of audit of all my online accounts, which ones could be deleted/deactivated, which ones needed new passwords, which ones have poor security measures, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, I only need to do this once. An advantage to using custom domain emails is that if you&amp;rsquo;re unhappy with your underlying email provider, you can switch to a different one while retaining the same email addresses, no need to update emails in all your other online accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I had no intention of using webmail anymore, so I ended up installing Thunderbird (it&amp;rsquo;s been a while old friend) for accessing these accounts, and also set up the Mail app on the Macbook Air. For the phone, I installed K-9 mail, although I&amp;rsquo;m having an issue with that currently where it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be doing background syncing of mails. Not a super critical issue, as I mostly don&amp;rsquo;t want to be pinged real-time by email anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still keeping the GMail account of course, a lot of people still know me by that email address, but now I have a largely reduced footprint and dependency on it. And as mentioned, I&amp;rsquo;m also keeping the ProtonMail account for any security-conscious communications. So I ended up having to manage a lot more email addresses, but hopefully everything will be a bit more organized, with every account having a specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A while back I got an export of my Foursquare/Swarm data. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, these were a pair of apps that were used for &amp;ldquo;checking-in&amp;rdquo; to particular locations, with a sort of gamification system where if you checked in at a place often enough, you would earn points and eventually become &amp;ldquo;Mayor&amp;rdquo; of the venue. The idea being that owners of those venues might give some benefits to those who check-in often at those locations (AFAIK, this never really caught on in the Philippines). I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a super active user of Foursquare/Swarm, I had maybe 500ish check-ins from 2010-2017 when I stopped using it. Some people are still using it up to now and have thousands of check-ins, although as far as I can tell it&amp;rsquo;s no longer very popular in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I thought having this data would be handy so I put it up as location data on this site. It also gave me an excuse to figure out how to render OpenStreetMap. (The location pages are one of the few pages that have JavaScript on this site.) The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/locations/&#34;&gt;locations page&lt;/a&gt; shows a map of all the visited locations and a listing of the locations grouped by country, and for the Philippines, by city (where available). You can click through to individual locations to see how often I&amp;rsquo;ve checked in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, one of the venues with the most number of check-ins for me is &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/locations/4d27f36c8292236a41e814bb/&#34;&gt;BBQ Chicken&lt;/a&gt;, a now-closed Korean-themed BBQ chicken place in Ortigas near where I used to work. Another one with a lot of check-ins would be &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/locations/4bbbfea5ed7776b032413f51/&#34;&gt;Murphy&amp;rsquo;s in Makati&lt;/a&gt; where we did a lot of quiz nights from 2011-2013. Obviously, the location data isn&amp;rsquo;t complete and doesn&amp;rsquo;t capture all my visits, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t use Foursquare/Swarm that religiously anyway. I&amp;rsquo;m certain I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten at BBQ Chicken more than the 18 times I checked in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-about-privacy&#34;&gt;What about privacy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually telling the internet where you are all the time might seem a bit anathema to the more privacy-conscious modern world, but I do like having a history of where I&amp;rsquo;ve been. I even have location tracking enabled on my phone via Google Maps so that I can have a timeline of where I am on a day-by-day basis. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it more than once to answer queries like &amp;ldquo;do you know if we went to &lt;place&gt; in &lt;month&gt; of last year?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;When did you last go to &lt;store&gt; ?&amp;rdquo; Obviously it&amp;rsquo;s not for everyone and I fully understand the privacy ramifications of Google having all my location data and feeding the mightly global surveillance capitalism machine, but for me right now it&amp;rsquo;s an acceptable tradeoff. As for the foursquare data, I was using foursquare back when I was less privacy-conscious that I am now, so I my attitude is like, that particular dataset has been out in the world for years, I can&amp;rsquo;t put the toothpaste back in the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I did scrub some old check-ins from this data (and the corresponding data on Swarm and on Twitter if it was cross-posted)) that was a bit too close to home. I know this data potentially allows bad guys or assassins or whatnot to figure out where I live, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d at least make it a tiny bit more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-now&#34;&gt;What now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a neat little thing that probably only I will care about, as it lets me see some of the places I&amp;rsquo;ve been to. And I probably won&amp;rsquo;t be using 4sq/Swarm again, so the dataset probably won&amp;rsquo;t be growing. That being said, I do want to add some future features like grouping the check-ins according to trips, so I can see all the particular places where I went to on particular trips. Many of my trips are missing data though; for example, my only check-in in France was in the airport, and not at any of the touristy places we went to. I may try to supplement this data with selected extracts from my Google Maps location history (hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s easy to figure out!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also don&amp;rsquo;t know where to put the locations page in the menus lol. I&amp;rsquo;ll figure it out sooner or later!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>HyperX Cloud II Gaming Headset
</title>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I ordered this HyperX Cloud II Gaming Headset off Lazada on the first day of MECQ. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit expensive. Delivery came in Saturday morning, so around a week, not too bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m actually not super-picky when it comes to audio issues, but lately the 3.5mm audio jack on my Razer keyboard has been giving off static. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t move my speaker connectors to the back of the desktop tower case because I often switch them out for earphones (when I&amp;rsquo;m doing voice chat or &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/twitch/&#34;&gt;streaming on Twitch&lt;/a&gt; for example), and it&amp;rsquo;s inconvenient to do so when they&amp;rsquo;re so far in the back, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to buy a headset that can be plugged into a USB slot instead. That way, I can switch output sources via Windows 10&amp;rsquo;s built-in software controls. (You can switch output devices by clicking the speaker icon on the Windows 10 taskbar and clicking the ^ icon near the output device name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided I might as well get a fancy headset, this will be the most expensive one I&amp;rsquo;ve ever bought. On the upside, I get a better (in theory) mic for recordings and voice chats (I was previously using the mic off a cheap webcam), and I can use it on the PS4 as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tried it out a bit, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty nifty. But sometimes the mic attachment seems to fall off too easily. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll make a proper review once I&amp;rsquo;ve used it for while, although IDK if I&amp;rsquo;m not enough of an audiophile for any review to be meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/02/thoughts-on-blogging-2020-edition/&#34;&gt;Previously&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/weeknotes-2020-05-17/&#34;&gt;most recent weeknotes&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned this &lt;a href=&#34;http://tttthis.com/blog/if-i-could-bring-one-thing-back-to-the-internet-it-would-be-blogs&#34;&gt;post about bringing blogs back to the internet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23205588&#34;&gt;ensuing discussion on Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some further thoughts on blogging based on the HN discussion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-traffic-and-engagement&#34;&gt;On Traffic and Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone mentioned that one of the reasons most people stop blogging is that it feels like there&amp;rsquo;s nobody reading their work. This reminds me of a convo I had with a friend a couple of years back when he saw one of my blog posts. He was getting into content creation himself via a Youtube channel and he asked me what kind of traffic or how many visitors I see on my blog, and I was like &amp;ldquo;You know what, I have no idea!&amp;rdquo; because I never really got into that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to have Google Analytics on the site back when I first migrated to Hugo, because the initial theme I used supported it and why not right? But I got rid of it when I did the redesign because I didn&amp;rsquo;t really use it and didn&amp;rsquo;t care for the additional JavaScript and tracking and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do have are server-side stats via AWStats, which I do look at maybe once every couple or years or so. For the purposes of this post I decided to pull the server-side stats into a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/stats/awstats/&#34;&gt;page on this site&lt;/a&gt;. So if you check that page, I had 29292 unique visitors for the entirety of 2019. That&amp;rsquo;s around 80 visitors per day. The peak was in 2017, when I had around 135 visitors per day. These are pretty weak numbers I guess? I don&amp;rsquo;t really know, but obviously I haven&amp;rsquo;t gone viral or gotten on the frontpage of HN/reddit or anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s fine! Traffic isn&amp;rsquo;t why I write, and any visitors above 0 are kind of a bonus, since I write mostly for myself! I feel like optimizing for traffic or SEO or whatever would be a bit like selling your soul. I think the whole point of the original post was a nostalgia for the old-style blogs that were writing for the sake of writing, and not to cater to the whims of the search engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do like engagement though, mostly in the form of comments, which is something I have &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/stats/site/&#34;&gt;been tracking before&lt;/a&gt;. (Other than the comments, you can see that most of the stats that I track are &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; stats, i.e. how much I post and so on.) Again, it&amp;rsquo;s not a whole lot, but it&amp;rsquo;s enough to feel a bit rewarding every time a new comment comes in. I recently disabled the comment form for the site (been getting too much spam), but this site can still get new comments via webmention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is nice to know that there are actually people out there reading my words. I do know some friends of mine follow the blog somehow (or maybe they just pick up the posts when I syndicate to Twitter), but it&amp;rsquo;s actually more fun when a stranger leaves a good comment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-self-censorship&#34;&gt;On Self-Censorship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone on HN mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this is why I don’t have a blog. I have a lot of strong opinions that might be interesting to some people, but I don’t want to miss opportunities because some HR person googled my name and found a post they disagreed with. Or, in the future, not a real person but an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this is a result of the current climate, where people can get &amp;ldquo;cancelled&amp;rdquo; for things they&amp;rsquo;ve said in the past etc. And I guess that&amp;rsquo;s a valid concern, if you want to live your life that way. But really, how strong are your opinions if you can&amp;rsquo;t stand for them in public?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I write something, on this blog or elsewhere on the internet, it&amp;rsquo;s because I believe it to be true, at that time. (Or I may also be shitposting, but it should be obvious when I&amp;rsquo;m shitposting.) I&amp;rsquo;ve written some political stuff on the blog and elsewhere on the internet before, and I often criticize my country&amp;rsquo;s government when the opportunity arises. This might become problematic recently, as Duterte&amp;rsquo;s administration has started harassing critics by filing charges against them and so on. But even if it comes to that, I like to think that I would be willing to stand by what I write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to think it&amp;rsquo;s because I tend to be right all the time (LOL), but also if I&amp;rsquo;ve said or done or posted something before that would later turn out to be inaccurate or offensive or whatnot, I have no concerns about walking that back and saying &amp;ldquo;Hey, I made a mistake!&amp;rdquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s another advantage running your own blog has over something like Twitter. On Twitter you can only delete your past mistakes. Here I can preserve them, but add a note saying something like &amp;ldquo;My opinion on this has changed&amp;rdquo; or such. I have not yet had a reason to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I think it helps that I largely hold non-controversial opinions and generally try to avoid being an asshole to people, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably the topic of another post entirely.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also the idea that you may want to write things that you don&amp;rsquo;t want associated with you IRL. I can understand that. For those kinds of things, you can make one-off posts using throwaway accounts I guess? For me, from the very beginning of my internet presence, I haven&amp;rsquo;t considered anonymizing or protecting my content. My geocities URL had my full name in it for example (and so does this domain!). But I have made some throwaway posts that aren&amp;rsquo;t tied to me, for example when talking about sensitive information or such. But I think for a large majority of the content a regular person would post, this isn&amp;rsquo;t really necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-originality&#34;&gt;On Originality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often notice when I start writing on a particular topic, I learn more about my thoughts and opinions of it and realize my thoughts are wrong or not really novel. Halfway in I give up since I feel like, &amp;ldquo;oh, this actually isn&amp;rsquo;t really adding anything new to the conversation&amp;rdquo;. Then I leave with a new humbleness about my beliefs but also a sense of &amp;ldquo;when am I actually going to know enough to warrant writing about it?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in a blogging lull around 2010-2015 (as seen on &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/stats/site/&#34;&gt;the stats page&lt;/a&gt;!) and thinking of getting back into it and writing more software-related content, but I mentioned to a friend that I was worried that the internet was already oversaturated with such writers/bloggers and I would not have anything original to contribute. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember his exact words, but it was one of the best pieces of writing advice I had ever gotten, something along the lines of: &amp;ldquo;No one else is going to be writing with your perspective and your point of view, so no matter what, you are bringing something to the table.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-discoverability&#34;&gt;On Discoverability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people on the HN thread said that Google no longer surfaces older blog content. I anecdotally know this to be not true, because a Google search for the terms &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=killer%20killer&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;killer-killer&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=pasmado&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;pasmado&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; still shows posts from my blog from 2008 on the first page. I suspect this is because my blog has been continuously updated since 2002, hence my posts never fall &amp;ldquo;out of rotation&amp;rdquo;? Is that a thing? Who knows! SEO, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original post was correct however in that it is difficult to find old-school blog content if you are searching specifically for that kind of thing. I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/04/fe45adb8c24e654605b9906dea2df749/&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; that I want some kind of indieweb federated search focused on searching content from &amp;ldquo;indie&amp;rdquo; blogs (for lack of a better term. We need a better term?). Maybe someday I&amp;rsquo;d write down how I imagine that would work. And implement it maybe? IDK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, there are still a lot of blogs around, if you know where to look. One of my favorite avenues is Kicks Condors&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kickscondor.com/hrefhunt/&#34;&gt;monthly HrefHunt updates&lt;/a&gt;. And I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before, but whenever anyone posts anything remotely nostalgic about old-school blogging on Hacker News, the comments are always full of links to blogs. There&amp;rsquo;s specialized subreddits like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/SpartanWeb/&#34;&gt;r/SpartanWeb&lt;/a&gt; (not many users!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run a blog, you can help by having a page where you list other blogs you like! Some kind of roll call, but for blogs. Like&amp;hellip; a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/blogroll/&#34;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt;? And if they make a post you like, share it on your blog, and maybe on other social media channels too! Us indie and old-school bloggers need to have each other backs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;more-to-come&#34;&gt;More To Come&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am 99.9999% sure this is not the last time I&amp;rsquo;m going to blog about blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

</title>

            <pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/04/privacy-and-nothing-to-hide/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I was reading this post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2020/04/nothing-to-hide/&#34;&gt;how to respond to the &amp;ldquo;Nothing to Hide&amp;rdquo; argument&lt;/a&gt; against the concept of privacy. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://spreadprivacy.com/three-reasons-why-the-nothing-to-hide-argument-is-flawed/&#34;&gt;quoted DuckDuckGo blog post&lt;/a&gt; lists some pretty good reasons, but I thought I&amp;rsquo;d expound on some thoughts as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of the &amp;ldquo;Nothing to Hide&amp;rdquo; argument is that if you, personally, have nothing incriminating or illegal to hide, then you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about privacy intrusions. The argument is used mainly to justify things like state-sponsored surveillance, but might also be applicable to data collection activities by large corporations such as Facebook or Google. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument&#34;&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; for reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to understand is that even if you personally have nothing to hide, there are people who do have legitimate reasons for having to hide something, especially from the government, and that society is better off with them having that ability. The primary example of this would be anyone who helps keep the powerful in check: whistleblowers, activists, journalists, and so on. More minor examples (much lower impact) would be people planning surprise parties, people in abusive relationships, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are of course also negative elements who have a lot to hide (criminal activities), but that is neither here nor there. There is no question that governments should be empowered to surveil the criminal elements, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they should have blanket power to surveil everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quoted post from jlelse mentions the argument in the context of the contact tracing apps being developed to fight the Covid19 pandemic, and this is a prime example. If the data were handled by a centralized entity such as a government or a private company, then presumably someone with that information could use the location data to do something like identify who has been meeting with a journlist, in order to unmask his sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I trust the government&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I trust corporation X&amp;rdquo; are not good responses either. Even if these entities were purely benevolent (not likely), the mere existence of such a data store is a possible threat, since there is always the possibility of data leaking or systems being compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may ask why should you personally be concerned? Why should you bother using privacy-protecting tools or avoiding privacy-collecting platforms such as Facebook, etc. Since you personally have nothing to hide, why worry about it? I personally have nothing to hide, and in fact even write a lot about the things going on in my life in this very website, I should have nothing to fear right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very individualistic mentality. Even if you personally have nothing to hide, there are people in society who have legitimate reasons to hide something, and if we get used to or start accepting the lack of privacy or mass surveillance, then we are moving society in a direction that makes it much harder for those people to operate. The less people that are privacy-conscious, then the more that those who use privacy-protecting tools or software stand out and it becomes easier to track them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though we as individual persons may not have anything to hide, privacy protections are a necessary element for society as whole to function and to keep the powerful in check. Just like public health in a pandemic, privacy is a societal concern, and we all need to do our part even if we aren&amp;rsquo;t the ones most at risk. We need to push back against mass surveillance and normalize or promote the use of privacy-conscious tools and software.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://css-naked-day.github.io/&#34;&gt;naked CSS day&lt;/a&gt;, so the site looks super bare-bones today! Inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;https://laurakalbag.com/css-naked-day-2020/&#34;&gt;Laura Kalbag&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://meyerweb.com/&#34;&gt;Eric Meyer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying out the site without the CSS made me realize how I wasn&amp;rsquo;t setting width and height for the svg icons I was using, so they became huge when the CSS was removed. I also rearranged the templates so the footer is at the end of the document (previously it was being put there by CSS). So at the very least this did lead to some fixes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Hopefully I don&amp;rsquo;t forget to restore the CSS tomorrow!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of the Naked CSS version for posterity:&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Drew Devault wrote a great post/rant about &lt;a href=&#34;https://drewdevault.com/2020/03/18/Reckless-limitless-scope.html&#34;&gt;the reckless limitless scope of modern web browsers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I conclude that it is impossible to build a new web browser. The complexity of the web is obscene. The creation of a new web browser would be comparable in effort to the Apollo program or the Manhattan project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past year or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about contributing to an open source project. Haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten around to it yet, but I have looked at a few projects of interest. Preferably it&amp;rsquo;s something I use on an every day basis, so Firefox was one of my candidates since it was my web browser of choice. I decided to try it out last month; I followed the instructions on their site for checking out the source and building the code. I assumed there would be a lot of code, and that the build would be a nontrivial amount of time, but just checking out the source and creating a build took the better part of a day; I believe the build itself took somewhere around 4-6 hours (I didn&amp;rsquo;t really record how long it took, just left it running while I went out and did stuff.) I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually tried hacking on the code itself yet, because with that kind of build time, I don&amp;rsquo;t see how one can be productive. (I decided to run the build a second time as I write this post, maybe it speeds up on successive builds?) It&amp;rsquo;s kind of intimidating to get into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is: Drew is right, and modern browsers are massive pieces of software. The comparison to the Apollo or Manhattan programs may even be understated; even though your browser isn&amp;rsquo;t taking people to the moon or testing nuclear weapons, it&amp;rsquo;s probably using way more memory than those programs combined!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhat related: Great post recently over on the Cloudflare blog about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-history-of-the-url/&#34;&gt;History of the URL&lt;/a&gt;. One can&amp;rsquo;t talk about the history of the URL without talking about the history of the internet of course, and this post let me learn a lot more about those early days of the internet. One of my key takeaways is that a lot of the design decisions around URLs and the early internet made by people like Tim Berners-Lee largely intended the web and the HTTP protocol to be used for serving text-based documents. It&amp;rsquo;s even in the name of the protocol: hyper&lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt; transfer protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s what it was in the early days. People put up documents and web pages, and other people read them and maybe posted comments or other input and that was it. But the modern web (and thus modern web browsers) have tacked on so much functionality onto the presumably text-based protocol. First we added the ability to serve images and videos, then whole applications, formerly the domain of native apps. Just looking at my commonly-used websites, the web browser is used these days for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;full-featured email applications (GMail, ProtonMail)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a complicated social media interface with multiple streams that automatically update (Tweetdeck)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watching videos, tv shows and movies (Youtube, Netflix)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instant messaging with groups and voice chat (Messenger, Discord)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rss feed reader (Inoreader)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;note taking and productivity (Trello, Notion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With systems like Google Stadia, you can even play AAA games via the web browser now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the internet, all of those would still be native apps running outside the browser but these days we overload the poor HTTP protocol to handle all of these functions. The modern browser these days is almost comparable to an entire operating system (and there are of course already ChromeOS and FirefoxOS to drive home this point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand full well the benefits of overloading the browser and the HTTP protocol to handle all of these applications, but the scope creep is definitely unsustainable. The high resource usage of modern browsers and web pages even moreso. Imagine a new web browser that cuts off support for the evolving W3C specs at a certain point to compete on performance and stability instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about one that&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;just a browser&amp;rdquo;, literally just for browsing documents. Maybe one without JavaScript support completely, if you open a page that has SCRIPT tags, it will prompt you to open the OS-level browsers like Firefox or Chrome? Many modern applications could probably work without JavaScript, except users would have to do without many of the bells and whistles we&amp;rsquo;ve come to expect from modern webapps. i.e. clicking &amp;ldquo;Refresh&amp;rdquo; instead of timelines auto-updating, clicking &amp;ldquo;Next&amp;rdquo; instead of having infinite scroll, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The never-ending scope creep reminds me of the never-ending growth pursued by late-stage capitalism; it can&amp;rsquo;t be sustainable in the long run, and maybe we need to start looking for different models other than &amp;ldquo;the browser does everything and will eventually become the OS.&amp;rdquo; (At that point, everything will have been subsumed by JavaScript)!&lt;/p&gt;

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/02/redesign/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;During recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/weeknotes&#34;&gt;weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a site redesign. The planned redesign had three objectives, more or less:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rework the navigation links so that new pages like the blogroll etc were more easily accessible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the homepage less messy and highlight blog posts more. The previous &amp;ldquo;stream of everything&amp;rdquo; home page mixed the blog posts in with everything else like the notes, and photos and links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General redesign to improve the layout etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had already done most of #1 and #2 (easy), but during the past few days, I found it difficult to decide on a direction for #3. (This is what happens when you set a vague goal.) It didn&amp;rsquo;t help that I found myself browsing Tumblr themes in the early mornings after recently &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/02/tumblr-cloudflare/&#34;&gt;having to debug Tumblr stuff&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself especially good at web design, but I do enjoy browsing themes, whether it&amp;rsquo;s Wordpress or Tumblr or Hugo themes. This is the reason why even when I was using Wordpress, I would be switching themes way too often. I&amp;rsquo;m not one of those guys who can be happy running the same Blogspot template for ten years. Given all of that I don&amp;rsquo;t know if the redesign would ever finish if I insisted on a general redesign. So, I&amp;rsquo;m deploying #1 and #2 first, and maybe worry about the other stuff in the future. So: more incremental, less big, drastic change, I find that always works out better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do get some general changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sidebar added for the navigation links, replacing the previous hero section at the top of the pages. The sidebar ploops to the bottom on lower display widths. Main links still up top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tightening up the spacing in the header&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Menus and Home page summary lists externalized to JSON data files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably some kinks to work out here and there since I decided to cut the cord on the redesign abruptly, but should be nothing we can&amp;rsquo;t fix as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is tradition for &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/changelog&#34;&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt; posts, I&amp;rsquo;m attaching a screenshot of the new design here. And I just discovered right now that the latest Firefox has built-in functionality for taking a screenshot of the whole page. No more need for Fireshot!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Apparently Tumblr custom domains don&#39;t work well with Cloudflare
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/02/tumblr-cloudflare/</link>

            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/02/tumblr-cloudflare/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I used to host my tumblr blog on a custom domain at &lt;a href=&#34;https://tumblr.roytang.net&#34;&gt;tumblr.roytang.net&lt;/a&gt;. That was working fine for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then recently I decided to play around with having &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cloudflare.com/&#34;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt; in front of my site (might be helpful on the off-chance I ever manage to go viral somehow). Not yet sure whether Cloudflare was a good idea, but apparently it doesn&amp;rsquo;t play well with Tumblr&amp;rsquo;s custom domains, so the above custom tumblr URL got turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t actually care about the tumblr blog anymore and have no intention of updating it further. All the content from that blog has already been &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/source/tumblr&#34;&gt;imported into this site&lt;/a&gt; anyway. But those imported posts still have a link pointing back to the original URL. I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of link rot on the web, and I want to minimize it as much as possible, so I was OC&amp;rsquo;ed into fixing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First idea was to just find-and-replace all the old links on this site to point to where the tumblr blog now lives. It would be super straightforward since it&amp;rsquo;s just file updates. But other sources out in the wild may be pointing back to the original URL, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to give them link rot either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to figure out a solution with the Tumblr and Cloudflare DNS settings for around ten minutes before saying &amp;ldquo;screw it&amp;rdquo; and set up a redirector from &lt;a href=&#34;https://tumblr.roytang.net&#34;&gt;tumblr.roytang.net&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;roytang.tumblr.com&#34;&gt;roytang.tumblr.com&lt;/a&gt;, which is where the tumblr blog now lives. It was a simple &lt;code&gt;.htaccess&lt;/code&gt; redirect like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://roytang.tumblr.com/%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Someday when I migrate off shared hosting/apache, I will have to live with rewriting all of these .htaccess workarounds to work with Nginx or such.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now all the old links just automagically redirect to the appropriate post as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Just for fun, I also changed the tumblr&amp;rsquo;s theme, since I was already logged in to the dashboard anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Thoughts on Blogging, 2020 Edition

            <pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I found this great article the other week about &lt;a href=&#34;https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/&#34;&gt;Why You Should Start A Blog Right Now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole thing is absolutely worth a read, but my favorite part is at the start where he enumerates a list of reasons why he wrote particular posts, and it sent me down a rabbit hole again of evaluating why I write on this blog, and whether it was an endeavor worth continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presumably, having a blog has a lot of possible benefits, but the one important for me personally are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it helps me clarify step through my own thoughts and understand my own thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it serves as an archive of my state of mind at the time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it helps me improve my own writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presumably, you can also use a blog to advance your career, build a brand/reputation, finding an audience, etc. And those are fine, but for me they are only incidentals, nice-to-haves. Fundamentally, I still always write for myself first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that&amp;rsquo;s the case, I said to myself, why write in public at all? If those three reasons are the most important, then something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/12/private-writing/&#34;&gt;private writing&lt;/a&gt; should already suffice. I even asked my self the very same question back in 2005 at the end of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2005/11/why-do-i-blog/&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, and at that time I had no answer. Today I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write in public because we as humans have so much in common, even if we aren&amp;rsquo;t aware of it. And while writing down one&amp;rsquo;s own thoughts or opinions or everyday happenings may seem like it would be entirely uninteresting to the average reader, there will always be some aspect of your stories that will resonate with someone else, somewhere, because of that shared human experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, everyone can have a platform for writing, whether it&amp;rsquo;s in one of the social media silos or your own site like this one, so the whole &amp;ldquo;writing in public&amp;rdquo; thing isn&amp;rsquo;t so novel anymore. But even in this age, not everyone chooses to participate in social media, not everyone tweets or posts all the time, and that&amp;rsquo;s fine. I can accept that writing in public isn&amp;rsquo;t for everyone. But to have that voice, that ability to express yourself and share your human experience with others, to have stories to share and advice to dispense and objections to raise - to have it and not to exercise it in a meaningful way? For me that seems a waste. And so I write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I actually haven&amp;rsquo;t been writing much the past couple of weeks, aside from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/weeknotes&#34;&gt;weeknotes&lt;/a&gt;. I pumped out a couple of longish and in my mind pretty good posts early in the month (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/02/old-web/&#34;&gt;Tales of the Old Web&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/02/burnout/&#34;&gt;Burnout&lt;/a&gt;), but after that I found myself struggling to put some new ones together. Somehow in my mind I became trapped in the idea that I needed to have these long, profound, well-researched essays as posts. Browsing blogs like Alexey Guzey&amp;rsquo;s (author of the post linked at the start of this one) certainly hasn&amp;rsquo;t helped - on his &lt;a href=&#34;https://guzey.com/notes/&#34;&gt;notes page&lt;/a&gt; he mentions that some of his better posts take upwards of 100+ hours to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I kind of fell into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/11/comparison-is-the-thief-of-joy/&#34;&gt;trap of comparison&lt;/a&gt; and wanted to be writing thesis papers? Except that&amp;rsquo;s not really my style. I can probably churn out some longer pieces if they&amp;rsquo;ve been formulating in my head for a while, but for the most part, my regular blogging consists of thoughts-in-the-moment, a snapshot of where my thinking is at that time, to be built upon and to be evolved later on. And I think that&amp;rsquo;s fine, I think everyone has their own unique writing/blogging style and voice that they need to develop to see what works best for them. Maybe as time goes on, I will tend more towards longer-form posts, but for now I have to listen to my own advice and remember that &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/01/not-all-posts-have-to-be-profound/&#34;&gt;not all posts have to be profound&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few years or so, and especially since I got interested in this &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/11/indieweb/&#34;&gt;Indieweb stuff&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve also been more on the lookout for interesting blogs to read. Personal blogs, none of that &amp;ldquo;professional blogger&amp;rdquo; crap. There&amp;rsquo;s still a lot of interesting sites out there, a lot of them long-running ones even. With the rise of social media silos, having personal websites and blogs hasn&amp;rsquo;t really gotten mainstream attention, but there&amp;rsquo;s still plenty of people writing out there. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve added more blogs to my RSS reader over the past 12 months than I have over the preceding 5ish years or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It saddens me a bit that among people of my cohort I am one among very few who are (still) actively blogging. I have a large folder of RSS feeds named &amp;ldquo;people I know&amp;rdquo;, many of them have tried blogging at some point or another, and all of those links are inactive or even inaccessible. Friends: please write more! You can revive your old sites if you like, you don&amp;rsquo;t even have to explain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have a bunch of reorganizing my RSS feeds to do, but I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to put enough feeds into a folder called &amp;ldquo;blogroll&amp;rdquo; that seems suitable for sharing, so I created a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/blogroll&#34;&gt;Blogroll page&lt;/a&gt; where you can see some of the blogs I follow. Very few of these are people I know IRL, mostly I just stumbled upon their blogs via some method or other. Many of them are tech-related though not all of them are. All are reasonably active. I thought about tagging or categorizing them somehow, but it&amp;rsquo;s rude to put people into boxes, so maybe it&amp;rsquo;s rude to do that for their websites too, just let people be people and let blogs be blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to maintain an older blogroll back in the day, but it seems that has already been lost to the dustbin of history, so this one is brand new and built from scratch. (If I find the older one, I might put it on that page too as a record of history.) As with many other things on the site, the blogroll is perpetually under renovation, so if you find (or have) a personal blog that you think I might find interesting, feel free to tell me about it and maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll add it there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Technical note: The blogroll listing is automatically imported from a JSON-formatted OPML file. I got the idea from &lt;a href=&#34;https://jlelse.blog/dev/auto-blogroll-hugo/&#34;&gt;this post by jlelse&lt;/a&gt;, and coincidentally he is also on the blogroll.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: I&amp;rsquo;m having trouble writing long-form posts recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also me: Hey, I wrote a thousand words on blogging without thinking about it!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I am generally receptive to receiving emails from strangers, so I don&amp;rsquo;t mind having a contact email publicly accessible on this site. But I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s a consequence of having a reasonably active blog or what, but in the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve sometimes gotten what I like to call &amp;ldquo;weird blog spam.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically it starts out with an introductory email that often includes a compliment about a specific article on your blog, accompanied by an offer to increase your blog&amp;rsquo;s visibility if you would just link to one of their articles:&lt;/p&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#d6cd0462e155938985aaaf24edbd02eb-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/01/weird-blog-spam/intro_hu3a74ace9dc3f452b095e42cf081fb805_57634_300x0_resize_box_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;d6cd0462e155938985aaaf24edbd02eb-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/01/weird-blog-spam/intro.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;13 Jan 2020 12:00am&#34;&gt;13 Jan 2020 12:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This particular subject line pattern of &amp;ldquo;Love your &amp;lt;content/article/post&amp;gt;! (and a proposal)&amp;rdquo; is specifically something I&amp;rsquo;ve seen multiple times. And since I never respond, all of them always send two follow-up emails, each spaced roughly days after the previous email. Usually there&amp;rsquo;s some wording like &amp;ldquo;Just checking if you saw the last email&amp;rdquo; etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it&amp;rsquo;s obviously some script that someone is training SEO people to use? Or is it some kind of automated process? With the goal of getting more organic links to their content to boost search engine placement. Most likely a search was done for blog posts about a specific topic then they just email blast the authors and hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I don&amp;rsquo;t really write on this blog to build an audience or to earn money, I am generally uninterested in such offers. (And actually, these are the sort of deceptive marketing practices I consider a bit scummy.) I was however curious about this script they were all following so recently I tried to get into a conversation with one of them:&lt;/p&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#3afc1fc0300542362c286b706a23ee5b-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/01/weird-blog-spam/are-you-a-bot_hu85c37da0b10ef353ee98365d2d35906e_45642_300x0_resize_box_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;3afc1fc0300542362c286b706a23ee5b-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/01/weird-blog-spam/are-you-a-bot.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;13 Jan 2020 12:00am&#34;&gt;13 Jan 2020 12:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They never replied to this email, but then, IDK if it was a coincidence or what, but I got another thread for them a couple of weeks later, as if they forgot they already sent me the script!&lt;/p&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#c071326c70f050ba13f9048bb58b7f6b-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/01/weird-blog-spam/followup_hu54c43db17cee1524bd12c94ce7f5e852_58033_300x0_resize_box_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;c071326c70f050ba13f9048bb58b7f6b-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/01/weird-blog-spam/followup.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;13 Jan 2020 12:00am&#34;&gt;13 Jan 2020 12:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never did get a response to this one either!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then last week I got a new email where the author seemed tired of these sort of scripts, it read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not going to lie and say I looked at your website or I love your latest blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are a global marketplace that helps publishers like you sell and manage guest posts and sponsored content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this sound like something you&amp;rsquo;re interested in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That made me LOL before I sent out my curt reply: &amp;ldquo;No.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of now, my curiosity about this sort of scheme has expired and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to avoid them in the future. I&amp;rsquo;ve removed the contact email that I show on every page of this site and replaced it with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/about/contact/&#34;&gt;Contact Information page&lt;/a&gt; that includes an FAQ entry that specifically says I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in such offers. I&amp;rsquo;ve only gotten a couple of dozen such email threads like this, starting around 2015 (coincidentally when I started to resume blogging regularly?). It&amp;rsquo;s still mildly annoying though, so I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this change to the contact information reduces that volume greatly or maybe even completely. (Either that, or now I&amp;rsquo;m going to receive offers to link to content about SEO, guest posts, sponsored content, and so on!) We&amp;rsquo;ll see!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It was a bit more than a year ago that I decided to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/11/site-migration-from-wordpress-to-hugo/&#34;&gt;haphazardly and suddenly migrate from Wordpress to Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a good time to look back and reflect on that decision and consider where we are now, and how to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am extremely happy with the site&amp;rsquo;s browser performance. It currently scores an insanely high 96 on &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Froytang.net&#34;&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s Pagespeed tool&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I I know how to close the remaining 4% gap. (I just need to get around to it.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;generally all the advantages listed in the original post a year ago. I&amp;rsquo;m particularly happy with managing the posts through the file system, especially with a decent editor like VS Code. I don&amp;rsquo;t miss Wordpress&amp;rsquo;s clunky editor at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main sticking point right now is that the build time is really high. I have a Travis build script setup that automatically builds the hugo site from source whenever I push a new commit, then the output is committed to a second repo, which is the one deployed to the live site every 15 minutes. This build right now takes on average around 8 mins, which is ridiculous. The hugo build itself takes around 3 mins, the rest is copying files and git clones and push and so on. The build times really skyrocketed when I did the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/10/archive-of-my-own/&#34;&gt;social media archiving&lt;/a&gt;, since the number of markdown files skyrocketed from around 1000 to almost 16,000. For sure, a lot of it is the fault of the theme I am using on this site, because I am adding a lot of features like static comments, image resizing, monthly archives, a bunch of taxonomies, and so on. I don&amp;rsquo;t blame Hugo at all, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure any other static site generator would simply choke on the amount of posts I have. There are surely a lot of optimizations that can be done, but even if I manage to pare down the template generation to bare minimum, I am most probably hitting the limits on disk I/O. As mentioned in &lt;a href=&#34;https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/performance-expectations-for-large-number-of-pages/21887&#34;&gt;this discussion I had on the Hugo forums&lt;/a&gt;, simply copying the entire content folder already takes 30 seconds on my local computer, so that is the bare minimum I could go. This is not an intolerable problem, but it means I don&amp;rsquo;t have immediate feedback when I push a post, it can take at least 15 minutes or more for recent changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are also a number of dynamic features I want to implement, which are impossible with just a static website. I have a python web app backing the static hugo site which I use for things like search, comments, and so on, but basically there is nontrivial effort when I want to implement new things. This is even less of an issue than the last one, mostly because I enjoy working with Python anyway lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The build performance is such a big issue for me that I briefly considered the option of migrating back to Wordpress. Ha! I&amp;rsquo;m not ruling it out, but the fact is I find managing posts through the Wordpress interface to be extremely clunky, especially compared to my current set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option would be to write my own database-backed webapp. This is something I&amp;rsquo;ve done before after all, and again, I enjoy working on Python anyway. But it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work, so maybe shelve that for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to stay with my current static hugo + dynamic python support, and try to optimize the build time as much as I can. I will probably be on the look out for possible alternative solutions, some other blogging software perhaps, or some other hybrid approach.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>New Video Card!

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;This is a follow up to my previous &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/08/the-great-memory-scare-of-2019/&#34;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; about my &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/09/two-backups/&#34;&gt;2019 PC troubles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was still encountering game crashes even after reinstalling the OS, so the most likely culprits now were either the video card or the power supply. I sent the video card over to my brother for him to test on his PC to see if he encountered the same symptoms. Sure enough, he couldn&amp;rsquo;t even run the 3DMARK Time Spy test without immediately crashing, which was the same when it was on my PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been running on onboard graphics only, which luckily could still handle things like Starcraft II, Magic Arena and Eternal. Oh, and I had to live on a single monitor, like a savage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began canvassing last month for a new video card. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get anything super expensive, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d keep the budget under 10k PHP (around $200). I also have a preference for NVidia/GeForce since the one time I tried an AMD I had an overclocking issue and had to replace the card within a couple of months (this was almost entirely my fault though!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that, the best (most recent) NVidia card in my price range was this year&amp;rsquo;s GTX1650. Unfortunately, reviews said this was not good value for money, as it was comparable in performance to the older and slightly cheaper AMD RX570 card. I also looked at a couple of cards above my budget line, namely the recently released GTX1650 Super and GTX1660 Super. The price difference between the two wasn&amp;rsquo;t too high, so I figured the 1660S was a better deal overall, but it was around $100 more expensive than the RX570.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the choice now was the cheaper RX570, which would be an upgrade anyway over my old GTX 970, or the more expensive GTX 1660 Super. Getting the more expensive card was a bit more future proof, but the problem is that this rig overall is already going on 4 years old, so I might need to upgrade everything again in a couple of years anyway. I figured it was better to get the cheaper card first then decide a few years down the line whether I needed a complete refresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, when I checked my nearby PC part stores, neither the RX570 nor the GTX1660S were in stock. (The first one due to high demand, the second due to maybe being too new?). Against my instincts, I decided to just order online from Lazada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not yet a fan of buying electronics online in the Philippines. Online purchases for me are fine for digital products or physical things that are relatively cheap. But for expensive electronics, I have some anxiety that there&amp;rsquo;s so much that could go wrong. And I had some friends with bad stories about shady/sloppy Lazada sellers too. I also prefer getting my components from a store because (a) I don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait for delivery; and (b) I can ask them to test the part right there and then to make sure no issues before I bring it home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case I had no choice, so online it was. Luckily, I found that one of my nearby PC part stores EasyPC was also a Lazada seller, and they had RX570 in stock online. I settled on a Gigabyte 4GB RX570, then waited the requisite number of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package arrived yesterday, a day earlier than predicted. I unboxed it and set about installing the card. I have some anxiety as well about installing PC parts myself, as I&amp;rsquo;m always worried that I&amp;rsquo;ll do some damage via static electricity or my sweat dropping down into the PC case or something like that. But this time went smoothly. These new video cards are nice because they have back plates making them easier to grip. The only problem I encountered was that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have an extra screw to pin the card unto the back of the case (I&amp;rsquo;ll get one later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, plugged the card into pci-e, connect the 8-pin power connector, plug in both monitors, then boot! Success! I got my 2nd monitor back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed the latest AMD drivers, then to verify everything was fine, I ran the 3DMARK Timespy benchmark test. The test scored my system at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.3dmark.com/spy/9343394&#34;&gt;around 3600+&lt;/a&gt;, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad. Comparing to results using my old card and the same CPU, those scores were around 1700+, so there&amp;rsquo;s a significant improvement. With the 1650, it would have been 3600+ as well. The results said I&amp;rsquo;m only better than 19% of all results, but that&amp;rsquo;s ok, I&amp;rsquo;m not looking for super high end graphics at super high resolutions and I rarely care about framerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next were the game tests!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starcraft II at Ultra settings: No crashes! Which is great, since all of this started with SC2 anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Street Fighter V: Smooth! I had tried SFV before with onboard graphics, but it was basically super slow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tales of Berseria: Smooth! I chose this game because I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to play it. It didn&amp;rsquo;t do too well with the onboard graphics either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dragon Ball Fighter Z: Smooth!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, everything looks good! I&amp;rsquo;ll probably be testing the card with a few other games over the weekend, but otherwise everything looks great!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I forgot to take a pic of the card after unboxing, so have a pic of the box instead.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Grab Overpricing
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/11/grab-overpricing/</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/11/grab-overpricing/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;So the Philippine Competition Commission recently &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philstar.com/business/2019/11/19/1969865/grab-fined-p23-million-overcharging&#34;&gt;fined rideshare provider Grab P23M for overcharging their customers&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently only P5M of that is meant to go back to the affected riders, which seems like a piddly amount considering the number of riders in the Philippines. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how of that I actually get credited back, if any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab pricing has been steadily increasing since Uber exited the market early last year. The other day Grab wanted to charge me a bit over P400 for a 13km ride to a commercial area, which seemed insane. I ended up just going out and taking a taxi back and forth, and that cost me a total of P500 both ways. So Grab was pricing the ride at around 60% higher than the equivalent taxi ride. This was on a Sunday afternoon (typically the lightest traffic day of the week), and the ride took only around 30 mins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pricing was never this bad with Uber; looking at my records, my most expensive Uber ride was for P412 pesos to Taguig, and that was a 21km ride that took an hour and a half!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel that Grab&amp;rsquo;s really pushing the pricing due to their monopoly. We were promised that there would be new entrants coming in to compete with Grab, but other than motorcycle service Angkas, none have actually come out. And so for now, we suffer their predatory pricing. Hopefully the PCC is more able to keep them in check in the days to come.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>On Feed Readers
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/11/on-feed-readers/</link>
            <pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/11/on-feed-readers/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.inoreader.com/&#34;&gt;Inoreader&lt;/a&gt; anymore, but a recent blog post of theirs recently appeared in my feeds that mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.inoreader.com/2019/11/new-feature-sort-by-magic-and-article-popularity-indicators.html&#34;&gt;they implemented &amp;ldquo;sort by magic&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. This was a feature that &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2009/10/5149594629/&#34;&gt;Google reader had 10 YEARS AGO&lt;/a&gt;! There hasn&amp;rsquo;t been much innovation in the feed reader space in the last decade it seems, which is totally understandable given they are mostly tools used by internet &amp;ldquo;power users&amp;rdquo;, and mostly by older netheads, so the target market isn&amp;rsquo;t very large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I talk about &amp;ldquo;feeds&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;feed readers&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;m not talking only about RSS and the associated readers, but anything that lets me aggregate contents from a set of sources. This includes most social media streams (Twitter, etc), I guess Indieweb microformats readers (though I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried these a lot), and apps like &lt;a href=&#34;https://flipboard.com/&#34;&gt;Flipboard&lt;/a&gt; (which I typically use for my morning news).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I installed a self-hosted &lt;a href=&#34;https://tt-rss.org/&#34;&gt;Tiny Tiny RSS&lt;/a&gt; to take the place of my primary RSS feed reader. I also previously tried Inoreader and Feedly. The jump to TTRSS was mostly to avoid the free account limitations on those services. TTRSS is fine and it&amp;rsquo;s serviceable, but there&amp;rsquo;s still a lot of improvement I would like. I think about feed reader features a lot because (a) I like reading content from a wide variety of sources and feed readers help me do that; and (b) even back when Google Reader was still around I was kicking around the idea of writing my own feed reader. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those side projects that I want to build for myself but never get around to it. I&amp;rsquo;ll note down a couple of features I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about in the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first flaw I find in most readers (including social media feeds) is that they typically treat all feeds the same way. In reality, I would like to be able to treat some feeds differently. I can think of at least two categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feeds where I don&amp;rsquo;t mind missing some of their content (since I don&amp;rsquo;t always have time to read), and don&amp;rsquo;t mind just browsing their latest content like a magazine. Flipboard is great for this. Most social media feeds on the other hand seem to want to pull you away from this model by having their feeds be &amp;ldquo;algorithmic&amp;rdquo;. And for traditional RSS readers, having unread counts for this type of feed doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense, and only annoys me and my compulsive need for zero unread counts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feeds where I don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss any of their content. Maybe because it&amp;rsquo;s a particular source that I enjoy reading, or because it&amp;rsquo;s a feed I set up for notification purposes or such, or maybe the source is an events page where I want to know all the events they set up. Basically feeds that have a high signal-to-noise ratio for me (although ideally all the feeds I follow have high S/N ratio.) For this kind of feed, the unread counts in traditional RSS readers make sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine there could be some in-between categories as well, possibly customizable. Something like a feed where I have unread counts, but also automatically mark as read articles that are too old? IDK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remembered this when I realized I could import my &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/08/1167000875090378752/&#34;&gt;Youtube subscriptions as RSS&lt;/a&gt;. That gave me a whole lot of new feeds to follow, but I realized it was kind of a waste of time because most of the channels I follow are there for me to browse through when I&amp;rsquo;m looking for entertainment, but usually not the kind of content I want to regularly appear in my feeds. (So they&amp;rsquo;re under the first type.) Importing them basically added a lot of noise to my feed reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook actually had something like you could add friends to a &amp;ldquo;Close Friends&amp;rdquo; list, and their posts would be prioritized for you and appear in your notification bar. I don&amp;rsquo;t FB much anymore, so IDK if this feature is still around, but as I recall you can&amp;rsquo;t use it with Pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another feature I&amp;rsquo;d like is grouping posts by topic, or the ability to highlight &amp;ldquo;related stories&amp;rdquo; for an article from other sources that I&amp;rsquo;m also following. For example, if there&amp;rsquo;s some breaking news story, and the article about this from NewsSourceA appears in my feed, I could maybe see a link to related articles about the same topic from NewsSourceB, NewsSourceC, and so on that I also follow. Or maybe choose to mark the topic as read or block further content about this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of my major grips when using Flipboard, especially for the &amp;ldquo;Latest news&amp;rdquo; sections. There&amp;rsquo;ll be like 5 different articles about the latest Trump meltdown, and I encounter them at different points in the feed. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind reading about Trump meltdowns, but it would be more efficient if I could have each instance only appear in my feeds once. I understand this may be a bit challenging since it involves some automated content analysis though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit I haven&amp;rsquo;t explored too much the paid features of services like Feedly or Inoreader, so maybe they support something similar to these features already. (I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely though. And I&amp;rsquo;m not really up for paying the monthly fees haha.) In addition to traditional RSS readers though, I&amp;rsquo;d also like my reader to be able to support following other kinds of sources like social media, ActivityStreams-compliant streams (Mastodon, etc), microformats feeds, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe someday I&amp;rsquo;ll get around to finally building that feed reader I wanted for myself!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>An Offline Walk

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/11/an-offline-walk/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;The other day, a family member mistakenly took my phone with them to the office so I was without a phone all day. This meant my daily walk had to be offline, which was a weird thing I hadn&amp;rsquo;t experienced in a while. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but note my hand&amp;rsquo;s instinctively reaching for the mobile phone that wasn&amp;rsquo;t there. Mobile phones are so ubiquitous in our daily lives, but sometimes it feels like a crutch how we can be totally dependent on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I can&amp;rsquo;t do on my walk if don&amp;rsquo;t have a mobile phone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be contacted in an emergency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contact someone in an emergency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take a picture of something I find interesting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take a quick note of something I think of and want to remember later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use Google Maps if I get lost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not be bored when I sit down for a few minutes to take a break&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check my feeds every 7 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I can do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;appreciate my surroundings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be more observant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;try to commit more things to memory (maybe strengthening my memory?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wean myself off the OC behavior of checking my feeds every 7 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old man rant, only tangentially related: People used to be able to go places and do meetups even without mobile phones. I think the advent of mobile phones made it more acceptable for people to be late to meetings because you could always message them and say you&amp;rsquo;re running late. In the old days, if you weren&amp;rsquo;t at the meetup point at the appointed time, you knew the other party was standing there tapping their feet impatiently not knowing whether you were actually still coming, so it was much more of a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/07/move-fast-break-things/&#34;&gt;mentioned before&lt;/a&gt; that I was looking into indieweb stuff. There&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/&#34;&gt;whole wiki of information&lt;/a&gt; about it if you&amp;rsquo;re into that sort of thing, but also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/10/20/indieweb-talk/&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s a recent post&lt;/a&gt; which kind of serves as an overview. I have some comments on the content of this post, more on that &lt;a href=&#34;#later&#34;&gt;later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indieweb things I&amp;rsquo;ve already implemented on this site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have a personal domain (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2006/02/welcome-to-roytang-net/&#34;&gt;since 2006&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://microformats.io/&#34;&gt;microformats&lt;/a&gt; (h-card and h-feeds and h-entrys), though I would have to be using some sort of microformats reader to make sure everything there is hunky-dory (no concrete plans for this yet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;webmention support, via &lt;a href=&#34;https://webmention.io/&#34;&gt;webmention.io&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, I&amp;rsquo;m not actually interacting with anyone else on the indieweb yet, so this is mostly experimental and untested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/POSSE&#34;&gt;POSSE&lt;/a&gt; (partially): blog posts are syndicated to Twitter and Mastodon, but I&amp;rsquo;m also still posting content on those platforms (and to Instagram)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;owning my content: (almost) all posts I make to other social media channels now get backfed into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/10/archive-of-my-own/&#34;&gt;archive on this site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I hope to be able to implement (no timetable):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;POSSE (full) - currently for notes and photos I still mostly post using Twitter and Instagram because their native posting features are more convenient (especially on mobile) compared to my current workflow of &amp;ldquo;push a markdown file to git&amp;rdquo;. This is largely contingent on me implementing the next item:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A web interface for posting to the site. A web interface should be sufficient convenient for mobile use. Optionally using the next item:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Micropub. I&amp;rsquo;m still iffy whether I really need the protocol. It could be handy in certain situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been &lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.technology/@roytang/102954512082445097&#34;&gt;digging into ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; lately. My hope is to eventually have this site itself serve as an ActivityPub server, such that one would be able to follow me on Mastodon via something like &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:roy@roytang.net&#34;&gt;roy@roytang.net&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to how &lt;a href=&#34;https://aaronparecki.com/aaronpk&#34;&gt;Aaron Parecki has done it&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve already done some exploratory work on this but it might be a ways off (low priority I guess.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive Mastodon posts into this site (this is kinda ironic for some reason)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic sending out of webmentions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;later&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Anyway, back to the post I linked above. My main criticism for the indieweb movement at the moment is that I don&amp;rsquo;t see a path to mass adoption, especially for the purposes of moving people away from silos like Facebook. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s not really one of the goals. My main issue is with two of the principles outlined in the post above (read the post again for more details):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Make What You Need / Scratch Your Itch&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Use What You Make / Dogfood&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about these concepts is that there is a lot of work involved and there are significant barriers to entry for getting involved. I mean, most people aren&amp;rsquo;t going to (won&amp;rsquo;t be able to) bother with the first step (getting your own domain), much more be able to &amp;ldquo;make what you need&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s ok for people like me who are comfortable with the highly technical and have a bunch of free time, but for the average person it seems unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can imagine there might be created a service that supports most of the Indieweb features and can easily be adopted by the mass market, although that has a lot of its own challenges as well, and it&amp;rsquo;s kind of like replacing one kind of silo with another? At least it would be a more open silo I guess? I think &lt;a href=&#34;https://micro.blog/&#34;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt; already supports the indieweb stuff, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet looked too closely into that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still moving forward with the indieweb stuff, and I am hopeful that it manages to coalesce into something that can challenge the way the modern internet works, but that may be a long way off. As far as I can tell, adoption is not yet very widespread, and AFAICT the main people driving the effort with their &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/events/2019-11-13-homebrew-website-club&#34;&gt;Homebrew Website Clubs&lt;/a&gt; are in Western countries. It&amp;rsquo;s even possible that I&amp;rsquo;m the first in the Philippines looking into this Indieweb stuff. :)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Current desktop images (Windows 10 PC and Macbook Air). I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of dual-booting my PC with Ubuntu because reasons (and also I miss having an Ubuntu desktop to toy around with), and I figured maybe I should document my current setup first before I try something that might end in disaster. Both of the pictured wallpapers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/05/street-fighter-background-wallpapers/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Also, yes I am generally bad at cleaning my desktops of icons.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Archiving Yahoo Groups
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/10/archiving-yahoo-groups/</link>
            <pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/10/archiving-yahoo-groups/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;So a couple of days ago, Yahoo announced that it was shutting down &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8xwe9p/yahoo-groups-is-winding-down-and-all-content-will-be-permanently-removed&#34;&gt;Yahoo Groups&lt;/a&gt;. I was a big user of Yahoo Groups back in the day. I was a member of several active mailing lists in the early 2000s, including some fandom groups (see: &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2018/10/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-final-fantasy-forum/&#34;&gt;The Rise and Fall of the Final Fantasy Forum&lt;/a&gt;) and a few alumni groups and some &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/tags/mtg/&#34;&gt;MTG&lt;/a&gt;-related ones. Now all of that content is vanishing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I hate losing content to the sands of time, I immediately looked at my options for archiving my Yahoo Groups content. Groups like archive.org are working to archive publicly-accessible groups, but most of the relevant ones for me were private groups, so I had to do things myself. Yahoo itself provided a link to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.yahoo.com/kb/groups/download-data-privacy-dashboard-sln28671.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;data privacy dashboard&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; which could supposedly export your data, but it&amp;rsquo;s ridiculously useless. It only exports your subscribed groups and your preferences for each group. None of the relevant things like messages, files, photos, etc. Yahoo also provides a page with instructions on how to &amp;ldquo;download your files and photos&amp;rdquo;, but it basically only says to go to the web interface and download them one by one, also ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked instead to an open source &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/andrewferguson/YahooGroups-Archiver&#34;&gt;archive script written in Python&lt;/a&gt; that I could easily modify for my own needs. I made a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/roytang/YahooGroups-Archiver&#34;&gt;fork with my own changes&lt;/a&gt;. The only change to the main script was to continue processing when an error 500 was encountered. The original script terminated processing at this time, assuming you had been rate-limited. But manual checking revealed that Yahoo Groups was throwing the error because there were some messages it simply could not retrieve for whatever reason. I simply removed the script-ending line so that the processing could continue after an error 500. I also added a separate script to download group photos, since the original only downloaded messages. (More on that later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-to-archive&#34;&gt;What to Archive?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to only archive groups where I had actively sent messages myself for a period of time. I was a member of some public developer-oriented groups that I never really participated in, so those were out. I also decided to archive messages, files and attachments for the relevant groups. There&amp;rsquo;s this one group where I was only active for maybe a few months in the early 2000s, but the group itself stayed semi-active for up to a decade, so I ended up archiving more than a 100k messages from that group, most of which were not personally relevant to me. Well, it&amp;rsquo;s not like these archives take a whole lot of space, so I&amp;rsquo;ll keep them for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;files-and-photos&#34;&gt;Files and Photos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, the original python script only exported messages but I wanted files and photos too. I was a bit more selective for the files and photos and only chose to archive from those groups that were more personally relevant to me. (i.e. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get the files/photos for that 100k-message group mentioned above). Luckily, the relevant groups didn&amp;rsquo;t have many files. It would have taken longer to write a script to do it, so I just manually downloaded files one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photos were a different matter. A couple of the relevant groups had too many photos to bother downloading one at a time, so I ended up doing the method of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;load the webpage and scroll down until you have all the photos&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;save the html&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/roytang/YahooGroups-Archiver/blob/master/archive_photos.py&#34;&gt;python script&lt;/a&gt; to parse the HTML, store the metadata and download the full-res photo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wrapping-up&#34;&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t have that many groups so I only ended up with around 300MB (compressed) total worth of messages, files and photos archived. I stored them in my usual archive places (cloud storage, a couple of external HDs). Most of that (maybe 80%) is that really big group too, so if needed I can dump most of those messages later. Someday I may do a further deep dive or analytics of all this archived YG data, who knows what I&amp;rsquo;ll find! (Spoken like a true digital pack rat.)&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>An Archive of My Own
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/10/archive-of-my-own/</link>
            <pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A post about making a guy &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zachleat.com/web/own-my-tweets/&#34;&gt;making an archive of his twitter data&lt;/a&gt; made the rounds lately, so I figured I should make my own post about my ongoing efforts in this regard. I mentioned in an &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/08/ephemeral-social-media/&#34;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; that I like being able to use social media to dig through my own history. But as the first link above says, these social media sites can go away since nothing lasts forever. In the spirit of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/own_your_data&#34;&gt;Indieweb principle to own your data&lt;/a&gt;, for the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on archiving most of my social media content on my own site. I also intend to cut down on my social media accounts and activities, and having a backup of all the data on my own site helps with that effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requirements and considerations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted my content from external sites to appear on this site, not necessarily as a post. I would create new content types as necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy: I would only import content that I considered okay for public consumption. Actually almost all of my social media accounts are fully public, except for Facebook, where I restrict access because I use it to post pictures of family. More on this when I talk about importing from facebook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comments and reactions: Ideally I would be able to preserve comments and reactions to my content as well (tweet replies/likes, fb comments/reacts, quora comments, etc), but that kind of runs afoul of the privacy requirement, since technically those commenters did not consent to me publishing their comments on my own site. I decided to be more conservative with this regard. Also it would have required a massive effort, since most of the backup data exports did not include third party comments. Only selected comments from certain sources are included in this site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syndication links: As much as possible, I wanted to retain links to where an entry originally existed. Many of my older entries have been cross-posted across different social media platforms, so they will have multiple syndication links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another question is if I were to import content from Twitter, Facebook, etc, how would they appear on the blog? Would they be imported as posts and it will all be one giant mess, etc? I decided to maintain my traditional blog posts as the primary focus of the site, and the content from social media would largely be confined to some new sections (these are meant to map to &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/posts#Types_of_Posts&#34;&gt;Indiweb post types&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/notes/&#34;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;: microblog-like status updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/photos/&#34;&gt;photos&lt;/a&gt;: photos, sketches, screenshots, and definitely memes. Basically anything with an image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/links/&#34;&gt;links&lt;/a&gt;: links and bookmarks shared from various places&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/replies/&#34;&gt;replies&lt;/a&gt;: replies to content on other sites. This is mostly just twitter replies at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/reposts/&#34;&gt;reposts&lt;/a&gt;: reposts/shares of content on other sites. This would include twitter retweets and tumblr reblogs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wanted two types of home page: one is the more traditional homepage listing only the most recent posts, while another would be a firehose of all posts+the above content, currently &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/stream/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t (yet) figure out how to paginate this page with Hugo, as the pagination support is limited to the homepage and listing pages and not to custom pages. Maybe someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, I wrote a hodgepodge of different python scripts to import data from various social media sources into this hugo blog. It has been a huge effort, and frankly the sort of thing I only expect someone as insane as me would do. The scripts are &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/roytang/blog/tree/master/utils/importers&#34;&gt;available on this blog&amp;rsquo;s own repo&lt;/a&gt;, but they are not portable at all and highly specific to my use cases and require certain temp files I keep around on my local filesystem that are unavailable in the repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some technical challenges I encountered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link rot. As much as possible I wanted to preserve the intent of the original items. This meant following and resolving link shorteners so that the original URL would be preserved in the archive here (instead of say, the t.co URL twitter uses or bit.ly that twitter used to use). But those shorteners didn&amp;rsquo;t always resolve to the same URL as they did before. Some sites have changed their structure so that the original URLs are no longer available and they just redirect to their homepage, etc. Some sites like imgur deleted old images from when they were starting out (they no longer delete any images as of now), so their links would resolve to something like &amp;ldquo;imgur.com/removed&amp;rdquo;. Some URL shortener services are no longer around (like ping.fm), so for those entries crossposted using ping.fm, the contexts are forever lost. Some reposts What is archived here now represents a &amp;ldquo;best effort&amp;rdquo; at trying to reconstruct the original content as it was.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Permalink scheme. Given the link rot issue above, I needed to make sure I chose a reasonable permalink solution for the new content types, since I would want to avoid changing the permalinks in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deduplication. Since I had a lost of content cross-posted across different social media sites, I had to do some amount of duplicate detection. i.e. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want the same content to be posted under two separate entries, one from twitter and one from tumblr. This involved some rudimentary matching based on content and date posted. The matching was challenging since the date posted wouldn&amp;rsquo;t always be consistent across platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo performance and limitations. With all this data imported, the number of content pages shot up from around 1000+ to roughly 15,000+, pushing the Hugo static generation to its limits. Generation time shot up from &amp;lt; 10 seconds to &amp;lt; 2 minutes. For a while, it was even reaching as long as 5-10 minutes, forcing me to do some template optimization to keep the performance reasonable. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how much further I could optimize my templates; I tried switching to some other themes to see if they fared any better with this amount of content, but the generation times were generally in the same ballpark. Perhaps I will revisit this again in the future. I&amp;rsquo;m also starting to miss some features of dynamic sites, like the ability to create custom queries, something like &amp;ldquo;list all replies tagged #mtg&amp;rdquo;, which are proving difficult if not impossible to do with Hugo. There&amp;rsquo;s also that limitation on the homepage pagination I mentioned earlier. I do still like having the entire site be statically generated, perhaps in the future I will explore my options for more versatile lists and searches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll also discuss each import source a bit, and the particular challenges each one posed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/source/quora&#34;&gt;Quora&lt;/a&gt;: I had already been planning to stop using Quora since I spoke about it &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/12/quora/&#34;&gt;in a previous post&lt;/a&gt;. Since Quora has no concept of exporting a backup of your data, importing my Quora posts involved a little bit of JS console sorcery and a little bit of web scraping as well. I imported each answer I had as a post on this site. After this import, I expect to no longer be using Quora. I&amp;rsquo;ve also unsubscribed to all their summary emails. It&amp;rsquo;s too bad, there&amp;rsquo;s often some interesting content there, but more and more it feels like Experts Exchange.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/source/goodreads&#34;&gt;Goodreads&lt;/a&gt;: For a while I used to use Goodreads to track my reading and post book reviews. Although Goodreads did provide a data export, it was kind of barebones, and importing required a lot of manual work. Luckily, there weren&amp;rsquo;t that many entries to import. I imported all of the book reviews into this blog as posts, and any further reading I can just talk about on the blog directly. I do not expect to be using Goodreads again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/source/plurk&#34;&gt;Plurk&lt;/a&gt;: Plurk is an old social media site that I used around 2010-2011, mainly because a certain friend group of mine was very active there. Looks like everyone stopped using it around 2012-2013ish though. Their data export was very good, and I was able to import all the plurk content (most of it crossposted from twitter via ping.fm) and I included the plurk comments too. (Those comments were all public anyway.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/source/tumblr&#34;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;ve had the &lt;a href=&#34;https://tumblr.roytang.net&#34;&gt;tumblr blog&lt;/a&gt; since 2008! I enjoyed using the Tumblr account mainly because there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of memes there and there&amp;rsquo;s content I follow, but I realized a while back I could just follow them via RSS. All my tumblr blog content has been imported either as notes, links or reposts. I don&amp;rsquo;t expect to be using tumblr much moving forward, although I still like it as a syndication endpoint; I may eventually re-enable syndicating my content to tumblr. I also have a second (currently inactive) &lt;a href=&#34;https://ireadcomicbooks.tumblr.com/&#34;&gt;tumblr blog focused on comics&lt;/a&gt; that I have not yet imported, as the content there is primarily comic book covers and excerpts. I may do so in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/source/pocket&#34;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt;: I use Pocket mainly for link sharing, so all the stuff from Pocket gets imported as links. I still intend to use Pocket moving forward, and there is an active script that imports new links I&amp;rsquo;ve shared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/source/ireadcomicbooks&#34;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;: My blog was previously running on Wordpress before migrating to Hugo of course, so no importing of the original posts was necessary. I did, however run a short-lived comic-book focused Wordpress blog (a predecessor of the Tumblr) from 2012-2013 on the ireadcomicbooks.com domain (no longer active). I imported the posts and comments from that old blog into this one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/source/youtube&#34;&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt;: I imported a selection of videos uploaded to my Youtube channel, mostly game videos and sketch timelapses. That account also had some videos uploaded by my niece, but those are her content not mine, so they were not migrated into this blog. I expect to still occasionally use Youtube for video uploads (since it&amp;rsquo;s very convenient for general internet sharing), but very sporadically so I don&amp;rsquo;t have any automated migration set up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/source/flickr&#34;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;: I don&amp;rsquo;t use this much anymore, but I did have a few photos uploaded here, so they are now merged into this site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/source/roywantsmeat&#34;&gt;roywantsmeat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/source/royondjango&#34;&gt;royondjango&lt;/a&gt;: roywantsmeat was the blogger incarnation of this blog. &lt;a href=&#34;http://roywantsmeat.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s still up!&lt;/a&gt;. I mostly did this import to get syndication links since presumably all the posts from that blog had been imported to Wordpress and then to this blog. But that was not true! Apparently there were some missed posts, so some content gets to live again. &lt;a href=&#34;http://royondjango.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Roy on Django&lt;/a&gt; was a second short-lived blogger blog I had, focused on Python/Django, now the posts from their contain syndication links back to blogger as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/source/twitter&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;: Twitter is still my most actively used social media channel, so a whole bunch of tweets have been imported as notes, replies and reposts. A lot of the past content was cross-posted from other sites though. I have a script that actively imports new tweets as notes, replies and reposts. I also had a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/roy_mtg/&#34;&gt;second twitter account dedicated to mtg&lt;/a&gt;, tweets from that account have been imported as well. If you reply or like a tweet that points to one of my blog posts, they are also automatically imported as comments to that post. (This is not retroactive.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/source/instagram&#34;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;: Instagram was challenging to import. This was actually the first import I attempted. There was a data export, but the problem was it did not provide any way to derive the original instagram URL. For a while I researched on how the instagram slug was derived, thinking maybe it could be algorithmically determined. Eventually I gave up and looked for other means. Since there is currently no public API access, I had to use a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/realsirjoe/instagram-scraper&#34;&gt;scraper library&lt;/a&gt; to get the instagram URLs then used some matching algorithm to combine them with the data export, and voila I was able to import all the entries as photos. I still plan on using Instagram moving forward (primarily for sharing sketches), but currently there is no viable way to automatically import newer entries. I tried using &lt;a href=&#34;https://ownyourgram.com/&#34;&gt;OwnYourGram&lt;/a&gt; for a while, but that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aaronpk/OwnYourGram/issues/85&#34;&gt;ran into some trouble&lt;/a&gt; after some Instagram changes broke their scraping algorithm, so we&amp;rsquo;re stuck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/source/facebook&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;: Ah, this was the most challenging import of all. The challenges were (a) first, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want all of my FB content to be publicly available on this blog, so there was a lot of manual vetting/review that had to be done; and (b) Facebook&amp;rsquo;s data export (both JSON and HTML formats) did not make it easy to get the URL for any given post, I had to do some scraping to get the correct URLs; and (c) the data export wasn&amp;rsquo;t even very complete; among other things it didn&amp;rsquo;t include visibility settings (would have helped with the manual review) or the application used to post (would have helped with deduplication); and (d) the data model wasn&amp;rsquo;t straightforward, since a given URL could refer to a post, a photo album, a single photo, etc and some items wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even have a single canonical URL, multiple URLs could be pointing to the same thing. I actually ended up rewriting the import script completely (you can see in github I have an fb2.py) after I&amp;rsquo;d already imported some posts. While I will still be probably using FB moving forward (for sharing family photos mostly), I do not intend to import any further Facebook posts into this blog. (Any content which could be public will be cross-posted elsewhere instead)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you weren&amp;rsquo;t keeping track, moving forward I generally still intend to still be regularly using Twitter, Instagram, and sometimes Youtube, and somehow syndicate that content back to this site. In some future update, I will probably attempt to reverse this. That is, change it so that I post on this site, and the content automatically gets syndicated to Twitter/Instagram/etc as appropriate. This is &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/POSSE&#34;&gt;Indieweb POSSE principle&lt;/a&gt;, which makes a lot of sense, assuming I am able to overcome the technological hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, the archive is available for your perusal.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I have a GeForce 970, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit old, I got it in 2015. I&amp;rsquo;ve been having an issue where sometimes in some games, my displays (I have two monitors) will die (go completely black), but the game goes on running for a while (I can hear the audio), then after a couple of minutes or so the audio also stops so I can&amp;rsquo;t really do anything except do a hard reboot. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried VNCing into the PC to see what&amp;rsquo;s going on after this time, but it&amp;rsquo;s not accessible over the network so I assume it&amp;rsquo;s dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crashes happen most often while playing Magic Arena (says a lot about the game!), but I&amp;rsquo;ve also had it happen once or twice on Starcraft 2 and Borderlands 2. I don&amp;rsquo;t play very demanding games graphically. I can&amp;rsquo;t identify any specific action that causes the crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other things I&amp;rsquo;ve tried:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attach my 2nd monitor to onboard graphics, keeping the main monitor connected to the vidcard. In this case when the crash happens, the main monitor goes black, while the 2nd monitor still has a display, but is frozen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove my 2nd monitor (I thought I might be overtaxing the graphics card by having two of them??)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;checking for memory (RAM) issues. I did have some RAM issues a couple of months ago, but that turned up to be due to a dirty connector, and it was causing crashes not just in games but in general Windows usage, so I think this is a different issue now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;checking for disk issues. I actually found some bad sectors on my secondary drive and ended up replacing it. But even if I ran everything from my primary (SSD) drive, the graphics crashes still occur&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reinstalling/updating device drivers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;resetting Windows 10 (yup, I went that far)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all of these, I&amp;rsquo;m still encountering these crashes so I&amp;rsquo;m seriously considering replacing the graphics card now, but I&amp;rsquo;d like the be sure that it&amp;rsquo;s a graphics card issue and not something wonky with the motherboard, as my purchasing decisions will be different if the motherboard was the problem (I might as well get a new PC then). I&amp;rsquo;m looking for any advice to help me diagnose or confirm the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference, my current PC specs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Case	Silverstone Precision 10SST-PS10B&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fan	120mm internal aux fan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PSU	Cooler Master B600 V2 600W&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPU	Intel Core i5-4460&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MB	ASUS H97ME&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RAM	2x DDR3 Kingston HyperX Fury 8gb 1600&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VC	Asus GTX970 STRIX OC 4gb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSD	Samsung 850Evo 250gb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSHD  Seagate Firecuda 2tb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>2019 Windows Installation List
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/09/2019-windows-install-list/</link>
            <pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;So I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/09/two-backups/&#34;&gt;recently reinstalled Windows 10&lt;/a&gt;. This reminded me that there used to be a time that I reinstalled Windows so often that I would maintain a standard &amp;ldquo;installation list&amp;rdquo; of software that I would install afterwards. (I&amp;rsquo;m sure I have at least one of those old lists somewhere in my backups, too lazy to look for them now.). I thought I&amp;rsquo;d post an updated 2019 version, based on the recent episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; (web browser)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/sumatra-pdf/9pnjwv0hphzk?activetab=pivot:overviewtab&#34;&gt;Sumatra PDF&lt;/a&gt; (PDF reader via Windows store)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/&#34;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; (cloud storage)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-deskjet-3630-all-in-one-printer-series/7172306&#34;&gt;hp deskjet 3630 series&lt;/a&gt; (Printer/Scanner software)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.qbittorrent.org/&#34;&gt;QBitTorrent&lt;/a&gt; (torrent client)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena&#34;&gt;Magic Arena&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/&#34;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/?ref=other&#34;&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work/Prjects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;openvpn (needed for some clients/projects)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com/&#34;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/11/my-history-in-text-editors/&#34;&gt;text editor of choice&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chocolatey.org/&#34;&gt;chocolatey&lt;/a&gt; (package manager)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git (via chocolatey)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;python3 (via chocolatey)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;hugo&lt;/a&gt; (via chocolatey)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list is relatively short, compared to how it was back in the day. Of course, there are more work-related things I haven&amp;rsquo;t listed here, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure eventually I&amp;rsquo;ll have to install XAMPP (for webserver and mysql db), Node/NPM (because it&amp;rsquo;s everywhere in the industry these days) and possibly vagrant as well (for virtualization), but I can do those things on demand. These are the more immediate essentials. In the old days, I&amp;rsquo;d also be installing stuff like an image viewer, a media player, a file compression program, putty (for ssh), and so on, but with modern OSes all of those are largely unnecessary or can be replaced by cloud services so these days the list is significantly shorter.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>A Tale of Two Backups
</title>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Despite my desktop PC being generally more stable after the events of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/08/the-great-memory-scare-of-2019/&#34;&gt;Great Memory Scare of 2019&lt;/a&gt;, I was still encountering occasionally crashes when playing games. And by crash I mean the displays dying although the PC continues to run for a short while thereafter and after which they proceed to apparently stop operating completely. It only happens when playing games, and most often when playing Magic Arena and sometimes (rarely) when playing Starcraft 2 or Borderlands 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to try swapping out the video card just yet, and I had already tried doing all the driver updates during the previous episode, I decided it was time to try a more extreme approach. I was going to re-install Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say &amp;ldquo;extreme&amp;rdquo; even though reinstalling my OS is not something I wasn&amp;rsquo;t used to. Back in the days of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2007/12/today-is-a-good-day-to-nuke-your-xp-install/&#34;&gt;Windows XP&lt;/a&gt; I used to reinstall my OS multiple times in a year, if not in a month. It&amp;rsquo;s only unusual now because Windows 10 managed to go four whole years without giving me even a hint of a bluescreen or any sort of issue like this, so props to MS for improving the stability of their OS. That being said, running an OS over such a long period means a significant amount of cruft has probably been installed and uninstalled and reinstalled over the years, with most of the details long forgotten which leads to a sort of OS rot. So in any case, I figured a reset was due anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did the research first, and apparently Windows 10 provides the reset option itself, I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to make an install USB or anything like that. And the reset happens &amp;ldquo;in place&amp;rdquo;, theoretically without needing to reformat your partitions or displacing your user files, which was good. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t put much stock in theory, so of course for safety, I had to make a backup first. If I had needed to reset Windows 10 two weeks ago I would have been out of luck because I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have had any space to backup critical stuff. Luckily, there was a bit of coincidental foresight.&lt;/p&gt;


    On 
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/09/1172359392714358784/&#34;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&#34;2019-09-13 04:00:35&#34;&gt;13 Sep 2019 4:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    I wrote:
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I had been waffling on getting a new external HD for a while, but a couple of days ago one of my friends posted about her backup drive failing at 6yo and I was like &amp;ldquo;all my drives are older than that&amp;rdquo; lol&lt;/p&gt;

        






    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So around last week I purchased a 2TB Seagate Backup Plus, so I had a bunch of space available for backups. Now, there is a generally recognized backup rule where any critical data should be backed up using a &amp;ldquo;3-2-1&amp;rdquo; rule; that is: 3 different places, 2 different media types, and 1 offsite. This is a bit too much for a home-based setup where my critical backups consist mostly of documents, family photos, mail archives, old chat logs and such, so I figured having two copies of the stuff I wanted backed up would be sufficient. One copy would remain on my secondary HDD on the desktop, and a second copy on my new Backup Plus. (And yes, that means I was living without the second copy before, which spoiler alert for the end of this story, was very dangerous.) In theory for anything that I didn&amp;rsquo;t mind backing up to the cloud for privacy reasons, I already had a third copy there via Google Drive and/or Dropbox, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been too religious with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, backups created, we proceed with Operation Fresh Start:&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;20 minutes or longer&amp;rdquo; was pretty much a lie (or a programmer&amp;rsquo;s estimate, as you will), and it took more like half a day. But it went smoothly more or less. Afterwards I had to reinstall a bunch of software (more on that in the next post!). And then I tried using the PC for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my main purpose was to avoid the crashing, the first test was running Magic Arena. Sure enough, no crashes since the reset, all the games finished smoothly etc. Pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the bad news: I was getting terribly slow read/write times on my secondary 2TB HDD. At first I thought there was some ridiculousness with Windows Explorer or other background processes gumming up the worst, so I booted into Ubuntu (using a USB boot drive) to see if copying from the disk would be better there. (Side note: I miss having an Ubuntu desktop, but discretion is the better part of valor, so maybe I won&amp;rsquo;t try to dual-boot it just yet). Sadly, Ubuntu told me there were some 40,000+ bad sectors on the 2TB drive (!) which meant it was almost certainly failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily I had the foresight to do backups beforehand and got all the critical stuff. Or not. It turns out I forgot to archives a whole 20+ gigs of photos from my Mom&amp;rsquo;s old PC after that PC&amp;rsquo;s hard drive had died. And violating the backup rule, there was no other copy of those photos anywhere else!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secondary drive was still there, so my first instinct was to power through and try to copy them off that drive but this turned out to be impractical as it was taking forever. Then I remembered that before using the old PC (which she inherited from me after I bought this current one), my Mom had been using a small ASUS netbook whose display had died. I confirmed with her that all the photos from the PC had come from that netbook, and happily I was able to boot it up and connect it to an old VGA monitor so I could copy her files from there. It took the better part of a day, but I was able to save most of her files. Whew! I&amp;rsquo;m backing these up to her Google Photos account as soon as she remembers to give me her creds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the next problemw as what to do with my current desktop&amp;rsquo;s 2TB drive. A couple of consecutive chkdsk runs (both of which took more than a workday to finish) confirmed the worst: many bad sectors and many unreadable segments. It would certainly not be prudent to continue to use it, it had to be replaced. I considered just replacing with a 500GB SSD, but I needed the 2TB capacity. Not just for the critical stuff, but mostly for game installations as well and also I had been running a Plex media server off this desktop so there were a bunch of movies and TV series eps there. It was ok to lose them to a reformat, since most of them could be re-downloaded, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t go to a smaller capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked the idea of getting a second SSD though (to help with load times), so I considered getting both a 500GB SSD &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; a new 2TB HDD but this was a bit of an expensive option. Then I learned about the existence of so-called SSHDs or Solid State Hybrid Drives. Basically they&amp;rsquo;re normal HDDs except they come with a small SSD cache to boost read/write speeds for commonly-used files. Basically you&amp;rsquo;re getting something a bit faster than a normal HDD, but not with the capacity costs of a full-blown SSD. Not a bad idea, and I convinced myself to try it out. The 2TB Seagate Firecuda looked like a good SSHD to try out, and it was a quite a bit less expensive than my previous option of an SSD+an HD. I wanted to get one today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, all the shops I called didn&amp;rsquo;t have any in stock, so I went ahead and ordered one from Lazada (slightly pricier). I&amp;rsquo;m a bit wary about ordering electronics online, because of warranty issues and such. But what the heck, I should risk my money every so often. Purchased! Ordering online meant I&amp;rsquo;d have to wait a few days for the delivery, so until then I have to live only with my primary 250GB SSD. Luckily this is sufficent to play Magic Arena and SC2 and write on this blog and SSH to work servers etc. I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to install most Steam games or download videos and such until the new drive gets here though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am hopeful that the failing hard drive was the cause of my recent gaming crashes and that replacing it solves the issue. All of the offending games were previously installed on the 2TB secondary so it&amp;rsquo;s a decent hypotheses. Both Arena and SC2 have been behaving since I moved them to the SSD, so signs are good. That being said, this HDD failure combined with the previous episode is pretty much an indication that my PC is getting on with age. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping it will last me a few more years still, but that is more the optimist in me than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;backups good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gonna try out an SSHD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pc might be dying. Well, we&amp;rsquo;re all dying I guess&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I read this post: &lt;a href=&#34;https://victoria.dev/verbose/why-im-automatically-deleting-my-old-tweets-using-aws-lambda/&#34;&gt;Why I&amp;rsquo;m automatically deleting my old tweets using AWS Lambda&lt;/a&gt; where the justification for regularly deleting your old social media content is that they are no longer representative of the current version of you and thus can be misleading. This has certainly been the case when famous people&amp;rsquo;s older tweets resurface (James Gunn comes to mind).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To each his own and I kind of understand the intent, but this kind of thinking is a bit anathema to me. In fact, I tweeted this just a few days ago:&lt;/p&gt;


    On 
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/08/1166149784350027776/&#34;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&#34;2019-08-27 00:45:49&#34;&gt;27 Aug 2019 12:45am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    I wrote:

        &lt;p&gt;As a digital pack rat, it always annoys me when I remember how much of my own pre-cloud data I am no longer able to recover&lt;/p&gt;

        






    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I wrote the tweet above because I was annoyed that there was no more way to recover older things like chat logs from now-defunct messenger apps (Yahoo Messenger, ICQ, AIM) that I used back in the day. I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of the content there was inane and probably of no relevance to anyone other than me, but I wish I had found a way to archive them anyway. Unlike physical posessions which eat up space and can be problematic when sorting and arranging, digital archives are much cheaper to retain and easier to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think for me, the fact that my older social media posts reflect a past and possibly different version of me are a feature, not a bug. It means I can use social media to dig through my own history and as a supplement to memory, a sort of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/05/logs-and-memories-and-audit-trails/&#34;&gt;audit trail&lt;/a&gt; of my thoughts. I guess it is a tendency of that &amp;ldquo;pack rat&amp;rdquo; side of me. It may be unnecessary sentiment, but I find that as I grow older, the more I appreciate the ability to have artifacts of the past to look through.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;shogun&#34;&gt;Shogun&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a quote I like from &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/11/shogun-and-the-rest-of-james-clavells-asian-saga/&#34;&gt;James Clavell&amp;rsquo;s novel Shogun&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It&amp;rsquo;s a saying they have, that a man has a false heart in his mouth for the world to see, another in his breast to show to his special friends and his family, and the real one, the true one, the secret one, which is never known to anyone except to himself alone, hidden only God knows where.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel implies this was a Japanese saying, which may not be accurate, Clavell &lt;a href=&#34;https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/18973/question-about-supposedly-a-japanese-proverb&#34;&gt;probably based it on Jesuit writings from that era&lt;/a&gt;. That being said, I like this quote because I think it&amp;rsquo;s applicable to all people, not just the Japanese, especially in this modern age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unlimited-hearts&#34;&gt;Unlimited Hearts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often we are not even limited to three &amp;ldquo;hearts&amp;rdquo;. Other people can see and bear witness to your life, but they only see a sliver, a fraction of what it is to be you, and only what you choose to let them see. How other people experience you varies for each group. You have your set of high school friends, who know of your early days of hijinks, your work friends who know how you react to stress and how you unwind, your relatives who know how you are during the holidays in the face of family turmoil, and so on. None of them know the real you, not completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;true-heart&#34;&gt;True Heart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can&amp;rsquo;t be helped that the &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; version of each person is known only to that person alone. No one else lives the same life exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider myself. I write a lot about what&amp;rsquo;s going on in my life, whether through social media or through this blog. I strive to be open and honest and true in my dealings with other people, and I am almost always willing to offer up my thoughts without filter, if asked. But despite that, the picture I present to the world is still always incomplete. There are things I omit and things I hold back and things I don&amp;rsquo;t like to talk about. It&amp;rsquo;s something I have since learned to respect in other people as well, despite my inquisitive nature: to hold back when they obviously don&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Don&amp;rsquo;t worry I haven&amp;rsquo;t secretly committed any heinous crimes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;public-facing&#34;&gt;Public-facing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of this quote only because I was reading some discussion about private content on the internet. In general, if I post something on the internet, I don&amp;rsquo;t expect it to be private, not completely. Otherwise, why post it on the internet at all? Anything on the internet has the chance to be exposed later, one way or another, and we should be careful accordingly. And &amp;ldquo;on the internet&amp;rdquo; here isn&amp;rsquo;t even limited to websites and blogs and social media. &amp;ldquo;Private&amp;rdquo; communications are a weak point too, as anyone can capture a screenshot anytime. If you want to keep secrets, then don&amp;rsquo;t put them on a network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three can keep a secret if two of them are dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;black-mirror&#34;&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a Black Mirror episode where the personality of a human who passed away is recreated based on his social media postings and what not. Because of the nature of humans, I don&amp;rsquo;t believe this process can ever be 100% accurate. What you will get is a shadow of the original human, an approximation of who he chose to present himself as. His true self will have been forever lost.&lt;/p&gt;
