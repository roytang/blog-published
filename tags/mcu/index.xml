            &lt;p&gt;We finally return to the MCU films, a full two years after the &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/07/spider-man-far-from-home/&#34;&gt;last film&lt;/a&gt; was released! Breaking a decade-long tradition, I am unable to watch it in theaters this time (and probably won&amp;rsquo;t get to watch any of the others this year in theaters either), but at least we are moving forward now, onto the next phase!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler-free review first, then spoilery bits follow afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;incredibly good as an action movie, great fight sequences and set pieces and chases etc. Felt like I was watching something from Mission Impossible or James Bond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fairly stand-alone, though some knowledge of what happened in &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2016/04/10154562419893912/&#34;&gt;Captain America: Civil War&lt;/a&gt; would give context to where Nat is at the start of the film&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pacing is good, alternating between character moments and action sequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;terrific performances by Florence Pugh and David Harbour, hope to see both again in the MCU at some point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a bit of humor sprinkled in there, mostly via Florence and David&amp;rsquo;s characters, but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely not the funniest MCU movie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;happy to see Natasha getting her own solo movie and get some development outside of the ensemble casts, though I wish it could have happened sooner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is one post-credits scene, at the very end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magugustuhan ba ni Mama? Possibly! She occasionally enjoys action movies. The themes are very family-focused, despite all the violence. She would probably ask a lot of questions though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid 4/5 for me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall a decent start to phase four. Looking forward to the other films this year, maybe by some miracle I&amp;rsquo;ll get to watch them in the theaters!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;##########################&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;### Spoilery bits follow&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;###&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;###&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;###&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;###&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;### Spoilery bits follow&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;###&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;###&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;###&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;###&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;### Spoilery bits follow&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;###&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;###&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;###&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;###&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;### Spoilery bits follow&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;##########################&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitpicks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is Nat a super soldier now? I mean, she survives a car exploding and tumbling in midair, and also a fall from several stories high where she bumps her head a couple of times along the way. She basically just gets up and shrugs it all off, it&amp;rsquo;s helluva plot armor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taskmaster fight sequences were great, but the character was severely underused, and the actress really got off easy I think?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the scene at the end with Nat not wanting to leave with the others &lt;strong&gt;on a plane&lt;/strong&gt; even while Ross and his men are still a ways away seems ridiculous, and the cut to &amp;ldquo;2 weeks later&amp;rdquo; leaves much to be desired; some people on Reddit claim there was probably a scene where she made a deal with Ross but the scene was cut; regardless, it&amp;rsquo;s an annoying discontinuity in the theatrical cut&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wish they could have managed one or two more fanservice cameos, and not just Valentina in the post-credits scene. Like, I would have wanted to have Chris Evans&amp;rsquo; Cap meet up with Nat in the &amp;ldquo;2 weeks after&amp;rdquo; scene so they go break out their friends together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than the above, I don&amp;rsquo;t seem to have any complaints about the main plot itself. I watched very few trailers and didn&amp;rsquo;t have any real idea about the other characters like Red Guardian or Yelena, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any expectations to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole &amp;ldquo;family&amp;rdquo; theme reminded me of the recent Fast and Furious memes about family lol.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;First, the spoiler-free review, then more spoilery stuff afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I watched Far From Home while I was&amp;hellip; far from home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;great movie, lots of fun, and the stakes are a lot higher than the Vulture just stealing some tech off Tony Stark&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;basically a story of Peter Parker the high school student trying to juggle his Spider-Man problems with his high school life, which was one of the best eras of comic book Spider-Man&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the movie gives us a look at what the world looks like post-Endgame and how weird it is for everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you&amp;rsquo;ve seen the trailers, you know who the &amp;ldquo;villain&amp;rdquo; is and you have certain expectations coming in. I was worried this would be a problem but it worked out fine, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a problem and was handled well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a mid-credits scene, possibly one of the best I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen, in terms of how it changes the entire tone of the movie. There is also a post-credits scene, the implications of which are still unclear and will leave the fanbase speculating for a while&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Possibly! There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of &amp;ldquo;cute&amp;rdquo; Peter Parker high school moments she&amp;rsquo;d probably like, and the plot and action aren&amp;rsquo;t too hard to follow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoilery stuff follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how could Midtown High afford to send their trivia team on a trip through Europe? Is this typical of American high schools?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As mentioned above, anyone even remotely familiar with Spider-Man lore wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised at the reveal that Mysterio is actually a villain. This is one of those times where there would have been some advantage to not knowing stuff ahead of time, as you get to enjoy the reveal. That being said, Mysterio&amp;rsquo;s villain monologue after getting the EDITH glasses may be one of the best I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. Since I already knew Mysterio was a bad guy, the only realy mystery was HOW he was doing these destructive elementals since they obviously weren&amp;rsquo;t the simple light-and-sound shows that comics Mysterio was known for. Tying the illusions to the BARF holograms and even re-using side characters from previous movies was an inspired choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the rest of the movie&amp;rsquo;s plot was fairly predictable, but the MCU continues to subvert the expectations of Spider-Man fans since both Peter Parker and the supporting cast are completely different from the comicbook incarnations, powers notwithstanding. I assume they planned as far back as Homecoming that Tony would be dying in Endgame and Peter would be pressured to take the mantle, setting Tony up as his father figure instead of the mythical Uncle Ben. Zendaya&amp;rsquo;s MJ is completely different from the comics&amp;rsquo; Mary Jane &amp;ldquo;Hey tiger&amp;rdquo; Watson; Flash is a nerd like Peter instead of a footballer; Ned isn&amp;rsquo;t even based on a Peter supporting character but on a Miles supporting character, and so on. This is basically a completely different version of Peter&amp;rsquo;s HS life and it&amp;rsquo;s great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that first Mysterio vs Spider-Man scene was great, evocative of the comic book version and even Arkham Asylum&amp;rsquo;s Scarecrow sequences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the whole Peter/MJ/Brad Davis subplot gives the movie a bit of a &amp;ldquo;John Hughes&amp;rdquo; vibe and there are some cute moments and MJ really holds her own; I think this movie handles the whole &amp;ldquo;dual identity problems&amp;rdquo; aspect of Spider-man better than Homecoming did&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that webswinging sequence at the end of the movie was great, has the same feel as the PS4 game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the midcredits scene completely changes the tone of the ending of course. But first, we must acknowledge the awesome return of the one true J. Jonah Jameson, JK Simmons! The unmasking is a problem, and how will they handle it? Will Peter and May have to go into hiding at an Avengers facility? Will the bad guys come after them? WIll Peter have to make a deal with Mephisto to protect his secret in exchange for getting the worst prom ever with MJ? Or will they go some other route like have one of the Skrulls pose as Peter and appear together with Spider-man? The great thing about MCU Spider-Man is that because the setup is completely different, they&amp;rsquo;re not beholden to the comic book plots (neither Homecoming nor Far From Home are based on actual comic stories AFAIK). This ending also mirrors Homecoming&amp;rsquo;s unmasking in front of Aunt May, so my guess is that they&amp;rsquo;ll handle this cliffhanger the same way - completely off screen and we just see the repurcussions in the next movie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the final postcredits scene will have fans speculating for a while, but it looks like Fury is busy setting up SWORD? Or could it be something else?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great movie, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to Marvel hopefully announcing their Phase 4 plans at SDCC later this month!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Two endgames to discuss in one post! MTG War of the Spark and Avengers Endgame spoilers ahoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endgame #1: War of the Spark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#cdb655624b3cf2a4e1e4d7428d798e2a-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/04/were-in-the-endgames-now/endgame_huf808040a75b6fb5c1e9efb3608d00058_168404_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;cdb655624b3cf2a4e1e4d7428d798e2a-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/04/were-in-the-endgames-now/endgame.jpg&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;27 Apr 2019 5:56am&#34;&gt;27 Apr 2019 5:56am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest Magic set has been a home run in terms of lore and flavor and storytelling, bringing the last three years worth of MTG lore to its conclusion as the villainous dragon planeswalker Nicol Bolas aims to complete his plan to achieve omnipotence over the multiverse. The set is packed with planeswalkers summoned to Ravnica by Bolas&amp;rsquo;s schemes, which means mechanically that a lot of new planeswalker design space is being explored. The spoiler season was well-executed (despite some leaks during the last week), allowing us to see the story unfolding through the cards in a clearer way than ever before: from the dreadhorde invasion of Ravnica, the counterattack by the guilds, the arrival of the Amonkhet God-Eternals, and the death and betrayal that soon followed. It remains to be seen what impact the set will have on the gameplay and the meta, but from lore and flavor alone it&amp;rsquo;s already a win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endgame #2: Avengers Endgame&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the spoiler-free review (mirrored from &lt;a href=&#34;https://tumblr.roytang.net/post/184473737480/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review&#34;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, I figured there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to publish there exclusively):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avengers: Endgame spoiler-free review!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I watched Endgame exactly 365 days after watching Infinity War! (And also 3 years to the day after watching Civil War)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I approve of this movie as a fitting end to the last decade of Marvel films. This is a slam dunk ending. They could end it here, with no additional MCU movies/shows coming out and that would be completely fine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I approve of how little information about the movie managed to leak, I approve of the trailers and the marketing campaign: just enough to get hyped but nothing too spoilery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a lot to unpack, but its impossible to cover anything without getting into spoilers, but I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with the movie and the fan service, especially as a comic book fan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the plot starts out slow and moves quickly at the end. If you have to pee, better to do it sometime during the first hour; I found myself holding my pee for the last hour of the movie and not wanting to miss anything, it was not pleasant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imax was fine, but without probably also would have been fine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is supposedly no post-credits, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know as I couldn&amp;rsquo;t hold it much longer and left mid-credits. The first half of the credits was nice though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: No, same issue as Infinity War, too many characters to follow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re going to earn a bajillion dollars with this one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoilers follow:

&lt;details class=&#34;spoiler&#34;&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;(Spoilers)&lt;/summary&gt;
    There are some timey-wimey concerns, but nothing a bunch of nerds wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to rationalize quickly. So much to unpack here, so many easter eggs and fan service: Widow&amp;rsquo;s death, Fat Thor, Smart Hulk, revisiting several previous movies, Steve wielding Mjolnir, Steve and Peggy&amp;rsquo;s last dance, Pepper rocking the Rescue armor, the Tony Stark final sacrifice and sendoff, all the cameos from previously lost characters and villains (did they actually get Natalie Portman to shoot new footage?!?), and finally that scene where when all hope was lost, I was wondering what deus ex machine they would use to get out of the situation, and when Sam made contact I was like, that&amp;rsquo;s right, everyone&amp;rsquo;s back, then we get all the Avengers, Wakandans, Asgardians, Sanctorum dudes, etc and Cap going &amp;ldquo;Avengers Assemble!&amp;rdquo; (Hey, wheren&amp;rsquo;t they already assembled?!?)
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worth the wait, very happy with the movie, and even tempted to watch it one more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is of course a third endgame that kicked off in April, and that&amp;rsquo;s Game of Thrones, but it&amp;rsquo;s not yet done, so I&amp;rsquo;ll cover that another time.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;movie was pretty good, no major issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doesnt follow the typical MCU origin story ‘formula’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some weird pacing issues in a few places, but that just might be because of the chosen story direction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lots of little call-outs and tie-ins to the other MCU movies (although I feel like they could have done a bit more in some spots)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am not a cat person. But if you are a cat person, you might like this: there is a cat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s some parts that made it obvious they were aiming for that Wonder Woman audience, so the movie may be better for you if you’re in that demo (but I think WW was a better movie overall)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imax was pretty good, nothing too excessive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Midcredits scene, and postcredits scene&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magugustuhan ba ni mama? Possibly! Also, its a good idea to bring little girls to watch this movie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Ant-Man and the Wasp Spoiler Free Review!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this movie is great; it&amp;rsquo;s fun and and action-packed and there&amp;rsquo;s even more Luis than you thought you wanted; go watch it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s like the first movie, except better and more fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;best new character: FBI Agent Jimmy Woo played by Randall Park (sorry Michelle Pfeifer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are two mid/post-credit scenes. One of them is better than the other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I watched in Imax. Some scenes were nice, but it&amp;rsquo;s probably more of a nice-to-have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Pwede, but kelangan ng kasama to explain things. Baka ok lang pag tagalized na sa tv&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Avengers Infinity War Spoiler Free Review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m amazed that so little of this movie has been widely spoiled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;movie was fantastic. the movie somehow managed to do everything it needed to do while not doing disservice to any of the bazillion characters involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the plot moves quickly. there is no good time to pee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is one post-credits scene.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very happy to have watched in imax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;BLACK PANTHER spoiler-free review!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s a fun, action-filled romp and Wakanda is amazing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tchalla was ok, killmonger and nakia were great, shuri was badass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some of the actions scenes didnt seem too well-shot/edited, making them hard to follow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I realize I&amp;rsquo;m saying this about a universe where there are talking raccoons and magic hammers, but some of the Wakandan tech push the boundaries of my suspension of disbelief&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my expectations were probably set a bit too high what with some people saying it&amp;rsquo;s the best MCU movie since Iron Man or calling it revolutionary or eye-opening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;off the top of my head I&amp;rsquo;d say I consider Civil War, Spider-Man Homecoming and Thor Ragnarok better than this one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I understand that it&amp;rsquo;s revolutionary in the sense that it&amp;rsquo;s a major hollowood motion picture filled with a cast of mostly african descent and that some of the characters are motivated by real world racial issues. But the plot itself was typical for an MCU first movie (maybe I&amp;rsquo;ve seen too many MCU movies? lol). I dont think it presents the issues it covers under any new or revolutionary context. I guess I kind of went in hoping to be impressed on the level of The Dark Knight or such, but I was disappointed in that regard. It&amp;rsquo;s a very straightforward movie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t watch in Imax, which I kind of regret, as I can imagine some of the scenes being pretty good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Possibly, pero baka mahirapan sya intindihin accent ni Chadwick Boseman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a mid-credits scene and a post-credits scene&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
