My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1552013302&#34;&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2016 Book #9: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The book starts off with a lot of action before settling into a phase where the three protagonists wander around a lot and sleep in tents and finally into a big showdown at Hogwarts with virtually every character in the series showing up for one big brawl. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to read, but I&amp;rsquo;d love to see it in the film too (soon!). I&amp;rsquo;m a bit ambivalent about how Severus Snape was handled, with the author basically treating him as a bad guy the entire series only to flip him at the last minute. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that Alan Rickman died before I finished the series - before Alan Rickman&amp;rsquo;s death I was unaware that Snape was a beloved character and being aware meant I knew he had to do a face turn at some point. The ending was satisfying enough, pretty good for a fantasy series actually; but I would&amp;rsquo;ve hoped for more details on what happened to the rest of the cast nineteen years later. We basically only got endings for Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione and Draco. Overall the series was pretty good, and covered some ground I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have expected for a children&amp;rsquo;s/young adult series.

2016 Book #8: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Someone had already spoiled me ahead of time about the death at the end of this book, although I hadn&amp;rsquo;t known when it would happen. But it started to become obvious as the book went on, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too surprised by the end. This book fleshes out the back story of the series&amp;rsquo; villain Voldemort and finally tries to make Draco Malfoy do something of consequence. The book feels a lot like Empire Strikes Back with the young protagonist learning more about the villain and the bad guys finally dealing a heavy blow. One more book to go!

This is a long book, roughly three times as long as the first Harry Potter book was. That wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so bad if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t so painful to read. Harry here is like a completely different character compared to the previous books, he&amp;rsquo;s irritable and whiny and keeps worrying about how other people aren&amp;rsquo;t treating him well. It&amp;rsquo;s not really teenage angst (since Ron and Hermione seem fine), but rather the character&amp;rsquo;s response to the end of the last book. I hope he&amp;rsquo;s less so in the last two books. Dolores Umbridge made for a great villain here.

The series started off a with rather straightforward stories that made obvious that JK Rowling was new to this business at the time, but Prisoner of Azkaban kicks off the world-building to a larger degree. Many elements of the world are expanded upon and added to and by now we get a better sense of the sort of wonders the world of Harry Potter represents. The plot is starting to get more complex, with more Chekov&amp;rsquo;s gun-type elements firing off as the story spins its plot twists near the book&amp;rsquo;s conclusion. It&amp;rsquo;s easily my favorite book of the series so far

I had next to no Harry Potter knowledge before reading this book, save what I read in passing on the internets. Yup, I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the movies either. Finished reading this in under 3 hours; I had been told ahead of time that it was a light read and that I can confirm. A welcome respite from the last book I read, this book has a straightforward plot, nothing too deep here, it&amp;rsquo;s very much meant for kids/young adults. In fact it reminds me of one of those Hardy Boys books I used to read when I was young, except with a lot more dragons. I wonder what age I can encourage my niece to read this&amp;hellip;
