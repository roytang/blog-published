            &lt;p&gt;Just watched the series finale of Star Trek Voyager, finally those crazy nerds managed to get home! I came into the series with low expectations given its reputation, but I think it was pretty ok overall. There were some pretty ridiculous episodes here and there, but even the much-revered TNG suffered from that. Janeway made some questionable decisions throughout the series, but arguably they were faced with a different set of quandaries than the crew of TNG or DS9. I feel like Voyager also had way more time travel episodes than either TNG or DS9 for some reason.  Best character: The Doctor, although he&amp;rsquo;s kind of a deus-ex-machina too, especially once he gets that mobile emitter &amp;ldquo;Oh, don&amp;rsquo;t worry I can do that super dangerous thing because I&amp;rsquo;m a hologram!&amp;rdquo;. Seven of Nine a close second, I was mildly annoyed with the character as first introduced, but she was developed well as the series went along.  Worst character: Chakotay. Ugh, I cringe whenever there&amp;rsquo;s one of his &amp;ldquo;Space Indian&amp;rdquo; episodes. He didn&amp;rsquo;t even do anything in the series finale except be a love interest for Seven of Nine&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Star Trek Voyager: Apparently Tuvok is a full-blood Vulcan. But AFAIK there are no black Vulcans anywhere else in Star Trek. Is this ever explained? I&amp;rsquo;m only in season two lol&lt;/p&gt;
