            &lt;p&gt;I have a 320GB western digital external HDD that was working fine a couple of days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plugged it into my Windows XP machine at work, and it detects the USB device (it is listed in the Safely Remove Hardware dialog), but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t detect the disk, not even under Disk Management in Control Panel. I&amp;rsquo;ve successfully used this ext HD on this machine before, so I suspect it is busted. I tried it on a couple of other machines none of them could detect the disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only possible reason I could think of is that the bag I was carrying it in fell to the floor off a table a couple of days ago, it might have been damaged then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously I would like to have the device working again, but failing that I would like to be able tor recover all the data on the disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are my options?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: In case it&amp;rsquo;s relevant, the product page for the ext HD is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.asp?driveid=698&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
