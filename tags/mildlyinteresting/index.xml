            &lt;p&gt;And yet we still have homework even to this day! What an ineffective president!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;TIL there are cars that do have heaters. Seems totally obvious but I&amp;rsquo;ve never had to think about it&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;When I was a kid (like 6 or 7), we had a bag that had a face and it was often hung up on a hook on the wall right in front of my bed and I spent many a sleepless night worrying about how it was staring at me.&lt;/p&gt;
