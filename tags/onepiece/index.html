<p>Can you tell me if the story in the game follows canon storylines? Or they made their own story for the game?</p>

<p>Does the story mode cover the entire One Piece manga run? Or just select parts? Or it&rsquo;s an original story?</p>
<p>Also, do you think it would it be better to buy OP:PW (I can probably find a used one somewhere for cheap), or wait for OP:PW2 (being released later this year)?</p>
