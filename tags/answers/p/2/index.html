<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Even if I lost everything today, I’d still have my own confidence and skill sets to fall back on. So I’d probably still be able to find a job, maybe even freelance or something. If I need housing, I’d probably look for a friend to put me up temporarily while I look for a place. I’m very low maintenance so I can survive on a small amount of resources until I can save up</p></span></p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It depends on what you mean by “moderately simple” and “without knowing programming”. If you only need to be build a simple CRUD website with no special logic of any sort, some frameworks such as RoR or Django have code generators that can automate all of that for you, but you have to provide the data structure first, which you’ll need to write in code, so it involves a “little” programming. If even that is too much for you, you can build some simple forms using online tools similar to Google Forms to capture input from users.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Anything more complicated than simple forms to capture data will probably require programming</p></span></p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Seriously? Determination of guilt or innocence isn’t a purely computational matter. There are no algorithms that can compute guilt. Adding to the complication are varying intricacies of law in different jurisdictions. If humans don’t know how to get it right, then we can’t program computers to do so either.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Arguably, we could build programs that learn to make such judgments, but in order for such programs to work we would need more data to train them. A lot of data, given the impossibly large number of possible ways that a crime can be committed. Way, way more data than we have criminal cases worldwide. We are probably two or three generations away from such a thing being even conceivably possible.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Despite what many might say, people can change. That is, people’s interests and passions can change. It’s not right or wrong, it’s just being human. The key is to keep living your life proactively. If you feel like the passion in your work is waning, think of what used to excite you about it and see if you can recapture that excitement. Or try to identify whether the problem is with the work you’re doing or the company you’re working for. Perhaps working for a different company or in a different environment might reingite the spark. Explore your options.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">At the same time, explore your options in other areas as well. It’s good that you tried taking courses about something, but if you find it doesn’t hold your interest very well, don’t be afraid to try other things. Be open to new opportunities or new areas to expand your character or your interests.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Living life is pretty much a game of exploration. You try things out and see if they make you happy, then you keep doing those that make you happy until they don’t. Then either you try to make it better or you search for other things to make you happy.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Good luck!</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I thought about answering this with some of the products I helped develop in the past, but as I was writing it I realized that “regret” was the wrong word to choose. There were a lot of mistakes made during design and implementation that ultimately led to the failure of those products, and I suppose the company might regret spending time and effort and money on those products, but for me personally I learned a lot from them, especially on what kind of mistakes to avoid in the future</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I think the only way I could say I regret making a product would be if it were something that ultimately turned out to be harmful to other people, i.e. something that might have caused injury or harm</p></span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-identify-a-good-programmer-Do-I-start-learning-how-to-code-so-it-is-easily-identifiable/answer/Roy-Tang">How do I identify a good programmer? Do I start learning how to code so it is easily identifiable?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Learning to code is not strictly necessary. It would be sufficient to simply have an understanding of how programs execute step-by-step instructions and algorithms. If you’re interviewing programmers, you can simply give them a moderately complex problem and ask them to verbally walk through / explain to you how they would approach the problem (you yourself would need to understand how the problem is typically solved). Sorting algorithms for example, can easily be explained with a few whiteboard diagrams instead of writing code</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The larger problem is that it is never easy to identify a good programmer. Even for people who do know how to code! The best way to identify a good programmer is actually to work with them on a project, but of course that option is unlikely during an interview. In general look for high-level skills: ability to step through the solution to a problem (and explain it well), ability to spot possible problems in a given solution (you might try describing a problem you encountered in a previous project and ask how he would address it), ability to work well with others, etc</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">This is something that often comes up in science fiction.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Think about the scenario where you are stranded in a foreign country where nobody speaks your language. How would you communicate with the locals? You would look for common signals or signs that they would interpret the same way. For example, if you were thirsty, you would mime drinking from a glass and hope that they get the message. If they don’t understand you would need to try different signs or words and hope that they recognize one of them</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Any contact with extraterrestrial intelligence would likely proceed the same way. We have no guarantee of what medium of communication they would use (it is possible they do not use visuals or sounds, but instead through some sort of E-M radiation), so we would have to try all sorts of things to see what they would recognize. Obviously we can’t send out signals in English or such as this would be meaningless to them. One possibility is to use a universally recognizable language - mathematics. We can transmit recognizable mathematical patterns or sequences to establish that we are an intelligent species capable of communication. If we are lucky enough that the alien species can understand visual signals we can show them images to try to explain what we mean, then use a secondary medium such as sound to try to establish our language.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">In effect we would have to spend effort to learn how to communicate with each other, largely through trial and error until a reasonable approach can be found. It’s not too different from the usual scientific method approach</p></span></p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The technology stack certainly isn’t very relevant unless you are hiring for a position where you cannot avoid the additional spin-up time of someone having to pick up your technology stack. For very good developers, the spin-up time will be very low, on the order of 1–2 days or maybe a matter of hours, so it’s unlikely that the technology stack is super relevant.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The two things to look out for are personality (whether the person can work well with your culture or with a team; whether he can communicate well; whether he can be trusted to work independently with minimal guidance; etc) and general technical skill (how easy it is for him to pick up new technologies, assess technical options, etc.). Both of these can be difficult to interview for though</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">You should start with Servlets and JSP as these are the basic building block technologies. For people new to Java web development I always recommend the book Head First Servlets and JSPs, as it builds up from these base technologies and moves towards establishing something similar to an MVC framework like Spring</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">As a computer science teacher, you really shouldn’t give this kind of an exam. It’s in no way reflective of how code is written in the real world</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If you must have an exam of this sort, you should focus on making sure the algorithm used in the code is conceptually correct, and disregard any problems in syntax that may fail a compiler. In fact, it’s probably better to have the students submit their answers in some sort of pseudocode or other informal format instead of actual program code, so they know not to focus on syntax</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">There is no need to feel guilty about your background, that’s not really something under your control or something you can change.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Being close-minded however, you can do something about that. While you may never fully understand their situation, that shouldn’t stop you from being able to empathize with them. Spend some time with people worse off than you, treat them to a meal every so often, listen to their stories, see what you can do for them.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">There is great inequality in this world. It’s something we may never be able to eradicate. But that shouldn’t stop us from trying, from reaching out to one another and trying to connect, even with those who live different lives than us</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">First, it isn’t necessary for you as a programmer to know these things</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Second, do you have a computer of your own? I’ve had and maintained my own computer for almost two decades now, so most of my knowledge of how computers work comes with that experience. I’ve encountered a lot of problems and researched how to fix each one so I have a good idea of how computers work and what fixes are available to common problems. Having your own computer for personal use (not just the one at work) will help a lot. Desktops are better than laptops, since they are more easily customisable</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Third, if you don’t already have a computer, build one yourself. Or even if you already have one, either build a second one for yourself and help a friend build one. And by “build” I don’t mean buying one fully assembled already; I mean buying each part individually and putting it together yourself. That means researching what parts are needed and what will serve your needs best and what will be compatible and canvassing for the best prices and finally sitting down and opening all the boxes and putting it all together. I’ve put together five different desktop builds over the past twenty years myself</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The best way to learn is to actually participate in an enterprise application project. You won’t get everything you need from a book, particularly things on how to work well and communicate well with a team. That being said, I would suggest reading the following books:</p><ul><li><i>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</i> by The Gang of Four</li><li>Refactoring by Martin Fowler</li><li>The Pragmatic Programmer by Andy Hunt and David Thomas</li><li>Peopleware - Productive Projects and Teams by Lister and DeMarco</li><li>Rapid Development by Steve McConnell</li></ul><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">That should give you a relatively good/balanced foundation to build on</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It’s almost certainly market-driven. While the core, long-time gamers are used to having single-player campaigns to enjoy on their own, the mass market is more focused on multiplayer, both offline and online, so we will continue to find many of the bigger AAA releases deciding to focus less resources on single-player stuff</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It’s a bit like how some people are scared of math. It’s hard and it looks arcane and exact and unforgiving and if you don’t understand it too well it’s easy to get lost and have no idea what’s going on.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Sometimes it’s just a matter of presentation though. Maybe those people were first exposed to programming in a difficult way, focusing more on syntax and other arcane things instead of programming as a way of thinking and stepping through problems. Math has this same problem too!</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The difference between front-end and back-end is on which side executes the relevant code. HTML, JS and CSS are all interpreted, rendered, and in the case of JS, executed by the client browser. These parts are the front-end. The code for those parts is basically meaningless to the server. The server program looks at these parts and only sees simple text and just sends it through to the browser (or whatever client program made the request)</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">For example in a *.php file, anything outside the &lt;?php ?&gt; brackets is not interpreted by the PHP runtime, they are just returned to the browser as-is. The server does not “load the HTML for the user”, it simply returns the HTML code to the browser and the browser loads that HTML and displays the rendered HTML.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Well, first you have to have a better of idea of what the “something” you want to do is. It doesn’t have to be super detailed or anything, just a direction you want to go. Then list down whatever small steps you need to do to take you down that road. You don’t need to figure out a complete roadmap, just something to get you started. And if you can’t figure out what steps there are, then that’s one of your first steps. After that, it’s like walking - you simply take one step after the next.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I don’t know what it is you plan or want to do, but here are some general ideas for next steps:</p><ul><li>look for a mentor. Look for people who have walked the path you have chosen or are already experts in the chosen field. Contact them and ask for advice. There’s a good chance they will decline, but some or a few may have a few small pieces of advice as to how you can start</li><li>talk to your family and your friends about what you want to do. Even if they don’t have direct knowledge of the area, they may be able to suggest ways for you to move forward or have contacts that can give you advise</li><li>read! Try to spend each day learning a bit more about what path you want to take and what you would need to get there</li><li>if you’re planning to start your own business, try to find out what are the specific legal requirements in your area to be able to do so. The admin staff at your office may be able to help you with this</li></ul><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Good luck!</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I suspect that in the long run this will be one of those things that doesn’t matter and it will turn out that either before or after works. I would guess that Nick Spencer is writing his first story arc independently of Civil War II. Besides, the focus of CWII is on Tony Stark and Carol Danvers, apparently Steve Rogers doesn’t have that big a role</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Playing against better people forces you to improve faster. But at the same time, if there is too large a gap in skill level, you may not be learning too much because what they’re doing may be too far above your skill level. Losing too much due to the skill gap will also increase frustration which will dampen your learning as well</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">There is a sweet spot where you are playing against people who are slightly better than you such that you still have a small chance of winning and at the same time you are still able to effectively learn and sharpen your skills.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Playing against others of the same skill level can also still help - but instead of learning new skills or techniques, the practice will help develop and reinforce the basics of your execution.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">No. Web tutorials will only teach you the basics. Most probably you just need to learn how to implement form-based screens that do simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Your “complex inventory management system” can be built upon those basics, and most probably will have specific requirements that web tutorials can’t cover. You’ll need to learn how to do the parts of it individually and put it all together.</p></span></p>

We aren&rsquo;t poor. He tells me this makes him feel a low priority. Is this justified?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Well, the first thing to ask yourself is: do you like hanging out with him? If not, the way forward should be clear.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The second thing to ask yourself is: why are you so scared of spending money? This can happen if you grew up in a poorer family and are used to scrimping and saving, or it may simply be that your level of saving is justified and it’s your partner that has a problem because he is spending too much.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The third thing is: since you prefer staying at home you are likely an introvert. If you want to be with your partner, you should also learn how to care for an introvert. At the same time, you can ask him to be more considerate of your needs as an introvert.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Sit down with your partner and talk through these issues with him. One thing I can suggest is if the two of you decide together to allocate a budget, say a monthly budget, for “going out” activities, at a level you’re comfortable with so you don’t spend too much money. Discuss also the difference in the activities you prefer. Maybe you can agree to go out at most X times a month or a week, and he can agree to spend Y days a week at home with you, and maybe even have some days for the two of you to do things separately. Compromise on the activities you both can do together: “Okay, we’ll go out this often, but can we also spend some nights staying in and doing [activity you like]?”</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Good luck!</p></span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/I-always-have-a-hard-time-talking-to-people-I-dont-know-I-hate-myself-because-of-this-and-its-really-hard-to-accept-who-I-am-How-can-I-improve-my-people-skills/answer/Roy-Tang">I always have a hard time talking to people I don&rsquo;t know. I hate myself because of this and it&rsquo;s really hard to accept who I am. How can I improve my people skills?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Whenever I see a question like “How can I improve [skill]”, there is almost always one obvious answer: practice. Improvement only comes with practice. You can read about it, think about it, watch youtube videos, but unless you practice you won’t be improving much.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">For talking to people, start small and work your way up:</p><ul><li>Smile at strangers you interact with. Smile at the lovely couple walking down the street. Smile at the little kids you give the ball back to.</li><li>Greet strangers as often as you can. Greet the cashier at the grocery or the bus driver during your commute. Say something short and simple “Hey, how’s your day going?”</li><li>When you see a stranger carrying or wearing something you find of interest, strike up a conversation about it. “Hey, I love that scarf, where’d you get it?”, “How are you finding that book? I read it last month and found it great!</li><li>And so on</li></ul><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">At first you will find it difficult. You might even choke on what you wanted to say or say something completely inappropriate and run away. That’s fine. Failing and trying again is what practice it. Don’t worry so much about how people will react. If it’s someone you might see again (say, the cashier at the grocery or the bus driver), it gives you something to talk about again next time “Hey, sorry if I was an idiot before. I’m trying to be better at talking to people” can lead to good conversations too.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">As soon as you become aware you’re stuck is a pretty good time in my opinion. If you already know you’re stuck and not going to move forward, why put it off? Sometimes a couple of minutes with a fresh set of eyes is all it takes to get some progress, so it makes no sense to hold off until you are truly desperate. That being said, be sure not to interrupt your colleagues when they are in the flow!</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Sometimes you don’t even need your colleague to answer or pay attention too much, the mere act of describing the problem to him may light up some neural pathways that make clear the way forward.</p></span></p>
