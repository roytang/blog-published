<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-point-of-having-fear/answer/Roy-Tang">What&rsquo;s the point of having fear?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Fear is an instinct, to keep one away from danger. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Sometimes the fear is valid. Such fear can keep you alive, especially in crisis situations. Examples are fear of falling or fear of injury.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Many other times, fear is simply a vestige of our prehistoric brains not yet adapted to modern times. An example is fear of humiliation, maybe manifesting as a fear of public speaking. Our prehistoric lizard brains are afraid that we might say something stupid and be humiliated and lose standing among the tribe, leading to us being ostracized. In prehistoric times, being ostracized can mean death, since humans had to band together to survive. But in modern times, such fear is unnecessary and unhealthy since people are more free to disagree with one another.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The key is to recognize fear for what it is and to understand whether the fear you are feeling is justified and needs to be acted upon, or simply part of a prehistoric instinct that is meaningless in the modern life.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Everyone, no matter how talented, will question themselves at some point. It&rsquo;s natural, but don&rsquo;t let it dictate your life.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Is writing important to you? If yes, then ignore the instinct to question yourself and just write. Write, write, write. Write until it becomes second nature, like breathing. Write until these thoughts fade to the wayside. Write until you can&rsquo;t write anymore, then write some more.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It&rsquo;s never too late to be who you were meant to be.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I would suggest studying an easy-to-learn programming language and getting into the basics of algorithms and data structures. Personally, I&rsquo;d recommend Python, but it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what programming language you choose, your initial learning stage should only be to get you familiar with programming concepts and constructs.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">When looking for a job, look for the ones geared towards fresh graduates that may be offering training for new hires. This puts you on a more even field with people who have been programming for longer.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The only real way to find your purpose in life to try a lot of different things and see what sticks. Find out what makes you happy and pursue those things.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">That being said, I&rsquo;ve found that many young people will not be able to find the right path for them immediately. And that&rsquo;s fine. Life is to be lived, and your purpose can come early or it can come late. The important thing is to live a fulfilling life, to make sure you are exposing yourself to as many different things as possible to make the most of life</p></span></p>

Tell them about the error and ask them for technical details of the possible cause, and if there are any diagnostics you can do. Ask them what you need to tell your ISP to check</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It&rsquo;s really up to you to decide if where you are is something you&rsquo;re satisfied with. In life, you often come to a crossroads where you have to decide whether you are willing to settle with what you have and are comfortable with, or to go out to seek something better. The choice is not always clear-cut, and the right answer always depends on the person and what he wants out of life</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It is a tenuous balance between ambition and happiness. If you are too ambitious and always keep moving on looking for the next best thing, you run the risk of never being happy. If you find yourself happy where you are, you run the risk of settling for something less than what you could have had. You have to look inside yourself and figure out where that balance lies.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Think about what happens if you stay: what&rsquo;s the best-case scenario? Will the job eventually become more challenging? More engaging? What&rsquo;s the worst-case scenario? Will it become even more boring later on?</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Think about what happens if you leave: are you likely to be able to find new work? (Actually there&rsquo;s minimal risk since you don&rsquo;t have to resign before looking for new work). Will you likely do well at any other job? Will you find happiness elsewhere?</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">For my case, I worked in a software job for more than a decade. It paid really well and I was well-respected by my peers and it was quite cushy for me. But eventually I decided to leave and take a break from working for a while to figure out where to go next. I had enough savings to live comfortably for a new months. Absolutely no regrets, enjoying all the free time I have now :)</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Finding a purpose in life is a life-long pursuit. It won&rsquo;t necessarily come easily. It may come early in life or it may come late. Don&rsquo;t let the lack of it lead to despair. Instead, enjoy life and explore it as much as possible. Try out as many new things as you can. Walk down unexplored side streets. Pursue strange and unusual things. Don&rsquo;t give up, just keep trying different things. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Think about school subjects you&rsquo;ve taken and put them in a list. Now sort that list according to which subjects you found most interesting to least. Now you have some indication of where your interests may lie. It may not be a strong indication, but it can be a good place to start</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">No, it&rsquo;s not foolish to have dreams. But don&rsquo;t let your dreams stay dreams. Figure out what kind of work you plan to do for yourself and how you&rsquo;re going to get there. Step-by-step, as detailed as possible. Take the first steps to get to your goal. Review your plan on a regular basis and make sure that either you are still on that plan or you want to take a different direction.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I always recommend learning java web development in the following order:</p><ol><li>Client-side stuff (If you&rsquo;re not familiar yet - HTML, JavaScript, CSS)</li><li>Basic Java usage (no web stuff)</li><li>Servlets, including request processing and response generation</li><li>JSP, including EL and tag libraries</li><li>SQL and basic database usage (If you&rsquo;re not familiar yet)</li><li>Database usage in Java (JDBC)</li></ol><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">At this point, you understand the basics of building webapps in Java without using any frameworks. It will give you a good base from which to branch out and choose specific frameworks or technologies to try and specialize in. The above is part of the regular training course for new developers in a company I previously worked in, new hires (fresh grads) without Java knowledge can complete the above in two weeks.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I would also recommend the Head First Servlets and JSP book, I&rsquo;ve found it to be pretty useful</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I disagree. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The thing about this line of work is that there is always something new to do. If you find yourself doing the same type of work all the time, it might be time to look for a different job/company that can offer you more challenging situations.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I&rsquo;ve been a web developer since 2004. Over the past five years, most of my projects have brought some new and interesting challenges. Some examples:</p><ul><li>One of my projects had to be ported from a large legacy client/server system under a minimal budget. We had create a converter that would create the boilerplate java code (I work primarily in servlets/JSP) from the source of the legacy PowerBuilder system which was very challenging since C/S program stuff doesn&rsquo;t always map cleanly to web-based stuff</li><li>Another project had me building a generic workflow engine to support the various modules in a large project. The engine had to cater to the different needs of the modules while remaining flexible enough to accommodate new modules and any configuration changes the clients wanted to support (the project had multiple clients)</li><li>The same project above had us learning about the challenges behind DevOps. The size of the project meant our build and deployment processes had to be revamped otherwise the builds would slow to a crawl (at one point it was taking three or more hours to churn out a build, totally unacceptable at the rate we needed to integrate and verify fixes). </li><li>I was also involved in a project that included a web portal that acted as messaging hub for a number of mobile apps. That meant devising a messaging protocol and format that could efficiently communicate with a large array of clients in real-time. </li></ul><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Web development actually has a lot of scope. It&rsquo;s true that many web development frameworks are largely the same, but that only makes the basic CRUD work easy. It means the developers need to move on to higher-order problems that are not covered by those frameworks.</p></span></p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Fear of public speaking is one of the most common fears (if not the most common - more than fear of death even), so in this you are in good company.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The first key to overcoming any fear is <b>to face it head on</b>. In this case, that means trying out public speaking, no matter how hard it seems or how badly you do. To try it again and again, until that fear is gone. You don&rsquo;t have to speak in front of an audience of hundreds or thousands to practice, you can do smaller steps first, like maybe in a classroom setting. If you are having trouble for example with a presentation you want to do in class, ask a small group of friends if you could practice the talk/presentation in front of them so they can give you feedback. This will give you more confidence during the actual talk.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Speaking of confidence, another key is to <b>learn how to express your ideas confidently</b>. This means practice as well, with an example above. But the practice here isn&rsquo;t restricted to speaking, you need to practice this at every opportunity. You need to practice expressing your ideas not only verbally, but also in written form. You need to be comfortable with the notion of presenting your ideas to people. One thing that can help is to have a like-minded group of friends, the kind you can have deep ongoing conversations with. Or join a debate team in school. Or even try discussing issues with strangers on internet forums (be careful with this one haha). Basically take any opportunity you have to practice expressing your ideas so that you have the confidence to present them to an audience.</p></span></p>

The system was pretty large - case management consisted of a lot of different types of records and there was a significant finance component.

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Moving on doesn&rsquo;t mean forgetting her. Don&rsquo;t dwell too much on her death; whenever you find yourself thinking about that topic, try to refocus your thoughts to her life and to your good memories together with her. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It might be difficult to let go, but it will come eventually with time. In the meantime, try to find new ways to occupy your mind and keep you distracted. A new hobby or something else to direct your attention to. Ask your friends to help you with this as well.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It&rsquo;s an understandable bias, always needing perfect information before moving forward and taking action. But it can be paralyzing, and there are situations where you will need to act quickly and with minimal information. As in many things in life, it&rsquo;s important to strike a balance and know when to wait for more data or when to move forward with what you have.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If you are having difficulty with this, you might need to practice being more spontaneous. Ask your friends to help you with this: ask them to drag you along on sudden road trips without telling you where you&rsquo;re going, or to surprise you with random situations where you have to react quickly</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Good luck!</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Minimum length requirements are inflated to take into account the BS that students write. If students write 500 words of meaningful response + 1500 words of BS for a 2,000 word essay, then for a 500 word essay, you&rsquo;re likely to get only 125 words of meaningful response.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">And even the mere act of thinking up 1,500 additional words of BS is something, at least you&rsquo;re trying to think about things tangentially related to the topic at hand. </p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Practice solving puzzles to get better at math. Not necessarily math puzzles (those are fine), but also logic puzzles will help. Try the book Satan, Cantor and Infinity</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">For remembering things, try to exercise your memory in everyday locations. For example whenever you go to the grocery store, choose a thing that you like to buy, say potato chips. Look at the row of potato chips on sale and try to memorize the order of the brands as arranged on the shelf. Then the next time you go to the store, see how well you remembered it.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">You can also look into/research the memory technique called the memory palace. There&rsquo;s a TED talk about it somewhere. </p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It can be something as simple as a checklist that you verify at the end of the period to make sure you&rsquo;ve done all the necessary things. Add a reminder/notification to your phone to remind you to do the thing you have to do for your goal. Tell your friends about your goal to keep you honest.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Typically, a database administrator will have the following tasks:</p><ol><li>Database installation and configuration</li><li>Maintenance - version upgrades and applying patches</li><li>Migration - transferring data from one database to another, or an older database version to another</li><li>Setting up regular backups and planning for recovery procedures</li><li>Configure security models</li><li>Storage and capacity planning - this means monitoring the disk storage used by the database</li><li>Performance monitoring and tuning - users will complain if the database slows to a crawl! Tuning here can mean modifying SQL statements or stored procedures to improve performance</li><li>General database troubleshooting</li><li>Maintaining data integrity - this means making sure the data in the tables and the relationships between them are &ldquo;correct&rdquo;. Typically a database will have internal mechanisms to ensure this, such as foreign keys (which may be configured by the database administrator also), and applications using the database will have their own set of rules that they impose upon the data.

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Having a mix of skills will be incredibly valuable for you since it makes you &ldquo;rarer&rdquo;. Look for the place where your skills/interests intersect - that is a good niche for you to pursue since there will be fewer people to compete with. i.e. look for programming work where an economics domain would be an advantage, or work for an economics graduate (I have no idea what that entails LOL) where you can leverage your programming knowledge (maybe via program-assisted data crunching or analysis). It&rsquo;s better than competing against everyone who is a programmer.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">This is a difficult fear, and it may take a lot of practice to get over. Not all fears have reasonable causes, but that&rsquo;s okay. To overcome fear you do not need to rationalize it, you only need to confront it.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Basically you need to start confronting this fear in small doses. It&rsquo;s best if you have friends you can count on and that are aware of your fear and willing to help.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Practice being comfortable around small groups of people first. Try taking the bus to/from school or work, if possible. Better if you can ride the bus with a friend. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Do your shopping errands at different grocery stores, find one where you feel slightly uncomfortable with the amount of people there and do your grocery shopping there for a while. When you get used to it, look for another grocery store that might be more difficult for you.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Bring a friend when you need to navigate through a large crowd (say, at the shopping mall or such). Having a friend along will make you a bit more comfortable.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Practice small talk. Say hi to the cashier at the grocery store, or the bus driver on your way to work. You don&rsquo;t need to think of anything else to say beyond &ldquo;Hi, how are you doing?&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t worry if you have trouble responding, just smile and try again next time.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Good luck!</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Edit: You don&rsquo;t always need to be outgoing and confident!

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If you are depressed, it is best to talk to a professional. This is the very first thing you should do.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Also see if you can share your fears and anxieties with friends and family and ask for their support. Maybe you also fear telling them about it, but that&rsquo;s fine. You&rsquo;ve already taken the first step of asking people on the internet for help anyway. If you have trouble telling them your problems, you can send them the link to this question :) Try to ask friends or family members who you think will likely be supportive.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">For your everyday fears, try facing them one at a time. Try the easiest ones first. Try a break in your routine. Go to a different coffee shop. Say hi to the barista (any small talk after that is optional!) When you go get a haircut ask the barber to suggest a different look. Or ask him how his family is doing. Little things, one at a time. It&rsquo;s ok to fail too. Every attempt is already a victory.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Don&rsquo;t let negative people get you down. Most often the people trying to drag you down are insecure about their own position and in seeing you working hard they feel some insecurity because they are stuck in their own mediocrity. As long as you are doing what you believe is right and you are not hurting other people, you shouldn&rsquo;t worry about it.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If those people are affecting you negatively, you might want to consider avoiding them or cutting them out of your life entirely</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">On the one hand, it&rsquo;s not really your responsibility.

If he is already aware of this, and decides to go on anyway, I don&rsquo;t think you can do anything more.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If you do decide to discuss this with him, try to soften it a little. I would wrap it in concern: &ldquo;Hey, are you doing okay?
