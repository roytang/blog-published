My country:
 Friday afternoon the president sighed the controversial &ldquo;Anti-terror law&rdquo; that vastly expands police powers, allows people to be arrested without warrants on mere suspicion of terrorism etc. Interesting timing, right after China applies a new anti-terror low to Hong Kong (and rightly gets castigated for it by countries all over the world) and also right after the PNP (who promise not to abuse their newfound powers) are under criticism for killing some soldiers in a misencounter and tampering with the crime scene to cover it up.

My stuff:
 This week&rsquo;s pandemic notes. Easily the most annoying thing this week: our broadband modem conked out Wednesday night. Customer support isn&rsquo;t super responsive for local telcos: I called their support line the next day (support line is not even available 24/7!), got put on hold for 45 minutes TWICE before they agreed to send a repair crew over the next day (Friday). Friday morning I got a text that the technician visit was actually scheduled for SATURDAY morning.

It seems difficult to write about stuff today, when the world seems like it is on fire.
For historical context, for the past few days the USA, presumably a first-world nation, has been in the grip of massive protests and riots and police brutality following the murder of a black man by four police officers was captured on video and went viral. Basically, many states are responding to protests against police brutality with&hellip; police brutality.

My Stuff:
 This week&rsquo;s quarantine notes. Work: A bit of Laravel work, and a bit of server management and deployment. Nothing too ridiculous. Watching: Haven&rsquo;t watched much this week. There was the really great Justice League Dark: Apokolips War which came out last week. Apparently it&rsquo;s the last one for the DC AMU, or this particular timeline at least. Quiz: We are now up to 3 locally produced online quiz nights per week, which seems like a lot because we only used to attend 2-3 live events per month.

My Stuff:
 Early this morning I took a walk outside for the first time since the lockdown started. Previously I had only gone out for groceries and meds. Only for less than 30 mins, and only in our subdivision, walking up and down the street. It&rsquo;s good to be walking again, although this short and limited route is quite boring and full of neighbor&rsquo;s dogs barking at me, so I&rsquo;m not too fond of it, but it&rsquo;s better to get the habit started again since I&rsquo;ve been feeling the fatness piling on due to the quarantine and the lack of exercise.

<p>Does Netflix have an open API? I remember looking around for it before but couldnt find any details.</p>
<p>Also any chance you could also serve rss feeds for new netflix shows/movies added per country?</p>

This week went by quickly, for some reason. And despite the fact that it&rsquo;s summer, the rains have started coming in early, although only sporadically. inb4 &ldquo;the world is healing&rdquo;
The COVID19 Diary is still being updated every few days. Actually went out 3 times this week, once for groceries, and twice for meds for the parental units (one would assume they would coordinate so I can just buy everything in one go, but nooooo.

I stopped updating the COVID19 Diary for a few days (last update was on Maunday Thursday), and I feel like that was a healthier choice overall. It helped that nothing significantly newsworthy happened over the long weekend. (Well, there&rsquo;s still thousands of deaths worldwide, but somehow our bar for &ldquo;significant&rdquo; has shifted quite a bit.)
Our lockdown has of course been extended to the end of April. I expect it will go beyond that though, likely the earliest chance for things to start going back to normal might be by June.

(Too late for the theatrical release, but it&rsquo;s tradition for comic book movies, so here we are.)
 Overall: Totally watchable, maybe slightly better than Suicide Squad for me. Somehow still fits into some kind of DCEU continuity (after Suicide Squad) the movie is really centered around Harley, to the detriment of the other characters. I can understand why they titled it the way they did, and I can appreciate the effort to have Harley carry a Birds of Prey introduction to the masses.

2020 Movies update: 7 movies watched in Feb. Probably the best movie I&rsquo;ve seen this month was Knives Out. (Jojo Rabbit close second.) The goal of 200 movies for the year is getting farther!
As for TV, I think most of my watching time was spent rewatching Rick and Morty for quiz purposes lol. Well, Criminal Minds ended, so there&rsquo;s that. Arrowverse has been meh, though I did enjoy Supergirl&rsquo;s 100th episode.

I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I should continue this watching-lately series since I already set up a separate page for listing my 2020 movies watched. It might have been more consistent to have a list for the 2020 TV shows also? But then again, TV shows are a much different beast, since each show/season is broken into an episode and sometimes you watch them all in one go or sometimes over the span of a few months.

Apparently I&rsquo;m not done looking back at the 2010s yet. I had some &ldquo;top tens of 2010s&rdquo; discussions with some friends recently, here are my personal lists, each in no particular order:
My Top Ten Movies of the 2010s  Avengers Endgame (2019).. I&rsquo;m keeping only one slot per franchise, so I had to choose an MCU movies for this. Runner-ups for this slot were Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America Winter Soldier, and individually either one of those movies might be around the same or better than Endgame, but Endgame is the culmination of a decade&rsquo;s worth of movies and gave me the most enjoyment as a comic book fan.

Been watching a lot of things this December.
I finally got back on The Expanse after finishing S1 more than a year ago. I only finished S2, but it was already a vast improvement over S1. S1 felt like a lot of meandering around until the characters actually ran into the plot. S2 was stronger, faster-paced, and there&rsquo;s always a lot of things going on in each episode. I really like this series now, looking forward to S3 and S4 when I have the time.

<p>RISE OF SKYWALKER Spoiler-free review:</p>
<ul>
<li>the movie is fine and entertaining to watch</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a Star Wars movie, so you pretty much know what to expect, space wizards and space battles and such</li>
<li>pacing is frantic in the first act, and a bit in the second. Abrams has a lot of things he wants to do and limited time to do it, so things happen in rapid succession</li>
<li>the third act is basically an ode to <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, as a parallel to The Force Awakens&rsquo; ode to <em>A New Hope</em>. In fact, there is a lot of fanservice for original trilogy fans sprinkled throughout the movie.</li>
<li>it is not the best ending I could have imagined for the sequel trilogy, but it is an ending</li>
<li>there are a few twists and turns in the movie, but because it&rsquo;s Star Wars, you largely know what to expect from the overall plot</li>
<li>magugustuhan ba ni Mama: The movie is generally family-friendly (outside of the violence), but my mom doesn&rsquo;t like space battles and she would probably be confused by the rapid pace of events and all these characters she&rsquo;s not familiar with, so no.</li>
<li>I watched in IMAX 3D, but I don&rsquo;t think there was much noticeable 3D, the movie is probably perfectly fine without IMAX</li>
<li>there is no post-credits scene</li>
<li>I think I liked <em>The Last Jedi</em> more than this one</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a bit more <a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/12/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-spoilers/">spoilery comments posted here</a>.</p>

Nothing in the cinema this month (going to the cinema is expensive!). I did watch a couple of animated movies this month:
 Dragonball Super: Broly. I have some vague recollection of watching the original Broly movie, and I believe this one is much better. DBS Broly is a slightly more nuanced character than just &ldquo;random raging monster&rdquo; from the previous non-canon movie. The animation was okay, you could tell the animators were having fun with some of the battle parts.

Actually watched something in the cinema this month: Joker. I wasn&rsquo;t originally sure if I wanted to see it, I wasn&rsquo;t hyped for it at all in the months prior. But as the showing date came nearer, there was a lot of buzz around it so I decided to go anyway. I don&rsquo;t feel like it lived up to the hype and the warnings about promoting incel stuff, but at least it&rsquo;s one of the higher-grossing DC movies, so maybe we&rsquo;ll have more to come in that vein.

<p>JOKER spoiler-free review:</p>
<ul>
<li>very dark movie, not like any previous superhero movies at all; don&rsquo;t bring your kids</li>
<li>it is violent and potentially disturbing, but strangely not as much as the hype made it out to be</li>
<li>Joaquin Phoenix definitely gives a pretty good performance, but IDK about the supposed &ldquo;Oscar-worthy&rdquo; hype</li>
<li>some of the shots feels like the director definitely had a lot of fun bringing this story to life</li>
<li>I would have liked less connection to the Batman mythos so that this movie is more stand-alone. I mean, it is pretty much stand-alone, but it does remind you where it&rsquo;s set and direct connections to the Mythos exist</li>
<li>I think a lot of the story and plot elements are handled well, any concerns I have would largely be nitpicking</li>
<li>No post credits scene</li>
<li>i didnt watch in imax and don&rsquo;t think it would be relevant</li>
<li>magugustuhan ba ni mama: sure NO</li>
<li>Ultimately, I still prefer that Joker&rsquo;s origin story remain undetermined, as it makes him more akin to a natural force of chaos, but I accept this movie as a version that even canon Joker could have told and that might have been believable</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s definitely a better movie overall than Suicide Squad, Man of Steel or Dawn of Justice or Justice League, but it&rsquo;s also a different completely type of movie, so the comparison is difficult</li>
<li>I still like Ledger&rsquo;s Joker the best, the character is best opposite Batman</li>
</ul>

I finally got around to watching X-Men Dark Phoenix which I skipped when it came out mainly because (a) poor reviews, and while normally I&rsquo;d have watched it anyway since I have not missed any of the X-Men movies in the cinema, not even the horrendous Wolverine Origins, there was also to consider that (b) I was in the US at the time and was only willing to spend my precious dollars on one expensive American cinema and Spider-man Far From Home won out.

Hmm, surprisingly I haven&rsquo;t watched too much stuff this month.
Eigasai I watched a Japanese film at Eigasai in UP Diliman for the first time ever, upon the invite of some friends. We saw One Cut of the Dead a comedy zombie film. It was great and it was hilarious, although you must make sure not to lose patience with the first thirty minutes. I went in blind not knowing anything about it other than &ldquo;Japanese comedy zombie movie&rdquo;, so you should too!

I was travelling for most of the past two months, so this covers both June and July, and I guess I haven&rsquo;t been able to watch too much. Maybe? IDK, we&rsquo;ll see.
Since I was in the US, I took the opportunity to finish watching Voltron: Legendary Defender which only had two seasons available on PH Netflix. Pretty good adaptation, lots of fun callbacks to the old series. Some annoying filler eps, especially in the middle seasons onwards.

I know I already made a whole post about the MCU after Endgame came out, but after the MCU Phase 4 announcements this past weekend at SDCC I was a bit hyped. I thought it would be fun to look back at the past 10 years of MCU Phase 1-3 and see what I wrote about the movies.
Iron Man (2008)
Surprisingly, I had written nothing about watching this film at all, and I don&rsquo;t remember going to the cinema to watch it.

First, the spoiler-free review, then more spoilery stuff afterwards.
 I watched Far From Home while I was&hellip; far from home. great movie, lots of fun, and the stakes are a lot higher than the Vulture just stealing some tech off Tony Stark basically a story of Peter Parker the high school student trying to juggle his Spider-Man problems with his high school life, which was one of the best eras of comic book Spider-Man the movie gives us a look at what the world looks like post-Endgame and how weird it is for everyone if you&rsquo;ve seen the trailers, you know who the &ldquo;villain&rdquo; is and you have certain expectations coming in.

The big TV thing of May 2019 was of course, the much maligned finale for Game of Thrones. I&rsquo;ve written about that separately here.
Most of the US TV series also ended their runs in May. Arrowverse show seasons were littered with poor writing as usual. I rank the seasons in this order:
 best is Legends of Tomorrow season 4. The reason Legends is the best is that they&rsquo;re not afraid to be outrageous.

I&rsquo;ve already written extensively about Avengers Endgame, but there are other things I watched this month too.
Shazam came out early this month, and while it was unfortunately sandwiched between MCU blockbusters, it was a fun adventure romp and surprised me in a few ways. I wrote a short spoiler-free review over on Tumblr.
TV-wise, I&rsquo;ve been on a rewatch binge of 30 Rock that unfortunately started with season 4 due to Amazon Prime&rsquo;s weird way of presenting things.

I already wrote about Avengers Endgame a bit in yesterday&rsquo;s post, but that was a bit rushed and I had more thoughts, so here we are. I figured I might as well get everything out. There will be unmarked spoilers for Avengers Endgame and Agents of SHIELD.
Before even going into the movie that was seemingly sold out everywhere despite being on almost every cinema screen in the Metro, I was thinking to myself what a phenomenon.

I liked this movie, it had good heart, fun kid-friendly humor, and a strong message about family basically the story of a kid with a messed up life being stupid and trying to be better john glover is here! does he now hold the record for portraying the most number of parents of bald supervillains? that’s not a spoiler right? this movie is kid-friendly, aside from the violence and the occasional swear word there is a mid credits scene and the post credits scene.

The big one this month was Captain Marvel. I posted the usual spoiler-free review over on Tumblr, but I have some more spoiler-y thoughts over here:
(Spoilers)   While I thought the movie was ok, I was underwhelmed by the third act and specifically the lack of any serious threat for Carol to defeat towards the end of the movie. As this tumblr post explains more clearly than I ever could, perhaps the issue is that the narrative is not something targetted towards me as a man, who has not experienced the emotional gaslighting IRL that many women are exposed to.

movie was pretty good, no major issues doesnt follow the typical MCU origin story ‘formula’ some weird pacing issues in a few places, but that just might be because of the chosen story direction lots of little call-outs and tie-ins to the other MCU movies (although I feel like they could have done a bit more in some spots) I am not a cat person. But if you are a cat person, you might like this: there is a cat.

If you haven&rsquo;t figured it out yet, I watch a lot of TV shows, rarely on TV itself though. I outgrew scheduled television maybe more than a decade ago. I&rsquo;m reminded of this because I was going through some old disks and found burned episodes of stuff like Smallville, Heroes, The Simpsons, various anime, and so on.
Those were from the days before streaming though. These days an abundance of content is available online via the streaming services, no need to store all those episodes yourself.

Some things I&rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:
I watched Alita: Battle Angel, with the friend who introduced me to the series in the first place. The movie looked fantastic and the fight scenes were great. Plot was supercondensed, several books&rsquo; worth of story combined into one. Ended in a weird place, kinda? Easily the best western live action anime adaptation by far.
On 7 Feb 2019 2:06pm I wrote:  Watched Alita: Battle Angel earlier today.

18 Feb 2019 5:56amClose   The quote is from the 1980s cult classic Bill and Ted&rsquo;s Excellent Adventure. I didn&rsquo;t include this movie in my top 10 movies post, but it and the sequel Bill and Ted&rsquo;s Bogus Journey are still among my childhood faves. These wise words are give by the Wyld Stallyns band composed of the epnoymous Bill and Ted, and form the philosophical basis of the future utopian civilization inspired by their music.

<p>I watched The Usual Suspects for the first time today. Holds up surprisingly well, despite the internet having spoiled Keyser Soze&rsquo;s identity for me many years ago. I can see why Kevin Spacey won an Oscar for his performance here</p>

    <p>Watched Alita: Battle Angel earlier today. Pretty good. Fast pace, excellent visuals and fight scenes. They tried to cram a lot of the source material into a two hour movie. I felt like they ended in a weird spot, obviously expecting to be able to do a follow up
After watching I immediately passed by a friend&rsquo;s house to borrow these. Must be more than a decade since I last read them</p>

Some things I&rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:
Bumblebee only came out over here in January (thanks to the usual MMFF shenanigans), and I decided to watch it on a whim. Pretty decent soft reboot, read my spoiler-free review over on the Tumblr
The first half of Young Justice Outsiders is out, and it&rsquo;s pretty good. Focus is back on a smaller group after the larger team in YJ season 2.

The first trailer for Spider-Man Far From Home dropped last week. I used to pretty hyped for superhero movie trailers, but I haven&rsquo;t bother watching this one yet. MCU still has two more movies coming out before this one, and I&rsquo;m already hyped enough for those, I don&rsquo;t think I have hype to spare for a third one.
My brother was complaining to me about the trailer, saying he was spoiled about some elements.

Christopher?&rdquo; &ldquo;Cliffjumper!&rdquo;</p>

Some things I&rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:
I very much enjoyed Elseworlds, the Arrowverse crossover this year. I mean sure, a lot of it didn&rsquo;t make any sense, but it was like a love letter to DC fans. I actually consider myself more of a Marvel fan than DC, but I still loved it! I wrote a spoiler-free review over on the Tumblr.

Into the Spider-Verse spoiler-free review
<p><br/></p><p>- this is a great animated comic book movie, it makes me happy<br/>- I may have been a bit overhyped by the early reviews, but it was very entertaining, funny and had brilliant presentation, melding the medium of movies with comic books in a way that has never been seen before<br/>- again, the presentation is fantastic, the animation is great and intentional and the funky alternate universe stuff is represented well<br/>- IDK if I would call it the best comic book movie of all time, or even the best Spider-Man movie of all time, but definitely one of the best animated movies of all time, for a comic book fan (highly specific lol)<br/>- in fact, much respect to the writers who dared to bring this story to life. imagine the challenge of pitching a story idea to Sony about not just one new Spider-man, but several alternate universe versions of them. It’s not exactly comparable to a Disney movie plot after all, but they pulled it off<br/>- between this movie and the PS4 game, I’m happy that Miles is making further inroads into the cultural zeitgeist<br/>- Miles appearance here reminds me of Hey Arnold’s black friend lol<br/>- maybe I would have appreciated the movie a bit more if I was into hip-hop or such<br/>- comic book fans will be happy to know that this movie does <em>not</em> follow the actual Spider-Verse comic book arc along with its convoluted background of the inheritors. The plot and the opposition are much more straightforward<br/>- Will Mama like it? Well …like all animated movies, with enough viewings at home by my nieces/nephews, maybe.<br/>- This movie has the best post-credits scene of all time</p></p>

<p>Aquaman Spoiler-Free review!</p>
<ul>
<li>I came in with low expectations (given DC&rsquo;s history), but the movie turned out pretty good, even though it wasn&rsquo;t the best comic book related thing I&rsquo;ve seen this week (see previous post)</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s fun and action-packed, some fun set pieces and action sequences. Lots of CGI (as can be expected)</li>
<li>the plot is fairly predictable, I&rsquo;ve seen similar story arcs for this character more than once, things pretty much happen as you expect</li>
<li>also the plot kinda feels a bit like black panther, except in reverse? does that make sense?</li>
<li>the first act felt a bit longish, but not really draggy or anything, it&rsquo;s just that there&rsquo;s a lot of set up to be done</li>
<li>the director&rsquo;s horror movie background shines through a bit in one of the sequences around the second act</li>
<li>I had the urge to pee about 1 hour in, but I had to hold it in until the end of the movie, I didn&rsquo;t want to miss stuff. So much water didn&rsquo;t help!</li>
<li>Arthur&rsquo;s dad looks like a Pinoy lol</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t watch in IMAX3D, but I suspect there&rsquo;s a lot of 3d given the volume of CGI</li>
<li>there is one mid-credits scene</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s family-friendly even though there is quite a bit of bloodshed</li>
<li>magugustuhan ba ni Mama. Eh, maybe? Not really her type of movie, but maybe if I explain it a bit?</li>
</ul>
<p>Spider-verse this weekend!</p>

Some things I&rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:
For some reason, I watched two biopics this month. The first one is Hidden Figures, about three black women who were instrumental during the early days of NASA leading up to the Friendship 7 mission piloted by John Glenn. The movie is fairly interesting if you are even remotely interested in either the challenges faced in black history or math and science or the early days of the space program competition between the USA and Russia.

Some things I&rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:
Tom Clancy&rsquo;s Jack Ryan (on Amazon Prime) &ndash; surprisingly good, even if I&rsquo;m not too familiar with the Jack Ryan stuff. I only know John Krasinski from The Office,
Spoilers for Tom Clancy&rsquo;s Jack Ryan:
(Spoilers)  The story starts with Ryan tracking down Suleiman&rsquo;s network via financials, but they never follow-up on who was financing his group I&rsquo;m not sure what was the point of the whole drone pilot side story (including the weird trip to the casino and the night with the couple), although it was admittedly kind of entertaining   Daredevil season 3 (on Netflix) &ndash; I enjoyed the season a lot.

<p>VENOM spoiler-free review:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I would watch this, given the poor critical response, but it&rsquo;s an ok movie overall, fun to watch but nothing to write home about (though I wouldnt spend extra for Imax). I would say comparable with Thor: Dark World or Iron Man 2</li>
<li>the first 15 mins or so felt draggy, but after that things happen quickly</li>
<li>overall plot slightly predictable, and not too long, very straightforward</li>
<li>a tiny bit of humor thrown in, not enough to make it feel like an MCU movie</li>
<li>not sure if there&rsquo;s something with the sound editing or some of the actors weren&rsquo;t delivering their lines properly, but I had trouble with understanding the lines in some scenes</li>
<li>the Venom symbiote seems to have some extra powers here (as compared to the comics)</li>
<li>Tom Hardy does a good job here, I feel like he was having fun during this movie</li>
<li>There is a mid-credits scene and a post-credits scene</li>
<li>Would Mama like it? Hard no.</li>
</ul>

This started as one of those silly Facebook memes where you post one thing every day and didn&rsquo;t have to explain and you tagged other people and they continued with the meme. I was very bad at following the meme instructions, but I did find the exercise interesting. I found it difficult to identify 10 specific movies, and since I didn&rsquo;t explain during the FB posts, I thought I&rsquo;d make a blog post about them instead.
