<p>JOKER spoiler-free review:</p>
<ul>
<li>very dark movie, not like any previous superhero movies at all; don&rsquo;t bring your kids</li>
<li>it is violent and potentially disturbing, but strangely not as much as the hype made it out to be</li>
<li>Joaquin Phoenix definitely gives a pretty good performance, but IDK about the supposed &ldquo;Oscar-worthy&rdquo; hype</li>
<li>some of the shots feels like the director definitely had a lot of fun bringing this story to life</li>
<li>I would have liked less connection to the Batman mythos so that this movie is more stand-alone. I mean, it is pretty much stand-alone, but it does remind you where it&rsquo;s set and direct connections to the Mythos exist</li>
<li>I think a lot of the story and plot elements are handled well, any concerns I have would largely be nitpicking</li>
<li>No post credits scene</li>
<li>i didnt watch in imax and don&rsquo;t think it would be relevant</li>
<li>magugustuhan ba ni mama: sure NO</li>
<li>Ultimately, I still prefer that Joker&rsquo;s origin story remain undetermined, as it makes him more akin to a natural force of chaos, but I accept this movie as a version that even canon Joker could have told and that might have been believable</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s definitely a better movie overall than Suicide Squad, Man of Steel or Dawn of Justice or Justice League, but it&rsquo;s also a different completely type of movie, so the comparison is difficult</li>
<li>I still like Ledger&rsquo;s Joker the best, the character is best opposite Batman</li>
</ul>

I finally got around to watching X-Men Dark Phoenix which I skipped when it came out mainly because (a) poor reviews, and while normally I&rsquo;d have watched it anyway since I have not missed any of the X-Men movies in the cinema, not even the horrendous Wolverine Origins, there was also to consider that (b) I was in the US at the time and was only willing to spend my precious dollars on one expensive American cinema and Spider-man Far From Home won out.

<p>I finally watched Dark Phoenix today. It was not as bad as I thought it would be, but the #xmen jet did have a port where Cyclops could put his head so they can use him as a cannon, and apparently Nightcrawler can teleport 4 people across an entire city so there&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>some weird character choices too. I mean, Erik&rsquo;s lackeys were basically random unknown mutants (I didn&rsquo;t even realize who Selene was supposed to be until she fell off the train). Not to mention the obscure Marvel alien race in the movie.</p>
<p>At least we got our space firebird thingy so there&rsquo;s that</p>

Hmm, surprisingly I haven&rsquo;t watched too much stuff this month.
Eigasai I watched a Japanese film at Eigasai in UP Diliman for the first time ever, upon the invite of some friends. We saw One Cut of the Dead a comedy zombie film. It was great and it was hilarious, although you must make sure not to lose patience with the first thirty minutes. I went in blind not knowing anything about it other than &ldquo;Japanese comedy zombie movie&rdquo;, so you should too!

I was travelling for most of the past two months, so this covers both June and July, and I guess I haven&rsquo;t been able to watch too much. Maybe? IDK, we&rsquo;ll see.
Since I was in the US, I took the opportunity to finish watching Voltron: Legendary Defender which only had two seasons available on PH Netflix. Pretty good adaptation, lots of fun callbacks to the old series. Some annoying filler eps, especially in the middle seasons onwards.

I know I already made a whole post about the MCU after Endgame came out, but after the MCU Phase 4 announcements this past weekend at SDCC I was a bit hyped. I thought it would be fun to look back at the past 10 years of MCU Phase 1-3 and see what I wrote about the movies.
Iron Man (2008)
Surprisingly, I had written nothing about watching this film at all, and I don&rsquo;t remember going to the cinema to watch it.

First, the spoiler-free review, then more spoilery stuff afterwards.
 I watched Far From Home while I was&hellip; far from home. great movie, lots of fun, and the stakes are a lot higher than the Vulture just stealing some tech off Tony Stark basically a story of Peter Parker the high school student trying to juggle his Spider-Man problems with his high school life, which was one of the best eras of comic book Spider-Man the movie gives us a look at what the world looks like post-Endgame and how weird it is for everyone if you&rsquo;ve seen the trailers, you know who the &ldquo;villain&rdquo; is and you have certain expectations coming in.

The big TV thing of May 2019 was of course, the much maligned finale for Game of Thrones. I&rsquo;ve written about that separately here.
Most of the US TV series also ended their runs in May. Arrowverse show seasons were littered with poor writing as usual. I rank the seasons in this order:
 best is Legends of Tomorrow season 4. The reason Legends is the best is that they&rsquo;re not afraid to be outrageous.

I&rsquo;ve already written extensively about Avengers Endgame, but there are other things I watched this month too.
Shazam came out early this month, and while it was unfortunately sandwiched between MCU blockbusters, it was a fun adventure romp and surprised me in a few ways. I wrote a short spoiler-free review over on Tumblr.
TV-wise, I&rsquo;ve been on a rewatch binge of 30 Rock that unfortunately started with season 4 due to Amazon Prime&rsquo;s weird way of presenting things.

I already wrote about Avengers Endgame a bit in yesterday&rsquo;s post, but that was a bit rushed and I had more thoughts, so here we are. I figured I might as well get everything out. There will be unmarked spoilers for Avengers Endgame and Agents of SHIELD.
Before even going into the movie that was seemingly sold out everywhere despite being on almost every cinema screen in the Metro, I was thinking to myself what a phenomenon.

I liked this movie, it had good heart, fun kid-friendly humor, and a strong message about family basically the story of a kid with a messed up life being stupid and trying to be better john glover is here! does he now hold the record for portraying the most number of parents of bald supervillains? that’s not a spoiler right? this movie is kid-friendly, aside from the violence and the occasional swear word there is a mid credits scene and the post credits scene.

The big one this month was Captain Marvel. I posted the usual spoiler-free review over on Tumblr, but I have some more spoiler-y thoughts over here:
(Spoilers)   While I thought the movie was ok, I was underwhelmed by the third act and specifically the lack of any serious threat for Carol to defeat towards the end of the movie. As this tumblr post explains more clearly than I ever could, perhaps the issue is that the narrative is not something targetted towards me as a man, who has not experienced the emotional gaslighting IRL that many women are exposed to.

movie was pretty good, no major issues doesnt follow the typical MCU origin story ‘formula’ some weird pacing issues in a few places, but that just might be because of the chosen story direction lots of little call-outs and tie-ins to the other MCU movies (although I feel like they could have done a bit more in some spots) I am not a cat person. But if you are a cat person, you might like this: there is a cat.

If you haven&rsquo;t figured it out yet, I watch a lot of TV shows, rarely on TV itself though. I outgrew scheduled television maybe more than a decade ago. I&rsquo;m reminded of this because I was going through some old disks and found burned episodes of stuff like Smallville, Heroes, The Simpsons, various anime, and so on.
Those were from the days before streaming though. These days an abundance of content is available online via the streaming services, no need to store all those episodes yourself.

Some things I&rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:
I watched Alita: Battle Angel, with the friend who introduced me to the series in the first place. The movie looked fantastic and the fight scenes were great. Plot was supercondensed, several books&rsquo; worth of story combined into one. Ended in a weird place, kinda? Easily the best western live action anime adaptation by far.
On 7 Feb 2019 2:06pm I wrote:  Watched Alita: Battle Angel earlier today.

18 Feb 2019 5:56amClose   The quote is from the 1980s cult classic Bill and Ted&rsquo;s Excellent Adventure. I didn&rsquo;t include this movie in my top 10 movies post, but it and the sequel Bill and Ted&rsquo;s Bogus Journey are still among my childhood faves. These wise words are give by the Wyld Stallyns band composed of the epnoymous Bill and Ted, and form the philosophical basis of the future utopian civilization inspired by their music.

<p>I watched The Usual Suspects for the first time today. Holds up surprisingly well, despite the internet having spoiled Keyser Soze&rsquo;s identity for me many years ago. I can see why Kevin Spacey won an Oscar for his performance here</p>

Some things I&rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:
Bumblebee only came out over here in January (thanks to the usual MMFF shenanigans), and I decided to watch it on a whim. Pretty decent soft reboot, read my spoiler-free review over on the Tumblr
The first half of Young Justice Outsiders is out, and it&rsquo;s pretty good. Focus is back on a smaller group after the larger team in YJ season 2.

The first trailer for Spider-Man Far From Home dropped last week. I used to pretty hyped for superhero movie trailers, but I haven&rsquo;t bother watching this one yet. MCU still has two more movies coming out before this one, and I&rsquo;m already hyped enough for those, I don&rsquo;t think I have hype to spare for a third one.
My brother was complaining to me about the trailer, saying he was spoiled about some elements.

<p>BUMBLEBEE Spoiler-Free review!</p><p>- attached image summarizes the plot. loljk (credit: Transformers (1985 - Marvel) #2)<br/>- I&rsquo;m a big Transformers fan, more G1 than Bayverse (I didn&rsquo;t even watch the last Michael Bay one). If you are like me, you will probably enjoy the film<br/>- if you grew up in the 80s like me, you will enjoy the film a bit more. Props to the 80s soundtrack<br/>- the plot is simple, straightforward and unambitious, unencumbered by any of Bayverse Megatron&rsquo;s super-complicated plans that he has been plotting for million of years in case he gets stranded on earth<br/>- not having a plethora of autobot and decepticon characters to develop on each side means the transformers are more distinctive and easier to identify, a big problem I had with the later bayverse films<br/>- i didnt understand some scenes where it looked like the characters were talking to some kind of human soldier but I can&rsquo;t see him?<br/>- foolish humans!<br/>- there is a &ldquo;mid-credits&rdquo; scene; I say &ldquo;mid-credits&rdquo; because they really only show the director credit before immediately going into the &ldquo;mid-credits&rdquo; scene<br/>- magugustuhan ba ni mama: no, she&rsquo;s not into giant robots. the movie is family-friendly, other than the violent explosions<br/>- after the movie, I went to the CR to pee, and I overheard two kids talking: &ldquo;Ano pangalan nung autobot na pula? Christopher?&rdquo; &ldquo;Cliffjumper!&rdquo;</p>

Some things I&rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:
I very much enjoyed Elseworlds, the Arrowverse crossover this year. I mean sure, a lot of it didn&rsquo;t make any sense, but it was like a love letter to DC fans. I actually consider myself more of a Marvel fan than DC, but I still loved it! I wrote a spoiler-free review over on the Tumblr.

Into the Spider-Verse spoiler-free review
<p><br/></p><p>- this is a great animated comic book movie, it makes me happy<br/>- I may have been a bit overhyped by the early reviews, but it was very entertaining, funny and had brilliant presentation, melding the medium of movies with comic books in a way that has never been seen before<br/>- again, the presentation is fantastic, the animation is great and intentional and the funky alternate universe stuff is represented well<br/>- IDK if I would call it the best comic book movie of all time, or even the best Spider-Man movie of all time, but definitely one of the best animated movies of all time, for a comic book fan (highly specific lol)<br/>- in fact, much respect to the writers who dared to bring this story to life. imagine the challenge of pitching a story idea to Sony about not just one new Spider-man, but several alternate universe versions of them. It’s not exactly comparable to a Disney movie plot after all, but they pulled it off<br/>- between this movie and the PS4 game, I’m happy that Miles is making further inroads into the cultural zeitgeist<br/>- Miles appearance here reminds me of Hey Arnold’s black friend lol<br/>- maybe I would have appreciated the movie a bit more if I was into hip-hop or such<br/>- comic book fans will be happy to know that this movie does <em>not</em> follow the actual Spider-Verse comic book arc along with its convoluted background of the inheritors. The plot and the opposition are much more straightforward<br/>- Will Mama like it? Well …like all animated movies, with enough viewings at home by my nieces/nephews, maybe.<br/>- This movie has the best post-credits scene of all time</p></p>

<p>Aquaman Spoiler-Free review!</p>

<li>I came in with low expectations (given DC&rsquo;s history), but the movie turned out pretty good, even though it wasn&rsquo;t the best comic book related thing I&rsquo;ve seen this week (see previous post)</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s fun and action-packed, some fun set pieces and action sequences. Lots of CGI (as can be expected)</li>
<li>the plot is fairly predictable, I&rsquo;ve seen similar story arcs for this character more than once, things pretty much happen as you expect</li>
<li>also the plot kinda feels a bit like black panther, except in reverse? does that make sense?</li>
<li>the first act felt a bit longish, but not really draggy or anything, it&rsquo;s just that there&rsquo;s a lot of set up to be done</li>
<li>the director&rsquo;s horror movie background shines through a bit in one of the sequences around the second act</li>
<li>I had the urge to pee about 1 hour in, but I had to hold it in until the end of the movie, I didn&rsquo;t want to miss stuff. So much water didn&rsquo;t help!</li>
<li>Arthur&rsquo;s dad looks like a Pinoy lol</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t watch in IMAX3D, but I suspect there&rsquo;s a lot of 3d given the volume of CGI</li>
<li>there is one mid-credits scene</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s family-friendly even though there is quite a bit of bloodshed</li>
<li>magugustuhan ba ni Mama. Eh, maybe? Not really her type of movie, but maybe if I explain it a bit?</li>

Some things I&rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:
For some reason, I watched two biopics this month. The first one is Hidden Figures, about three black women who were instrumental during the early days of NASA leading up to the Friendship 7 mission piloted by John Glenn. The movie is fairly interesting if you are even remotely interested in either the challenges faced in black history or math and science or the early days of the space program competition between the USA and Russia.

Some things I&rsquo;ve been watching lately, aside from the usual TV shows I follow:
Tom Clancy&rsquo;s Jack Ryan (on Amazon Prime) &ndash; surprisingly good, even if I&rsquo;m not too familiar with the Jack Ryan stuff. I only know John Krasinski from The Office,
Spoilers for Tom Clancy&rsquo;s Jack Ryan:
(Spoilers)  The story starts with Ryan tracking down Suleiman&rsquo;s network via financials, but they never follow-up on who was financing his group I&rsquo;m not sure what was the point of the whole drone pilot side story (including the weird trip to the casino and the night with the couple), although it was admittedly kind of entertaining   Daredevil season 3 (on Netflix) &ndash; I enjoyed the season a lot.

<p>VENOM spoiler-free review:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I would watch this, given the poor critical response, but it&rsquo;s an ok movie overall, fun to watch but nothing to write home about (though I wouldnt spend extra for Imax). I would say comparable with Thor: Dark World or Iron Man 2</li>
<li>the first 15 mins or so felt draggy, but after that things happen quickly</li>
<li>overall plot slightly predictable, and not too long, very straightforward</li>
<li>a tiny bit of humor thrown in, not enough to make it feel like an MCU movie</li>
<li>not sure if there&rsquo;s something with the sound editing or some of the actors weren&rsquo;t delivering their lines properly, but I had trouble with understanding the lines in some scenes</li>
<li>the Venom symbiote seems to have some extra powers here (as compared to the comics)</li>
<li>Tom Hardy does a good job here, I feel like he was having fun during this movie</li>
<li>There is a mid-credits scene and a post-credits scene</li>
<li>Would Mama like it? Hard no.</li>
</ul>

This started as one of those silly Facebook memes where you post one thing every day and didn&rsquo;t have to explain and you tagged other people and they continued with the meme. I was very bad at following the meme instructions, but I did find the exercise interesting. I found it difficult to identify 10 specific movies, and since I didn&rsquo;t explain during the FB posts, I thought I&rsquo;d make a blog post about them instead.

<p>Ant-Man and the Wasp Spoiler Free Review!</p>
<ul>
<li>this movie is great; it&rsquo;s fun and and action-packed and there&rsquo;s even more Luis than you thought you wanted; go watch it</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s like the first movie, except better and more fun</li>
<li>best new character: FBI Agent Jimmy Woo played by Randall Park (sorry Michelle Pfeifer)</li>
<li>there are two mid/post-credit scenes. One of them is better than the other</li>
<li>I watched in Imax. Some scenes were nice, but it&rsquo;s probably more of a nice-to-have</li>
<li>Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Pwede, but kelangan ng kasama to explain things. Baka ok lang pag tagalized na sa tv</li>
</ul>

<p>Deadpool 2 SPOILER-FREE REVIEW:</p>
<ul>
<li>entertaining enough; kind of a popcorn movie. i kinda liked the first movie better</li>
<li>if you watched the first movie, you kinda know what to expect in terms of tone and humor and all</li>
<li>dont bring your kids. but if it matters to you, there is significantly less sex in this movie than the first one</li>
<li>the plot did go in ways i was not expecting</li>
<li>i did not watch in imax, it seemed fine</li>
<li>there is a mid credits scene. well, scenes. like five of them strung together</li>
<li>there is no end credits scene but there is a&hellip; small bonus near the end if you pay attention</li>
<li>would i recommend na panoorin ni mama: definitely not</li>

<p>I also watched Snowpiercer. I had this on my backlog for a while and decided to watch because it came up in quiz night. Good movie, kinda weird. My copy didnt have Korean subs, so I had to guess a lot of what that one guy was saying.</p>

<p>I watched Baby Driver. Great movie. Might have been a bit better if I knew sign language. Kind of makes me want to visit that parallel universe where Edgar Wright got to finish Ant-Man. No post-credit scenes.</p>

When Game of Thrones entered its sixth season in 2016, it was true spoiler territory for those of us who had read the GRRM books before HBO&rsquo;s TV adaptation turned the property into a worldwide phenomenon. Due to the author&rsquo;s glacial writing pace, at this point the TV series went past the point that the novels had reached. Thus nobody &ndash; book readers or tv viewers &ndash; knew what events would unfold in the story.

<li>the plot moves quickly. there is no good time to pee.</li>
<li>there is one post-credits scene.</li>
<li>very happy to have watched in imax</li>

<p>BLACK PANTHER spoiler-free review!</p>
<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s a fun, action-filled romp and Wakanda is amazing</li>
<li>tchalla was ok, killmonger and nakia were great, shuri was badass</li>
<li>some of the actions scenes didnt seem too well-shot/edited, making them hard to follow</li>
<li>I realize I&rsquo;m saying this about a universe where there are talking raccoons and magic hammers, but some of the Wakandan tech push the boundaries of my suspension of disbelief</li>
<li>my expectations were probably set a bit too high what with some people saying it&rsquo;s the best MCU movie since Iron Man or calling it revolutionary or eye-opening</li>
<li>off the top of my head I&rsquo;d say I consider Civil War, Spider-Man Homecoming and Thor Ragnarok better than this one</li>
<li>I understand that it&rsquo;s revolutionary in the sense that it&rsquo;s a major hollowood motion picture filled with a cast of mostly african descent and that some of the characters are motivated by real world racial issues. But the plot itself was typical for an MCU first movie (maybe I&rsquo;ve seen too many MCU movies? lol). I dont think it presents the issues it covers under any new or revolutionary context. I guess I kind of went in hoping to be impressed on the level of The Dark Knight or such, but I was disappointed in that regard. It&rsquo;s a very straightforward movie</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t watch in Imax, which I kind of regret, as I can imagine some of the scenes being pretty good</li>
<li>Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Possibly, pero baka mahirapan sya intindihin accent ni Chadwick Boseman</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a mid-credits scene and a post-credits scene</li>
</ul>

<p>THE LAST JEDI Spoiler-free (promise) review:</p>
<ul>
<li>great movie, but there was this weird draggy part around the middle that they maybe could have done away with</li>
<li>my brother whom I watched with says he thinks it was the best Star Wars movie ever. I&rsquo;m not sure</li>
<li>Adam Driver needs to either speak up or work around his accent a bit</li>
<li>because we didn&rsquo;t plan this movie outing so well, we ended up with terrible seats (i.e. very first row, slightly off-center) in the Imax theater. I think the Imax was fine, but being so up close made for some weird angles sometimes and sometimes the 3d didn&rsquo;t work so well from where we were seated. And medyo nakakapagod sa mata. Never again!</li>
<li>walang post-credit scene lol</li>
</ul>

<p>JUSTICE LEAGUE Spoiler-Free Review:</p>
<ul>
<li>Movie was OKAY. Started out fine, build-up was good, kind of surprised with what happened in the middle, then a disappointing conclusion</li>
<li>Movie was SHORT. IMDB says 120 minutes but my watch told me it was &lt; 2h. Probably could have spent more time putting the team together or setting up the characters or such</li>
<li>the movie does pander a lot to comic/DC fans; Batman/Superman themes play in the background when they first appear; References to some other DC characters during the exposition, etc</li>
<li>Ugh Steppenwolf so boring and terrible</li>
<li>I think Ezra Miller and Gal Gadot were the best here out of the lead roles.</li>
<li>A number of fight scenes reminded me of Injustice</li>
<li>the best part of this movie was the Black Panther trailer that I somehow hadn&rsquo;t seen or heard of yet</li>
<li>for some reason the other comic book movie that came to mind was X-Men Apocalupse</li>
<li>Gary Oldman should play JJJ in the next Spider-Man so that he and JK Simmons will have effectively role-swapped</li>
<li>one mid credits scene for fun and one end credits scene as a portent of things that may come later</li>
<li>Imax was okay. There was one scene where I instinctively moved my head to avoid an incoming projectile</li>
<li>Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: It&rsquo;s very much a fantasy action movie so probably not.</li>
<li>we still get Batman with guns and Superman who threatens to kill</li>
<li>no title drop and no Superfriends reference = LAME</li>
</ul>

<p>THOR RAGNAROK spoiler-free review:</p>
<ul>
<li>a fun, action-packed romp that shakes up the Thor status quo significantly</li>
<li>easily the best of the three Thor movies</li>
<li>a number plot points are fairly predictable, yet still fun</li>
<li>the Marvel formula is generally action mixed with witty banter here and there, and it&rsquo;s what we get here, although some of the jokes feel like they&rsquo;re stretched a bit too much</li>
<li>some great-looking cinematic scenes here and there. One particular flashback scene looked really great</li>
<li>I kind of like how the older franchises need to be some sort of team effort nowadays. Like Civil War, this felt a bit like some kind of mini-Avengers crossover &ndash; in space!</li>
<li>speaking of space, one of the positive things about this installment is that they didn&rsquo;t feel the need to tie Thor&rsquo;s adventures to Earth anymore (not that the movie is 100% Earth-free), and they get to go a bit wild with space and aliens and all that</li>
<li>I understand the need to highlight Hulk&rsquo;s involvement as part of the film&rsquo;s marketing, but man, it would have been so awesome to just find out right then and there</li>
<li>This movie had that Star Wars: Last Jedi trailer I was trying to avoid D:</li>
<li>1 mid-credits scene and 1 post-credits scene</li>
<li>I think Imax was good for this movie. The 3d wasn&rsquo;t too much and it definitely made some scenes pop. The film is a visual delight so I think the larger screen is important too</li>
<li>Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Probably not. Maybe I should stop including this section kasi parang same na parati ang answer. Unless for some reason I decide to watch some Tagalog romcom</li>
</ul>

<p>Spider-man Homecoming Spoiler-free review:</p>
<ul>
<li>This movie is amazing. Possibly best in all MCU so far. It&rsquo;s fun, it&rsquo;s exciting, unexpected things happened. Maybe not watching the trailers helped lol</li>
<li>Covers a lot of ground the previous Spider-man movies didn&rsquo;t. Helped along by not needing to rehash the origin story for the Nth time</li>
<li>Lots of great call outs for the comic book fans</li>
<li>I was worried about the Vulture, but it was handled very well. Keaton is great here.</li>
<li>This movie is tightly coupled to the MCU yo. IDK how they&rsquo;re going to handle it if Sony breaks it off after the two-movie deal. By they I mean Sony. Obviously MCU can just ignore him forever afterwards.</li>
<li>TBH I was also really worried about the MCU coupling and having too much Iron Man in the movie, but it turned out okay. Maybe could have had a little bit less Tony Stark.</li>
<li>IMAX? Probably not worth it.</li>
<li>there&rsquo;s a mid-credits scene and a post-credits scene.</li>
<li>Magugustuhan ba ni Mama? Possibly! There&rsquo;s some shaky cam footage near the start that can be a bit nauseating though</li>

<p>Wonder Woman spoiler-free review:</p>
<ul>
<li>First act was best, second act was okay, third act/resolution a bit weak (and really kind of super obvious/predictable)</li>
<li>The parallels with the first Captain American movie, especially in the 3rd act, are uncanny</li>
<li>great battle/stunt choreography, especially in the first act</li>
<li>Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Robin Wright gave excellent performances</li>
<li>Definitely better than Man of Steel/Dawn of Justice</li>
<li>Not better than TDK/Logan. Come on people!</li>
<li>Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Possibly!</li>

First, the spoiler-free summary (spoilers after this part):
 overall a very entertaining movie to sit down and watch popcorn and to enjoy the jokes and the space battles and the different colored lights and the tiny adorable tree creature GOTG&rsquo;s humor was one of its strong points and for the 2nd movie, they push the comedy up a notch, perhaps a little too much in some places. Lots of funny gags and one-liners I felt like some of the character/background development stuff was pushed a bit too hard as well the movie&rsquo;s plot also felt a bit thin and straightforward.

I&rsquo;m not a fan of scary movies. I don&rsquo;t appreciate the idea of paying money to get surprised by jump scares or whatever.
Back when I was a kid I remember my dad watching a Betamax copy of The Gate back home and me and my younger brother were watching with him and the movie seriously creeped me out. There was this one scene where a demonic eye manifested on the lead kid&rsquo;s palm and that scene stuck with me for a while.

<p>Right. I watched Logan yesterday.</p>
<p>LOGAN Spoiler-Free review:</p>
<ul>
<li>great movie. Best of the Wolverine trilogy, easily</li>
<li>the tone is very different from any previous X-men movies. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s closer to something like John Wick</li>
<li>good send-off for Jackman and Stewart, since this is their last movie in these roles. Stewart finally given more acting to do than just sitting in a chair being bald and pretending to think at you</li>
<li>very, very violent and lots of swearing. Don&rsquo;t bring your kids</li>
<li>no, it doesn&rsquo;t really follow the Old Man Logan comicbook storyline</li>
<li>need to listen closely to dialogue to figure out what is implied to have happened to the X-men</li>
<li>Post-credits scene: I was told there wasn&rsquo;t any, and I really had to pee, so I didn&rsquo;t wait for it -_-</li>
<li>Magugustuhan ba ni mama? Probably not!</li>
<li>IMAX or not? I did not go IMAX, and I don&rsquo;t think the movie would have been significantly improved by IMAX or 3d</li>
</ul>

<p>Arrival spoiler-free review:</p>
<ul>
<li>first half a bit boring</li>
<li>Forrest Whitaker is hard to understand</li>
<li>not sure if it was just the cinema I was at, but the audio and the lighting seemed quite bad at some points</li>
<li>that being said, the movie was ok. I think it&rsquo;s comparable to, but not as good as, Interstellar</li>
<li>if you watch it with people who don&rsquo;t pay attention, you&rsquo;ll have to explain stuff</li>

<p>ROGUE ONE Spoiler-free review:</p>
<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s great. As a Star Wars fan, I was very happy with the movie!</li>
<li>K-2SO best droid ever</li>
<li>a lot of great shots that really show the scale of things: star destroyers, the death star, etc</li>
<li>a fun, great movie to watch, with the tension rising almost throughout the entire movie.</li>
<li>You already know how it ends, but the tension is so well-done that you&rsquo;re worried that history might change!</li>
<li>IMAX? The big screen was a plus, but the 3d wasn&rsquo;t much. IMAX optional.</li>
<li>Magugustuhan ba ni Mama? Probably not, madaming itatanong.</li>
<li>Mid/post credits scene: None.</li>
<li>R1 &gt; TFA (!)</li>
</ul>
<p>(I edited in a bunch more details after the original post)</p>
