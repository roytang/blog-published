<p>Today I decided to watch Rocky (1976) for some reason. The quintessential sports film, but I&rsquo;ve never seen it before. Stallone looks only a bit younger than I remember him from the 90s. Apollo Creed is that dude from the Mandalorian! Surprised at the ending.</p>

<p>Bond film no. 8: Live and Let Die (1973).</p>
<p>Moore feels a lot more &ldquo;generic white guy&rdquo; than Connery was. Maybe I just need to get used to him. Young Jane Seymour is here! There&rsquo;s a bayou chase scene here that goes on just a bit too long and had superfluous cop characters. <!--sep-->All the voodoo stuff felt weirdly out of place. There&rsquo;s a character named Tee Hee! Most ridiculous villain death so far.</p>

<p>Needed something light to watch in the background, so I watched Airplane! (1980). It&rsquo;s the kind of movie where they just stuff in as many gags as possible, every throwaway line and even stuff happening in the background is a gag.</p>

<p>Bond movie no. 7: Diamonds are Forever (1971). Connery&rsquo;s hair starting to go a bit gray in his last appearance. More Blofeld than I&rsquo;d expected (harhar). Space laser! Plenty O&rsquo;Toole seemed pointless, there just to die. A lot of cheesy lines from the assassin henchment.</p>
<!--sep-->
<p>These movies would be a lot shorter if they just shot Bond whenever they caught him. The action scenes in all these old Bond films always feel so jarring compared to modern ones. Limited by the technology of their time I guess.</p>

<p>Bond movie no. 6: On Her Majesty&rsquo;s Secret Service (1969). Only Lazenby appearance. He was fine, I suppose. Tracy probably best Bond girl so far. I liked the ski scenes more than Thunderball&rsquo;s underwater scenes.</p>
<!--sep-->
<p>Loose continuity. Was confused by Blofeld not recognizing Bond after they already met in the previous movie. Apparently, the novel order was reversed. Also, did Bond just leave him stuck in a tree assuming he was dead after hunting him relentlessly?</p>

<p>Bond movie no. 5: You Only Live Twice (1967). Such Japan. Much wow. Cringe at trying to pass Bond off as Japanese. Introduction of secret volcano lair trope. Ninjas with guns! First screen appearance of the head of SPECTRE, inspiration for Dr Evil.</p>
<!--sep-->
<p>That endgame scene of ninjas invading the secret volcano lair reminded me of the Simpsons episode <em>You Only Move Twice</em>. Bond&rsquo;s &ldquo;wife&rdquo; never named despite being only Bond girl to survive the movie.</p>

See also: Justice League spoiler-free review (2017)
This is basically a movie that&rsquo;s more than 3 years old, we&rsquo;re not holding back on spoilers here.
 plot basically follows the same beats as the theatrical cut except this time we have a lot more team setup time (one of my criticisms from the previous version), giving the characters stronger backgrounds, especially Cyborg and Flash Ray Fisher was right to complain; in this version he&rsquo;s one of the important characters of the ensemble while he was basically a minor guest character in the theatrical cut more DC characters make appearances in this version, among them Ryan Choi, DeSaad, Granny Goodness, Martian Manhunter, the Joker and of course Darkseid himself I accept this version as a better version of the original theatrical release and is my new DCEU headcanon it never would have worked in theaters anyway, given the four hour runtime.

<p>Bond movie no. 4: Thunderball (1965). This is the first one I didn&rsquo;t like very much. Too many boring/confusing underwater parts. There&rsquo;s a jetpack! Wasn&rsquo;t there an atomic bomb aboard that boat when it exploded? And did they just leave the guy who helped Domino escape floating alone in the ocean?</p>

<p>Bond movie no. 3: Goldfinger (1964). Lot of the classic Bond tropes introduced. Bad guy&rsquo;s plan was actually pretty good, even had the escape contingency. Disappointed he did not have an actual gold finger. Great fight between Bond and Oddjob.</p>

<p>Haven&rsquo;t seen any of the pre-Brosnan Bond films, so I started today with Dr No (1962). Pretty good, but if this were a modern film, I&rsquo;d have expected some kind of plot twist with Honey Rider, like maybe she would have turned out to be the actual Dr No</p>

<p>For some reason, I watched Space Sweepers, a Korean sci-fi movie on Netflix. Fun ride, fairly entertaining, pretty good setpieces and special effects. (They are so far ahead of the local film industry.) Plot a bit predictable. Villain made no sense.</p>

<p>Finally watched #WonderWoman1984. Maybe don&rsquo;t think too much about what&rsquo;s going on in the movie. My headcanon is that the only reason it takes place in 1984 is because it&rsquo;s pre-crisis</p>

October is imminent! There are two distractions I&rsquo;m looking forward to in the coming month.
  The first one is Inktober, which I&rsquo;ve been doing since 2016. Basically it&rsquo;s just to do 30 ink drawings in October, one per day. There are some official prompts, which I&rsquo;ll probably follow. I haven&rsquo;t really done any serious sketching in a while, maybe this will help me get back into the groove.

This last week was weird. I feel like I didn&rsquo;t really get much done in terms of productivity, yet I don&rsquo;t feel I was unproductive. A very relaxed and chill week.
Once again a tiny bit of work done this past week, some fixes, including to side projects. I also spent some time preparing for some events next weekend. Although I wasn&rsquo;t productive this week, I did outline a bit of a roadmap of new features for one of my side projects, hopefully I can get into that in the coming weeks!

 There are days when I have to consciously temper my rage at the shenanigans of this government. I can&rsquo;t write about them today.  My stuff:
 This week&rsquo;s pandemic notes. Had a busy work week again; at the same time I also picked up an older charity project where the client asked for UI updates. Had issues with running the old code, and it was small enough, so I decided to rewrite it in a new tech stack.

My country:
 Friday afternoon the House of Representatives voted to deny the franchise application of the nation&rsquo;s biggest broadcaster ABS-CBN. This despite all agencies of the executive testifying that the company had no violations. Justifications cited were mostly personal reasons. The Palace claims they remained neutral on this issue, but no one really believes that. Probably not even then. What now, Philippines?  My stuff:

My country:
 Friday afternoon the president sighed the controversial &ldquo;Anti-terror law&rdquo; that vastly expands police powers, allows people to be arrested without warrants on mere suspicion of terrorism etc. Interesting timing, right after China applies a new anti-terror low to Hong Kong (and rightly gets castigated for it by countries all over the world) and also right after the PNP (who promise not to abuse their newfound powers) are under criticism for killing some soldiers in a misencounter and tampering with the crime scene to cover it up.

My stuff:
 This week&rsquo;s pandemic notes. Easily the most annoying thing this week: our broadband modem conked out Wednesday night. Customer support isn&rsquo;t super responsive for local telcos: I called their support line the next day (support line is not even available 24/7!), got put on hold for 45 minutes TWICE before they agreed to send a repair crew over the next day (Friday). Friday morning I got a text that the technician visit was actually scheduled for SATURDAY morning.

It seems difficult to write about stuff today, when the world seems like it is on fire.
For historical context, for the past few days the USA, presumably a first-world nation, has been in the grip of massive protests and riots and police brutality following the murder of a black man by four police officers was captured on video and went viral. Basically, many states are responding to protests against police brutality with&hellip; police brutality.

My Stuff:
 This week&rsquo;s quarantine notes. Work: A bit of Laravel work, and a bit of server management and deployment. Nothing too ridiculous. Watching: Haven&rsquo;t watched much this week. There was the really great Justice League Dark: Apokolips War which came out last week. Apparently it&rsquo;s the last one for the DC AMU, or this particular timeline at least. Quiz: We are now up to 3 locally produced online quiz nights per week, which seems like a lot because we only used to attend 2-3 live events per month.

My Stuff:
 Early this morning I took a walk outside for the first time since the lockdown started. Previously I had only gone out for groceries and meds. Only for less than 30 mins, and only in our subdivision, walking up and down the street. It&rsquo;s good to be walking again, although this short and limited route is quite boring and full of neighbor&rsquo;s dogs barking at me, so I&rsquo;m not too fond of it, but it&rsquo;s better to get the habit started again since I&rsquo;ve been feeling the fatness piling on due to the quarantine and the lack of exercise.

<p>Does Netflix have an open API? I remember looking around for it before but couldnt find any details.</p>
<p>Also any chance you could also serve rss feeds for new netflix shows/movies added per country?</p>

This week went by quickly, for some reason. And despite the fact that it&rsquo;s summer, the rains have started coming in early, although only sporadically. inb4 &ldquo;the world is healing&rdquo;
The COVID19 Diary is still being updated every few days. Actually went out 3 times this week, once for groceries, and twice for meds for the parental units (one would assume they would coordinate so I can just buy everything in one go, but nooooo.

I stopped updating the COVID19 Diary for a few days (last update was on Maunday Thursday), and I feel like that was a healthier choice overall. It helped that nothing significantly newsworthy happened over the long weekend. (Well, there&rsquo;s still thousands of deaths worldwide, but somehow our bar for &ldquo;significant&rdquo; has shifted quite a bit.)
Our lockdown has of course been extended to the end of April. I expect it will go beyond that though, likely the earliest chance for things to start going back to normal might be by June.

(Too late for the theatrical release, but it&rsquo;s tradition for comic book movies, so here we are.)
 Overall: Totally watchable, maybe slightly better than Suicide Squad for me. Somehow still fits into some kind of DCEU continuity (after Suicide Squad) the movie is really centered around Harley, to the detriment of the other characters. I can understand why they titled it the way they did, and I can appreciate the effort to have Harley carry a Birds of Prey introduction to the masses.

2020 Movies update: 7 movies watched in Feb. Probably the best movie I&rsquo;ve seen this month was Knives Out. (Jojo Rabbit close second.) The goal of 200 movies for the year is getting farther!
As for TV, I think most of my watching time was spent rewatching Rick and Morty for quiz purposes lol. Well, Criminal Minds ended, so there&rsquo;s that. Arrowverse has been meh, though I did enjoy Supergirl&rsquo;s 100th episode.

I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I should continue this watching-lately series since I already set up a separate page for listing my 2020 movies watched. It might have been more consistent to have a list for the 2020 TV shows also? But then again, TV shows are a much different beast, since each show/season is broken into an episode and sometimes you watch them all in one go or sometimes over the span of a few months.

Apparently I&rsquo;m not done looking back at the 2010s yet. I had some &ldquo;top tens of 2010s&rdquo; discussions with some friends recently, here are my personal lists, each in no particular order:
My Top Ten Movies of the 2010s  Avengers Endgame (2019).. I&rsquo;m keeping only one slot per franchise, so I had to choose an MCU movies for this. Runner-ups for this slot were Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America Winter Soldier, and individually either one of those movies might be around the same or better than Endgame, but Endgame is the culmination of a decade&rsquo;s worth of movies and gave me the most enjoyment as a comic book fan.

Been watching a lot of things this December.
I finally got back on The Expanse after finishing S1 more than a year ago. I only finished S2, but it was already a vast improvement over S1. S1 felt like a lot of meandering around until the characters actually ran into the plot. S2 was stronger, faster-paced, and there&rsquo;s always a lot of things going on in each episode. I really like this series now, looking forward to S3 and S4 when I have the time.

<p>I watched the most recent Star Wars last night. Spoiler-free review posted <a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/12/rise-of-skywalker/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since this ended the sequel trilogy and the entire &ldquo;Skywalker Saga&rdquo;, I thought it deserved a bit more spoilery discussion.</p>

<p>RISE OF SKYWALKER Spoiler-free review:</p>
<ul>
<li>the movie is fine and entertaining to watch</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a Star Wars movie, so you pretty much know what to expect, space wizards and space battles and such</li>
<li>pacing is frantic in the first act, and a bit in the second. Abrams has a lot of things he wants to do and limited time to do it, so things happen in rapid succession</li>
<li>the third act is basically an ode to <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, as a parallel to The Force Awakens&rsquo; ode to <em>A New Hope</em>. In fact, there is a lot of fanservice for original trilogy fans sprinkled throughout the movie.</li>
<li>it is not the best ending I could have imagined for the sequel trilogy, but it is an ending</li>
<li>there are a few twists and turns in the movie, but because it&rsquo;s Star Wars, you largely know what to expect from the overall plot</li>
<li>magugustuhan ba ni Mama: The movie is generally family-friendly (outside of the violence), but my mom doesn&rsquo;t like space battles and she would probably be confused by the rapid pace of events and all these characters she&rsquo;s not familiar with, so no.</li>
<li>I watched in IMAX 3D, but I don&rsquo;t think there was much noticeable 3D, the movie is probably perfectly fine without IMAX</li>
<li>there is no post-credits scene</li>
<li>I think I liked <em>The Last Jedi</em> more than this one</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a bit more <a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/12/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-spoilers/">spoilery comments posted here</a>.</p>

Nothing in the cinema this month (going to the cinema is expensive!). I did watch a couple of animated movies this month:
 Dragonball Super: Broly. I have some vague recollection of watching the original Broly movie, and I believe this one is much better. DBS Broly is a slightly more nuanced character than just &ldquo;random raging monster&rdquo; from the previous non-canon movie. The animation was okay, you could tell the animators were having fun with some of the battle parts.

Actually watched something in the cinema this month: Joker. I wasn&rsquo;t originally sure if I wanted to see it, I wasn&rsquo;t hyped for it at all in the months prior. But as the showing date came nearer, there was a lot of buzz around it so I decided to go anyway. I don&rsquo;t feel like it lived up to the hype and the warnings about promoting incel stuff, but at least it&rsquo;s one of the higher-grossing DC movies, so maybe we&rsquo;ll have more to come in that vein.

<p>JOKER spoiler-free review:</p>
<ul>
<li>very dark movie, not like any previous superhero movies at all; don&rsquo;t bring your kids</li>
<li>it is violent and potentially disturbing, but strangely not as much as the hype made it out to be</li>
<li>Joaquin Phoenix definitely gives a pretty good performance, but IDK about the supposed &ldquo;Oscar-worthy&rdquo; hype</li>
<li>some of the shots feels like the director definitely had a lot of fun bringing this story to life</li>
<li>I would have liked less connection to the Batman mythos so that this movie is more stand-alone. I mean, it is pretty much stand-alone, but it does remind you where it&rsquo;s set and direct connections to the Mythos exist</li>
<li>I think a lot of the story and plot elements are handled well, any concerns I have would largely be nitpicking</li>
<li>No post credits scene</li>
<li>i didnt watch in imax and don&rsquo;t think it would be relevant</li>
<li>magugustuhan ba ni mama: sure NO</li>
<li>Ultimately, I still prefer that Joker&rsquo;s origin story remain undetermined, as it makes him more akin to a natural force of chaos, but I accept this movie as a version that even canon Joker could have told and that might have been believable</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s definitely a better movie overall than Suicide Squad, Man of Steel or Dawn of Justice or Justice League, but it&rsquo;s also a different completely type of movie, so the comparison is difficult</li>
<li>I still like Ledger&rsquo;s Joker the best, the character is best opposite Batman</li>

I finally got around to watching X-Men Dark Phoenix which I skipped when it came out mainly because (a) poor reviews, and while normally I&rsquo;d have watched it anyway since I have not missed any of the X-Men movies in the cinema, not even the horrendous Wolverine Origins, there was also to consider that (b) I was in the US at the time and was only willing to spend my precious dollars on one expensive American cinema and Spider-man Far From Home won out.

<p>some weird character choices too. I mean, Erik&rsquo;s lackeys were basically random unknown mutants (I didn&rsquo;t even realize who Selene was supposed to be until she fell off the train). Not to mention the obscure Marvel alien race in the movie.</p>

Hmm, surprisingly I haven&rsquo;t watched too much stuff this month.
Eigasai I watched a Japanese film at Eigasai in UP Diliman for the first time ever, upon the invite of some friends. We saw One Cut of the Dead a comedy zombie film. It was great and it was hilarious, although you must make sure not to lose patience with the first thirty minutes. I went in blind not knowing anything about it other than &ldquo;Japanese comedy zombie movie&rdquo;, so you should too!

I was travelling for most of the past two months, so this covers both June and July, and I guess I haven&rsquo;t been able to watch too much. Maybe? IDK, we&rsquo;ll see.
Since I was in the US, I took the opportunity to finish watching Voltron: Legendary Defender which only had two seasons available on PH Netflix. Pretty good adaptation, lots of fun callbacks to the old series. Some annoying filler eps, especially in the middle seasons onwards.

I know I already made a whole post about the MCU after Endgame came out, but after the MCU Phase 4 announcements this past weekend at SDCC I was a bit hyped. I thought it would be fun to look back at the past 10 years of MCU Phase 1-3 and see what I wrote about the movies.
Iron Man (2008)
Surprisingly, I had written nothing about watching this film at all, and I don&rsquo;t remember going to the cinema to watch it.

First, the spoiler-free review, then more spoilery stuff afterwards.
 I watched Far From Home while I was&hellip; far from home. great movie, lots of fun, and the stakes are a lot higher than the Vulture just stealing some tech off Tony Stark basically a story of Peter Parker the high school student trying to juggle his Spider-Man problems with his high school life, which was one of the best eras of comic book Spider-Man the movie gives us a look at what the world looks like post-Endgame and how weird it is for everyone if you&rsquo;ve seen the trailers, you know who the &ldquo;villain&rdquo; is and you have certain expectations coming in.

The big TV thing of May 2019 was of course, the much maligned finale for Game of Thrones. I&rsquo;ve written about that separately here.
Most of the US TV series also ended their runs in May. Arrowverse show seasons were littered with poor writing as usual. I rank the seasons in this order:
 best is Legends of Tomorrow season 4. The reason Legends is the best is that they&rsquo;re not afraid to be outrageous.
