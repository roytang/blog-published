            &lt;p&gt;March has begun. Did it ever really end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vaccination finally starts in the country, with initial donated batches of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccine arriving in the country. Just in time for the one year anniversary of the world&amp;rsquo;s longest lockdown. SinoVac isn&amp;rsquo;t the best choice, but many of my doctor friends say they&amp;rsquo;ll settle for it if that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s available for them. I think QC is planning to use AstraZeneca for their citizens, but worrying is that AZ&amp;rsquo;s efficacy has been shown to be not so good against certain variants such as the South African one, which has already been detected in the country. Cases have been on the rise in the past couple of weeks as well, possibly due to the variants. We may very well be in a race against time now (maybe we always have been). The next month may be the most crucial phase of the pandemic for us, as vaccination drives hopefully kick into gear to try to overcome the accelerating spread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohhelloana.blog/catching-up-on-my-bookmarks/&#34;&gt;OhHelloAna.blog shared a whole bunch of bookmarks&lt;/a&gt;. Quite a few look interesting. Looking forward to going through this list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/&#34;&gt;Great article about cutting loading times in GTA&lt;/a&gt; went around last week. A case study in the problems with blindly relying on dependencies perhaps, and the complexities of C code performance, and even software performance in general.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rachel True had &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RachelTrue/status/1365461618977476610&#34;&gt;problems with iCloud&lt;/a&gt; after accidentally inputting her last name in lowercase. Feels like the sort of thing that can be maybe part of standard QA test suites? Hope she gets it resolved soon!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this fan video: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UngE0qn3VRY&#34;&gt;What if Wes Anderson directed X-Men?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/NonsenseIsland/status/1366449816042102787&#34;&gt;this thread on classical music in classic cartoons&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m no musical expert by any means, so it was even educational for me!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve switched back to doing digital sketches via Procreate, with kind of a different style this time? I kind of like it, more or less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today I was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/lzagfz/eli5_whats_the_difference_between_joules_watts/gq0i81h/?context=3&#34;&gt;mentioned via the u/hungryroy syntax on reddit&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. Not a big deal, I was just surprised lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally the pandemic and the quarantine hasn&amp;rsquo;t hit me as bad as other folks. My day to day routine hasn&amp;rsquo;t actually changed that much, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t really go out too often even pre-pandemic. That being said, I do miss being able to go out to places just to wander around, take my daily walk in a public place like &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1366349139559129088/&#34;&gt;the QC circle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/01/saturday-morning-up/&#34;&gt;the university campus&lt;/a&gt;, or even just loitering at the mall. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I miss being able to hang out with other people (although I do to some degree as well). More like I miss the ability to be outside, alone, in public, just sitting quietly and letting the universe wash over me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; is done! Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/wandavision/&#34;&gt;a spoiler-free review&lt;/a&gt;, something I used to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/spoiler-free-review/&#34;&gt;do more regularly&lt;/a&gt;. I have more spoiler-related thoughts, but they may be too much for this space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m almost done with season 2 of &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;, which means I&amp;rsquo;m about halfway through the series overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Flash&lt;/strong&gt; started its new season last week, but it feels like their episodes are like 90% nonsense now. (Used to be closer to 60% nonsense.). Second ep of &lt;strong&gt;Superman and Lois&lt;/strong&gt; was okay, although we are definitely getting more moody teenager problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run: still WIP. Moving forward slowly, ever so slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got last month&amp;rsquo;s Humble Choice, and decided to go ahead and install and try out some of the games in the bundle.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started by playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127610/Iris_and_the_Giant/&#34;&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice little tactical battle indie game with CCG mechanics &amp;ndash; think Slay the Spire, but with turn-based tactical RPG battles that can also feel very puzzle-like. I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying well-designed indie games recently, and this one seems to fall into that bucket. It has a unique, minimalist aesthetic and the story is about a young girl&amp;rsquo;s mental health? Maybe? I&amp;rsquo;ll know more if I actually managed to finish a run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also tried to play a game of &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/392110/Endless_Space_2/&#34;&gt;Endless Space 2&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not unfamiliar with 4X games of course, but this one was a bit confusing for me. In the one game where I managed to get anywhere, it felt like I was always behind in tech, and there&amp;rsquo;s so many indicators and UI elements on the different views that I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand. I can see there&amp;rsquo;s going to be a learning curve for this one, so it may take a few games for me to get the hang of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of Humble choice, the next one has Control as a showcase game, but I already got that off PS+, so I think I&amp;rsquo;m pausing on this one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday regular gaming group decided to play &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1015930/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/a&gt; again yesterday, and we found out there was new DLC so we all decided to buy that and try it out. Might do a review for this game this week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also did quite a few Starcraft 2 1v1s with friends this past week. I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself very proficient with SC2, mostly because I&amp;rsquo;m very micro-averse, but I still enjoy playing it. Maybe not ladder though. We recorded some of our games, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bINjaPjt1M&#34;&gt;the first one is up on the Team Camote youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;, if you&amp;rsquo;d like to watch me be terrible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of reasons, I browsed some Ludum Dare games the other day. My favorite is this short and simple one: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/a-monster-hunter-story&#34;&gt;A Monster Hunter Story&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Still very slowly reading cyberpunk classic &lt;em&gt;Neurmancer&lt;/em&gt; by William Gibson. I&amp;rsquo;m about halfway through, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I understand everything that&amp;rsquo;s going on. Might need to look for a recap later on. Still, I soldier on!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh, nothing. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s going to be one of those weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Pandemic thoughts and updates, Aug 9 edition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So, NCR got sent back into MECQ, a stronger quarantine lockdown. I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually felt the difference, since I&amp;rsquo;m at home most of the time. We went out yesterday for a grocery run, and not much seemed different out there either, still a lot of cars and people out of doors. I don&amp;rsquo;t actually remember what the last MECQ was like, but I kind of assumed things would be closer to how they were at the onset of the lockdowns in March, but this feels still mostly like the GCQ of past weeks. IDK if this 2-week MECQ stretch really serves any purpose except to show the government is trying something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching mass via Facebook again today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 126,885 cases (+4226 from the day before, +28653 from last week, huge jump week-on-week), 2,209 deaths (+41 from the day before, +170 from last week, thankfully not as big a jump as from last week), 67,117 recoveries (+287 from the day before, +1852 from last week, a predictably much smaller jump after last week&amp;rsquo;s miraculous &amp;ldquo;mass recoveries&amp;rdquo;). We hit record high daily deaths again over the first few days of the MECQ. We seem to have settled at a much higher average daily rate since then. Luckily, the death rate hasn&amp;rsquo;t gone up that much. We are now #1 in confirmed cases in SEA, overtaking Indonesia. The govt claims nothing to worry about, it&amp;rsquo;s only because we are testing more, but our relatively large positivity rate (around 8.6% as of this writing) implies transmission is outpacing testing? &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at around 19.8 cases (+1.8M from last week, slope holding steady for maybe 3 weeks now?) and almost 730k deaths. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Pandemic thoughts and updates, Aug 2 edition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We ended July with around 90k active cases. Despite the threat of sending Metro Manila back to ECQ if we breached the 85k mark, the govt did not push through. Over the weekend, this led to a clamor from doctors and other frontliners to have a &amp;ldquo;time out&amp;rdquo; of 2 weeks for the NCR, a temporary quarantine, to give the healthcare system some breathing room. The knee-jerk response from the palace was to say it wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessary, but they quickly flipped their flops and said the IATF would discuss it. Enraging people and doctors, a certain outspoken-on-social-media doctor tried to shame doctors for not being heroic enough, and a certain senator implied that we can&amp;rsquo;t afford it so frontliners just need to work harder and be more passionate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching mass via Facebook again today. Churches have actually been holding limited physical services, but in solidarity with the call for ECQ, they said they will temporarily suspend such services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went to get some Jollibee takeout last Thursday; apparently they are already allowing limited dine-in customers, that seems unwise, eh. Was anxious the entire time I was waiting for my takeout order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 98232 cases (+4963 from the day before, +19820 from last week, huge jump week-on-week), 2039 deaths (+17 from the day before, +142 from last week, moderate jump), 65265 recoveries (+93 from the day before, +39513 (!) from last week, a miraculous jump). We hit record high daily deaths over the past few days, and the huge spike in recoveries is because the DOH decided to do a &amp;ldquo;mass recovery&amp;rdquo; of mild/asymptomatic cases that are already 14 days or older, supposedly in line with WHO guidelines. I can kind of see some logic behind this, but the communication was not handled very well. &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at around 18M cases (+1.8M from last week) and almost 690k deaths. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Pandemic thoughts and updates, July 26 edition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching mass via Facebook again today. The nearby Church actually holds services, but last I heard it was only 10 people per mass, and need to call ahead of time. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem likely we&amp;rsquo;ll be going anytime soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grocery run yesterday, without incident&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;last Thursday I finally &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/1286105826743091201/&#34;&gt;got a haircut&lt;/a&gt; my last one was around New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day, so this was around six and a half months of hair cut off. I didn&amp;rsquo;t go to a barbershop, this was a home service haircut, care of a lady who works at a neighboring salon, who actually came over to do some home care service for my mom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 78412 cases (+2019 from the day before, +13108 from last week, slight acceleration week-on-week), 1897 deaths (+20 from the day before, +224 from last week, lower jump than last week), 25752 recoveries (+1278 from the day before, +3685 from last week, much less than last week&amp;rsquo;s jump). The admin claims that if we breach 85k cases by end-July, Metro Manila may go back to NCQ. First, that seems likely to happen so we&amp;rsquo;ll see. Second, it seems a bit unfair and illogical to make Metro Manila&amp;rsquo;s quarantine status dependent on national case numbers, but whatever. &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at 16.2M cases (+1.8M from last week, slight acceleration) and almost 650k deaths. The US retains a comfortable lead over second placer Brazil. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only left the house once all week, to get cash from an ATM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching mass via Facebook again today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A couple of weeks ago, someone I knew had someone in their household (a medical worker) test positive for the virus. Now everyone in their household is staying in separate rooms and eating separately while they wait to be tested. After a week and a half, out of 5 adults who need to be tested, only 2 have been tested and gotten their results (prioritized because they were seniors). How can we make decisions with this kind of lag on testing and getting results?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 65304 cases (+2357 from the day before, +11082 from last week, roughly same slope as last week), 1773 deaths (+113 from the day before, +401 from last week, this is a huge jump), 22067 recoveries (+321 from the day before, +8030 from last week, also a huge jump). &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at 14.4M cases (+1.6M from last week) and around 605k deaths. Three countries have now broken 1M cases: USA, Brazil and India. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Pandemic thoughts and updates, July 12 edition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;haven&amp;rsquo;t had a haircut since January. Been urged to go out and get one, but feels like an unnecessary risk. As a friend of mine said &amp;ldquo;Like, it&amp;rsquo;s one thing to get sick because I picked up groceries or something. Would feel really dumb to be intubated because I wanted a haircut&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did a grocery run yesterday. Not too crowded. Hopefully didn&amp;rsquo;t get sick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching mass via Facebook again today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 54222 cases (+1387 from the day before, +12392 from last week), 1372 deaths (+12 from the day before, +82 from last week), 14037 recoveries (+807 from the day before, +2584 from last week). Record high week for number of new cases. We broke past 2000 new daily cases this week, three times! One thing that still surprises me is how long recoveries take. Even though we only quarantine for 14 days if sick (in theory), many cases seem to be lasting a month or more. Like four weeks ago we only had 25k cases, but now we only have 14k recoveries, so there&amp;rsquo;s 11k active cases that have had the virus for four weeks now? It may also be due to a lag in testing, reporting and verifying recoveries I guess. I wish someone would come out with an analysis of all the deaths/recoveries to break down how long their cases lasted. &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at 12.8M cases (+1.5M from last week) and around 567k deaths. Rate of new cases accelerating worldwide as well. US and Brazil still a strong no. 1 and no. 2 respectively, India and Russia jostling for 3rd place. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Covid19 thoughts and updates, July 5 edition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did a small restaurant take-out run and mid-week mini-grocery run. Didn&amp;rsquo;t stay out too long. Ugh, not enough walking though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched mass via Facebook again today, after our internet came back. I&amp;rsquo;ve already deactivated Facebook, but Church pages are mostly public anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 41830 cases (+1494 from the day before, +7027 from last week), 1290 deaths (+10 from the day before, +54 from last week), 11453 recoveries (+380 from the day before, +2023 from last week). New cases still accelerating week-on-week, apparently even faster this time. Our death rate remains low, so that&amp;rsquo;s something. Is it because of the widespread mask usage? &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The presidential spokesperson, on the eve of July, struck a celebratory tone because we &amp;ldquo;beat&amp;rdquo; the prediction of UP experts that there would be 40k cases by the first of July. A &amp;ldquo;target&amp;rdquo; we barely met, and probably still crossed anyway due to late reporting/verification. He has rightfully been turned into a meme. Later in the week, he proceeded to go to a resort park to swim with dolphins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at 11.3M cases (+1.3M from last week) and around 533k deaths. Ten million! Brazil now a strong number 2, but still at only around half of US numbers. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wew, it&amp;rsquo;s almost July! It&amp;rsquo;s unlikely that the Metro Manila GCQ gets further loosened though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of new cases recently have been reported in Cebu/Region VII. Some dumbass things coming out of their local officials too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Haven&amp;rsquo;t had a haircut for 6 months now. People keep asking me when I&amp;rsquo;m getting one, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really seem essential?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did a grocery run Saturday afternoon. Surprisingly, fewer people than I expected. Still unable to find Choc-Nut in the grocery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had internet service people coming in this week, and a friend working in UK said to give them masks to wear and I was like &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous, of course they&amp;rsquo;ll bring their own.&amp;rdquo; Apparently the expectation is a lot different in the UK, unsurprisingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I wasn&amp;rsquo;t worried about having the masked strangers from the outside in our home&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite all of these precautions, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel quite a bit of anxiety visiting these medical facilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched mass via Facebook again today, after our internet came back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 34803 cases (+738 from the day before, +5403 from last week), 1236 deaths (+12 from the day before, +86 from last week), 9430 recoveries (+249 from the day before, +1780 from last week). New cases still accelerating week-on-week. I read somewhere that they&amp;rsquo;re planning to tweak how they report recoveries, presumably to make it look like we have less active cases? &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at 10,087,840 cases and around 501k deaths. Ten million! Once again roughly a million new cases during the week. USA still number one, but Brazil racing to catch up. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Covid19 thoughts and updates, June 21 edition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other day, a friend who doesn&amp;rsquo;t keep up with the news much said that it feels like the pandemic is no longer an urgent thing, and I think that says a lot about the general atmosphere in these parts. This in spite of the fact that our case counts continue to go up, accelerating even.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The president&amp;rsquo;s spokesman bravely says that at least we are doing better than the US; what standards, to be compared against the country with the worst response in the world. Maybe try comparing to New Zealand?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This past week I had to take my mom to the hospital and some clinics a couple more times. Again, nothing major, just regular tests and consults that had been pushed back due to quarantine. I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/covid19-06-14/&#34;&gt;our first hospital visit last week&lt;/a&gt;. The smaller clinic we went to for blood tests had less screenings at the entrance, but all the med techs were in full PPE. Their building also had these &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/foot-dispenser/&#34;&gt;nice foot-powered alcohol/hand sanitizer dispensers&lt;/a&gt;, pretty neat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite all of these precautions, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel quite a bit of anxiety visiting these medical facilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched mass via Facebook again today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GCQ in Metro Manila extended until Jun 30th. Probably the minimum right decision, but it also feels like we&amp;rsquo;re just pushing back because we don&amp;rsquo;t know what else to do (because no mass testing, poor data management etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 29400 cases (+943 from the day before, +4107 from last week), 1150 deaths (+20 from the day before, +76 from last week), 7650 recoveries (+272 from the day before, +1265 last week). Thankfully a lot more recoveries this week. &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at almost 9 million cases and around 466,000 deaths. Looks like we aren&amp;rsquo;t slowing down with roughly a million new active cases per week? Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aside from doing another grocery run this weekend, I also accompanied my mom to the hospital last Saturday. Nothing major, just a consult that had been put off due to all of this. Before letting us into the hospital, there were the usual temperature checks, but they also had us fill up a form with name, address and contact details, I assume for contact tracing purposes. We waited for a couple of hours in the doctor&amp;rsquo;s queue (my mom was only there to get a referral, which in itself only took like 5 minutes). The hospital was mostly empty, we didn&amp;rsquo;t see any actual sick patients in most of the waiting areas I think. Seating was limited - they had blocked off the seat rows such that only 2 out of every 4 seats was usable. I was super anxious about touching anything, and probably used hand sanitizer at least 5 times during the visit. Their canteen was open, I only went in to get some water while waiting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched mass via Facebook again today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GCQ in Metro Manila was supposedly only up to the 15th. It&amp;rsquo;s the 14th, and we still don&amp;rsquo;t know what happens after that. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure the IATF has already announced their recommendations. There are rumors going around that we may get sent back to ECQ. Some authorities are saying limited restaurant dine-in will be available this week. In spite of this, my mom already scheduled some tests at the hospital, a result of the referral consult I mentioned earlier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 25293 cases (+607 from the day before, +4052 from last week), 1074 deaths (+22 from the day before, +80 from last week), 5706 recoveries (+252 from the day before, +1265 last week). Jumps slightly lower than last week, except for recoveries which are about the same, so that&amp;rsquo;s good news. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what happens next week. &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at 7.8+ million cases and 432,000 deaths. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Covid19 thoughts and updates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one week into ECQ. I went out for a walk outside the subdivision last Thursday, just to see what it was like. First time walking outside since I did a meds run for the folks in April. What I saw: lots of people and cars already in the streets, just like it was pre-virus. Of course this time, around 95% of people are masked. (Maybe 1 in 10 weren&amp;rsquo;t wearing their masks correctly though.). I went into the nearby Jollibee to see what it was like. Not as many people inside, and the guard took my temp told me to stand aside before later motioning me to get into a particular queue. The queues are spaced (should have taken pictures), and there&amp;rsquo;s tables in front of the cashiers to keep you from getting too close. Anyway, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll still keep my walks limited to my subdivision; much too many people outside for my comfort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched mass via Facebook again today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 21340 cases (+714 from the day before, +7563 (!!!) from last week), 994 deaths (+7 from the day before, +131 (!!) from last week), 4441 recoveries (+111 from the day before, +1264 last week). &amp;ldquo;Last week&amp;rdquo; numbers slightly lower because it&amp;rsquo;s only been 6 days since the last report. Basically an explosion in confirmed cases; over 50% jump from last week. Large jumps in deaths and recoveries too, thought not as alarmingly large as the cases. Regardless of the DoH&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;tardy&amp;rdquo; / &amp;ldquo;fresh&amp;rdquo; massaging of the data, it looks bad, and the explosion in cases kind of aligns with the last days of the ECQ. I expect another spike in another two weeks. &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are almost at 7 million cases and 400,000 deaths. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;. The protests in the US and worldwide might speed up these numbers in a week or so, though hopefully the virus doesn&amp;rsquo;t spread as easily in open air. (And at least many of the protesters this time are masked, as compared to the the ones protesting before about not being able to get haircuts).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metro Manila is lower restrictions again and going into ECQ tomorrow, June the 1st. Only a two week MECQ transition period, and not really any time to evaluate what the effect that has had on the case numbers. This is reopening for the sake of the economy, without regard for the medical data. I&amp;rsquo;m still not going out. Public transportation will still be limited, so I kind of expect chaos Monday morning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of medical data, the DOH has changed the way they report new cases, now dividing them into &amp;ldquo;fresh&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;tardy&amp;rdquo; cases. The tardy ones are the ones that were delayed by 4 or more days due to validation or some other reason. This seems like propaganda to make things seem not so bad, especially since there have been an explosion of cases in the past few days, probably as a result of lowering restrictions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched mass via Facebook again today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went out for groceries this past Saturday. Had to do it on a weekend, since my dad drives the car to work on weekdays now and we need that for groceries. Surprisingly, a bunch of things that were always out of stock the past couple of months were available this time around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lazada is back to shipping non-essentials again, and I&amp;rsquo;ve already &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/hyperx-cloud2/&#34;&gt;ordered a thing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 13777 cases (+180 from the day before, +1264 from last week), 863 deaths (+6 from the day before, +39 from last week), 3177 recoveries (+85 from the day before, +542 last week). &amp;ldquo;Last week&amp;rdquo; numbers slightly lower because it&amp;rsquo;s only been 6 days since the last report. Maybe I should be monitoring the active cases too? Apparently our active case count has never dropped, and the DOH backlog in confirming cases is only getting larger. &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 18086 cases (+862 from the day before, +4309 from last week), 957 deaths (+7 from the day before, +94 from last week), 3909 recoveries (+101 from the day before, +732 last week). The case numbers are exploding in growth, presumably because the DOH is catching up to the backlog, but that&amp;rsquo;s still super unsettling. &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at 6.2 million cases and 372,000 deaths. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are officially one week deep into Modified ECQ. It should be a couple of weeks before the cases start picking up again, but we are already seeing a lot of traffic and crowds and such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lazada is back to shipping non-essentials again, and I&amp;rsquo;ve already &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/hyperx-cloud2/&#34;&gt;ordered a thing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I feel compelled to share &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10158571281328991&amp;amp;id=827533990&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by a friend of mine dubbing a certain local &amp;ldquo;expert&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;Science Mocha&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My dad started going back to work last Wednesday. He says they have strict screenings and rules so that&amp;rsquo;s good. They don&amp;rsquo;t let anyone go out unless they&amp;rsquo;re already going home for the day, so he has to bring &lt;em&gt;baon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We did a grocery run the day before he went back to work. Not sure if it was because we went earlier, but it felt like there were slightly fewer shoppers that time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 13777 cases (+180 from the day before, +1264 from last week), 863 deaths (+6 from the day before, +39 from last week), 3177 recoveries (+85 from the day before, +542 last week). &amp;ldquo;Last week&amp;rdquo; numbers slightly lower because it&amp;rsquo;s only been 6 days since the last report. Maybe I should be monitoring the active cases too? Apparently our active case count has never dropped, and the DOH backlog in confirming cases is only getting larger. &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at 5.3 million cases and 340,000 deaths. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Covid19 thoughts and updates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I heard mass again via the Quiapo church website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ECQ in Metro Manila officially ended last Friday, and we are now on the supposedly slightly-less-strict &amp;ldquo;Modified ECQ&amp;rdquo;, where selected industries are now allowed to open, etc. But yesterday, the first day of MECQ, reports came in about traffic on the highways and lots of people flocking to the malls. I guess people got tired of being cooped up, which is not unexpected. The government messaging has not been very tight about the reopening, they should have made much clearer that despite the loosening of restrictions we should still take precautions and not go out unless absolutely essential. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s an indicator that many people were not staying in because they wanted to avoid spreading the virus, but rather because they had nowhere to go. I jokingly told some friends that maybe we should require something like a P1000 entrance fee to the malls. This would be terribly elitist, but honestly I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;d say no at this point. Fully expecting chaos tomorrow, the first Monday of MECQ. &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/nobody-knows-for-sure-whats-going-to-happen/&#34;&gt;Nobody knows for sure what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen&lt;/a&gt;, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if we get our second wave and possible tightened lockdown again in maybe a month?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://news.abs-cbn.com/ancx/culture/spotlight/05/16/20/the-philippines-now-has-the-highest-covid-19-fatality-rate-and-lowest-recovery-rate-in-the-asean&#34;&gt;The Philippines now has the highest COVID-19 fatality rate and lowest recovery rate in ASEAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stayed in the whole week, although I&amp;rsquo;ve started doing short walks just outside our house for around 30 mins, never leaving the subdivision. I&amp;rsquo;m doing it in the early mornings, when there are fewer people around. (There&amp;rsquo;s very few people around during the day too!). A sort of prelude to getting back in the habit I guess?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of today, we are at 12513 cases (+208 from yesterday, +1720 from last week), 824 deaths (+7 from yesterday, +105 from last week), 2635 recoveries (+74 from yesterday, +711 last week). Gain in active cases slightly higher from last week. &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at 4.7 million cases and 313,000 deaths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I mean, that&amp;rsquo;s true in general of course. But it certainly seems much more true in these &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/covid19/&#34;&gt;pandemic times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before all of this &lt;em&gt;waves hands arounds frantically&lt;/em&gt;, people had a general sense of routine and predictability about their daily lives. It varied person by person of course, but many people had regular things like a steady job that kept them occupied for most of the week, a school where their kids could go off to most days, maybe a favorite bar or restaurant they visit every week or so, church on Sundays, friends you saw every other weekend or so, malls or stores they would pass by regularly, and so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I had a generally looser schedule than most, I was still often able to plot out my coming days with relative accuracy. Oh, I have a client meeting on this day. Then the next day I have to run these errands. Then meeting up with friends (maybe for a quiz night) the evening after. On the weekend a visit with my brothers and the nieces. That kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I would have had some fairly safe medium-term predictions too. If you had asked me at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/01/new-years-checklist/&#34;&gt;start of the year&lt;/a&gt;, I would have thought I&amp;rsquo;d have seen the Black Widow movies by now, played Final Fantasy VII Remake, and got together with the family in April to celebrate birthdays. But none of those came to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, that kind of reasonable prediction seems like a distant memory. Weeks come and go and all the days seem to blend in together, each one indistinguishable from the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about writing something about what to expect down the road, or the &amp;ldquo;new normal&amp;rdquo; or what not, but (a) so many people (many of whom I&amp;rsquo;m sure are better qualified) are already writing things like that; and (b) I think a lot of it is largely pointless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have all these models and graphs and projections coming out, with varying degrees of reliability. They tell us things like, there will be M cases and N deaths by so-and-so date unless we do this or that. Each model is slightly different, depending on many factors like the country being studied or the data being analyzed and such. And maybe they&amp;rsquo;re right. Surely at least some of them are, right? But all of these are, to make a software development analogy, estimates. Some are certainly more accurate than others - it falls to our individual discernment whether we choose to believe experts and scientists or populist politicians or whatever - but in the end, all of them are still just estimates. Trend-spotting based on data that is probably largely incomplete (certainly so in the case of my own country). And just like estimates, there&amp;rsquo;s no way to know for certain which will turn out to be correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of all the models and trends and predictions, the future remains incredibly hazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many cases will we end up with? How many deaths? All as of yet unknown, but almost certainly far too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will we have a vaccine this year? Next year? In 2022? No one knows for sure. There are many vaccines and treatments in development, but we won&amp;rsquo;t know for a while which ones will turn out effective, if any. There may never be a permanent vaccine, the same way we don&amp;rsquo;t have one for the common cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will there be a second wave? Seems likely. Will it be under control? Who knows. Even countries we previously thought to be doing well are in danger of a possible resurgence, so what then? How much more countries like us that have done far worse in controlling the spread?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will the ECQ in Metro Manila be lifted after the 15th? Nobody knows, even up to now, a mere 5 days before the deadline. And if it is lifted, what happens then? There are people counting down to the ECQ lifting as if it would be &amp;ldquo;back to normal&amp;rdquo;, I can&amp;rsquo;t say it will be, but it almost certainly shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be. Maybe there will be an explosion of people, tired of being cooped up in their houses, and a corresponding explosion of cases, and we are forced to go back to a stricter lockdown. That&amp;rsquo;s my guess, but again, nothing is certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When will people be able to go back to work? When will your favorite restaurant be open again? When will you get to meet up with friends again? When can I travel to other countries again? All of these, nobody knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joke with my parents and brothers that the next time we&amp;rsquo;ll be seeing each other in person again would probably be in August during my birthday month, but something that far off might not come to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And people are talking about what the &amp;ldquo;new normal&amp;rdquo; is going to be like. That we might have to live with social distancing precautions in the medium-to-long term moving forward. We may be looking at months or maybe even years of social distancing measures. Or cycles of lockdown and loosening, until there is a widespread vaccine, or maybe forever? All distinct possibilities, but again, there&amp;rsquo;s no certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are people that say humanity is going to learn our lesson from this crisis and realize that so many things we previously accepted in our daily life are BS that we can do without. Short list: overpopulation, inequality, low pay for essential workers, work commutes, dress codes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies will see that work from home is effective, so it will be more common moving forward! The anecdotal reports of companies implementing draconian surveillance schemes to monitor their remote workers makes me doubt that one actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t buy that this crisis will change society for the better (though I am more than willing to be surprised). Many humans are too set in their ways and can&amp;rsquo;t even be bothered to endure minor inconveniences like wearing a mask to costco or whatever. And there are many who can&amp;rsquo;t wait to be right back there sucking at the fresh teat of capitalism, instead of maybe looking for alternatives that promote and protect the commons instead of exploiting the vulnerable. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong - there are many positive and hopeful stories coming out of this pandemic, of people helping other people get by - that heighten my faith in humanity. My faith in humanity&amp;rsquo;s leadership and elite, however, is probably at an all-time low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the models and projections and predictions for the new normal, these things are useful at the policymaking levels. But for those of us just living our every day lives, it is difficult to look so far ahead. Right now, we are roiling about in a sea of uncertainty, unsure of what the future brings. All we can worry about will be what the next day looks like. Maybe the best we can do right now is just to take it one step at a time, and hope that we are making the right decisions to build towards a new normal that will actually be better than the last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post turned out more ranty than I thought it would be.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Covid19 thoughts and updates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previously: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/covid19/&#34;&gt;COVID19 Diary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the government decided to shut down ABS CBN, me and my Tita heard Sunday mass today via GMA at 5:30am&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went out once this week for a grocery run. Should be enough to last us for 2 weeksish. The grocery actually seemed less chaotic than usual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early this morning (after the mass) I took a walk outside for the first time since the lockdown started. Previously I had only gone out for groceries and meds. Only for less than 30 mins, and only in our subdivision, walking up and down the street. It&amp;rsquo;s good to be walking again, although this short and limited route is quite boring and full of neighbor&amp;rsquo;s dogs barking at me, so I&amp;rsquo;m not too fond of it, but it&amp;rsquo;s better to get the habit started again since I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling the fatness piling on due to the quarantine and the lack of exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still no word on what happens to Metro Manila after the ECQ &amp;ldquo;ends&amp;rdquo; on the 15th. The mayors gave a bunch of options to the IATF that basically amounted to &amp;ldquo;whatever, we can&amp;rsquo;t decide&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s this great site showing the progress of different countries in battling the pandemic: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.endcoronavirus.org/countries&#34;&gt;End Coronavirus .org&lt;/a&gt;. While some of our leadership are claiming we have already flattened the curve, comparing our data to other countries shows we still clearly need improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The government is already preparing guidelines for when we shift to GCQ like only 150 passengers per MRT train (good luck with that!) and so on. This implies that they are leaning towards shifting from ECQ to the more lenient GCQ already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We really have no data to indicate that the pandemic is under control in NCR, so lifting the ECQ would probably be dangerous, if not outright foolish. That being said, another question is how much longer people can take being under ECQ at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social distancing in some barangays in QC &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/PhilstarNews/status/1259388201950568449&#34;&gt;went out the window today&lt;/a&gt;, as it&amp;rsquo;s the last day for distributing the social assistance funds to those in need. The QC government has had a lot of trouble distributing aid to their residents, which might be explained away by the sheer size of the city (and the fact that administrative support for a population does not scale linearly). I wonder what the statistics are re: number of government employees vs number of citizens per city in Metro Manila? In any case, large-scale logistics has never been the strong point of the Philippine government, at any level. This kind of chaos really holds us back as a society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Word has it that there were a lot of cars outside today, presumably people buying food to celebrate Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day? For us, we just held a zoom call with the grandkids as usual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of today, we are at 10793 cases (+184 from yesterday), 719 deaths (+15 from yesterday), 1924 recoveries (+82 from yesterday). We&amp;rsquo;re still gaining more than 1,500 active cases a week, although a lot of those are now in the provinces. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if there&amp;rsquo;s a data source I can use that shows the trends for NCR only? &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at 4 million cases and 280,000 deaths. A full 1/3rd of all worldwide cases and 2/7ths of all deaths are in the US, which is still raring to reopen for the sake of the economy. We might be watching a tragedy unfold slowly in real-time over there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This post will largely be about the effects of the COVID-19 virus on my country, the Philippines, including government and society&amp;rsquo;s response, largely from a personal POV. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a bit difficult to write about, but I figure it&amp;rsquo;s something I would like to be able to look back on in the future, so let&amp;rsquo;s give it a shot. The reason it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to write about is that events are unfolding and changing rapidly, and a lot of things are still unclear. On top of that, there is anxiety to contend with, and all the news can make it difficult to think. And so we write, both as a record of events and to help clear my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was originally going to write about the recent COVID-19 virus happenings during this week&amp;rsquo;s weeknotes, but I ended up writing so many words about it, so I decided to make a separate type of post. And its a new type of post, one that I tagged under &amp;ldquo;diaries&amp;rdquo;. The post is being published early on the 15th, but the intent is I will be updating this post as events unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;january-the-29th-govt-says-no-travel-ban-needed&#34;&gt;January the 29th: Govt says no travel ban needed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/250506-coronavirus-scare-travel-ban-mainland-chinese-not-for-now-duque&#34;&gt;Even with coronavirus scare, no mainland Chinese travel ban for now – Duque&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/1/29/duterte-on-china-travel-ban.html&#34;&gt;Duterte not keen on banning travel to China amid coronavirus scare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/1/30/Philippines-coronavirus-case.html&#34;&gt;Philippines confirms first case of novel coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;february-the-2nd-travel-ban-from-china&#34;&gt;February the 2nd: Travel ban from China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;march-the-7th-first-confirmed-local-case&#34;&gt;March the 7th: First confirmed local case&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2020/03/07/1998804/philippines-has-first-local-case-covid-19&#34;&gt;Philippines has first local case of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;march-the-9th-president-declares-public-health-emergency&#34;&gt;March the 9th: President declares public health emergency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;march-9th-march-11th&#34;&gt;March 9th-March 11th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locally, our country had a very small number of confirmed cases coming into the last week, I think it was at around 20 or less before Sunday the 8th. And only 1 confirmed death. The president had previously addressed the country in some kind of incoherent drunken rant that didn&amp;rsquo;t say much but was easily repurposed by internet memers into some kind of spoken word poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a shortage of face masks. People are reminded to wash their hands regularly and practice social distancing when possible. The DOH claimed we had everything under control. &lt;em&gt;Eat Bulaga&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Showtime&lt;/em&gt; have been running shows without a live studio audience. Life was still mostly normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But during this week, more and more cases were reported, in ever-increasing quantities. As of Saturday (the 14th) night, we were up to 111 confirmed cases and I think 8 deaths, with 40+ reported during that day alone. That fatality rate of around 7%, is way higher than the global 1-3%, which is a good indicator of how many unreported cases we probably have locally, due to the severe lack of testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thursday-march-the-12th-lockdown-announced&#34;&gt;Thursday, March the 12th: Lockdown announced&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explosive growth in cases finally made the government take drastic action; around Thursday lunchtime, rumors started circulating in online circles that the authorities were planning a lockdown of the National Capital Region. This included a leaked memo listing the recommendations that the president would have to decide on. Many details were not known, like what exactly would happen in such a lockdown. What we did know was that the lockdown would start reportedly start on Sunday, the 15th and would last for 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markets did not take the rumors well. Shortly before closing, the Philippine Stock Exchange circuit breaker was triggered after the index had dropped more than 10% on the day. The index recovered slightly before closing at around -9.x%. It was a bloodbath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my late afternoon walk I decided to pass by the nearby grocery because there had already been reports of large crowds. Sure enough there were way more people than usual. I really only wanted to get Tostitos dip, but they were out of stock of that. Why were people hoarding it? Alcohol and hand sanitizer were out of stock as well, as expected. From the chatter I overheard, people were well aware of the rumored announcement later that day. My parents weren&amp;rsquo;t planning to do our weekly grocery run until Friday night, but I decided to pick up a few essentials (bread, eggs, canned goods, etc) early since I was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A press conference was announced for around 6-630pm. True to form, the conference only started around a couple of hours late. Most of it consisted of the president telling the people to listen to the health authorities, reading out the details of the memo (exactly the one that was leaked, leaving many questions), in his usual annoying rambling style. (To his benefit, he seemed way more lucid than his last public speech.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lockdown covered Metro Manila, banning domestic travel over land, sea, and air. International travel was still around. The press conference did not provide any details of how the lockdown would be enforced or any plan for increased testing or support for health care front-liners or new health care supplies. No details of how people who live outside the NCR but work there during the day would be handled. No word on support programs for people who will lose paying work because of the arrangements. The president did not acknowledge the efforts of public health care workers, but instead for some reason, decided to thank China for supposedly supporting us. (Even though the virus came from them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of my group chats are abuzz, discussing the turn of events and the lack of details, with the general consensus being: &lt;em&gt;ANG LABO!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A doctor friend reports that she has been in quarantine and is awaiting results of the COVID19 test because she was in contact with possible carriers. We wish her good luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people I knew had flown out of the NCR to the provinces for some R&amp;amp;R and their flight back would be from Saturday night to Sunday early morning, so they would be caught by the lockdown. I jokingly said that since international flights weren&amp;rsquo;t banned, they could just fly out to Malaysia or such, then fly back in to NAIA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I note that on this day, 16 new confirmed cases were reported, while 9 and 4 cases were reported the two days prior. This implies to me that we&amp;rsquo;re looking at 25 cases the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My opinion: I general accept that the lockdown is probably necessary, but not with the implied threat of police/military action. Focus should be on improving testing and healthcare resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;friday-march-the-13th&#34;&gt;Friday, March the 13th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Friday the 13th! This morning, the PSE circuit breaker triggers again, mere minutes after trade opens. The markets did not like last night&amp;rsquo;s announcements either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/1238286699706200064/&#34;&gt;Twitter tells us&lt;/a&gt; that the MRT officials have started applying social distancing rules, only letting a limited number of people on the trains per station. This results in very long lines outside the stations, kind of negating the social distancing anyway. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I&amp;rsquo;m no longer a regular commuter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend to my parents to do the regular grocery run earlier, and as a result I have to accompany my mom on the trip, just after lunch. Even then, the nearby grocery was packed, with maybe 200% more people than the usual peak. Sanitation items like hand sanitizer and alcohol were out of stock. Eggs were too for some reason (luckily I had already bought some the day before). Common canned goods were still on shelves, but the more popular ones were in short supply. The &amp;ldquo;panic buying&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t as much as we see reported in other countries where many shelves are bare. Friends who go to larger groceries like SNR report 2-hr wait times at the checkout line. Ours takes around 30 mins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokespersons for different government agencies have begun issuing statements clarifying how things will actually work during the lockdown &amp;ndash; excuse me, &amp;ldquo;community quarantine&amp;rdquo;. The air and sea restrictions are pretty clear, but the land restrictions seem impossible to implement without massive traffic. The intent is to have checkpoints at roads in and out of the metro, and to inspect passengers one by one to make sure their trips are essential. There is still no plan on how to support people who cannot work due to the lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local churches announce suspension of mass services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group chats are abuzz all day with discussions such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how their companies are preparing for WFH. Some of my friends work at a company with over 200 people and they had been preparing a business continuity plan during the week, but last night&amp;rsquo;s announcements have accelerated plans. They need to purchase laptops and pocket wifis for those who don&amp;rsquo;t have hardware or internet at home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disinfectant alternatives due to lack of supply of alcohol and hand sanitizer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;word is a doctor at the Philippine Heart Center has been intubated because a patient lied about her travel history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My doctor friend happily reports that she has tested negative, but that she still has to stay quarantined for 14 days. Our healthcare system will not survive any uptick in cases which causes large swathes of our medical professionals to be taken out of play for 2 weeks at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I note the strong parallels between Trump and Duterte&amp;rsquo;s approaches: both held disastrous press conferences that resulted in markets crashing!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell everyone that since things are unclear, just stay home as much as possible. I am privileged enough that I can largely follow this advice, and many of my friends work in industries where WFH is viable. The ones who will be disproportionally affected are the poor - the ones who can&amp;rsquo;t afford not to work or have no way to work remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mayor of Quezon City has declared a state of calamity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the trading day, the PSE has managed to recover a bit, closing at +1.x% up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only 3 new confirmed cases are reported today, defying my pattern recognition skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;saturday-march-the-14th&#34;&gt;Saturday, March the 14th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Pi day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a small extended family lunch gathering today, mostly as a send-off to some &lt;em&gt;balikbayan&lt;/em&gt; relatives who are flying back to the US in a couple of weeks. The gathering was originally scheduled for Sunday, but because of the announcement we rescheduled to Saturday to avoid complications. Fewer people are able to attend, and we just have takeout instead of going to a restaurant as originally planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, there is a presscon where the MMDA/PNP/some mayors are talking about a one month curfew from 8PM-5AM. The interior secretary threatens arrest for those who refuse to go home during the curfew. This causes a mix of reactions on social media and in the group chats. During the time I was still a regular commuter, by 8PM I would not have been able to get on a bus yet. The authorities are also requesting that malls close except for essential services such as supermarkets, banks and pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strain in the healthcare system is starting to show. Multiple reports of healthcare personnel lacking alcohol, hand sanitizer, gloves, and other personal protective equipment (PPE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local media giant ABS-CBN announces their hit primetime dramas are going off the air starting next week, to be replaced by reruns. Finally, a villain that &lt;em&gt;Ang Probinsyano&lt;/em&gt; is unable to defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All day there are reports of massive crowds at the bus stations of people planning to leave the metro before the lockdown. The exodus is worse than Christmas or Holy Week holidays. Airline ticketing offices are also swamped with people looking for refunds and rebookings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the evening, they start rolling back the curfew announcement, saying it was just recommendations, and that the MMDA has no authority to impose a curfew, unless the LGUs pass ordinances to enable such. PCOO&amp;rsquo;s Andanar calls such reports &amp;ldquo;fake news&amp;rdquo;. (Never mind that the government people were live on TV talking about it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the day, 47 new confirmed cases had been reported, for a total of 111. (If my pattern recognition had held, today would have seen 36 new cases. Not too far off.) Some posts from healthcare workers suggest that some of the new cases are from the poorer Payatas and BASECO areas. An outbreak in those areas would be really bad, as the spread would be very difficult to control. And the tests are delayed by about two days - by now many people may have been infected in those areas. The DOH is yet to release details of the new cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late in the evening, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ANCALERTS/status/1238843668485685248&#34;&gt;NCRPO announces&lt;/a&gt; that instead of checkpoints, they will just implement increased police visibility at the metro exit points. Thread says they had meetings late into the night, I suspected they realized how ridiculous the original plan was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we near the start of the lockdown, only the LGU of Muntinlupa has confirmed a curfew, starting Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes increasingly clear how poor the planning and coordination for this event was, that they are just ironing out details and making plans up more or less on the fly. We had weeks where they were saying not to worry and things were under control, that time should have been spent preparing for contingencies such as this. This does not inspire confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minor annoyance: social media people who say we should just obey without question. We don&amp;rsquo;t have to obey dumbass rules!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, my intent is just to stay at home as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-march-the-15th&#34;&gt;Sunday, March the 15th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard mass online through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/quiapochurch/&#34;&gt;facebook page of the Quiapo Church&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayala and Robinson&amp;rsquo;s malls have announced that their Metro Manila malls will be closing indefinitely starting tomorrow. SM malls announced a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TheSMStore/status/1239123144851390464&#34;&gt;similar closure except limited to a few cities and areas&lt;/a&gt;, Quezon City not included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayor Belmonte has &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/notes/quezon-city-government/mayor-joy-belmonte-on-declaration-of-public-safety-hours-in-quezon-city/226925012028597/&#34;&gt;declared a curfew in Quezon City&lt;/a&gt; starting Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A family friend has been suffering from a fever for a couple of days but refuses to go to the hospital for checkups. His two daughters, both doctors, are reportedly very exasperated at his stubbornness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently the US has &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/amanbatheja/status/1239175709823819776&#34;&gt;attempted to acquire exclusive rights to a possible vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. Capitalism ho!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lockdown is generally going smoothly. I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone was questioning the need of course. The real challenge in implementation will be tomorrow when people start going to work. My earlier expectation of general chaos, confusion and traffic has been tempered by the fact that the NCRPO supposedly reduced it to just police visibility instead of hard checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Sunday evening, we are at 140 cases (+29) and 12 fatalities, around 8.5% fatality rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of my friends however are quite worried about whether the police are sanitizing themselves after every check. If not, they might well become another vector for spreading the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t left the house since the grocery run on Friday. I&amp;rsquo;m considering resuming my afternoon walks starting tomorrow. I mean, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably be fine right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some handy trackers: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ncovtracker.doh.gov.ph/&#34;&gt;https://ncovtracker.doh.gov.ph/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;https://covid19ph.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monday-march-the-16th-enhanced-community-quarantine-announced&#34;&gt;Monday, March the 16th: Enhanced community quarantine announced&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, throngs of people out in the streets trying to commute to work. So much for social distancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go out for a quick medicine run (to ensure I have one month&amp;rsquo;s worth). The nearby drugstore is less crowded than the last time I passed by, although still well above expectations for the early afternoon hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A THREAD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        






    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the people in my group chats are starting to get overwhelmed by anxiety at the mishandling of the situation. I send them the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not saying we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take things seriously and/or prepare for the worst, I&amp;rsquo;m saying be mindful of your mental health by exposing yourself to too much anxiety and worry. i&amp;rsquo;m sure each of us here is already doing as much as possible to avoid risk/exposure for us and our families, it&amp;rsquo;s ok to step back from all the updates every so often&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word starts to spread that the government is meeting to plan a heightened lockdown. A press conference is announced for this afternoon. It seems like they announced the presscon even before the meeting starts, which means they have a presumption that an announcement will be needed. I expect that meeting to run long, most likely it will be this early to mid evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/gmanews/posts/10158510980196977&#34;&gt;breaking news post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUST IN: Presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo says President Duterte has ordered an enhanced community quarantine of entire Luzon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under enhanced community quarantine, the government says strict home quarantine will be implemented in all households, transportation will be suspended and provision for food and essential health services will be regulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of uniformed personnel to enforce quarantine procedures will be heightened under enhanced community quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kind of slept through the actual announcements. Tighter lockdown as expected. No more going to work, only essential travel. No public transpo. Outbound international travellers have 3 days to get to their flights (luckily my &lt;em&gt;balikbayan&lt;/em&gt; relative had previously decided to panic-rebook to this Thursday, just inside the window). Luzon-wide travel ban. Food distribution etc. Looks like a lot of the implementation problems are being left to the LGUs to decide. Government asking landlords, etc to defer rents, business to advance 13th month pay if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of edge cases seem unhandled, mostly for poor people without cars: how do they get to groceries, hospitals? How do healthcare workers without cars get to the hospitals? Etc. Some of the people in my chat groups are very pessimistic and are worried about the implementation of food distribution and other support for the poor. If not implemented properly, could lead to social unrest. I suspect we&amp;rsquo;re going to see another major announcement within 1-2 days to iron out some details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading at the PSE is suspended until further notice. Just as well - otherwise we might be in for daily bloodbaths. Stocks were down 7.9% today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news is only 2 confirmed cases today, and no additional deaths. One of the new cases is Senator Zubiri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increased lockdown is harsh, but might be necessary for containment at this point, given the earlier mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuesday-march-the-17th&#34;&gt;Tuesday, March the 17th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I caught part of the morning DZMM program with Noli de Castro, he&amp;rsquo;s complaining about how unclear the details of the enhanced lockdown is. He speaks to a field reporter on Commonwealth who says there are still a few jeeps running but MMDA personnel are flagging them down telling them they can&amp;rsquo;t run their routes. Those with full passenger loads are told to complete one last pass then that&amp;rsquo;s it. There are a lot of commuters on the road trying to get a rare ride. The reporter interviews a security guard for a hospital who says he&amp;rsquo;s been waiting to get a ride for 1.5 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Castro calls up the mayor of Paranaque (Edwin Olivares, also chair of the Metro Manila Mayors group), who tells him the implementation details are mostly dependent on the LGU. As for those who still need to work (like the security guard above) and don&amp;rsquo;t have cars, they have no choice but to walk. (&lt;em&gt;Sakripisyo daw&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mid-day, a friend reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just got back from buying supplies and delivering to my aunt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lots of ppl at the banks that I passed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;line at the grocery was long&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;line at the other grocery on anonas was hella long just to get in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a fair number of people just walking along the streets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;saw one jeepney and a couple tricycles&amp;hellip; maybe friends of brgy officials? who knows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;saw very few cops. they must be at the entry and exit points between cities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a car, it almost feels like holy week back in the 80s, when everything would be closed, but there are still some people going about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News comes out that last night, the President declared a state of calamity for the entire country. My understanding of this is that it&amp;rsquo;s mainly to unlock use of calamity funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OVP has set up transportation support for frontliners starting tomorrow. The military will also be deploying army trucks. Social media is full of stories of ordinary citizens volunteering to provide transportation or other support to those who still have to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manny Pacquiao has worked with Jack Ma&amp;rsquo;s foundation to have 50,000 testing kits donated to the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some social media influencer gets shamed for going off on people who are still going to work despite the enhanced lockdown. These trying times really make it easy to identify those who are unable to put themselves in other people&amp;rsquo;s situations and empathize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nograles talks to an early evening news program on TV , saying there will be a press conference later at 8PM discussing more details. The press conference happens past 11PM. It&amp;rsquo;s just Nograles and some other cabinet members, discussing details of who will be allowed to move around, what companies/industries will still be operating, etc. Basically details they should have had from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of new cases today is +45, with 2 additional deaths. Total number of cases: 187, deaths: 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wednesday-march-the-18th&#34;&gt;Wednesday, March the 18th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, Quezon City mayor Joy Belmonte announces &amp;ldquo;Extreme Enhanced Community Quarantine&amp;rdquo; (LOL) for selected barangays in Quezon City, specifically those barangays with 2 or more confirmed cases each. This enhanced lockdown (lets be real) means additional restrictions such as checkpoints and temperature scans in certain areas. Only those with essential travel needs will be allowed to pass. During the press conference, they identified several areas to be affected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a rectangular area around St. Luke&amp;rsquo;s Hospital near E.Rodriguez&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a circular area around the cluster of hospitals along East Avenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quirino Memorial Medical Center (facility quarantine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Barangay Tandang Sora (where we live) is one of the identified areas with multiple cases, but they have yet to finalize which streets/areas to restrict. Reportedly, the cases are somewhere in the Himlayan area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were worried about how the lockdown would affect us so my parents decided to do a grocery run today (our last run was Friday). This gave me quite a bit of anxiety, since they&amp;rsquo;re both vulnerable seniors, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t drive and I&amp;rsquo;m not the best shopper so I can&amp;rsquo;t make decisions in case of stuff being out of stock. They came back without incident, and reportedly the grocery practiced safe social distancing measures, so I assume (and hope) they&amp;rsquo;re fine. For future runs, we may try some online grocery sites such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.metromart.com/welcome/cities&#34;&gt;Metromart&lt;/a&gt;, or I&amp;rsquo;ll do the run myself (and we just live with whatever terrible choices I make LOL.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we are up to 202 confirmed cases (15 new cases) with 3 additional deaths (total 17). Over the past few days we have alternated big jumps and low jumps, so we might have more new cases tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thursday-march-the-19th&#34;&gt;Thursday, March the 19th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No major announcements today. We are up to 217 confirmed cases (+15) and 17 (+0) deaths. Not bad considering I thought we&amp;rsquo;d get a big bump today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;friday-march-the-20th&#34;&gt;Friday, March the 20th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No major announcements today. Well, there was a presscon by the president at 1am where he basically threw shade at the mayor of Pasig for daring to suggest something contrary to what the national government has advised. But nothing of significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got out of the house today, but only to walk a little bit around the subdivision. I thought about walking around my usual route, but that seems like an unnecessary risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are up to 230 cases (+13) and 18 deaths (+1). The growth rate is kind of plateauing, most probably due to lack of testing, but maybe not? We&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;saturday-march-the-21st&#34;&gt;Saturday, March the 21st&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word is going around in various QC barangays that the barangay personnel are issuing quarantine passes to households. AFAIK there has been no announcement from either the national government or the LGU, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s just the barangays being creative in implementation. Feels like unnecessary bureaucracy, and probably prone to abuse? We haven&amp;rsquo;t had anyone give us any yet. Regardless, we are mostly staying cooped up inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumors abound that there is a &amp;ldquo;secret protocol&amp;rdquo; at the RITM to prioritize VIPs in testing, and that the staff is furious but are afraid of violating NDAs. Sucks if true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we are up to 307 cases (+77) and 19 deaths (+1). This is the biggest one day jump in cases so far. Presumably there has been a lag in testing, so we may be in for even more cases in the days ahead. The coming week may very well tell us what our eventual curve is going to look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-march-the-22nd&#34;&gt;Sunday, March the 22nd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been just around one week of this lockdown. I think people are starting to get used to it? A lot of the less fortunate people are still suffering though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning my dad and my tita went out for groceries. I didn&amp;rsquo;t find out about it until I went down around lunch time. I told them later that they should just let me go out if we need to do a grocery run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard mass online again via the Quiapo church facebook page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I was getting a handle on all this covid19 news but I felt frustrated again today at a lot of bad news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOH prioritizing VIP politicians for testing given limited test kits. The current head of the RITM has been removed allegedly due to his refusal to prioritize VIPs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;530 hospital staff in UST quarantined&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The president asking congress for emergency powers (Senate President and the Palace spokesman both say it&amp;rsquo;s not emergency powers, some kind of BS). Basically this incompetent government after all this time assuring that they have the budget needed etc, say we should trust them with even more power and budget. And still no word on plans for mass testing!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, word in our barangay is that they are starting to distribute quarantine passes in our subdivision. We haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten one yet because they ran out or something, but they&amp;rsquo;ll be back tomorrow. We&amp;rsquo;re also told even with the pass, others can still go out as long as you have an ID with an address. Huh, what&amp;rsquo;s the point then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight we have 380 confirmed cases (+73) and 25 deaths (+6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monday-march-the-23rd&#34;&gt;Monday, March the 23rd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re entering the second working week of this lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock market was relatively calm today. The PSE Index dropped by about 0.74%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metro Manila hospitals are at or close to capacity; The Medical City advised that their ER beds are full and the same goes for other Pasig hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sign of how severely out of touch they are, the Speaker of the House and the Executive Secretary posted a picture of themselves with other congressmen at the house (for deliberations on the emergency powers bill), while holding a manila paper banner between them with a message along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Like our doctors and frontliners, we came to work for you, so please stay at home.&amp;rdquo; The internet responded&amp;hellip; appropriately. &amp;ldquo;ANG KAKAPAL&amp;rdquo; trended on PH twitter for a while, and since they conveniently provided an image with a space for text, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/scoutmagph/status/1241981421175975937&#34;&gt;memes started rolling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so frustrated at the government today, I ended up writing a tweetstorm rant that evolved into &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/this-is-not-the-time-for-mediocrity/&#34;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;. I even broke my Facebook isolation to post it there as well. It helped my sanity a little to write it out (and to get positive dopamine hits from the likes and shares.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight we have 462 confirmed cases (+82) and 33 deaths (+8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuesday-march-the-24th&#34;&gt;Tuesday, March the 24th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More hospitals today announced they are at capacity, including St. Luke&amp;rsquo;s and Makati Medical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night in the wee hours, after more than half a day of sessions, emergency powers were granted by Congress to the president. The senate version was adopted, with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/kevinikhe/posts/10219934639812972&#34;&gt;bit more checks and balances&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s fine, but we must remain vigilant. For me, the main issue with the admin being granted emergency powers is that it has not proven competence and indeed has shown a tendency to abuse powers in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president held another address at 10pm (surprisingly on schedule). I did not listen to it, I&amp;rsquo;m told it was mostly thanking frontliners and law enforcement and encouraging the nation. (Sounds good.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight we have 552 confirmed cases (+90) and 35 deaths (+2). The confirmed cases rate is still accelerating, albeit slower than I thought it would. As more people are tested, the curve of the death rate becomes a bigger indicator - it may indicate whether people are already dying due to hospital over capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the world crossed the 400,000 confirmed cases mark, 3 days after crossing 300,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wednesday-march-the-25th&#34;&gt;Wednesday, March the 25th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went out with my dad midday to get groceries. I had volunteered to go do it alone, but the problem was I can&amp;rsquo;t drive, and the 30-40 minute walk back might be problematic with the amount of stuff to buy. And it turned out if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a senior citizen with me, I&amp;rsquo;d have had to wait in a long queue. It&amp;rsquo;s a tradeoff and a risk to be sure, but we tried to manage it. I did the main grocery shopping, he mostly just went to the pharmacy to buy meds. Hopefully that mitigates things. Anytime I go outside, there&amp;rsquo;s an additional bit of anxiety over the next few days to see if we develop any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our drive back, I noted that the nearby McDonald&amp;rsquo;s was the only open restaurant, and it was full of GrabFood drivers. We considered using their drive through, but I don&amp;rsquo;t actually like McDonald&amp;rsquo;s so I passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our &amp;ldquo;honorable&amp;rdquo; senators caused a shitstorm today when he showed up to a major private hospital with his wife for them to have a caesarean birth, knowing full well he should have been under home quarantine while waiting for COVID19 test results. His results came back while they were at the hospital and he had to leave and the whole delivery ward had to be decontaminated and HCWs put into quarantine. The speaker of the house and the mayor of QC must be glad there&amp;rsquo;s a new idiot taking the heat off of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight we have 636 confirmed cases (+84) and 38 deaths (+3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thursday-march-the-26th&#34;&gt;Thursday, March the 26th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, nothing exceptionally stupid from the government today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another senator has announced that he has been diagnosed positive though. And a VP loser, rumored to have been flown to Singapore due to possible severe Covid symptoms, was forced to issue a statement, this time inviting criticism due to him and his family and staff allegedly getting prioritized with tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight we have 707 confirmed cases (+71) and 45 deaths (+7). The world is also a sliver away from 500k cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;friday-march-the-27th&#34;&gt;Friday, March the 27th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumors have been circulating since the day before that a lockdown level up was in the works, perhaps as soon as this weekend. No such announcement came, and some admin people claimed it was fake news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RITM rolls back the positive diagnosis for a congressman, saying they made a clerical error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we have 803 confirmed cases (+96, biggest daily jump so far) and 54 deaths (+9, also biggest jump).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;saturday-march-the-28th&#34;&gt;Saturday, March the 28th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abuzz on the internets yesterday was the exchange between a science-student turned journalist and a infectious disease specialist consulting with the DOH, who sparred over some facts. The journalist was asking why we had tested so few people compared to other nearby countries of similar economic standing, but the doctor insisted the official numbers were much higher - except he was actually talking about number of tests conducted, not number of people tested, which was the comparison being made. This particular doctor had over the past few days established a reputation for being quite arrogant and self-centered, and dismissive of people who aren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;experts&amp;rdquo;. Probably not the best person to be talking for the DOH (but he isn&amp;rsquo;t actually an officially spokesperson - a DOH usec later confirmed the journalist&amp;rsquo;s numbers were the official one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the more science-y folk in my monkeysphere are not very happy with this particular doctor and how he handles himself on social media, and one of my friends (with a background in molecular biology) even got blocked trying to ask him about the technicalities. Regardless, I try to avoid delving into his conversations too much anyway, as he is only a DOH consultant and not an official spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the things he are saying are counterproductive or non sequitur anyway. If I was a media person interviewing a Government or DOH spokesperson, the main question I would want asked would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;between the time of the first confirmed case (January 30) and up to the lockdown of Metro Manila (roughly a 6 week period), what preparations did the DOH undertake to make sure we would have sufficient testing capacity, hospital capacity, and available PPEs for our health workers and other frontliners in case the virus spreads?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize looking into the past may not be the most productive thing at the moment, but if the government and the DOH want us to trust them, I think they need to be able to acknowledge mistakes and lack of preparation. This helps us see that they know what went wrong and can adjust accordingly. Transparency begets trust, and the more trust we can have in our leadership, the easier it will be for the citizenry to bear the harsh burdens that the following weeks and/or months may entail. I want to believe they are capable of handling this situation. Give me hope!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 1075 cases (+272) and 68 deaths (+14), both the biggest daily jumps so far. Presumably the RITM are starting to burn through the testing backlog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, we are past 650k cases. Jumped from 500k-600k in a day and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-march-the-29th&#34;&gt;Sunday, March the 29th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We survived 2 weeks of quarantine/lockdown!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard online mass again via the Quiapo Church facebook page. The priest reminds us that next Sunday is Palm Sunday, and thus next week is Holy Week. He says we just have two more weeks to go, but I am not as hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to keep some of the seniors I live with under check. A couple of them went out for groceries without my knowing. I&amp;rsquo;m sure they&amp;rsquo;re being careful, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I won&amp;rsquo;t be worried and anxious D:.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to shout out some props to the OVP, they&amp;rsquo;ve been able to give support to the frontliners/health care workers even while running on donations and a limited budget. They&amp;rsquo;ve set up free transport routes, dorm rooms for those who want to stay near hospitals, and now they&amp;rsquo;re partnering with fashion designers to make custom PPE clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DOH released a statement saying some of the test kits from China were faulty, but then rolled it back later (presumably not to offend China).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHO and China are increasingly coming under scrutiny for misrepresenting figures and mishandling the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 1418 cases (+343) and 71 deaths (+3). We expect the cases to rise rapidly, given the increase in testing capacity, but we don&amp;rsquo;t yet know where the ceiling is. Today&amp;rsquo;s rate suggests doubling roughly every 3 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monday-march-the-30th&#34;&gt;Monday, March the 30th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A press conference by the president was announced for 4PM today, presumably this is for the report required by the emergency powers law. I will update the time when that actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that not everything is doom and gloom, here are some (presumably good) things the admin is doing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOH expanded testing capabilities to 6 laboratories so far, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/OfficialDOHgov/posts/3188149711196259&#34;&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s a long list of other labs currently being accredited&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOST says &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/256400-philippine-kits-coronavirus-tests-available-april-2020&#34;&gt;120,000 locally-made test kits will be available by Apr 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOH says &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/03/30/1-million-ppe-sets-worth-p1-8b-due-for-delivery-to-doh-for-distribution-to-health-workers/&#34;&gt;1 million PPE sets are due to be delivered and distributed&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully these aren&amp;rsquo;t substandard quality and were not overpriced!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several friends have mentioned that they have viber/messenger chat groups for their local areas so I ask for advice if there&amp;rsquo;s any for our barangay. Someone helpfully adds me to the viber group for QC, though I mute it almost immediately, as I (correctly) expect heavy volume there. I just want to have the channel available in case we need it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally at around 1140pm, the promised presscon finally airs. It&amp;rsquo;s pre-recorded, and rumor is it was already shot earlier and the day, no explanation for the long delay, but I would guess they had to find a decent/usable cut/take that didn&amp;rsquo;t make him look too much like an idiot. I didn&amp;rsquo;t watch, but here&amp;rsquo;s the summary I got from friends (my comments in &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thanks frontliners &lt;em&gt;(finally! he was roundly criticized for not acknowleding them before)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;appeals to the private sector to contribute to this national emergency &lt;em&gt;(Pretty sure they&amp;rsquo;ve been doing that for the past 2 weeks)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We have allotted P200 billion for low income households who are badly affected by this crisis.” &lt;em&gt;(This is good, but still only an allocation, hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s executed well)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thanks those who silently helped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speaking about frontliners who died of COVID-19: Napaka swerte nila namatay sila para sa bayan. It will be an honor to die for the country. &lt;em&gt;(Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just me, but this feels at least a teeny bit insensitive)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;says he will crackdown on corruption in COVID-19 funds &lt;em&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;ll believe it when I see it. Also, what about crackdown on VIPs who ask for priority testing and who violate quarantine?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thanks governments of China and Singapore as well as local businessmen for their contributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 1546 cases (+128) and 78 deaths (+7). Low jump in cases today, have they already completed their backlog? We&amp;rsquo;ll see what tomorrow brings!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuesday-march-the-31st&#34;&gt;Tuesday, March the 31st&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes from a meeting between the IATF and private sector representatives &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mlq3/status/1244827097610084353&#34;&gt;were leaked online today&lt;/a&gt;. Looks like they are recommending a two-week lockdown extension. Private sector people later &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/business/256541-philippine-chamber-commerce-industry-leaked-notes-government-businessmen-video-call-not-policy&#34;&gt;said it was just a brainstorming session&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we got &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/732016/duterte-s-first-report-to-congress-on-covid-19-response/story/&#34;&gt;a copy of the report the palace submitted&lt;/a&gt; to congress as required by the emergency panel law. A lot of details in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former senator and 2016 VP loser Bongbong Marcos has declared he was found positive of COVID19. Same goes for DILG secretary Ano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we are up to 2084 (+538) cases and 88 (+10) deaths. Despite a low bump yesterday, we still managed to double over 3 days. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how the rest of the week goes&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wednesday-april-the-1st&#34;&gt;Wednesday, April the 1st&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;rsquo;s April Fools Day, but there&amp;rsquo;s nothing funny about today&amp;rsquo;s events. I don&amp;rsquo;t normally swear, but what a fucking shitshow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime in the afternoon, a protest broke out at Sitio San Roque in Quezon City (near where my high school was), with the residents going out to the streets to complain about lack of food packs being distributed to them. These are urban poor-type people. Law-enforcement types came in to disperse them for violating quarantine, and violence broke out when people refused and complained. Multiple people were arrested. Arrested for complaining they were dying of hunger! The QC govt later issued a statement denying that relief goods had not been distributed to those areas and blamed instigators for causing trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, the NBI summoned a popular city mayor for questioning about an alleged violation of the Bayanihan Heal As One Act (aka the emergency powers bill aka the BaHO Act), because he violated the natgov order not to allow tricycles to ply the roads. The thing is, that happened way before the BaHO Act was passed, and the mayor appealed to the natgov to let them use tricycles and when that appeal was denied, the mayor complied with the directives. Targeting a very popular local gov official turned out to be a very unpopular move, unsurprisingly, and many just assumed the president was being insecure because this particular mayor was serving his city well and was making him look bad. This is such an idiotic move, not even particularly corrupt or evil or sinister as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really gain them anything; what purpose does it serve other than to make the people angry? An unforced error in a long line of unforced errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people suggested it might be a sleight of hand - to distract us with things they are doing with the emergency funds prescribed by the BaHO act. Supposedly the 1.8B pesos worth of PPE sets being ordered by the DOH are overpriced, but they of course denied that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there was this directive that all donations to the DOH and to govt hospitals need to be coursed through the OCD, and hospitals have to make their requests in writing. Many questioned this added layer of centralized bureaucracy and some openly speculated that this was so that the donations could be &amp;ldquo;repackaged&amp;rdquo; and distribution controlled by a particularly influential senator through his &amp;ldquo;Malasakit centers&amp;rdquo;. If the idea is just to make sure all hospitals get served appropriately, perhaps a more prudent approach would have been for the DOH to continuously publish a priority list of hospitals with the most dire need of donations? The whole reason people are donating directly to the hospitals and hcws is the poor trust in the national government. Some have also suggested that this may be a way to exert some control over the OVP, which has been working hard to solicit donations and get supplies and support to hcws and other frontliners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The icing on the cake: at around 10pm, an unannounced live press conference by the president was aired where he warned the people to just obey, even if relief goods are delayed, promising they will not die of hunger. And for those who would violate quarantine or cause trouble, he implied that the law enforcement types should just shoot to kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTF. Think about that. People are anxious, worried, fearful, and most of all hungry and staving and you think the best move is to threaten them with violence and death?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, pictures came out of donated PPEs and face masks supposedly repackaged and branded as being from a certain senator. Unverified rumors also started to spread that certain private hospitals were raided to get their donations, so that they can be repackaged by the senator. These are yet unverified reports, the only evidence being screenshots of text convos between people who allegedly have first-hand knowledge. If it were true, one would think there would be images or video footage somewhere maybe? Someone I know asked her medical friends and they have no knowledge of such raids on the private hospitals. So maybe let&amp;rsquo;s leave that for now. But I think it&amp;rsquo;s a serious indictment of the trust in the natgov and that senator in particular that many people easily believe he could be behind such acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we are up to 2311 (+227) cases and 96 (+8) deaths. The slope is around the same as the past few days (slightly less), which seems to imply that the limiting factor is how many tests are being conducted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thursday-april-the-2nd&#34;&gt;Thursday, April the 2nd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing this at a bit past 4pm. Ever since Duterte&amp;rsquo;s surprise address last night, #OUSTDUTERTENOW has been trending on Twitter, first locally to the Philippines, then worldwide at #1 (currently at 489k tweets). I took the liberty of taking a look of a few of the profiles using the hashtag, and as far as I can tell the traffic is organic; the accounts don&amp;rsquo;t look like bots, they tweet about a lot of other things (honestly most of it seems to be korean fandom, so maybe they&amp;rsquo;re young people), and aren&amp;rsquo;t recently created egg accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, obviously I don&amp;rsquo;t like Duterte as a president and think he&amp;rsquo;s doing a terrible job. But I wish the Filipino people had chosen a better time to wisen up to his shortcomings than when we&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of a pandemic. Even if somehow there were an orderly transition (not bloody likely), the discontinuity in administration is bound to cause friction and hiccups in our pandemic response. Unfortunately, the administration is pretty bad in their crisis control and have made multiple unforced errors (see yesterday&amp;rsquo;s entry) that only increase the likelihood of social unrest and/or chaos. I would prefer we get past the current crisis first, then we exact accountability, but that may be wishful thinking&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the rest of the day was relatively saner compared to yesterday. As of 7pm, I am slightly more optimistic about the country again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/inquirerdotnet/status/1245614612751331328&#34;&gt;Relief goods were finally distributed to the residents of Sitio San Roque.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jeffcanoy/status/1245616090719195138&#34;&gt;The DILG Sec Ano has some sane words about the NBI&amp;rsquo;s investigation of a popular mayor.&lt;/a&gt; He also says they will crack down on other chief executives not following the IATF guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member of the Presidential Anti-Crime Competition floated the idea that the NBI should also investigate the OVP for &amp;ldquo;competing&amp;rdquo; against other government services. WTF? Later, the head of the PACC issued a statement saying that was not an official recommendation and the member was just expressing a personal opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#OUSTDUTERTE vanished from the twitter trending lists by the time I woke up around lunch time, to be replace by typos like #OUSTDUTERE. Some are speculating it may be counter-ops by troll farms wishing to split the original hashtag. The funny thing is even the typo&amp;rsquo;d hashtag trended for a while!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the lockdown started, we haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten our regular newspaper delivery, so I&amp;rsquo;ve missed the opinion columns of some columnists I like such as Boo Chanco. I recently read a post of his on FB where he shared some thoughts from someone complaining how the government officials in charge had practically no knowledge of supply chain logistics, which made managing the quarantine much more difficult. Unfortunately when I checked his FB profile for the post, it could no longer be found! Either he set it to private due to being bashed by trolls or the person who shared the info asked him to take it down, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 7pm tonight, we are at 2633 (+322) cases and 107 (11) deaths. Still roughly the same curve. It&amp;rsquo;s actually possible we do have this thing under control, given our death count so far hasn&amp;rsquo;t been spiraling out of control like the US (who got their first cases much later than us). But we probably don&amp;rsquo;t have an accurate count - there might be a lot of deaths going unreported as covid19-related due to not being tested, or poor people not even bothering to go to the hospitals, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss being able to go out. Not for hanging out with people, but just being able to take long walks and also to eat outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;friday-april-the-3rd&#34;&gt;Friday, April the 3rd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overnight, the worldwide tally of cases broke past the 1,000,000 mark (doubling in around 5 days) and 50,000 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of good news: Late last night it was announced that mass testing of PUIs and PUMs is planned to start on April 14, so it&amp;rsquo;s a solid step towards the mass testing everyone had been clamoring for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mayor of QC issued a statement apologizing for her past statements on social media and for relief bags bearing her name. She still has a long way to go, but wow the ability to admit mistakes and apologize is super rare among politicians, and improves my trust rating of her and makes me see her more as someone just trying her best in a bad situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had another surprise episode of Late Night with Duterte tonight. Most of it was the usual seemingly drunken rant (a friend of ours showed the stream to a UK colleague and the comment was &amp;ldquo;he looks so wasted!&amp;quot;), including an appeal/threat to obey the police and trying to justify his earlier violent statements, etc. He also spent quite a lot of time picking on former senatorial candidate Chel Diokno, in a manner that made him look like a shallow playground bully, including commentary on appearance. A bit of a plot twist at the end when he castigated the PACC official who suggested to investigate the OVP for helping the people and announced he would be fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 3018 (+385) cases and 136 (29) deaths. Are deaths starting to accelerate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;saturday-april-the-4th&#34;&gt;Saturday, April the 4th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was relatively uneventful, thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 3094 (+76) cases and 144 (+8) deaths. Virus taking a weekend break?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-april-the-5th&#34;&gt;Sunday, April the 5th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have completed three weeks of quarantine/lockdown! The original target end date for the lockdown was Apr 12th, but it seems highly probable that we will have an extension, at least until the end of April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally uneventful, though I would like to note that anecdotally I have been reading more stories about people who criticize the government accused of being communists/leftists rebels (as if complaining is exclusively the domain of the left!). There&amp;rsquo;s even an infamous PCOO undersecretary accusing teachers at my high school alma mater of being CPP-NPA-NDF! I would guess the president&amp;rsquo;s threats against the &amp;ldquo;left&amp;rdquo; has galvanized his base into painting critics with a common brush, giving them an enemy to hate in this crisis; convenient since the true enemy is invisible and cares not about your red-tagging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In better news, a number of politicians, including some mayors and congressmen and even the president himself, have committed to donating part or all of their salaries to the relief operations. It may not be much, but it&amp;rsquo;s something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 3246 (+152) cases and 152 (+8) deaths. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if the relatively lower numbers keep up during the coming week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monday-april-the-6th&#34;&gt;Monday, April the 6th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are officially in week four of quarantine/lockdown!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think by this point, most people are already expecting an extension at least until the end of April. Even Chief Impelementer Galvez (of the  National Task Force Against COVID-19) is implying that&amp;rsquo;s where the task force is leaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the task force, they have &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ntfcovid19ph&#34;&gt;a twitter&lt;/a&gt;! They seem to be communicating better than other govt branches too, and they are &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ntfcovid19ph/status/1247098792848982016&#34;&gt;friends with the OVP apparently&lt;/a&gt;. Galvez is one of the bright spots in the govt fight against the virus, so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This afternoon I went out to the nearby drugstore (around a 10-minute walk) to buy meds for my mom and maybe a tiny bit of groceries (the drugstore has a small grocery section). The drugstore had 3 short queues outside: one for regular transactions, one for senior/PWD transactions (this was the shortest line), and one for groceries (only 3 grocery people allowed inside at the same time). I was transacting for a senior, so I got to use the shortest line. Inside, what used to be the open counter of the pharmacy had a barrier of plastic wrap to separate the customers from the staff, with only a tiny hole to slide prescriptions and money and medicines across. Entire trip (including back and forth walk) took around an hour and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Monday, so we have a new episode of Late Night with Duterte. As usual, I didn&amp;rsquo;t watch, but here&amp;rsquo;s the summary I got from one of my chat groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;says poorest of the poor must receive gov’t assistance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;₱100 billion for one month or the ₱270 billion for two months is not enough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exploring adjustment of budgets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asks for the cooperation of the public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let’s heed the needs of our poor brothers and sisters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on drug addicts: wag subukan ang gobyerno, ang gobyerno desperado na din (to solve the COVID-19 crisis)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encourages everyone to wear masks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nagdadasal ako para sa bayan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kung may pera, d ko hawakan yan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“it’s not my money d ko pwede nakawin, kung ma nakaw ko man, ano gawin ko sa pera na yan”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if money allotted for next month is used now, no more money next month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i want to give the poorest of the poor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;says Elly Pamatong “as president” instructs the military to catch Duterte&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ako, I agree. Kung maaari lang, isali ko sila. (On adding middle class to social amelioration program)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ang solusyon dito is vaccine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;itong problema natin, ang pang kontra nito is stay home, at wag ka mahawaan&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Wag kang mahawa, mag-stay ka sa bahay. “pano pagkain namin?” maghanap ka ng paraan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;panawagan ko: be patient, intindihin niyo ang gobyerno, we’d appreciate it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the resources are all exhausted and the pandemic would claim millions of lives, I hope, really, and I pray that it would not. Pero kung ganun, wala na ako magawa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are inclined to extend the lockdown up to April 30.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like he is striking a softer tone than the last presscon, where it was like he wanted to pick a fight with everyone. A lot of it still seems senseless and incoherent, but I guess there&amp;rsquo;s a slight improvement? I prefer how the ntfcovid19ph is communicating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 3660 (+414) cases and 163 (+11) deaths. For looking at how the trend has been adjusting since the start of the lockdown, my thesis adviser Luis Sison has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/luisgsison/posts/2905346532879075&#34;&gt;posting some graphs regularly on Facebook.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuesday-april-the-7th&#34;&gt;Tuesday, April the 7th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lockdown/ECQ has officially been extended until the end of April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a grocery run today with my dad. He went to the bank while I did the grocery shopping. There&amp;rsquo;s still a decent number of people in the grocery, despite them limiting entry. Proper social distancing is probably impossible. I mean, if implemented properly, each aisle of the grocery is only wide enough for one person, so that means waiting patiently while the lady in front of you slowly goes through the items on the shelves. I tried to minimize getting too close unnecessarily of course, but it&amp;rsquo;s a challenge. For me, that means I&amp;rsquo;ll be anxious for the next week or so in case any symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small Pizza Hut in the grocery building was open and doing takeout, but I only noticed when I was done, and there was a 30-45 minute wait. Should remember next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of interest: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.4442633659095731&amp;amp;type=3%3Fsfnsn%3Dmo&#34;&gt;Duterte&amp;rsquo;s timeline of incompetence post by JGS-UPD&lt;/a&gt;. I was thinking of incorporating something like this into this diary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word is that the defendants being represented by Chel Diokno after they were subpoena&amp;rsquo;ed by the NBI were investigated &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lianbuan/status/1247465754066178049&#34;&gt;because of a social media post asking why the government doesn&amp;rsquo;t have money for healthcare when they have P2B for a gulfstream jet&lt;/a&gt;. Sounds like suppression of freedom of speech to me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 3764 (+104) cases and 177 (+14) deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wednesday-april-the-8th&#34;&gt;Wednesday, April the 8th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time before 9pm, we were told the president had another address tonight. It&amp;rsquo;s now 11:57 and it hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened. Maybe I should just be thankful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 3870 (+106) cases and 182 (+5) deaths. Low numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thursday-april-the-9th&#34;&gt;Thursday, April the 9th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president&amp;rsquo;s address actually aired well past midnight, so let&amp;rsquo;s log it here. The content wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything of relevance, more whining about limitations of budget, imploring people to obey, etc. The address also included remarks from people like DOHsec Duque, BudgetSec Dominguez, Chief Implementer Galvez, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I will note is Duque said that &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cnnphilippines/status/1247925887619567616&#34;&gt;the travel ban from China helped slow the disease&lt;/a&gt;. Now, a lot of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cnnphilippines/status/1247925887619567616&#34;&gt;twitter reactions&lt;/a&gt; indicate people think this was a lie, that we had no such China travel ban, basing it on earlier statements of Duque and other palace officials. Now, I dislike this admin of course, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t meant I can be dishonest about them. Officially, we did have a travel ban from China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did Duterte, Duque and other officials say there was no need for a China travel ban and that China may question it?&lt;/em&gt; Yes, this happened in late January, around the time of the first 3 confirmed cases in the country. Citations: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/250506-coronavirus-scare-travel-ban-mainland-chinese-not-for-now-duque&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/1/29/duterte-on-china-travel-ban.html&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did we did have China travel bans instituted?&lt;/em&gt; Also yes, after the first case was confirmed in the country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first from Hubei province only, as of Jan 31. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/1/31/Philippines-novel-coronavirus-China-travel-ban.html&#34;&gt;Citation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a few days later on Feb 2, on all of China (including HK, Taiwan and Macau. The Taiwan part was later rescinded). &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/02/02/20/ph-imposes-travel-ban-on-china-as-new-coronavirus-infections-rise-globally&#34;&gt;Citation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After these bans were instituted, there were questions as to whether they were really strictly being implemented, and there were screenshots and other evidence circulating that there were still flights coming in from China. That there are flights coming in from China should not in itself be relevant, given (a) flights can contain cargo, not just passengers; and (b) flights can contain Filipino citizens being repatriated from China, as these are still allowed to come in, although they have to undergo quarantine. Whether any foreigners slipped through the cracks of this travel ban is unknown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, not even the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.4442633659095731&amp;amp;type=3%3Fsfnsn%3Dmo&#34;&gt;timeline of incompetence post I referenced the other day&lt;/a&gt; includes this information, which is a disservice. In the interest of fairness, I have highlighted these dates and links at the top of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could the government have done more during January and February?&lt;/em&gt; Less factual, but in my opinion also yes. We basically wasted a lot of time in January and February twiddling our thumbs. As far as I can tell, no additional preparations were done in Feb other than the China travel bans. Total travel ban from other countries only happned when the lockdown/ECQ happened in early March, IIRC. (Feel free to correct me if I&amp;rsquo;m wrong.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Were we the first to lockdown, as Duterte implies?&lt;/em&gt; Obviously not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 4076 (+206) cases and 203 (+21) deaths. Biggest deaths jump so far!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it is the Holy Week long weekend, and updating this everyday is getting tiresome, I might skip a few days and maybe resume on Easter Sunday. Unless something outlandish happens, which is not outside the realm of possibility!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-april-the-12th&#34;&gt;Sunday, April the 12th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is Easter Sunday, and coincidentally marks one month since the lockdown/ECQ was originally announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past couple of days, word came out that a certain QC hospital was having trouble with a lack of body bags for handling cadavers. Insider reports say that bodies are piling up and they&amp;rsquo;re running out of places to put them, and that the hospital got an order to underreport the deaths. The DOH got wind of this and immediately issued a statement denying the rumors. The hospital came out with a statement denying they are running out of body bags, but later admitted that their morgue is over capacity because of an unusually high number of unclaimed body bags. Apparently there was an order to hospitals to report deaths first to the DOH before anyone else, so maybe that order was misinterpreted which led to the underreporting deaths rumor. In any case, if one hospital is struggling with deaths, it&amp;rsquo;s likely other hospitals are too, which is worrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents haven&amp;rsquo;t seen their grandkids all together since February, so today we set up a zoom call with everyone so we can enjoy their company. It was expectedly a lot of chaos, but the kids had a lot of energy and we had fun and the grandparents enjoyed the quality time, so that&amp;rsquo;s something. It&amp;rsquo;s highly unlikely we&amp;rsquo;ll get to see each other until late May at the earliest, so this was the next best thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 4648 (+220 today, +572 since Thursday) cases and 297 (+50 today, +94 since Thursday) deaths. This is now the record for most deaths/day, but it&amp;rsquo;s possible that some death reporting may have been delayed due to the holiday weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, cases are now at 1.8 million and deaths more than 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kind of enjoyed the short break, so I think future updates to this diary will be sparse, instead of the daily it was before. Maybe only when significant things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wednesday-april-the-15th&#34;&gt;Wednesday, April the 15th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three days since the last entry. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone out three times, the most for any week since the quarantine began. Twice was for medicine runs for the parental units (one would think they could just combine them into one request, but apparently extenuating circumstances etc), and another was for a grocery run. I still failed to get pizza at the grocery store though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had thought about having food delivered last Easter Sunday, but apparently we decided on it too late, by 4:30pm most of the open restos were no longer delivering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much to report on the government side. Not that things aren&amp;rsquo;t happening, but it&amp;rsquo;s more of the same, mostly. Although the good news is that some LGUs are adding their own testing programs, so hopefully we get a better idea of where we are in the days to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 5453 (+230 today, +805 since Sunday) cases and 349 (+14 today, +52 since Sunday) deaths. The rate of new cases has more or less held steady over the past few days, with about a thousand being added every 3-4 days. The good news is the recovery count has caught up to the death count, today it&amp;rsquo;s at 353. This is excellent because it was probably only a week or so ago that the there were about twice as many deaths as recoveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;friday-april-the-17th&#34;&gt;Friday, April the 17th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, a resolution by majority of senators asking the health secretary to resign came out. The signatories were mostly pro-admin senators too! Duterte quickly rejected the requested. Today, the socioeconomic planning secretary and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rapplerdotcom/status/1251045773443166208?s=21&#34;&gt;NEDA head offered his resignation&lt;/a&gt;, partly due to personal reasons and partly due to &amp;ldquo;differences in philosophy with a few fellow cabinet members&amp;rdquo;. The timing is weird and makes me think that he resigned due to Duque not resigning, but that&amp;rsquo;s pure speculation lol. The more probable reason is that the other cabinet members don&amp;rsquo;t agree with his recommendation to try to end the lockdown quickly? We can only speculate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1852785&#34;&gt;entire sitio in Cebu is now considered infected&lt;/a&gt; after mass testing found a large number of asymptomatic cases. Out of 53 confirmed positives, 51 were asymptomatic. That&amp;rsquo;s a troubling rate, it may mean our actual number of confirmed cases may be up to 25 times more than previously thought. (Don&amp;rsquo;t quote me on that, this is a single data point.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 5878 (+218 today, +425 since Wednesday) cases, 387 (+25 today, +38 since Wednesday) deaths and 487 (+52) recoveries. Recoveries increasing faster than deaths, so that&amp;rsquo;s promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-april-the-19th&#34;&gt;Sunday, April the 19th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard 6am mass via the TV. ABS-CBN broadcasts one, I think it&amp;rsquo;s held in their studio. The celebrant was Fr. Jerry Orbos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two more weeks of this, at least. Some people are hoping for partial lifting of the ECQ in May, but there&amp;rsquo;s also the possibility of tighter restrictions, as the president has threatened. Rumors and feelers point in either direction being possible. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 6259 (+172 today, +381 since Friday) cases, 409 (+12 today, +22 since Friday) deaths and 572 (+56 today, +85 since Friday) recoveries. Recoveries growing faster than deaths for the past 3 days, and confirmed cases seemingly tapering off? Seems a bit too good to be true? Again, we&amp;rsquo;ll see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;friday-april-the-24th&#34;&gt;Friday, April the 24th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, the government officially extended the ECQ in Metro Manila (and some other areas with high Covid19 incidence) up to May 15th. Not surprising, especially given the rumors and the trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago, there was this altercation at a quezon city checkpoint where cops ended up shooting and killing a mentally unstable ex-military person after a short standoff. Supposedly because he made a motion as if to draw something from his bag. The police claim he had a gun, but the witnesses and relatives say otherwise. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of different videos of the encounter too. The PNP initially cleared the officer in the encounter, but today it was announced that homicide charges would be filed. It&amp;rsquo;s a good step towards accountability, but I&amp;rsquo;m skeptical it would lead anywhere. But more importantly - cops really need to get over this mentality of preferring the use of lethal force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 7192 cases (+211 today, +933 since Sunday), 477 deaths (+15 today, +68 since Sunday), and 762 (+40 today, +190 since Sunday) recoveries. It&amp;rsquo;s great that recoveries are still outpacing deaths, but I&amp;rsquo;m worried about the number of still unresolved active cases. Around two weeks ago, there were a bit 4000 cases, but as of today, we only have around 1200 deaths+recoveries, so there&amp;rsquo;s around 2800 cases that are serious enough to still be unresolved after 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-april-the-26th&#34;&gt;Sunday, April the 26th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three more weeks of this. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I mind staying at home. But I miss being able to go out and walk around and eat outside freely, even alone. Also, I could use a haircut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only went out once this week, for groceries. We tried to buy a bit more than usual, hoping to reduce the number of times we need to go out. We also celebrated a couple of birthdays in the family, through a zoom call, complete with the grandkids blowing on a candle from across the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 7579 cases (+285 today, +487 since Friday), 501 deaths (+7 today, +24 since Friday), and 862 (+70 today, +100 since Friday) recoveries. Worldwide, we are nearing 3M cases and have passed 200,000 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-may-the-3rd&#34;&gt;Sunday, May the 3rd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officially, this is the 3rd calendar month of quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couple of days ago we got a second tranche of relief goods from the LGU, mostly canned fish things and some rice. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been out all week, but word is that they are being a bit more strict and there are more cops policing places like the wet market etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 9223 cases (+295 today, +1644 for the week), 607 deaths (+4 today, +106 for the week), and 1214 (+90 today, +352 for the week) recoveries. Recoveries vastly outpacing deaths is good news, but the number of cases continues to rise linearly without any slowdown in sight, probably due to testing limits I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll see if NCR manages to leave ECQ after the 15th, but even then we&amp;rsquo;re still only going into General Community Quarantine (GCQ) which is definitely not a &amp;ldquo;back to normal&amp;rdquo; scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, there have been an additional 500k cases and 45k deaths over the past week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-may-the-10th&#34;&gt;Sunday, May the 10th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was mostly an experiment in making a single continuous post that would be updated periodically. At this point (well over 10,000 words in this single post), I&amp;rsquo;m ready to admit this has been an unwieldy experiment. I will still continue the covid19 updates and thoughts, but probably as separate notes and posts. You can follow succeeding entries (including one for today) via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/covid19/&#34;&gt;covid19 tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be continued&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It is easier and natural for tyrants to impose a lockdown and a curfew than to provide what&amp;rsquo;s really needed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;free mass testing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;more funds for public health&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;more public health workers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;adequate facilities for patients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#COVID19&lt;/p&gt;
