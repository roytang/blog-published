            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying out this &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/recent-links&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;recent links&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; series where I highlight some stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve bookmarked. I used to just share them via &lt;a href=&#34;https://getpocket.com&#34;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt;, which get fed into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/links/&#34;&gt;links list&lt;/a&gt; on this blog, but the problem with that approach was that I don&amp;rsquo;t get to comment on each link about why I shared or bookmarked it. Writing them into a blog post gives me a chance to highlight them too. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen some other blogs where they have something like a weekly list of recent links, let&amp;rsquo;s see if that works out for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firefox announced a &lt;a href=&#34;https://firefox-replay.com/&#34;&gt;replay feature&lt;/a&gt; that will allow the webdev to trace the things that are happening on a given web page. This has the potential to be super useful, but for now it looks like it&amp;rsquo;s only available for MacOS. I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything that needs tuning at the moment anyway, but it&amp;rsquo;s something to keep in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found out there was a &lt;a href=&#34;https://micropub.rocks/&#34;&gt;Micropub validator online&lt;/a&gt;, which would be super helpful if and when I decide to implement micropub myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I came upon this list of &lt;a href=&#34;https://nothingintherulebook.com/2019/11/25/46-famous-books-you-can-read-for-free-right-now/&#34;&gt;famous books that are freely available online&lt;/a&gt; (legally). A lot of classics in this list. I&amp;rsquo;ve only read around 5 of these (some fractional value may be due to me not being sure if I&amp;rsquo;ve read all of Aesop&amp;rsquo;s fables), so might be a good idea to add to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/lists/reading/&#34;&gt;reading list&lt;/a&gt; later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/12/quora/&#34;&gt;soured on Quora&lt;/a&gt; recently, and now Hacker News has confirmed that &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21622322&#34;&gt;they hate it too&lt;/a&gt;. Quora used to be really good though. Reading this discussion reminded me that they released a &amp;ldquo;best of quora&amp;rdquo; ebook a few years back which I recall as being a pretty good read, but it&amp;rsquo;s no longer available on their site. I was able to track down a copy from &lt;a href=&#34;http://adityasanyal.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-best-of-quora-in-epub-mobi-and.html&#34;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;. He has the files hosted on OneDrive, which I feel has a non-trivial chance of being purged, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d also &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/uploads/2019/best-of-quora-2010-2012.html&#34;&gt;mirror the HTML version here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written my fair share of web scrapers for various reasons (people need to build more APIs), mostly using Python and BeautifulSoup. I found out recently that there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/overview.html&#34;&gt;Python library dedicated to writing scrapers&lt;/a&gt; (because of course there is). I&amp;rsquo;ll probably try this out the next time I have the need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been following &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kickscondor.com/&#34;&gt;Kicks Condor&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s blog for a while, especially after getting into this Indieweb stuff. He has a page dedicated to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kickscondor.com/hrefhunt/&#34;&gt;highlighting interesting websites&lt;/a&gt; he&amp;rsquo;s found. Adding this to the list of things to browse in the future. (Ok, I was being metaphorical, but you know what, I&amp;rsquo;m going to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/lists/tobrowse&#34;&gt;make that list&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sadness swept across the gaming community when Nintendo shut down the beloved MiiVerse following the discontinuing of the WiiU, but I found out recently that there was an archive of the MiiVerse created and it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://archiverse.guide/&#34;&gt;accessible online&lt;/a&gt;! Here&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href=&#34;https://archiverse.guide/posts?name=hungryroy&#34;&gt;archive of my own Miiverse posts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://archiverse.guide/user/hungryroy&#34;&gt;my profile page&lt;/a&gt;. Since I want to own my content, one of these days I&amp;rsquo;m going to get around to archiving these posts back into this site. (Even though a fair number of these are just my niece playing with in-game stamps.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this post: &lt;a href=&#34;https://malcolmocean.com/2016/06/you-flow-downhill/&#34;&gt;You flow downhill (and you can sculpt the hill)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone shared &lt;a href=&#34;https://cavalrygames.com/shop/ten-candles-pdf&#34;&gt;this TTRPG adventure a while back&lt;/a&gt; (I forgot to track who). I don&amp;rsquo;t really play much TTRPGs but I like the module&amp;rsquo;s description and maybe it&amp;rsquo;s something that can be explored in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all for today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director&amp;rsquo;s cut: Some meta notes about this &amp;ldquo;recent links&amp;rdquo; effort. The downside here is that I can&amp;rsquo;t tag individual links by topic. An alternative to consider would be just making shared links as normal notes (but my style of linking doesn&amp;rsquo;t translate well when syndicated to Twitter and the like). Well, we&amp;rsquo;ll keep going with this for a bit and see how it works out.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I usually log links to interesting articles that I read over on &lt;a href=&#34;https://getpocket.com&#34;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt;, which get fed into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/links/&#34;&gt;links list&lt;/a&gt; on this blog, but that page only shows the most recent ones, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d highlight some in a post as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recent science news: scientists have managed to image the event horizon of a black hole! Here&amp;rsquo;s a nice article about &lt;a href=&#34;https://forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/04/10/black-holes-are-real-and-spectacular-and-so-are-their-event-horizons/#2e0d48cd5808&#34;&gt;why that&amp;rsquo;s a big deal and some interesting science stuff behind it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thesimpledollar.com/the-advantages-of-stealth-wealth-and-how-to-practice-it/&#34;&gt;the advantages of stealth wealth&lt;/a&gt; reminds me how my mom always gets on my case for wearing old and ratty shirts when I go out walking. I could probably write an entire blog post myself on appearing poorer than you actually are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/defining-a-distinguished-engineer/&#34;&gt;What does it mean to be a distinguished engineer?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
