<div class="content e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;m surprisingly ok with this, and even slightly enthusiastic as to what might come out of it at the end.</p>
<p>What I would hope for is that 616 doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;go away&rdquo; or get destroyed or whatever (too much history there to throw away), but that we get a new &ldquo;main universe&rdquo; that combines some elements of both universes.</p>
<p>Some random ideas for the new combined universe:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this universe, the age of heroes already began earlier with Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, X-Men, already existing years prior. Think something like Watchmen where a previous generation of supers already existed. This solves some issues like Magneto being alive during the holocaust (we need to leave Magneto behind)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peter Parker is retired as Spider-Man, living a quiet life with Mary Jane and their kid. We find out about this in a Spider-Man ongoing where the lead character is Miles trying to figure out what happened to the previous Spider-Man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uncanny X-Men: Charles Xavier and his X-Men died some time ago during a violent confrontation with Magneto. The world finds out that Scott Summers actually survived and now he&rsquo;s come out calling for a new mutant revolution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>X-Men: After Xavier&rsquo;s death, the government partnered with the remaining mutants to establish a franchise of schools in Xavier&rsquo;s memory to both train mutants and keep them under control. The schools are used by the government as secret training/recruitment grounds. As an initial story arc, I&rsquo;d introduce a new villain who claims to be the son of Magneto, inheriting his powers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone here commented about the spider-verse totems taking on the role of the now defunct Captain Britain Corps. This sounds great! As an initial story arc, I&rsquo;d have them go up against the surviving members of the Council of Reeds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no idea yet what to do with the avengers lol. I&rsquo;d imagine a new series focusing on the formation of the team, i.e. they don&rsquo;t have to exist in the previous generation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cosmic stuff: Bendis hasn&rsquo;t actually done anything much with the Gu</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Bendis is probably just waiting for someone to call him out on this on Tumblr or Twitter&hellip;</p>
<p>On another note, damn Sorrentino&rsquo;s work on the two X-Men annuals has been great. I really enjoyed his Green Arrow work and I&rsquo;m hoping to see a lot more Marvel work from him</p>

<p>My only gripe might be that the parallel earth heroes seem a bit too DC-inspired. I mean, they have a Superman, a Doctor Fate, and that lady with the lightning garb looks a bit like the New 52 Jay Garrick from Earth-2</p>

<p>There is an incursion point that will destroy one of two earths (this is on the parallel earth). Only one Earth can survive. The New Avengers meet up with that world&rsquo;s superheroes to see if they have any options, but they have less than an hour to figure a way out. The New Avengers have a unthinkable backup plan - an antimatter bomb that would destroy the parallel earth and make them mass murderers. Namor is tired of the discussions and knows where it&rsquo;s all headed&hellip;</p>

Well, I haven&rsquo;t written anything in a while, so I figured I&rsquo;d write some words on the new Spider-Man movie. Spoilers abound!
Action-packed! The web-swinging is fun and looks and feels just like Spidey from the comic books. Spider-man moves and fights and banters pretty faithfully to the comic book version of our favorite wall-crawler, so that&rsquo;s a definite plus. Peter&rsquo;s Spider-sense is portrayed as a slow-motion bullet-time kind of deal which allows him to react quickly and save all the people while dodging everything.

<p>They&rsquo;ll kill off Wolverine so that he becomes less popular and then the Fox X-Men movies will make less money and they can get the rights back, yay!</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t too impressed with the final issue. Some nice sequences overall, but a number of parts seemed rushed, like how Peter explains things so quickly to Carlie, Miguel, the Avengers even. And the Goblin recognizing it was Peter after one line of banter?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed in how Norman got away. Spider-man gets stunned for one panel and suddenly he&rsquo;s gone and neither Peter nor Miguel bother to look for him? Obviously they ran out of space to wrap that up neatly, but jeez</p>
<p>I just felt it needed a bit more oomph as a series finale I guess. I suppose they&rsquo;ll be covering the repercussions of Otto&rsquo;s run in the months to come though</p>

<p>Just finished reading the Man Out of Time and Winter Soldier story arcs of Brubaker&rsquo;s Captain America run.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t really keeping up with comics back then, how did fans react to Brubaker bringing back Bucky? Did people know ahead of time he was coming back, was it hinted at, or was it a big surprise?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I think he&rsquo;ll come back reincarnated as a bear, and he has to somehow convince the Avengers that he&rsquo;s Peter Parker using only grunts and bear swipes, but then he also has this weird need to always have honey.  Then Iron Man builds him some bear armor he uses to take down Superior Spider-Man so that he can fashion a body exchange device to get back into his old body.</p>
<p>After the body swap, the bear gets into an accident that fuses octopus arms to his body. A live octopus, not a mechanical one.</p>

<p>I like how Marvel still manages to keep some surprises under wraps without having them spoiled by the marketing department.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to. If you want, I&rsquo;ll just give you a summary right here.</p>
<p>[Spoiler](#s &ldquo;US Govt forms their own Justice League (JLA) to keep JL in check. Later Superman somehow loses control and accidentally kills one of the JLA members, Dr Light. The three Justice Leagues (JL, JLA and JL Dark - the magic guys) start hunting for this magic thing called Pandora&rsquo;s Box which they think can cure Superman or something, but the box radiates evil and makes them all fight one another. The leader of the Secret Society, the Outsider, makes an appearance and reveals that the box is actually a device that can open a gateway to his parallel world Earth-3. Then he uses the box to bring the Crime Syndicate of America (you might want to research them) over to our world. It is revealed that the Outsider is actually the &ldquo;Alfred&rdquo; of Earth-3 and the female Atom of the JL is actually from Earth-3 and was the one who jabbed a sliver of Kryptonite into Superman&rsquo;s brain to make him kill Dr Light, and that Cyborg&rsquo;s mech parts were actually an evil robot called Grid. Trinity War ends with the Crime Syndicate claiming this world as theirs &ldquo;)</p>
<p>If you really want to read it, reading the first (Justice League 22) and last (Justice League 23) issues are sufficient. All the rest is filler. And really, the only thing you need to know is that <a href="#s" title="there's an evil Justice League that wants to take over this world">Spoiler</a></p>

<p>I enjoyed this arc, despite JRJR&rsquo;s terrrible artwork. That being said, it seems we&rsquo;re getting Carlos Pacheco starting next issue, looking forward to that.</p>
<p>So, Ian was real after all right? Sharon was just mistaken when she said Zola was messing with Cap&rsquo;s head</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>So far it&rsquo;s been 5 issues of &ldquo;hey let&rsquo;s split up into 3 different groups that don&rsquo;t make sense and go to random places together and occasionally hit each other&rdquo;. It feels like everything significant is going to happen in the sixth issue.</p>
<p>I feel like this could have been done in a single 3-issue crossover between the 3 books, instead of dragging it out over six.</p>
