Easily the best comic I&rsquo;ve read this week (and I&rsquo;ve already read a lot!) is the Marvel NOW! Relaunch of the Avengers book. Avengers vol. 5 #1 by Jonathan Hickman and Jerome Opena ushers in a brand new era of Avengers; bigger, bolder and looking to be a lot more epic.

8 Dec 2012 3:49pmClose   Jonathan Hickman, fresh off what many consider to be the best Fantastic Four run in recent history (if not all-time), takes over from former Avengers showrunner Brian Michael Bendis and immediately shows us how his take on the Earth&rsquo;s Mightiest Heroes is going to set itself apart from Bendis&rsquo; 200+ issue run.

It&rsquo;s actually kind of a light week this week. There&rsquo;s a couple of Marvel NOW! #1s coming in, and nothing too exciting particularly on the DC side.
The #1 I&rsquo;m most looking forward to the most this week has to be Jonathan Hickman and Jerome Opena&rsquo;s Avengers #1 (link leads to preview pages). It&rsquo;s a new era for the Avengers as a new creative team takes over from Bendis, and it looks like Hickman will be bringing over his tendency for epic-scale adventures from the Fantastic Four books over to the Avengers franchise.

Let&rsquo;s see what the comic book man brought us this week! (Mild spoilers may ensue)
Uncanny Avengers #2 (Marvel)
  (Click to view full-size)    
30 Nov 2012 1:09pmClose   To be honest this book was not at the top of my to-read list since I was a bit underwhelmed by the first book. But that may have been a product of reading too many preview pages so that basically the only surprise I got was the shock ending of what Red Skull was doing to Xavier&rsquo;s corpse.

<p>I had this discussion with a friend who was mainly exposed to batman through the movies, and I said that the detective aspect isnt played up very much in the films. What stories can i recommend to him that show the more detective side of batman?</p>

<p>Right about Kyle. I went back and re-read the first few issues of New Guardians. He was the 2nd GL in our sector as of the start of the series, but was &ldquo;fired&rdquo; as of the 3rd issue. I don&rsquo;t know if they ever got another lantern to replace him for the sector, since they didn&rsquo;t actually got the ring off him.</p>

<div class="content p-summary">
Writing regularly is something I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be able to do but like most things I have trouble with, it&rsquo;s the lack of discipline that gets me.
Take this blog for instance. I randomly think of things to write about while I&rsquo;m idling or commuting or waiting in line or any of the dozen or so other opportunities during the day when my mind wanders, but because of laziness and/or lack of discipline, these ideas never get very far.

This week&rsquo;s biggest issue was Amazing Spider-Man #698. With three issues before the series finale and Dan Slott hyping up the ending arc and still keeping a tight lid on who may be taking over Peter&rsquo;s role in Superior Spider-Man in January, I was really excited to be able to read the first part of the final Dying Wish arc.

<p>There are two lanterns assigned to each sector. I think Kyle and Baz are the ones currently assigned to our sector. John and Guy are assigned to Oa. Hal doesn&rsquo;t currently have a ring (he and Sinestro are trapped&hellip;somewhere).</p>

<p>The art was a blast and I like the way everything was set up. I&rsquo;m hoping Hank&rsquo;s new mutation involves time travel lol. Him going back to ask the young &lsquo;uns to come forward hopefully means we don&rsquo;t get a mindless misunderstanding when the kids make it to the present day.</p>

<p>Ultimate universe hasnt been rebooted yet - a lot of people just died, but basically everything that happened in Ultimate Spider-man #1 and Ultimate X-Men #1 and onwards are still part of that universe&rsquo;s continuity.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not an american, and we dont have write-in votes where i&rsquo;m from, but in the Ultimates, cap wins the election via write in and they know the results immediately (within the same day the ballots were cast). Are they really able to count handwritten votes that quickly in US elections, or is this just a comics thing?</p>

<p>Do we know their current ages and when they became Robin, and for how long? I mean, I know Damian is ten years old right now. And Dick is always drawn like he&rsquo;s maybe 21 or something? But given that Dick started being Robin at around 9 or 10, that means Batman has been Batman for more than a decade?</p>
<p>Obviously it&rsquo;s all &ldquo;comic book time&rdquo;, but I just want to get an idea of how long ago and for what duration each of them (Dick, Jason, Tim, Damian) were Robin in the New 52 universe.</p>

<p>I mean, it looks like a main book based on the first few pages with Mockingbird, Wolverine, Ms Marvel, Black Panther, Red Hulk, and other current Avengers on the team, but the cover features the ones who&rsquo;ve appeared in the movie only. Also, as far as I know the current green Hulk is bald and intelligent, while the Hulk in this book has hair and seems less intelligent. So&hellip;which is it?</p>

The last two entries (here and here) took too long to write, and there&rsquo;s a helluva lot of other titles to go through. And many of them don&rsquo;t deserve much comments, so I&rsquo;ll just go through the rest quickly or I might never finish.

Superman&rsquo;s early years are largely re-written, and that&rsquo;s understandable, he&rsquo;s never had particularly interesting events in his history anyway

This is part 2 of my DC New 52 Review. Part is here. Hopefully I finish this series before the reviews become too out of date.
Batman
I decided to read every book of the New 52 to widen my horizons regarding my comic book reading, and one of the greatest advantages has been exposure to Scott Snyder&rsquo;s work. I have a tendency not to remember writers and artists of comics I read, except for the very famous ones, so I wasn&rsquo;t aware that I had read his work before during the Black Mirror arc in Detective Comics pre-New 52.

If you&rsquo;re reading this, that means I&rsquo;ve done it: I&rsquo;ve read the first eight issues of every DC New 52 book. I&rsquo;ve always been a Marvel fan more than DC, my previous DC reading having been restricted to JLA and the Batman books, so I figured exposure to the New 52 would widen my appreciation of the DC stable of heroes. Here are my reviews:
Justice League
While the art is Jim Lee-fantastic, the first story arc left much to be desired.

<p>I hope this isn&rsquo;t true, that would be terrible. I love that there&rsquo;s a different Spider-Man in the Ultimate Universe, with his own set of problems and issues. I&rsquo;d understand them wanting to bring Peter back someday, but Miles needs more time in the sun!</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I think the year in parenthesis is the year the series started. It makes sense for most of them, but not for Amazing Spider-Man. Pretty sure it didn&rsquo;t start in 1999. Shrug.</p>
<p>For series to jump into, do you want to follow an ongoing series? If yes, the recent ones that I like: Daredevil (&lt; 10 issues), Uncanny X-Men (they rebooted last year, only 5 issues so far), Uncanny X-Force (this is around 20 issues in), Wolverine and the X-Men (5 issues), Defenders (only 2 issues in! I like the art). The X-books might be a bit harder to pick up if you&rsquo;re not familiar with the characters as they reference a lot of previous storylines.</p>
<p>You might be interested in the Ultimate line, it&rsquo;s basically a separate universe they started around 10 years ago that has less back story for a new reader to follow. They have some ongoing series currently, namely Ultimate Comics Spider-Man (6 issues in, this Spider-Man is not Peter Parker), Ultimate Comics X-Men (6 issues) and Ultimate Comics The Ultimates (6 issues). If you want to go back farther, I suggest picking up trades of Ultimate Spider-Man (this was the first Ultimate book, and it ended last year) and Ultimate X-Men.</p>
<p>If you want some Avengers, they have several series ongoing. Avengers, New Avengers and Secret Avengers are all okay, and they&rsquo;re all in the 20+ issue range. I like New Avengers best among the three, I need to catch up on Secret Avengers</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>The book is great, except I find the pacing horribly slow. I understand  they&rsquo;re taking it slow deliberately because they&rsquo;re targetting new readers who may or may not be familiar with the rest of the league, but I feel like with a bit tighter pacing they could have gotten the current 5-issue plot in 3 issues or so.</p>
<p>Maybe I just got spoiled by Morrison&rsquo;s JLA run. By issue 5, Morrison was already on the second story arc!</p>

<p>I wish they would do one of their big yearly crossovers (on the scale of secret invasion, fear itself, etc) where they spend a lot of time trying to identify the big bad and it turns out that it was dr doom all along. Then of course they defeat him, but it&rsquo;s just a doom bot</p>

<p>From the first issue it looks like Tim Drake and company will be establishing the Titans, does mean the previous incarnations of the team never existed in the DCNU? Cyborg heading straight to the JL seems to support this, but Red Hood and the Outlaws #1 is telling us Dick has been with Starfire before, though they can always retcon that to a non-Titans interaction</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
