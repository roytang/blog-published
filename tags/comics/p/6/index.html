<p>How is reading on the app compared to say, Comixology?</p>
<p>Looks like a sweet deal, but my problem is I&rsquo;m offline during 90% of the day (I dont have a data plan) and I heard they only allow 6 offline issues at once. I usually do my reading when I&rsquo;m out of the house (when waiting in line, etc) so I&rsquo;m kinda on the fence about subscribing.</p>

Due to general business and/or laziness I&rsquo;ve missed a few weeks of posting so to get back into pace I&rsquo;m going to go through the current Marvel NOW titles and see how they&rsquo;re going so far. (We&rsquo;ll see if I have time for DCnU later)
Captain America (4 issues in) - I&rsquo;m not a big fan of Romita&rsquo;s art but at least it&rsquo;s better in this book than his AvX work.

Here are the first few Marvel comics I read this week:
Savage Wolverine #1 by Frank Cho is a fun, action-packed ride. It doesn&rsquo;t explain much of what the heck is going on, but it does feature Wolverine chopping heads off and stabbing dinosaurs in the face so hey, I guess I&rsquo;ll read it for a while!
All-New X-Men #6 sees the young X-Men trying to settle into modern day. I found young Scott&rsquo;s trying to wrap his head around mobile phones, bottled water and $5 magazines particularly amusing.

 Beast newly mutating again. It's not too radical, but I wasn't really a fan of cat-beast anyway, so I don't mind something new Stuart Immonen's artwork is still pretty good My favorite panel here has to be the one with Jean finding out about what happened to her from furry Beast. (See below) It's a nice collage that will be enjoyed by long-time X-fans who will most likely try to identify each and every scene depicted by Immonen in this spread.

 Kenneth Rocafort's art is as usual the highlight of the book for me. This time he gets to draw a full book of Superman in his Action Comics shirt and jeans, plus a few panels of the Justice League. Rocafort is easily the best artist DC comics has at the moment. Amazing build-up of Lex Luthor and how much of a genius/threat he is to Superman. It's terrific that faced with a threat beyond his grasp, Superman's first move is to consult his arch enemy before the Justice League.

DC has an extra week of #15 releases on the first week of January (January 2), since they only had two issues out on Christmas week, which were:
Justice League #15 and Aquaman #15 (Throne of Atlantis)
Geoff Johns finally gives us a bit more characterization in the Justice League, stepping up from the previous issues that seem a bit filler.

When I first heard about Amazing Spider-Man ending and being replaced by a new Superior Spider-Man series starring someone other than Peter Parker, my first thought was: maybe they&rsquo;re finally retiring Peter for good. Peter is at a pretty good point in his personal life: he has a good, fulfilling job at Horizon Labs so he doesn&rsquo;t have to miss the bills, Aunt May is well taken care of by Jameson Sr.

<div class="content p-summary">
It&rsquo;s &ldquo;Last Week in Marvel NOW!&rdquo; since this is going up on Sunday/Monday. And what a lot of Marvel NOW! we got, since many of the top titles are double shipping this month. Hopefully the schedule normalizes back to monthlies soon, I&rsquo;m already reading far too many books as it is! (Well, that&rsquo;s kind of a good problem to have right?) Luckily Marvel only has two books coming out on Christmas week, gives me some time to catch up.

There&rsquo;s really far, far too many comics I read each week to cover them in one blog post so I&rsquo;ll just cover them in groups. First, the non-Marvel NOW! series:
Hawkeye #6 is the highlight of this week&rsquo;s Marvel releases. The book is consistently funny, down-to-earth and awesome, and this issue is one of the best so far. If you haven&rsquo;t heard about it, the series written by Matt Fraction is one of Marvel&rsquo;s best ongoings right now.

<div class="content e-content">

<p>The stories in the books always take place at the time they were written. Older stories adjust to the timeline of the book you&rsquo;re reading as needed.</p>
<p>When the original x-men were introduced, their story took place in the 60s and that&rsquo;s still true if you&rsquo;re reading uncanny x-men v1 #1.</p>
<p>But when you read all new xmen #1 which takes place in 2012, the story of the original xmen happened 15-20 years ago. This means that their story doesnt have exactly the same setting as it did in uxm#1, although the details remain more or less the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit weird. Best not to take comic book timelines too seriously lol.</p>

Well, missed posting about last week&rsquo;s comics due to some technical difficulties with my home computer, let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t get back on track.
There&rsquo;s a lot to look forward to this week on the Marvel side. There&rsquo;s All-New X-Men #4 where we&rsquo;ll finally get to see Cyclops face off with his younger/older self. My other favorite so far of the Marvel NOW! books has the second issue this week: Avengers #2 continues the introductory arc to Jonathan Hickman&rsquo;s Avengers epic, let&rsquo;s see how he handles the large cast he&rsquo;s playing with.
