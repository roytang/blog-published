<p>Are you asking about the concept of comic book universes in general or about what universes Marvel has specifically?</p>
<p>Marvel has an infinite number of universes (all of them together comprise the Marvel multiverse), as opposed to DC which has only 52 universes. Each universe is usually identified by a number.</p>
<p>The main Marvel universe in which most of the Marvel comic book stories have taken place is commonly referred to as the 616 universe.</p>
<p>The other universes most active right now are the Ultimate universe for the Ultimate Comics line (I forgot the exact designation for this universe, it&rsquo;s 16xx I think) and the Marvel Cinematic Universe (I believe this is designated universe 199999) for the Iron Man/Avengers set of movies.</p>
<p>Edit: Here is a list of known Marvel universes: <a href="http://marvel.wikia.com/Multiverse/Universe_Listing">http://marvel.wikia.com/Multiverse/Universe_Listing</a></p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>The DC universe rebooted back in September 2011, which may be causing some of your confusion. Martian Manhunter used to be a big part of one of the Jusice League incarnations before this reboot. In the current universe, he has some sort of history with the Justice League but was never a full member I think.</p>
<p>In the current universe (the new 52):</p>
<p>Justice League - team of heroes formed during the Darkseid invasion five years ago, basically kicked off an age of superheroes</p>
<p>Justice League of America - the US government (ARGUS)&rsquo;s attempt to form a counterbalance to the Justice League. Basically they want to have their own Justice League that they can control.</p>
<p>Justice League Dark - a team of magic-related heroes hanging out together for one reason or another. Unaffiliated with either the JL or the JLA</p>

<p>Thor: GOT is very good.</p>
<p>Cable and X-force is a bit meh. Uncanny X-Force is better IMHO</p>
<p>Look into X-Men #1 coming out this week.</p>
<p>Consider: Daredevil, Captain Marvel, Young Avengers</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Some people I know (big comic fans) were disappointed at the Mandarin build-up then the let-down reveal. I dunno, I was kinda fine with the deception.</p>
<p>I felt like the second half of the movie was way too predictable.</p>
<p>Did Tony Stark just utter a bunch of gibberish to get Happy Endings Max to climb to the top of the van and tweak a screw on a satellite dish?</p>
<p>Apparently it&rsquo;s all right for Pepper to wear the armors (one of them at least, and a hand or two), but Tony can&rsquo;t spare one for Rhodes because &ldquo;they&rsquo;re all coded for me&rdquo;</p>
<p>How did two Mark 42 parts make it out of the garage while the rest had to bang against the door to get a kid&rsquo;s attention?</p>
<p>I watched this movie more than a week ago, so those are all I could remember right now. I thought it was okay, but not &ldquo;best in the trilogy okay&rdquo;.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;m a bit annoyed when they do variant covers that are not at all related to the book they&rsquo;re in. I mean, this one doesn&rsquo;t even have any of the cast on the cover. Wait, the first X-Men story arc isn&rsquo;t about zombies, is it?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Most books are released on a monthly basis, but they don&rsquo;t all come out on the same week, so usually a different set of books comes out every week.</p>
<p>For Marvel, some of their books double-ship, meaning they come out twice a month (sometimes more). I think DC is fairly regular with their monthly schedule. You can check the links in the OP for a list of what books are expected to come out this week and most of those sites will have schedules for the next few weeks/months as well.</p>

<div class="content p-summary">
Just rewatched the ending of X-Men First Class. As far as origin stories go, it&rsquo;s pretty decent (although a number of continuity issues with the other X-Men movies exist). Charles getting crippled during the time that he and Erik part ways is certainly better than the canon comics story of him getting crippled by a random alien. The use of the Cuban Missile Crisis was also a good idea considering how the timeline matched up with Erik&rsquo;s time in the Nazi camps.

<div class="content e-content">

<p>#6 is part of the Omega Effect crossover with the Daredevil and Punisher books</p>
<p>#8 is an epilogue for the Ends of the Earth storyline from Amazing Spider-man</p>
<p>They are probably not included in Vol 2 because they are included with separate volumes for their own storylines.</p>
<p>It should be fine to miss them, but you might also be interested in reading the above two storylines.</p>
