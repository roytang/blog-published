<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Sketchbook Pro since that&rsquo;s what I use for my sketching, but I find that my hands are very uneven at drawing the speech bubbles, so I&rsquo;m hoping for something that includes a smoothing process for the lines, and also a way to input multiple lines of text easily</p>

<p>I currently have the 4th generation iPad (the first one with retina display), and I&rsquo;ve tried using third-party styluses with them but am never satisfied, it always feel imprecise. I&rsquo;ve tried drawing with just my fingers and while it&rsquo;s more precise it also feels a bit more tiring</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of getting an iPad Pro next month. How much better would it be to use the Apple Pencil?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in the UK for a few months so I thought I&rsquo;d try Netflix, which we don&rsquo;t have where I live. I created a UK apple account so that I could download Netflix from the app store, but apparently I must enter payment info first and of course I don&rsquo;t have a UK credit card to use.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have access to a PC during the trip so I can&rsquo;t do anything that requires the use of anything other than my iPad. Am I shit out of luck?</p>
<p>Edit: After a chat with apple support, I was able to create a new account with no payment details, as explained by /u/anchorboi</p>

<p>I just want an app that gives me trivia questions that I can toss out to people. Nothing that requires an internet connection and preferably no time limits. A wide variety of trivia questions and topics would be great.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Thanks! I was able to add back the old sidebar, but it seems I still can&rsquo;t drag epubs directly to the ipad, though I can add them to the itunes library.</p>

<p>How is this done in the new itunes? In the old one I just drag epubs to the iPad on the left side panel. In the new itunes I tried going to the Books tab of the iPad but it seems I can&rsquo;t drag anything into there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna do syncing or anything, I want to be able to copy/remove books individually as needed.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>iTunes will only accept certain video formats. For example, I think mp4s are fine but mkvs aren&rsquo;t. Not sure if it filters based on the container or the encoding.</p>
<p>And yeah, syncing to an iPad isn&rsquo;t the best thing =/</p>

<p>Is there something that makes this easy? Like say I&rsquo;m browsing something on my PC and I see an image that could be a good ipad wallpaper so I want to send it to my ipad somehow. Or maybe I see something on my ipad and think &ldquo;I want to view this on my desktop&rdquo; so I want to send the link there. I don&rsquo;t want to have to do something like send it out via an email, I&rsquo;m hoping /r/ipad has some sort of mindblowing magic for me.</p>
<p>Edit: probably should have mentioned i dont use a mac</p>

Also, can anyone recommend alternatives?</a></h4>
<p>In my previous thread <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/mv9ji/can_someone_recommend_a_comic_book_reader_cbrcbz/">http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/mv9ji/can_someone_recommend_a_comic_book_reader_cbrcbz/</a> practically everyone recommended comiczeal, but it doesn&rsquo;t have the easy collection management features I was looking for. Specifically, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a way to upload multiple folders&rsquo; worth of comics at a time (both the sync app and itunes file sharing only accept files, not folders), and no easy way to delete lots of comics at a time (still need to select them individually or something)</p>
<p>Is there a way to ask Apple for a refund because I&rsquo;m not satisfied with the app?</p>
<p>Also, can someone recommend any alternatives?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<ul>
<li>preferably free :)</li>
<li>easy to transfer/manage lots of files including folder hierarchy (talking hundreds of files in dozens of folders here)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently using ComicFlow, but the limitation of this app is that it only supports a folder structure that is up to one folder deep.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t recommend Stanza, the file management there is terrible when you get to a larger number of files.</p>

<p>I mean, if both a 3g connection and a wifi connection are available, will it use the wifi instead of the 3g?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Upvotes for this. I posted the following message:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are multitouch gestures not enabled in iOS5 for iPad1? I&rsquo;ve been using them for months in developer mode without any problems so I&rsquo;m sure the hardware can handle it. Please patch it back in, this makes me want to jailbreak&rdquo;</p>
<p>No idea if it will work, but maybe if enough of us do it they&rsquo;ll take notice :D</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using multitouch gestures on the iPad1 for months and it didn&rsquo;t feel laggy at all to me. Far from completely pointless, I loved the feature</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/lapqm/still_no_multitouch_gestures_on_ios_5_for_ipad_1/">&#39;Still no multitouch gestures on iOS 5 for iPad 1?&#39; on /r/ipad</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>I had the multitouch gestures before the update (i have developer mode) so it is quite ridiculous how ios5 disabled it for ipad1s since ive never had a problem with the feature. Either apple hates us ipad1 owners or they want to force us to upgrade. Having multitouch gestures really made the ipad a lot more usable, i will miss it greatly (and no i dont want to jailbreak~)</p>

<p>The stylus is a Targus one&hellip;I plan to use the iPad for drawing/random doodling, but the only drawing app I have at the moment is Adobe Ideas. Any suggestions for good drawing/doodling apps (preferably free ones)?</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m using the official Apple case, but I&rsquo;d like to be able to attach the stylus to the ipad somehow to avoid losing it&hellip;any ideas?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using my iPad for a bit more than a month now, and I&rsquo;m mostly satisfied. I use it for browsing, social networking, ebook reading and s few games. Several people are telling me however that I&rsquo;m not getting the most out of the device uless I jailbreak it. How true is this, especially for an engineer type who likes to tinker with stuff? Are there any risks or disadvantages to jail breaking? Will I lose my warranty?</p>

<p>Basically, I just installed iTunes on this machine (had to reformat/reinstall the PC), and downloaded a few apps (using the same iTunes account as the one on my iPad). But when I try to sync the apps with the iPad, iTunes seems to want to delete all the other apps on the iPad. How do I &ldquo;merge&rdquo; the libraries?</p>

<p>So, I have a non-US billing address so I don&rsquo;t have access to the US app store. Can I create an account for the US app store, then download an app from there and put it on my iPad, together with apps from my main account?</p>
<p>Sorry for being noobish, I&rsquo;m new to this Apple thing. :D</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions!</p>
<p>The iPad was purchased for me by a friend, so I did not have any choice with the model. I don&rsquo;t have Wifi ubiquitously where I am, so the 3G is cool with me anyways. :D</p>
