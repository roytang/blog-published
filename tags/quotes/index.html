Shogun There&rsquo;s a quote I like from James Clavell&rsquo;s novel Shogun:
 “It&rsquo;s a saying they have, that a man has a false heart in his mouth for the world to see, another in his breast to show to his special friends and his family, and the real one, the true one, the secret one, which is never known to anyone except to himself alone, hidden only God knows where.”

“We are, finally, all wanderers in search of knowledge. Most of us hold the dream of becoming something better than we are, something larger, richer, in some way more important to the world and ourselves. Too often, the way taken is the wrong way, with too much emphasis on what we want to have, rather than what we wish to become.” — Louis L’Amour

&ldquo;Never give in, never, never, never–never, in nothing, great or small, large or petty. Never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense.&rdquo;
 Churchill   Persistence is a virtue, except when it isn&rsquo;t - there is some amount of good sense necessary to discern when one should just give in. As in most things, a balance is required. Unfortunately, good sense is not always in abundance in today&rsquo;s world.

Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
&ndash; Winston Churchill
 I already typed the above quote into the post, then realized I had already used it before. Whatever, just goes to show, I&rsquo;m no stranger to failure.
I was reminded of this quote because recently I prepared a demo for a project that didn&rsquo;t push through. At first I was annoyed at the wasted effort, but I realized that I had wisely taken the demo project as an opportunity to learn/sharpen some skills.

It&rsquo;s fun to think about what might have been, but often regret is tinged with optimism - the optimism that given another chance, we might have made different decisions and obtained better outcomes. But different doesn&rsquo;t always mean better, so such visualizations are often pointless speculation.

&ldquo;Whatever doesn&rsquo;t kill you, only makes you stronger.&rdquo;
 Nietzche   I liked this quote a lot when I was younger and more gung-ho, especially about things like work. In fact, I may have considered it as a bit of a defining quote back then. I guess the idea was &lsquo;ok, we&rsquo;ll rush in and try anything, at worst we learn a lesson and be better for next time&rsquo;.

“Of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these, &lsquo;It might have been.&rdquo;
― John Greenleaf Whittier, Maud Muller - Pamphlet
 It is human nature perhaps, to think about those alternate realities that might have come from different decisions or different dispositions.
If only I was braver.
If only I was more decisive.
If only I didn&rsquo;t have something holding me back.
If only I knew what I knew now.

For my first few years in elementary school, I didn&rsquo;t get any pocket money. Instead I&rsquo;d have a couple of sandwiches and a thermos of water. So I wasn&rsquo;t used to handling money. One time while waiting for the school bus, I was a bit thirsty but my thermos was already out. For some reason, I decided to borrow five pesos from a classmate to buy a coke from the canteen.

It is said an Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a sentence, to be ever in view, and which should be true and appropriate in all times and situations. They presented him the words: And this, too, shall pass away. How much it expresses! How chastening in the hour of pride!how consoling in the depth of affliction!
 Abraham Lincoln   More quotes! I like ones that have a level of ambiguity, a meaning that changes depending on situation.

18 Feb 2019 5:56amClose   The quote is from the 1980s cult classic Bill and Ted&rsquo;s Excellent Adventure. I didn&rsquo;t include this movie in my top 10 movies post, but it and the sequel Bill and Ted&rsquo;s Bogus Journey are still among my childhood faves. These wise words are give by the Wyld Stallyns band composed of the epnoymous Bill and Ted, and form the philosophical basis of the future utopian civilization inspired by their music.

 &ldquo;The world isn&rsquo;t fair Calvin&rdquo;

&ndash; Bill Watterson, &ldquo;Calvin and Hobbes&rdquo;
 Quote 2:
 &ldquo;If you expect the world to be fair with you because you&rsquo;re fair to them, its like asking a lion not to eat you because you don&rsquo;t eat lions.&rdquo;
(Unknown source)
 We accept that the natural order of the world is inherently unfair.

&ldquo;The price for being the best is always&hellip; having to be the best.&rdquo;
 Terry Pratchet, Lords and Ladies   This is one of my favorite quotes. For context: in the story, one of the characters has a special talent that he can shoe anything anyone gives him (like when you put horseshoes on a horse). And Granny Weatherwax tells him that the price he pays for that talent is that when someone brings him something to shoe, no matter how wild or ridiculous the request, he has to do it.

<blockquote>
<p>Frodo: I can&rsquo;t do this, Sam.</p>
<p>Sam: I know. It&rsquo;s all wrong. By rights we shouldn&rsquo;t even be here. But we are. It&rsquo;s like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger, they were. And sometimes you didn&rsquo;t want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it&rsquo;s only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn&rsquo;t. They kept going. Because they were holding on to something.  Frodo: What are we holding onto, Sam?  Sam: That there&rsquo;s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo&hellip; and it&rsquo;s worth fighting for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On its world, the people are people. The leaders are lizards. The people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people.”</p>
<p>“Odd,” said Arthur, “I thought you said it was a democracy.”</p>
<p>“I did,” said Ford. “It is.”</p>
<p>“So,” said Arthur, hoping he wasn’t sounding ridiculously obtuse, “why don’t the people get rid of the lizards?”</p>
<p>“It honestly doesn’t occur to them,” said Ford. “They’ve all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they’ve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want.”</p>
<p>“You mean they actually vote for the lizards?”</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,” said Ford with a shrug, “of course.”</p>
<p>“But,” said Arthur, going for the big one again, “why?”</p>
<p>“Because if they didn’t vote for a lizard,” said Ford, “the wrong lizard might get in.”</p>

<p>“Anyway, George comes up to me the first day of filming and he takes one look at the dress and says, &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t wear a bra under that dress.&rsquo; So, I say, &lsquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll bite. Why?&rsquo; And he says, &lsquo;Because&hellip; there&rsquo;s no underwear in space.&rsquo; I promise you this is true, and he says it with such conviction too! Like he had been to space and looked around and he didn&rsquo;t see any bras or panties or briefs anywhere. Now, George came to my show when it was in Berkeley. He came backstage and explained why you can&rsquo;t wear your brassiere in other galaxies, and I have a sense you will be going to outer space very soon, so here&rsquo;s why you cannot wear your brassiere, per George. So, what happens is you go to space and you become weightless. So far so good, right? But then your body expands??? But your bra doesn&rsquo;t- so you get strangled by your own bra. Now I think that this would make a fantastic obit- so I tell my younger friends that no matter how I go, I want it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra.”</p>
<p>― Carrie Fisher, Wishful Drinking</p>

<p>It is said an Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a sentence, to be ever in view, and which should be true and appropriate in all times and situations. They presented him the words: &ldquo;And this, too, shall pass away.&rdquo; How much it expresses! How chastening in the hour of pride! How consoling in the depths of affliction!</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that &ldquo;my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.&quot;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ndash; Isaac Asimov, Column in Newsweek (21 January 1980)  (not really just a US thing)</p>

<p>I met a traveller from an antique land</p>
<p>Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone</p>
<p>Stand in the desert.</p>
<p>Near them, on the sand,</p>
<p>Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,</p>
<p>And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,</p>
<p>Tell that its sculptor well those passions read</p>
<p>Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,</p>
<p>The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:</p>
<p>And on the pedestal these words appear:</p>
<p>&lsquo;My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nothing beside remains.</p>
<p>Round the decay</p>
<p>Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare</p>
<p>The lone and level sands stretch far away</p>
<p>&ndash; Percy Bysshe Shelly, &ldquo;Ozymandias&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the world were merely seductive, that would be easy. If it were merely challenging, that would be no problem. But I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.” - E.B. White</p>

<p>“By taking the risk of trying hard means you are going to make mistakes, and then the most important thing is hopefully realizing that and doing something about it. Being a good dad is not a static thing. Having a good marriage isn’t a static thing. Neither is a democracy. Neither is a friendship. Tomorrow morning you have to start over, continue the process and make adjustments. And if you don’t… it’s a game that moves as you play, and if you don’t move you can’t play”  Viggo Mortensen, on Here’s The Thing podcast</p>
