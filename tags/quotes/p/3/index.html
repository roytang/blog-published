<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Many adults are put off when youngsters pose scientific questions. Children ask why the sun is yellow, or what a dream is, or how deep you can dig a hole, or when is the world’s birthday, or why we have toes. </p>
<p>Too many teachers and parents answer with irritation or ridicule, or quickly move on to something else. Why adults should pretend to omniscience before a five-year-old, I can’t for the life of me understand. What’s wrong with admitting that you don’t know? Children soon recognize that somehow this kind of question annoys many adults. A few more experiences like this, and another child has been lost to science.</p>
<p>There are many better responses. If we have an idea of the answer, we could try to explain. If we don’t, we could go to the encyclopedia or the library. Or we might say to the child: “I don’t know the answer. Maybe no one knows. Maybe when you grow up, you’ll be the first to find out.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>After learning my flight was detained 4 hours,<br/>
I heard the announcement:<br/>
If anyone in the vicinity of gate 4-A understands any Arabic,<br/>
Please come to the gate immediately.</p>
<p>Well—one pauses these days. Gate 4-A was my own gate. I went there.<br/>
An older woman in full traditional Palestinian dress,<br/>
Just like my grandma wore, was crumpled to the floor, wailing loudly.<br/>
Help, said the flight service person. Talk to her. What is her<br/>
Problem? we told her the flight was going to be four hours late and she<br/>
Did this.</p>
<p>I put my arm around her and spoke to her haltingly.<br/>
Shu dow-a, shu- biduck habibti, stani stani schway, min fadlick,<br/>
Sho bit se-wee?</p>
<p>The minute she heard any words she knew—however poorly used—<br/>
She stopped crying.</p>
<p>She thought our flight had been canceled entirely.<br/>
She needed to be in El Paso for some major medical treatment the<br/>
Following day. I said no, no, we’re fine, you’ll get there, just late,</p>
<p>Who is picking you up? Let’s call him and tell him.<br/>
We called her son and I spoke with him in English.<br/>
I told him I would stay with his mother till we got on the plane and<br/>
Would ride next to her—Southwest.</p>
<p>She talked to him. Then we called her other sons just for the fun of it.</p>
<p>Then we called my dad and he and she spoke for a while in Arabic and<br/>
Found out of course they had ten shared friends.</p>
<p>Then I thought just for the heck of it why not call some Palestinian<br/>
Poets I know and let them chat with her. This all took up about 2 hours.</p>
<p>She was laughing a lot by then. Telling about her life. Answering<br/>
Questions.</p>
<p>She had pulled a sack of homemade mamool cookies—little powdered<br/>
Sugar crumbly mounds stuffed with dates and nuts—out of her bag—<br/>
And was offering them to all the women at the gate.</p>
<p>To my amazement, not a single woman declined one. It was like a<br/>
Sacrament. The traveler from Argentina, the traveler from California,<br/>
The lovely woman from Laredo—we were all covered with the same<br/>
Powdered sugar. And smiling. There are no better cookies.</p>
<p>And then the airline broke out the free beverages from huge coolers—<br/>
Non-alcoholic—and the two little girls for our flight, one African<br/>
American, one Mexican American—ran around serving us all apple juice<br/>
And lemonade and they were covered with powdered sugar too.</p>
<p>And I noticed my new best friend—by now we were holding hands—<br/>
Had a potted plant poking out of her bag, some medicinal thing,</p>
<p>With green furry leaves. Such an old country traveling tradition. Always<br/>
Carry a plant. Always stay rooted to somewhere.</p>
<p>And I looked around that gate of late and weary ones and thought,<br/>
This is the world I want to live in. The shared world.</p>
<p>Not a single person in this gate—once the crying of confusion stopped<br/>
—has seemed apprehensive about any other person.</p>
<p>They took the cookies. I wanted to hug all those other women too.<br/>
This can still happen anywhere.</p>
<p>Not everything is lost.</p></blockquote>
--Naomi Shihab Nye (b. 1952), “Wandering Around an Albuquerque Airport Terminal.” I think this poem may be making the rounds, this week, but that’s as it should be.  (via <a class="tumblr_blog" href="http://oliviacirce.tumblr.com/">oliviacirce</a>)<p>When I lose hope in the world, I remember this poem. </p> (via <a href="http://bookoisseur.tumblr.com/" class="tumblr_blog">bookoisseur</a>)

<blockquote>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; because there is not effort without error and shortcomings; but who does actually strive to do the deed; who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotion, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly. So that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>This week two noteworthy events involving the Philippines made headlines: the botched rescue of Chinese tourists taken hostage by a disgruntled former policeman, and a botched response to a question by Miss Philippines in the finals for the Miss Universe contest. You might ask, what do these two things have in common? Separately, not much, but taken together, they represent both the peril and promise of the Philippines today.<br/>
…If the Philippines wants to get its act together and live up to its potential, it needs to demand more of itself. It can achieve this by stopping making excuses for its failures and ending its acceptance of the lowest common denominator. President Aquino promised to put an end to nepotism and corruption in government. The people should make sure he does this. When the police screw up a hostage rescue, the people responsible should be fired. And when a beauty queen blows an attempt to become the glory of the Philippine people, it should be recognized as such.</blockquote>
