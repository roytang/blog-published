<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that. Or perhaps we&rsquo;ve just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we&rsquo;ve barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us.&rdquo; - Cooper, Interstellar</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes the things that may or may not be true are the things a man needs to believe in the most. That people are basically good; that honor, courage, and virtue mean everything; that power and money, money and power mean nothing; that good always triumphs over evil; and I want you to remember this, that love&hellip; true love never dies. You remember that, boy. You remember that. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s true or not. You see, a man should believe in those things, because those are the things worth believing in.&rdquo; - Secondhand Lions</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the start of all this? When did the cogs of fate begin to turn? Perhaps it is impossible to grasp that answer now, From deep within the flow of time.  But for a certainty, back then We loved so many yet hated so much We hurt others and were hurt ourselves.  Yet even then we ran like the wind Whilst our laughter echoed Under cerulean skies&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Many adults are put off when youngsters pose scientific questions. Children ask why the sun is yellow, or what a dream is, or how deep you can dig a hole, or when is the world’s birthday, or why we have toes. </p>
<p>Too many teachers and parents answer with irritation or ridicule, or quickly move on to something else. Why adults should pretend to omniscience before a five-year-old, I can’t for the life of me understand. What’s wrong with admitting that you don’t know? Children soon recognize that somehow this kind of question annoys many adults. A few more experiences like this, and another child has been lost to science.</p>
<p>There are many better responses. If we have an idea of the answer, we could try to explain. If we don’t, we could go to the encyclopedia or the library. Or we might say to the child: “I don’t know the answer. Maybe no one knows. Maybe when you grow up, you’ll be the first to find out.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>After learning my flight was detained 4 hours,<br/>
I heard the announcement:<br/>
If anyone in the vicinity of gate 4-A understands any Arabic,<br/>
Please come to the gate immediately.</p>
<p>Well—one pauses these days. Gate 4-A was my own gate. I went there.<br/>
An older woman in full traditional Palestinian dress,<br/>
Just like my grandma wore, was crumpled to the floor, wailing loudly.<br/>
Help, said the flight service person. Talk to her. What is her<br/>
Problem? we told her the flight was going to be four hours late and she<br/>
Did this.</p>
<p>I put my arm around her and spoke to her haltingly.<br/>
Shu dow-a, shu- biduck habibti, stani stani schway, min fadlick,<br/>
Sho bit se-wee?</p>
<p>The minute she heard any words she knew—however poorly used—<br/>
She stopped crying.</p>
<p>She thought our flight had been canceled entirely.<br/>
She needed to be in El Paso for some major medical treatment the<br/>
Following day. I said no, no, we’re fine, you’ll get there, just late,</p>
<p>Who is picking you up? Let’s call him and tell him.<br/>
We called her son and I spoke with him in English.<br/>
I told him I would stay with his mother till we got on the plane and<br/>
Would ride next to her—Southwest.</p>
<p>She talked to him. Then we called her other sons just for the fun of it.</p>
<p>Then we called my dad and he and she spoke for a while in Arabic and<br/>
Found out of course they had ten shared friends.</p>
<p>Then I thought just for the heck of it why not call some Palestinian<br/>
Poets I know and let them chat with her. This all took up about 2 hours.</p>
<p>She was laughing a lot by then. Telling about her life. Answering<br/>
Questions.</p>
<p>She had pulled a sack of homemade mamool cookies—little powdered<br/>
Sugar crumbly mounds stuffed with dates and nuts—out of her bag—<br/>
And was offering them to all the women at the gate.</p>
<p>To my amazement, not a single woman declined one. It was like a<br/>
Sacrament. The traveler from Argentina, the traveler from California,<br/>
The lovely woman from Laredo—we were all covered with the same<br/>
Powdered sugar. And smiling. There are no better cookies.</p>
<p>And then the airline broke out the free beverages from huge coolers—<br/>
Non-alcoholic—and the two little girls for our flight, one African<br/>
American, one Mexican American—ran around serving us all apple juice<br/>
And lemonade and they were covered with powdered sugar too.</p>
<p>And I noticed my new best friend—by now we were holding hands—<br/>
Had a potted plant poking out of her bag, some medicinal thing,</p>
<p>With green furry leaves. Such an old country traveling tradition. Always<br/>
Carry a plant. Always stay rooted to somewhere.</p>
<p>And I looked around that gate of late and weary ones and thought,<br/>
This is the world I want to live in. The shared world.</p>
<p>Not a single person in this gate—once the crying of confusion stopped<br/>
—has seemed apprehensive about any other person.</p>
<p>They took the cookies. I wanted to hug all those other women too.<br/>
This can still happen anywhere.</p>
<p>Not everything is lost.</p></blockquote>
<p>&ndash;Naomi Shihab Nye (b. 1952), “Wandering Around an Albuquerque Airport Terminal.” I think this poem may be making the rounds, this week, but that’s as it should be.  (via <a class="tumblr_blog" href="http://oliviacirce.tumblr.com/">oliviacirce</a>)<p>When I lose hope in the world, I remember this poem. </p> (via <a href="http://bookoisseur.tumblr.com/" class="tumblr_blog">bookoisseur</a>)</p>
