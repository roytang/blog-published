<p>“By taking the risk of trying hard means you are going to make mistakes, and then the most important thing is hopefully realizing that and doing something about it. Being a good dad is not a static thing. Having a good marriage isn’t a static thing. Neither is a democracy. Neither is a friendship. Tomorrow morning you have to start over, continue the process and make adjustments. And if you don’t… it’s a game that moves as you play, and if you don’t move you can’t play”  Viggo Mortensen, on Here’s The Thing podcast</p>

<blockquote>You are the books you read the films you watch, the music you listen to, the people you meet, the dreams you have, the conversations you engage in. You are what you take from these. You are the sound of the ocean, the breath of fresh air, the brightest light and the darkest corner. You are a collective of every experience you have had in your life. You are every single second of every single day. So drown yourself in a sea of knowledge and existence. Let the words run through your veins and let the colours fill your mind.</blockquote>

<p>Be soft. Do not let the world make you hard. Do not let pain make you hate. Do not let the bitterness steal your sweetness. Take pride that even though the rest of the world may disagree, you still believe it to be a beautiful place. - Iain Thomas, I Wrote This For You (often wrongly attributed to Kurt Vonnegut)</p>

<blockquote><p>This is an excellent writing advice from Chuck Palahniuk. This was first seen on tumblr. Unfortunately, when I clicked on the link, it no longer existed.</p>
<p>But, I still think it’s worth sharing.</p>
<p>writingadvice: by Chuck Palahniuk</p>
<p>In six seconds, you’ll hate me.<br/>
But in six months, you’ll be a better writer.</p>
<p>From this point forward—at least for the next half year—you may not<br/>
use “thought” verbs. These include: Thinks, Knows, Understands,<br/>
Realizes, Believes, Wants, Remembers, Imagines, Desires, and a hundred<br/>
others you love to use.</p>
<p>The list should also include: Loves and Hates.<br/>
And it should include: Is and Has, but we’ll get to those later.</p>
<p>Until some time around Christmas, you can’t write: Kenny wondered if Monica didn’t like him going out at night…”</p>
<p>Instead, you’ll have to Un-pack that to something like: “The<br/>
mornings after Kenny had stayed out, beyond the last bus, until he’d<br/>
had to bum a ride or pay for a cab and got home to find Monica faking<br/>
sleep, faking because she never slept that quiet, those mornings, she’d<br/>
only put her own cup of coffee in the microwave. Never his.”</p>
<p>Instead of characters knowing anything, you must now present<br/>
the details that allow the reader to know them. Instead of a character<br/>
wanting something, you must now describe the thing so that the reader<br/>
wants it.</p>
<p>Instead of saying: “Adam knew Gwen liked him.” You’ll have<br/>
to say: “Between classes, Gwen had always leaned on his locker when he’d<br/>
go to open it. She’s roll her eyes and shove off with one foot,<br/>
leaving a black-heel mark on the painted metal, but she also left the<br/>
smell of her perfume. The combination lock would still be warm from her<br/>
butt. And the next break, Gwen would be leaned there, again.”</p>
<p>In short, no more short-cuts. Only specific sensory detail: action, smell, taste, sound, and feeling.</p>
<p>Typically,<br/>
writers use these “thought” verbs at the beginning of a paragraph (In<br/>
this form, you can call them “Thesis Statements” and I’ll rail against<br/>
those, later). In a way, they state the intention of the paragraph. And<br/>
what follows, illustrates them.</p>
<p>For example:<br/>
“Brenda knew she’d never make the deadline. Traffic<br/>
was backed up from the bridge, past the first eight or nine exits. Her<br/>
cell phone battery was dead. At home, the dogs would need to go out, or<br/>
there would be a mess to clean up. Plus, she’d promised to water the<br/>
plants for her neighbor…”</p>
<p>Do you see how the opening “thesis statement” steals the thunder of what follows? Don’t do it.</p>
<p>If nothing else, cut the opening sentence and place it after all the others. Better yet, transplant it and change it to: Brenda would never make the deadline.</p>
<p>Thinking is abstract. Knowing and believing are intangible. Your<br/>
story will always be stronger if you just show the physical actions<br/>
and details of your characters and allow your reader to do the thinking<br/>
and knowing. And loving and hating.</p>
<p>Don’t tell your reader: “Lisa hated Tom.”</p>
<p>Instead, make your case like a lawyer in court, detail by detail.</p>
<p>Present each piece of evidence. For example:<br/>
“During roll call,<br/>
in the breath after the teacher said Tom’s name, in that moment before<br/>
he could answer, right then, Lisa would whisper-shout ‘Butt Wipe,’ just<br/>
as Tom was saying, ‘Here’.”</p>
<p>One of the most-common mistakes that beginning writers make is leaving their characters alone. Writing,<br/>
you may be alone. Reading, your audience may be alone. But your<br/>
character should spend very, very little time alone. Because a solitary<br/>
character starts thinking or worrying or wondering.</p>
<p>For example: Waiting for the bus, Mark started to worry about how long the trip would take…”</p>
<p>A better break-down might be: “The schedule said the bus would come<br/>
by at noon, but Mark’s watch said it was already 11:57. You could see<br/>
all the way down the road, as far as the Mall, and not see a bus. No<br/>
doubt, the driver was parked at the turn-around, the far end of the<br/>
line, taking a nap. The driver was kicked back, asleep, and Mark was<br/>
going to be late. Or worse, the driver was drinking, and he’d pull up<br/>
drunk and charge Mark seventy-five cents for death in a fiery traffic<br/>
accident…”</p>
<p>A character alone must lapse into fantasy or memory, but even then<br/>
you can’t use “thought” verbs or any of their abstract relatives.</p>
<p>Oh, and you can just forget about using the verbs forget and remember.</p>
<p>No more transitions such as: “Wanda remembered how Nelson used to brush her hair.”</p>
<p>Instead: “Back in their sophomore year, Nelson used to brush her hair with smooth, long strokes of his hand.”</p>
<p>Again, Un-pack. Don’t take short-cuts.</p>
<p>Better yet, get your character with another character, fast.<br/>
Get them together and get the action started. Let their actions and<br/>
words show their thoughts. You—stay out of their heads.</p>
<p>And while you’re avoiding “thought” verbs, be very wary about using the bland verbs “is” and “have.”</p>
<p>For example:<br/>
“Ann’s eyes are blue.”</p>
<p>“Ann has blue eyes.”</p>
<p>Versus:</p>
<p>“Ann coughed and waved one hand past her face, clearing the cigarette smoke from her eyes, blue eyes, before she smiled…”</p>
<p>Instead of bland “is” and “has” statements, try burying your details<br/>
of what a character has or is, in actions or gestures. At its most<br/>
basic, this is showing your story instead of telling it.</p>
<p>And forever after, once you’ve learned to Un-pack your characters,<br/>
you’ll hate the lazy writer who settles for: “Jim sat beside the<br/>
telephone, wondering why Amanda didn’t call.”</p>
<p>Please. For now, hate me all you want, but don’t use thought verbs. After Christmas, go crazy, but I’d bet money you won’t.</p>
<p>(…)</p>
<p>For this month’s homework, pick through your writing and circle every “thought” verb. Then, find some way to eliminate it. Kill it by Un-packing it.</p>
<p>Then, pick through some published fiction and do the same thing. Be ruthless.</p>
<p>“Marty imagined fish, jumping in the moonlight…”</p>
<p>“Nancy recalled the way the wine tasted…”</p>
<p>“Larry knew he was a dead man…”</p>
<p>Find them. After that, find a way to re-write them. Make them stronger.</p></blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that. Or perhaps we&rsquo;ve just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we&rsquo;ve barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us.&rdquo; - Cooper, Interstellar</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes the things that may or may not be true are the things a man needs to believe in the most. That people are basically good; that honor, courage, and virtue mean everything; that power and money, money and power mean nothing; that good always triumphs over evil; and I want you to remember this, that love&hellip; true love never dies. You remember that, boy. You remember that. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s true or not. You see, a man should believe in those things, because those are the things worth believing in.&rdquo; - Secondhand Lions</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Many adults are put off when youngsters pose scientific questions. Children ask why the sun is yellow, or what a dream is, or how deep you can dig a hole, or when is the world’s birthday, or why we have toes. </p>
<p>Too many teachers and parents answer with irritation or ridicule, or quickly move on to something else. Why adults should pretend to omniscience before a five-year-old, I can’t for the life of me understand. What’s wrong with admitting that you don’t know? Children soon recognize that somehow this kind of question annoys many adults. A few more experiences like this, and another child has been lost to science.</p>
<p>There are many better responses. If we have an idea of the answer, we could try to explain. If we don’t, we could go to the encyclopedia or the library. Or we might say to the child: “I don’t know the answer. Maybe no one knows. Maybe when you grow up, you’ll be the first to find out.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>After learning my flight was detained 4 hours,<br/>
I heard the announcement:<br/>
If anyone in the vicinity of gate 4-A understands any Arabic,<br/>
Please come to the gate immediately.</p>
<p>Well—one pauses these days. Gate 4-A was my own gate. I went there.<br/>
An older woman in full traditional Palestinian dress,<br/>
Just like my grandma wore, was crumpled to the floor, wailing loudly.<br/>
Help, said the flight service person. Talk to her. What is her<br/>
Problem? we told her the flight was going to be four hours late and she<br/>
Did this.</p>
<p>I put my arm around her and spoke to her haltingly.<br/>
Shu dow-a, shu- biduck habibti, stani stani schway, min fadlick,<br/>
Sho bit se-wee?</p>
<p>The minute she heard any words she knew—however poorly used—<br/>
She stopped crying.</p>
<p>She thought our flight had been canceled entirely.<br/>
She needed to be in El Paso for some major medical treatment the<br/>
Following day. I said no, no, we’re fine, you’ll get there, just late,</p>
<p>Who is picking you up? Let’s call him and tell him.<br/>
We called her son and I spoke with him in English.<br/>
I told him I would stay with his mother till we got on the plane and<br/>
Would ride next to her—Southwest.</p>
<p>She talked to him. Then we called her other sons just for the fun of it.</p>
<p>Then we called my dad and he and she spoke for a while in Arabic and<br/>
Found out of course they had ten shared friends.</p>
<p>Then I thought just for the heck of it why not call some Palestinian<br/>
Poets I know and let them chat with her. This all took up about 2 hours.</p>
<p>She was laughing a lot by then. Telling about her life. Answering<br/>
Questions.</p>
<p>She had pulled a sack of homemade mamool cookies—little powdered<br/>
Sugar crumbly mounds stuffed with dates and nuts—out of her bag—<br/>
And was offering them to all the women at the gate.</p>
<p>To my amazement, not a single woman declined one. It was like a<br/>
Sacrament. The traveler from Argentina, the traveler from California,<br/>
The lovely woman from Laredo—we were all covered with the same<br/>
Powdered sugar. And smiling. There are no better cookies.</p>
<p>And then the airline broke out the free beverages from huge coolers—<br/>
Non-alcoholic—and the two little girls for our flight, one African<br/>
American, one Mexican American—ran around serving us all apple juice<br/>
And lemonade and they were covered with powdered sugar too.</p>
<p>And I noticed my new best friend—by now we were holding hands—<br/>
Had a potted plant poking out of her bag, some medicinal thing,</p>
<p>With green furry leaves. Such an old country traveling tradition. Always<br/>
Carry a plant. Always stay rooted to somewhere.</p>
<p>And I looked around that gate of late and weary ones and thought,<br/>
This is the world I want to live in. The shared world.</p>
<p>Not a single person in this gate—once the crying of confusion stopped<br/>
—has seemed apprehensive about any other person.</p>
<p>They took the cookies. I wanted to hug all those other women too.<br/>
This can still happen anywhere.</p>
<p>Not everything is lost.</p></blockquote>
--Naomi Shihab Nye (b. 1952), “Wandering Around an Albuquerque Airport Terminal.” I think this poem may be making the rounds, this week, but that’s as it should be.  (via <a class="tumblr_blog" href="http://oliviacirce.tumblr.com/">oliviacirce</a>)<p>When I lose hope in the world, I remember this poem. </p> (via <a href="http://bookoisseur.tumblr.com/" class="tumblr_blog">bookoisseur</a>)

<blockquote>A programmer should be able to find a bug, market an application, refactor a spike, lead a team, architect an application, hack a kernel, schedule a project, build a database, route a network, give a reference, implement UserStories, analyze UserStories, work in a team, work alone, use patterns, innovate, write documentation, have a RealLife, create a cool website, email efficiently, resign gracefully, AdmitIgnorance, and keep on learning. Specialization is for recruiters.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; because there is not effort without error and shortcomings; but who does actually strive to do the deed; who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotion, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly. So that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.</blockquote>
<p>&ndash;Theodore Roosevelt</p>
