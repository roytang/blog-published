<p>Flight B, February 2, 2008, Saturday at Neutral Grounds Galleria. The format is LOR/MOR sealed.</p>
<p>I get my product and check it out. No outright bombs or cash rares, but I immediately spot the Drowner of Secrets + Merrow Commerce + 2 Stonybrook Schoolmasters. I had reasonable fliers and permission, so I built the blue-white deck. My only removal being a Weight of Conscience that I did not actually put in the maindeck.</p>

Tournament was at January 5 2008 in Robinson&rsquo;s Galleria. I only found out the day before, so I brought the only deck I had &ndash; Mannequin.
Round 1: 0-2 loss vs UG Faeries
Round 2: 0-2 loss vs BGW Doran
Round 3: 2-0 win vs BW unknown deck
Round 4: 0-2 loss vs UG Faeries
Round 5: 0-2 loss vs BG Tarmorack
Ugh. Terrible way to start the year. My own fault for bringing an outdated version of Mannequin to the tournament without even any testing.

I believe that this year, I have managed to improve my Magic-playing a bit (despite the abundance of embarassing mistakes).I also believe I&rsquo;m slightly better at Limited than I am at Constructed. TO back up these beliefs, I could point to my DCI ratings. But as a programmer who loves stats, I compiled additional stats for my own pleasure: My Playing Stats.
A bit of background: I&rsquo;ve been playing Magic on and off since Revised, but only gotten into the tournament scene seriously in 2006.

A couple of weeks ago, just before the last PTQ of the season, I was thinking of quitting Magic. Not because I&rsquo;m tired of it or anything, but because I&rsquo;ve run out of people to play with.

Which means that unlike a real draft where I can focus 100% on the draft, in Magic Online I could possibly be doing several other things such as coding, blogging, random surfing, IM, etc. that may cause terrible misclicks such as a first-pick Faultgrinder (true story)
I should stop writing this post now and maybe try to salvage the draft.

Tournament was last Sunday, November 18. Format was Lorwyn Sealed.
I open a pretty good sealed pool this time. Notable cards include Mistbind Clique, Profane Command, Mulldrifter, Cloudgoat Ranger, Oblivion Ring, Shriekmaw and Silvergill Douser. Haven&rsquo;t written up the sealed pool yet, will probably do so later. I play major blue, minor black and white.
Round 1: 2-0 win vs BG Goblin/Elf
Round 2: 2-0 win vs UB Faeries
Round 3 vs merfolk, things start getting interesting.

Tournament was on Saturday, November 10. Format was Standard. I didn&rsquo;t have any good deck ideas this time around (some would argue I never do!), so I played a netdeck. I played the Mannequin deck that originally appeared in US States, as reported by BDM here. I had to change the board around a bit, I went with:
 4 Nameless Inversion (to help kill black/artifact critters) 3 Vesuvan Shapeshifter (get random tricks off pickles, and kill legends) 3 extirpate 3 bottle gnomes 2 damnation  I had very minimal testing, but I was fairly sure aggro decks were a cakewalk, and control decks are winnable headaches.

The format is Lorwyn Sealed. Note here that I they had a shortage of boosters and had to split tournament packs into 3 boosters to be able to accomodate all the players.
Decklist/Card pool later, I&rsquo;m too lazy to type it up. Unfortunately, I failed to learn from the previous mistakes as I got blinded by the shiny again, thinking I could actually cast Horde of Notions, so I went with an almost-five color build, major red-blue-and-green.

I still have no idea what to play for Lorwyn Standard, so I was eagerly awaiting this year&rsquo;s States/Champs results. There are already partial results up at MTG.com, and I had some time so I did some of my programming hocus-pocus and extracted some fun data. States / Champs 2007 Card Counts
The data is of course extracted from top eight decklists, so what we have here are literally the best decks this past weekend.

I wasn&rsquo;t too keen on playing, but that Dark Confidant kept whispering at me to give him one more chance. Rakdos again, except I removed Martyr of Ashes from the board and put in Avalanche Riders to help the terrible Angelfire matchup.

I kept Hit/Run in the main because I thought he had Solifuges, he did not.

Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t make it to the AM flights yesterdat, so I hung around Galleria for a few hours watching people play. A lot of people seemed to be playing blue or green stuff. There are people saying Needle Drop is good, what? Just because it cantrips?
My flight manages to start around 4 PM, and I open the sealed pool I&rsquo;m registering. The first two rares I see are Jace Beleren and Chandra Nalar!

Lorwyn prerelease in two days, and of course MTG Salvation is spoiler-complete. Some thoughts on cards:
Thoughtseize
&ndash;
B
Sorcery (Rare)
Target player reveals his or her hand. Choose a nonland card from it. That player discards that card. You lose 2 life.
My take:
Undercosted cards that demand a 2 life payment are usually pretty good. (See: Shocklands, Char, Psionic Blast, Vampiric Tutor). Thoughtseize is widely anticipated to be the chase rare of the set, with starcitygames.

I played at an FNM for the first time last Friday, in a cramped room at the back of the Neutral Grounds in Galleria. It was definitely&hellip; different than the usual weekend tournaments. I mean people playing Rhox different. Asking whether equip costs needed to be paid every turn different. Not that I&rsquo;m picking on noobs or anything; it was all fun and refreshing. Everything was a lot more casual than the highly competitive PTQs or GPTs.

Obviously, I&rsquo;ve started playing a lot of Magic since last year. I&rsquo;ve been a long-time player, having started around the time of Revised more than twelve years ago, but I&rsquo;ve never seriously started playing in tournaments in such until I had a job, which meant more money to spend on Magic (also meant less free time though =/)
As anyone who has immersed himself in this game knows, Magic is an addictive experience.

It&rsquo;s my first time playing at BCI Greenhills. During deck registration, I open a Damnation and a Graven Cairns. If I got up then, I&rsquo;d have gotten my money&rsquo;s worth. But I didn&rsquo;t come here to buy a Damnation, I came here to play.
My sealed deck:

This weekend was the first of three &ldquo;Pre-Lorwyn Triple Treats&rdquo; at Neutral Ground, featuring Saturdays with three tournaments: one each of Standard, Block Constructed and Legacy. I tried preparing a deck for block but I couldn&rsquo;t come up with anything consistent enough. Lazily, I just picked up the Standard Rakdos deck the day before the tourney, tweaked the sideboard for the inevitable TarmoRack decks (-4 Bottle Gnomes +4 Dodecapod). I lacked a 15th sideboard card, so I toss in a random Seize the Soul.

Yeah, I actually did play at the Standard Open at Trinoma Mall a couple of weekends ago, but my performance was so piss-poor I didn&rsquo;t bother writing a report. Long and short of it, I played Rakdos, but didn&rsquo;t have time to look for Rain of Gores for the board. They would have really helped against the two Angelfire losses I got in rounds 3 and 5, including the one where the opponent drew all four Lightning Helixes :/ The decks record against Angelfire decks is something 1-3 I believe.

Just to make it, y&rsquo;know, official: I suck at Standard.
I played in two Nationals qualifiers over the past two weekends. The first one with the Mishra deck (Flores&rsquo; Legends of Team CMU) to a disappointing 4-3 finish in a sea of Angelfire, Solar Flare and Gruul. Disappointed with the decks performance, I took a look at the result of Australian Nationals that same weekend, and decided to play the Rakdos &ldquo;Satanic Sligh&rdquo; build that had won that event in today&rsquo;s qualifier, which was incidentally the last one I could play given my schedule.

Today is of course the release of Magic&rsquo;s Xth edition, Magic Game Day.
As usual, I played at Neutral Grounds in Galleria. Helluva lot of people there, more than I was expecting for a Core Set Release tournament.
The format is, as usual, Sealed Deck with four rounds of Swiss pairings. Players were grouped in Flights of 32 people each (previous prerelease tournaments had 48-people flights), each win gets you an Xth booster pack and the top 2 of each flight (the ones who went 4-0) get something extra.

The saga of the mightiest deck in the universe continues. My previous outing showed me a solid control matchup and maybe 60% aggro matchup. I tweaked the sideboard to improve the aggro game post-board, dropping the useless Yixlid Jailers for 4 Last Gasps.
Here&rsquo;s how I did:
Round 1 2-0 win vs MGA
Round 2 0-2 loss vs RUW control (no angels)
Round 3 2-0 win vs RGW mid-range aggro (elephants/avalanche riders)

Before actually going to the elections last Monday, I played some Limited-format Magic last Sunday at Galleria.
The format was Time Spiral Block Sealed, and I was feeling good. I opened a card pool with no outstanding rares. The only real bomb was the red uncommon Pyrohemia. Spotting the Deep-Sea Kraken and wanting to play it, I decided to go red-blue. I tested the build for a few minutes before realizing it completely stunk and had very few creatures.

A bit lazy today, just a quick summary.
As usual for a prerelease, lots of people at NG yesterday. I got there before Galleria opened and whiled away time on the DS. The NG staff was a lot more efficient today, they were able to start the first 3 flights as early as 10:30. I got on flight C, and proceeded to open one of the most mediocre card pools I&rsquo;ve ever seen.

I scrubbed out of the last 3 TSP-TSP-PLC drafts, how annoying. :/
I tend to make bad plays at the worst possible time, and also don&rsquo;t mulligan very well.
If I&rsquo;m not good at it, I suppose I should stop. Maybe I&rsquo;ll get better once Future Sight comes out.

So yeah, it was a Two-Headed Giant Limited PTQ at NG Galleria yesterday. I played with my friend Paul, and we had a rather good sealed pool, coming up with a pair of decks that had the basic strategy of &ldquo;Do not block!&rdquo;
Unfortunately, we were only able to go 5-2, ending up as the team in 10th place. Well, it&rsquo;s not like we would&rsquo;ve been able to go to San Diego, but still the 750USD would have been nice.

Played yesterday at Galleria. With a whole bunch of people: three from the Zu crowd and I think five or six from the office. Insane number of people, as expected. I got there about ten minutes after the mall opened (I came from work), and I was already preregistered, but I only got to sign up for the sixth flight (Flight F). They had to buy extra tables from a nearby Office Warehouse.

I played the same deck again this past weekend, but I forgot to name it &ldquo;Nameless Deck Wins&rdquo; this time, so I posted a much worse record. =(
I went 2-3-drop, with the losses all going to aggro decks (2 Boros, 1 KarstenBot). The Boros matchup is winnable, but really tight, with no room for error.
Anyway, with Planar Chaos coming out, my colors (Red/Green/Black) look like they&rsquo;re getting a good boost, so hopefully I can further improve this deck.

One of the nice things about Magic: Online is the concept of &ldquo;Nix Tix&rdquo;. Basically, for a few days during holidays, 8-man drafts no longer require the usual 2 tickets to play. You simply need the product used for the draft (3 booster packs) in order to join an 8-man draft. And since the payout is also in booster packs, distributed as 4-3-2-2, you can basically keep playing 8-man drafts for free as long as you get at least two wins per draft.

I made it back to the country just two days before the last big Standard event of 2007, and I had no deck ready.
On Saturday morning, I quickly cobbled together a RGB off the obvious theme of hating Islands. Minor land destruction theme (4 Cryoclasm, 4 Mwonvuli Acid-Moss), Elephant and Solifuge beats and always going for the Demonfire finish. The black was in the main only for Hit // Run, my answer to Akroma and Bogardan Hellkite.

Same deck as last week.
Round 1: 2-0 vs WUb Sliver-Mill.
I asked him afterwards why he didn&rsquo;t show me any Traumatize, he said it was only in the board.
Round 2: 2-0 vs Solar Flare
Game one he only gets four lands, he manages to animate a Skeletal Vampire, but Glare taps the blockers and pushes the kill.
Game two he gets nothing but ten lands and a Remand.

<div class="content p-summary">
This tournament and three others for each Saturday of November are run-ups to the Time Spiral Gold Rush tournament in December. I&rsquo;ve been agonizing over the past couple of weeks as to what I can play in the diverse new standard enivornment. In the end, instead of doing my usual thing and building an original decklist, I decided to work from an existing archetype instead. I believe that in order for me to become a better Standard player, I have to get more match experience before designing decks, since my thinking is still on a casual level most of the time.

Yesterday at NG Galleria. My record for this event was 4-3, running B/G with red splash. I initially thought red was very weak in TS limited, but as I got to the end of the tourney I found myself splashing more and more red cards. Bogardan Rager in particular I underestimated.
At least I can somehow feel my skill level improving. There&rsquo;s this guy who&rsquo;s beaten me two tourneys in a row now, both with edge-of-the-seat wins decided in a single turn.

Played four 4-man drafts last night, opening 2 boxes.
Some interesting draft archetypes:
  White Weenie &ndash; easy. If you get a Celestial Crusader early this is a good choice.
  Black Weenine &ndash; a bit tougher, you have to get a bad moon early
  Slivers &ndash; W/U combinations focus on board lock down and pinging to win. R/G combinations focus on acceleration and beatdown.
  Thallids &ndash; tedious and slow.

I left work early yesterday with the intent of playing in the Time Spiral release tourney at Galleria. The product arrived late though, and Switch and I had to wander around Galleria for half a day before the tourney was able to begin.
As witnessed in the prerelease, Time Spiral seems to be immensely popular, which means high demand and low supply of boosters for the general public. And for good reason: Time Spiral is awesome, and provides an incredibly fun (and sometimes technical) limited environment.

Yeah!
Haven&rsquo;t won a prerelease shirt since Odyssey, but I successfully won four edge-of-my-pants matches to take home the coveted prerelease-shirt-that&rsquo;s-always-two-sizes-too-small-for-me-anyways! Man&hellip; one would think they would have shirts bigger than XXL. Lots of husky guys play Magic in the Philippines.
Anyway, yeah 4-0, running a blue-white aggro-control. I opened awesome cards &ndash; Ancestral Vision, Lotus Bloom, Ith, Teferi, Whispers, etc. I was a bit worried that going UW would be a bad idea since I didn&rsquo;t have access to either R or B for removal, but seems it was the right decision all along.

Wanting to catch the last RGD Sealed tourney of the season, I headed out to NG Galleria today for GPT Sydney. Unfortunately, their shipment of Rav tourney packs failed to arrive, so anyone who wanted to play had to play Coldsnap Sealed.
Bah, I got a terrible set, one of my rares was a Jokulmorder. Went RG/w, with the white being two Gelid Shackles that failed to show up whenever I faced down an Adarkar Valkyrie.
