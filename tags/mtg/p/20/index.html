Yeah!
Haven&rsquo;t won a prerelease shirt since Odyssey, but I successfully won four edge-of-my-pants matches to take home the coveted prerelease-shirt-that&rsquo;s-always-two-sizes-too-small-for-me-anyways! Man&hellip; one would think they would have shirts bigger than XXL. Lots of husky guys play Magic in the Philippines.
Anyway, yeah 4-0, running a blue-white aggro-control. I opened awesome cards &ndash; Ancestral Vision, Lotus Bloom, Ith, Teferi, Whispers, etc. I was a bit worried that going UW would be a bad idea since I didn&rsquo;t have access to either R or B for removal, but seems it was the right decision all along.

Wanting to catch the last RGD Sealed tourney of the season, I headed out to NG Galleria today for GPT Sydney. Unfortunately, their shipment of Rav tourney packs failed to arrive, so anyone who wanted to play had to play Coldsnap Sealed.
Bah, I got a terrible set, one of my rares was a Jokulmorder. Went RG/w, with the white being two Gelid Shackles that failed to show up whenever I faced down an Adarkar Valkyrie.

I came home at 3am yesterday after a long day at work Saturday. I was a bit sleepy, but because of work I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to play in the Coldsnap-standard Magic tournament on the 26th, so I decided to blow some cash by playing in a Coldsnap release event on MTGO instead.
I managed to win five consecutive rounds of Coldsnap sealed, piloting a mediocre decklist. Mediocre meaning I had neither Adarkar Valkyrie nor Ohran Viper.

I was busy this weekend with Magic: The Gathering. Four of us from the office played at a Nationals Qualifer today at Galleria. I played a custom-built aggro-control blue-white beauty called Azorius-12. Considering that I threw it together at practically the last minute, I think I did fairly well (but not enough to get the Nationals invite). Large turnout; rumor has it more than a hundred and thirty players participated, and NG quickly ran out of chairs and tables to use.

I played at Robinson&rsquo;s Galleria last Saturday. So much for my first constructed outing in 10 years&hellip; not a very good outcome for me.
I played 4-color Firemane Control&hellip; no permission, but lots of life gain and 4 Wrath of Gods packed maindeck, a specifically anti-aggro build. I was anticipating lots of Gruul beats and Orzhov aggro decks, and I was ready to beat them to the ground. Unfortunately, I faced not a single one of those decks.

<div class="content p-summary">
So, I played at PTQ Kobe at Robinson&rsquo;s Galleria last Saturday. First things first: First thing I do when I get passed a Ravnica Block sealed deck is to check the decklist to see if I got passed a shockland. Incredibly, I was passed not just one, but two! That in itself paid for the registration fee, but I still wanted to get a decent finish in the PTQ. Unfortunately, aside from the Temple Garden and the Blood Crypt, I didn&rsquo;t get that many &ldquo;wow&rdquo; cards.

Mike: I thought you were broke?
Me: That&rsquo;s just a lie I tell people who ask me for money.
 I forgot to talk about this. We played Champions of Kamigawa Team Sealed a couple of weekends back. For the uninitiated, ChK is a Magic:the Gathering set, and Team Sealed is our favorite limited format! I think it&rsquo;s mostly because if we lose, I can blame my teammates for screwing up, unlike in regular tournaments where it really is my fault.
