            &lt;p&gt;Maybe we should try removing it for everybody for a few months, see what happens&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m travelling to SF later this year as a tourist (I&amp;rsquo;m not an American, I&amp;rsquo;m from the Philippines), should I expect that the TSA will want me to unlock my devices?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also curious what the internet would be like for the rest of us without the Americans :p&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;When people download something using the bittorrent protocol, there needs to be one or more &amp;ldquo;seeds&amp;rdquo;. These are computers that are providing the material to be downloaded. When one is &amp;ldquo;seeding torrents&amp;rdquo; it means they&amp;rsquo;re making available the contents of that torrent for download by others. If there&amp;rsquo;s no one seeding, the contents can&amp;rsquo;t be downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Piracy doesn&amp;rsquo;t let you own the games either. Valve still owns Half-Life even if you pirate it.&lt;/p&gt;
