            &lt;p&gt;Be random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an episode of Futurama, Fry gained the ability to read minds and tried to use it to win a big Poker tournament. In the final table, he was up against Bender, and they were the last two players. For the final hand, Bender didn&amp;rsquo;t even bother looking at his cards and went all-in, giving Fry&amp;rsquo;s mind-reading no chance to work. Clip: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cc.com/video-clips/55yfmj/futurama-the-poker-tournament&#34;&gt;http://www.cc.com/video-clips/55yfmj/futurama-the-poker-tournament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In One Piece, the protagonist Luffy was having trouble fighting bad guy Enel who could read his opponent&amp;rsquo;s intentions. What Luffy did was to bounce his barrage of attacks against a wall, so that neither he nor Enel could predict which way they would go, so that Enel would be unable to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Around the time the Hugh Jackman Les Miserables movie came out I was hanging out in a bookstore and I overheard a teenage girl telling her friend “Oh the movie already has a book out, that was fast!”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s this video my brother shared to our family chat group, where my one and a half year old nephew is sitting on a chair and animatedly telling a story, complete with facial expressions and hand motions and pointing around and everything, except everything he says is gibberish because he doesn&amp;rsquo;t really know how to talk yet. I&amp;rsquo;ve watched it for the fourth time just now and it still makes me giggle.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Back when Future Sight had just come out, I went into a store to check their singles and they had like 8 copies of this weird green rare they were selling for less than $1 a pop. I looked at it for a bit, and I thought it might be fun to try to build a deck around. But for whatever reason I wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the mood to buy cards that day so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d come back to it the next time I was in the store. The very next weekend, there was a GP, and the price of Tarmogoyf immediately spiked to around 20-30 dollars and never went back down. Today they&amp;rsquo;re at $100+ a pop, I still only have the one copy I got from a booster pack.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Worth means something different to every person, so it depends on what definition you use and what priorities you think society should have. There are a number of priorities to choose from: survival, advancement of knowledge, expansion of territory, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you judge based on a priority of survival, then I guess you would give greater worth to food producers (farmers, etc). If you judge based on advancement, perhaps scientists would be ranked highly. I would also imagine that all other things being equal, younger people would be worth more than older people as they have more potential&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what priority you choose, a precise measurement of a person&amp;rsquo;s worth or ranking will be very difficult, if not impossible, given all the nuances of human life and the inherent potential that any human life possesses&lt;/p&gt;

            Reply to &amp;#39;Reddit, what&amp;#39;s something special about your country&amp;#39;s McDonald&amp;#39;s?&amp;#39; on /r/AskReddit at https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4sg8n2/reddit_whats_something_special_about_your/:

            &lt;p&gt;We serve a McSpaghetti. The first time I tried a McDonald&amp;rsquo;s overseas I tried to order a McSpaghetti and the Chinese lady behind the counter looked at me like I was a madman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also they are consistently #2 behind a local Bee-themed franchise&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the city areas, I think belief in ghosts and the like is comparable to Western countries. It may be more pronounced in the countryside. A lot of people reference local myths of course, but it&amp;rsquo;s not like adults really believe them or anything. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of old wives tales too but nobody really takes them seriously afaik&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of chinese families here who practice feng shui and the like too&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The answer will be different for each person. Starting a business is more stressful and has a lot of risks but is potentially more rewarding. Taking a regular job is &amp;ldquo;safer&amp;rdquo; in the traditional sense, the risk here is mostly of possible future regret - in the future you may wish you had tried out riskier things when you were young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are people who will argue that having a job is still a risk since you are dependent on the competence and good will of other people to earn a living, that your safe job may not actually be as safe as you imagine since you could get fired or the company could go under at any time. But truthfully, you run the same risks when running a business, except that you do more of the work yourself, so whether you are able to overcome those risks or not is more dependent on your own effort.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not wrong to be angry; those people are assholes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is quite useless. Try not to let other people get to you. If these are people you know, let them know it&amp;rsquo;s not okay. If these are people you can avoid, do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is too short to be upset at assholes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, IE isn&amp;rsquo;t really that bad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re able to make this statement with a straight face, you&amp;rsquo;ve never had to write cross-browser compliant websites.&lt;/p&gt;
