But the tradeoff is that no new humans will be born, ever. You are asked to decide for all of humanity whether to take this chance. What do you do?</a></h4>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a big Street Fighter fan since forever, but I&rsquo;m not too good at the game because of super-tight timings with one-frame links and stuff like that and not having enough time to practice my execution religiously. I&rsquo;m planning to get Smash on 3ds, but I&rsquo;ve never played the series before. Do you have any idea if it&rsquo;s generally as unforgiving as Street Fighter execution-wise?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;ve been in situations where I knew a friend was about to do something stupid that could ruin her life, but there was nothing I could do to stop it or dissuade her, all I could do was stand by and bear witness to the inevitable (metaphorical) train wreck that she would have to climb out of. It&rsquo;s terrible because you give advice and you feel like you&rsquo;re not listened to when you&rsquo;re only looking out for them and you&rsquo;re being completely sensible.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just have to let people make their own mistakes.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>There are small moments that each person lives for - the smile on a little kid&rsquo;s face, the joy of seeing your crush when you come in to the office in the morning, the satisfaction of a job well done, the thrill of beating unfair odds, the warm feeling of being able to help someone, etc. It varies person by person but these small moments of joy and happiness, no matter how rarely they come to us make all the stress, worries, problems, fears and insecurities of the in-between moments worth slogging through.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;m told that when I was a little kid I had the ability to quickly determine what day of the week any given date was, and the grownups couldn&rsquo;t figure out how I did it. I don&rsquo;t remember this at all - I probably just did some quick maths in my head or something. Now that I think about it, I guess it&rsquo;s not <em>too</em> useless.</p>

<p>Or, how difficult would it be for we as redditors to start one (obviously we&rsquo;re not going to post about it here!)</p>
<p>It seems the secretiveness of the affair would make it difficult to scale worldwide.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>That means it sort of feeds itself doesn&rsquo;t it? Once you get into the top subscribed, it&rsquo;s hard to fall out since new users are subbed by default. Unless there&rsquo;s a massive unsubing campaign by existing subs.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Write your order on a small piece of paper and give it to her instead of saying it out loud. Below your order write something like &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go out with you sometime if that&rsquo;s ok. If you&rsquo;re cool with it, write your phone number on my cup. If not, it&rsquo;s ok, we&rsquo;ll pretend it never happened.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Seriously though, how is this a question? What&rsquo;s the ratio of human population vs bear population anyway? I think it&rsquo;d have to be less than a hundred humans per bear to even be remotely close, because for sure a hundred humans could take a single bear.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s expensive to implement a payment system processing credit card payments. There&rsquo;s security certifications you need to go through before the CC companies will agree to process payments coming from your website, the cost is in the tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Don&rsquo;t feign confidence, <strong>be</strong> confident.</p>
<p>Take as many opportunities as you can to try to strike up conversations - don&rsquo;t restrict yourself to parties, and don&rsquo;t restrict yourself just to girls you want to hit on</p>
<p>Just keep trying, be yourself, you&rsquo;ll get used to it eventually.</p>
