<p>When we were young we were only allowed to play on the NES for one hour at a time. It seemed like a reasonable restriction on kids&rsquo; play time I guess, but it meant I got into a lot of trouble when I tried to finish Super Mario 3 without warping in one sitting</p>

<p>Maybe she prepares everything ahead of time and just has shell scripts to run. That way she impresses all the noobs who have no idea how she does all this so fast. Do I get a no-prize?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s about as bad as Garcia from Criminal Minds, who can basically search for any information in no time flat unless the plot gods say it&rsquo;s too difficult.</p>
<p>Most of the time it doesn&rsquo;t bother me though. It&rsquo;s just TV.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>What is your purpose in presenting the website idea? Are you hiring the programmer to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Design the website? (Not just graphic design, but to flesh out the details of how your requirements can be met, like what screens will be needed, what sort of data will be stored)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement a design you already have? (In which case the design better be thorough! You wouldn&rsquo;t come up to a carpenter and just say &ldquo;Build me a shelf!&rdquo; without any details)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>You&rsquo;re going to need a whole lot more details before anyone can give you a reasonable estimate, especially from a programmer who&rsquo;s not familiar with how fantasy leagues work. Where is the data going to come from? How many players will participate? What kind of actions can they do? Will size will you need to be able to scale to? etc</p>

<p>Nope. Keep moving forward!</p>
<p>Edit: I forgot to say I didn&rsquo;t even read most of your paragraph. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter, keep moving forward, don&rsquo;t look back! You&rsquo;ll experience more of life that way.</p>

<p>Currently my savings are mostly in fixed-interest time deposits (low interest rates around here though) and in personal loans to well-trusted people who repay me on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I would like to branch out my investments to stuff like mutual funds or whatever, but I am a bit ignorant on these matters. I&rsquo;m just looking for more growth opportunities since some people have told me that I should be growing my money more. Because I&rsquo;m ignorant, I&rsquo;m a bit risk-averse, especially with stuff like the stock markets that seem so swingy to me. Any advice on where to start or what stuff I should read first?</p>
<p>Note: I am not an American!</p>

<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t be petty to complain. You&rsquo;ve worked with these people for 3 years, and typically in a startup you&rsquo;re a small tight-knit group; why aren&rsquo;t you comfortable enough with them to confide your concerns?</p>

<p>If you feel like you have too much money, the reasonable options are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Save it for a rainy day (or invest to make it grow)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help out someone else in need, especially those who might not have everything during the holday season.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That being said, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind being gifted a copy of Fallout: New Vegas on Steam :D</p>

<h4 id="posted-on-raskreddit-why-arent-lawyers-required-when-interrogating-suspectshttpsredditcomraskredditcommentsdf5tqwhy_arent_lawyers_required_when_interrogating">Posted on r/AskReddit: <a href="https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/df5tq/why_arent_lawyers_required_when_interrogating/">Why aren&rsquo;t lawyers required when interrogating suspects?</a></h4>
<p>I live in a country where criminal defendants often retract confessions saying they were tortured or coerced into making those confessions. So I was thinking: why not require that the suspect have a lawyer present during any police interrogation, otherwise any statements made during such interrogation would not be admissible in court?</p>
<p>I remember there was an online video being passed around where even if you were innocent you should not talk to the police; if this view is recognized and the general consensus is that you should never talk to the police without a lawyer anyway, why not formalize it so that ignorant people are automatically protected and police are not tempted to coerce confessions out of suspects?</p>
