According to Wikipedia, Speaking truth to power is a non-violent political tactic, employed by dissidents against the received wisdom or propaganda of governments they regard as oppressive, authoritarian or an ideocracy. I always had the general sense of it before, but not that it was specifically for use against oppressive or authoritarian governments. It is believed the phrase has origins in a Quaker pamphlet published in 1955.
I was reminded of this phrase today and looked it up because it seems relevant again recently, at least in the Philippines.

Like many non-Americans, I&rsquo;m acutely aware of the shenanigans of Donald Trump, the current US president. It would be a fascinating story, if only it weren&rsquo;t so bad for the world.

Systemic change is difficult. I&rsquo;m talking about software projects/systems, but there are a lot of parallels with societal systems too, like governments or states.
I&rsquo;ve been in large projects with hundreds of thousands of LOC where a lot of the code was painful to read and full of code smells and so on. It happens over time as projects get maintained by different developers and teams or different enhancements or changes are made.

Comic books and superheroes have always tended to skew towards liberal philosophies, given how writers and artists tend to support ideals like individualism and free expression.

<div class="content p-summary">
In fourth year HS, we had an Economics subject, and back then I was fascinated with the idea of free market capitalism &ndash; the free market, the invisible hand, the law of supply and demand, and the idea that through competition we are forced to adapt and become better and more efficient in order to survive. Capitalism mirrored the law of nature: the strong will survive.
These days, I am much less enamored with the idea of capitalism.

A few days ago I read this great Reddit comment about how increasing hyperpartisanship makes it easier to influence the entire population. Quoting the relevant part:
 Once you've done that, you have a population that's easier to manipulate. You have, say, 30% that's 100% sure on both ends, and probably another 15% on both ends that are 80% sure, and a remaining 10% that could go both ways. The more you do this, the more the 15% will be set in stone.

I recently watched this TedX talk by Seth Godin about the purpose of school/education:   One of the best points I agree with from the talk is that majority of our educational system is geared towards generating graduates who are obedient. We teach students from a young age to follow rules and answer roll calls. We teach them standard prescribed solutions. We teach them how to take exams and how to find the right answers.

We put people into boxes because it is convenient.

 Poverty Ignorance Misinformation (sorry, &ldquo;Alternative facts&rdquo;) Abusive government officials Traffic Rights abuses Pollution High power rates Political dynasties Poor quality of local cinema offerings Politicians putting their names everywhere Internet trolls and bullies Lack of critical thinking Redundancy Overtime without overtime pay Government officials blatantly lying or pulling statistics out of thin air Slow and expensive internet The MRT breaking down Cruelty to animals Poor quality of local anti-piracy ads Jejespeak SMS spam Typhoons Taxis that don&rsquo;t give exact change War Irony Spoilers Pineapples on pizza Poor grammar and/or spelling Hashtags Hypocrisy Multi-level marketing Working at &ldquo;Edi sa puso mo&rdquo; Redundancy Low effort blog posts that start out serious but end up trying a bit too hard to be funny People who don&rsquo;t understand sarcasm People who stand in malls and shove fliers in your face Commenting on posts without reading the actual article Lists that end abruptly at weird numbers so you&rsquo;re not sure if there&rsquo;s more or what

At my old job I used to have this group of coworkers I had Friday lunch outs with. Inevitably, every Friday around noon someone would message the others asking &ldquo;where are we eating?&rdquo;. Now, there are a lot of good places to eat around the area and we&rsquo;ve all been working there a while so most of the time we don&rsquo;t care where we eat and we&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;ll decide when we get to the elevators.

&ldquo;If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.&rdquo;
  ― Sun Tzu, The Art of War
 I was reading a forum thread recently about learning competitive Street Fighter.

&ldquo;Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.&rdquo;
  ― Winston S. Churchill
 In the current world political climate, it seems that in many instances democracy and the related values (equality, human rights, and so on) are increasingly taking a back seat to populism and increasingly authoritarian leaderships.

<div class="content p-summary">
I traditionally try to save some time on the week between Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s Day to do some cleaning up and decluttering of my stuff. One would assume that having more time meant I would be better able to organize my stuff and all that, but one would be wrong. My room still has stacks of books, toys, Magic cards and other stuff in random places.
Or maybe I just have too much OCD that I want everything to be neat and organized, but I&rsquo;m not industrious enough to make it happen.

If a friend found out your work was horrible, would you want to know? Or would your feelings be hurt?
If your coworkers think you&rsquo;re doing something wrong, would you prefer that they keep quiet or that they call you out?
As a leader, do you prefer to have sycophants who sing your praises or people who are willing to tell you that you have no clothes?
Is your ego more important than doing a good job or self-improvement?

The series was a bit formulaic, and towards the end really preachy toward&rsquo;s the authors personal philosophies, but Terry Goodkind&rsquo;s Sword of Truth series always comes back to me because it codified one of life&rsquo;s most important truths:
 Wizard&rsquo;s First Rule: &ldquo;People are stupid. They will believe a lie because they want to believe it&rsquo;s true, or because they are afraid it might be true.&rdquo;
 That doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re stupid or I&rsquo;m stupid, just that collectively, we&rsquo;re kind of dumb.

Recent events both in my country and abroad, both of wide importance and personal importance, have made the past week or so difficult. Bad news and bad events have no master or timing, they do not consider giving us a break, they come and go as they please no matter how bad the situation already is.
I fully understand why many people choose to withdraw from daily news or shut it out altogether or even just avoid social media completely.

There&rsquo;s a very rare, privileged group of people for whom everything in life goes well and they experience great success all the time.
You and I are not part of that group (most likely). Like the vast majority of other people, sometimes our lives are good and sometimes our lives are bad.
Sometimes life can feel cruel or unfair or exhausting. In those times it&rsquo;s easy to forget the times when life was good and to wallow in your misery.

Sometimes I write something and at the end I find that it upsets me. Or I think about something I haven&rsquo;t thought about in a long time just before I sleep, then I have a nightmare about it and it saddens me to think that my subconscious still hasn&rsquo;t let go of it after all this time
That&rsquo;s a good thing though, right? One of the purpose of writing and introspection is to become more attuned to your inner thoughts and emotions, to better understand and work with your own self.

I&rsquo;m kind of a serial project starter. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a very common thing. I&rsquo;ll often have random ideas for projects I could do, big or small. I&rsquo;d have a dozen of them percolating in my head at any one time. And somewhere between four to five dozen scattered down in various documents, notepads and what not, waiting to be explored. (I literally have two such small post-it notes with 5 such items in front of me right now)

Recently as the whole world watched one of our political leaders display his expected lack of diplomatic finesse on the global stage, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think about how in my younger days there&rsquo;s a good chance I might have approved of his frank, straight-talking, shoot-from-the-hip brand of diplomacy. I have a bit of a reputation myself for preferring to speak frankly and directly instead of dancing around the issues, although these days I understand the wisdom of adapting to the situation as needed

I remember having a discussion with a friend a few years back where I made the following list to emphasize a point:
 8-9 hours at work (possibly more) 7-8 hours of sleep 3-4 hours commuting in Metro Manila 2 hours for meals  That leaves you between 1-4 hours for all forms of recreation including exercise, sports, TV, derping around on the internet, hanging out with friends, and so on.

When you&rsquo;re young and in school memorizing math formulas or history dates or whatnot, all of it seems so silly and you wonder if you&rsquo;re really going to be using all of this knowledge in real life. However, the intent of a general education program isn&rsquo;t specifically to give you knowledge that will be useful to you in the future (although it may turn out to be so)
The stuff school teaches you &ndash; literature, mathematics, art, history, science, and so on &ndash; are intended to give you a broad enough base from which you can freely choose the direction you want to go in life.

So, Stranger Things
It&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;s great. I thought it might be overhyped, but it&rsquo;s not. And I can see why people find it hard to explain without spoiling things.
It&rsquo;s about strange things happening in a small town. Creepy things. It&rsquo;s a mystery. It&rsquo;s suspense. It&rsquo;s not a jump-scare sort of thing if you&rsquo;re not into that. Well, there&rsquo;s maybe a little bit of jump scares. The best description I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s about as scary as an X-Files or Doctor Who episode.

Motivation is a fickle mistress. It comes and it goes. It&rsquo;s easily distracted. It can vanish in a blink of an eye. When it&rsquo;s there, it&rsquo;s great, but when it&rsquo;s not you don&rsquo;t get anything done and you don&rsquo;t feel terrible. Motivation is based on the principle that you need a certain emotion or state of mind to get things done. Motivation is burst damage, you can get a lot done but you don&rsquo;t know when it&rsquo;s gonna come out.

When blogging and social media started to explode in popularity, it held a great promise: it would give a voice to the masses.

I found this draft blog post that I had written back in 2010. I&rsquo;m not sure why I never published it, though it does end on a dire note and seems a bit incomplete. Perhaps I had some further thoughts percolating in my brain back then that never came forward. I am also not sure if I wrote this before reading about The Great Filter. I figured I&rsquo;d just publish it now without further comment:

During my adult life, I&rsquo;ve tried to learn or at least expose myself to one new skill or programming language every year. For example, over the past year or so I&rsquo;ve been studying, dabbling, or trying out the following: game development using Unity, technical analysis of stocks, Spanish, driving a car, and even some simple cooking! I&rsquo;ve also been regularly practicing to improve my skills in writing and sketching. I probably even forgot a few things I&rsquo;ve tried to learn.

Grammar note: &ldquo;Biased&rdquo; is an adjective. &ldquo;Bias&rdquo; is a noun. It is not appropriate to say that a person or an entity &ldquo;is bias&rdquo;. Unless you are talking to like a prejudice elemental or something (takes note of that for hypothetical hipster RPG)
In a (long-winded) discussion during the recent election period, someone told me that I &ldquo;obviously had a bias&rdquo; and my answer was &ldquo;Of course I do! Everyone does!

&ldquo;Do you know what&rsquo;s there, waiting beyond that beach? Immortality! Take it! It&rsquo;s yours!&rdquo; &ndash; Achilles, Troy
 Each person has a different view of what their life&rsquo;s purpose is, but I&rsquo;ve found more often than not it relates to some form of immortality. Usually that means leaving something behind, some trace of yourself so that the world remembers you, something that says &ldquo;I was here, I existed.&rdquo; For many people that means offspring, for others it may mean some other legacy: children taught, people helped, ideas expounded, inventions created, companies founded, and so on

Relevant XKCD:

Sometimes I have this inexplicable urge to argue with people. With recent events I&rsquo;ve found myself getting into more discussions, debates and otherwise friendly arguments online. The quality of these interactions hasn&rsquo;t always been the best, and many times I feel like I should have stopped engaging sooner or maybe not participated at all. I&rsquo;ve considered some points to help me decide in the future whether to bother engaging other people online.

We shouldn&rsquo;t have to keep telling people that Ferdinand Marcos was a terrible president and that the Martial Law he imposed was terrible for the country. Imagine if a significant percentage of German citizens kept insisting that Hitler was a great man and the more sensible Germans had to keep trying to educate them on why that wasn&rsquo;t true and why World War II was a terrible idea and that they wanted to elect Hitler&rsquo;s descendant to a position of national prominence.

Few people are really Superman fans, because let&rsquo;s face it, Superman is boring compared to say, Batman. I wouldn&rsquo;t claim to be a fan either, though I follow the history because of being generally a comic book guy (I got less than 50% of the answers in a recent Superman round in one of the local quiz nights =/) That being said, I did re-watch the first 2 Donner Superman movies and re-read All-Star Superman and Superman: For Tomorrow ahead of watching the movie.

The content of this post is regarding my own opinion and who I plan to vote for. If you want to do your own research (I highly recommend it), here are some links to get you started:
 Movement for Good Governance briefers on Senatorial candidates Rappler Senatorial profiles I would also Google &ldquo;rappler [candidate name] interview&rdquo; for the interview article for each candidate (too many to list here)  Here&rsquo;s a link to a Google doc of my own notes on each candidate, which I used as basis for recommendations below.

People who follow me on Facebook or Twitter know that I&rsquo;ve been recently made a number of anti-Nancy Binay posts. For a while now I&rsquo;ve been wanting to write a blog post about that and several other election-related thoughts. I&rsquo;ve decided to present these thoughts it as a fictional chat between made-up characters. Totally fictional characters. Any resemblance to actual people living or dead = pure coincidence. (Although if you must try to imagine these characters, you can imagine jaeger as a dashing idealist, in-in as a cynical pragmatist, ORYLY as a carefree vagabond and Scrappy coco as someone who just wandered into the wrong room.

Time for some Monday morning quarterbacking!
Disclaimer: I Am Not A Lawyer. I&rsquo;m just a guy with opinions. And you know what they say about opinions&hellip;
Today, the Philippine Senate has impeached the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court by a vote of 20 to 3.
I&rsquo;ve generally kept silent about the CJ trial, mainly because I know people who are rabidly pro-Corona and I don&rsquo;t feel like getting into an argument with someone who&rsquo;s obviously biased (I&rsquo;m sorry my friends, we are going to have to agree to disagree now).

I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write about why I quit a perfectly good job I had at Azeus, but it&rsquo;s been hard to articulate the reasons, in the same way I found it hard to explain to people why I didn&rsquo;t feel a corporate &ldquo;9 to 5&rdquo; was entirely necessary at this point. Then I read a blog post today &ldquo;Why I Quit A Six Figure Job&rdquo; which I found to express/coincide with my thoughts pretty well on the upsides and downsides of having a job.

Here&rsquo;s the scenario: Last Sunday in the early morning, there was a fire in our office building, which hit some power stuff in the basement. So yesterday (Monday), the whole building was running on generators without air conditioning. Last night, we were notified that the power was back in the building, but just in case, we should come in to work in casual clothes (&ldquo;dress down&rdquo;), normally reserved for casual Fridays/Saturdays.

I predict that eventually, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t&rdquo;, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t&rdquo;, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t&rdquo; and the like will eventually become their own words, dropping that weird apostrophe they have.
A few decades after this happens, some people will wonder what &ldquo;wan&rsquo;t&rdquo; used to stand for.

I remembered that I haven&rsquo;t written an About page yet. This post will go there.
The Blogger profile describes me as a &ldquo;Programmer, engineer, scientist, critic, gamer, dreamer, and kid-at-heart.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s break that down, shall we?
