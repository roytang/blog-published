<div class="content e-content">

<p>If the Xbox One (a) lets me play all my PS3 discs and PSN downloads AND (b) had an online service that gave out lots of value in free games, that&rsquo;d turn me for sure. I&rsquo;m not terrible interested in Xbox franchises like Halo or Gears of War. (I originally typed GoW, but realized that means God of War)</p>
<p>PS4 has (b) but not (a), but I&rsquo;m not rushing out to get that on release date either, and I figure given enough time and Gaikai, Sony would be able to figure something out for (a)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a second run of Skyrim, this time I&rsquo;m playing with a whole lot of mods (I&rsquo;m up to a 100+ now). I finally made the jump and made a nexus account so that I could get mods from the nexus using the NMM.</p>

<p>I sunk some 2-300 hours into Crusaders of the Dark Savant back in the day, but never managed to finish it, although I think I got rather close. I remember that it was always troublesome to find those maps off the randomly wandering NPCs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have time to play it again though :p</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a different experience, especially in terms of warfare since you can stack multiple units on a tile. In Civ4 you basically create one superstack then throw it at everything.</p>

<p>Nah, I feel that way too. This year&rsquo;s sale isn&rsquo;t too exciting really. Or maybe it&rsquo;s just that there aren&rsquo;t many games I&rsquo;d want to buy anymore.</p>
<p>I miss those great achievement hunts they used to have.</p>

<p>This review actually made me hold off on buying it, as it makes out that only the story is the strong point while the gameplay is not as good. I mean, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d enjoy the story as it seems epic based on the demo, but I wouldn&rsquo;t plunk down full price for a game just for that.</p>

<p>I wonder why they don&rsquo;t include the Square characters anymore (like Squall, Cloud, etc who appeared in the original KH) Probably some licensing issue I guess</p>

<p>As much as I support this post, I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s not really going to do much to change the minds of those who feel really entitled to it. They are too blinded by nerdrage to understand what this chart means, I say just let them rant it all out and ignore the multiple threads about it, until ME3&rsquo;s release date when the rage subsides as they enjoy the game.</p>
