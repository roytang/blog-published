<p>Link: <a href="http://www.telltalegames.com/playlikeapirate">http://www.telltalegames.com/playlikeapirate</a></p>
<p>Are these as good as the first two Monkey Island games? I enjoyed them as a kid but haven&rsquo;t played the newer ones.</p>
<p>Also, is Telltale Games ok? Do they work like Steam?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>It is not like Age of Empires, the gameplay is turn-based instead of real-time, and much more massive scale.</p>
<p>Reading through the manual might help you decide whether to buy or not. Or maybe look for videos of Civ 4 gameplay (I remember seeing some introductory videos to Civ 4 on youtube) to get an idea of what a Civ game is like.</p>

<p>They probably didn&rsquo;t bother making a child corpse model just for this. You can&rsquo;t kill kids in the game right? (I forget if this was fallout 3 or an earlier fallout)</p>

For the record, I purchased an original R1 copy of Street Fighter IV for the PS3 last Tuesday, and we&rsquo;ve been pretty much playing it whenever we had free time at home. The one time I came in late to work during the month of February was because of Street Fighter IV.
Street Fighter IV came in with ridiculously high reviews for both the XBox 360 and PS3 versions, the PS3 version garnering a 94 (universal acclaim) on Metacritic It can&rsquo;t be denied that it&rsquo;s an awesome game, although not everyone agrees.

Street Fighter IV is out next week, hopefully we&rsquo;ll be slinging fireballs by next weekend!

Amazingly, despite my work schedule I still managed to finish a rather old-school RPG. I finished Star ocean: Second Evolution for the PSP today, clocking in 30 hours of playtime. I have to say I quite enjoy playing RPGs on handhelds. RPGs are usually rather long games so it&rsquo;s nice being able to handle them in bite-sized chunks while commuting, et cetera.
Star Ocean: The Second Story was probably one of the best Japanese RPGs to come out of the Playstation era, despite the lackluster translations of that time (hey, it was pre-year 2000, all translations were pretty bad then!

Finally finished Valkyria Chronicles last Saturday, clocking in at around 25 hours. Quick Review:
 Beautiful, beautiful game, even on my SD TV; it&rsquo;s like watching a flowing watercolor painting When you start the game, all the dialogue/cutscenes seems a bit draggy but eventually you get used to the pacing and then you don&rsquo;t mind because the battles are really engaging. Speaking of battles; I&rsquo;m not sure if it would be good for beginners to tactical games.

I purchased a PS3 last week! As is typically with me making large purchases, a was wishy-washy about it for a whole two weeks (although Alvin had been egging me to buy one for months).
To show how indecisive we are, here&rsquo;s the conversation we had at the store:
 Saleslady: Sir, anong kulay ang gusto nyo? Black, silver or white?

Alvin: Kahit ano, silver na lang siguro.

I&rsquo;ve been submerged in work for the past two weeks or so, not having much time to do anything else aside from work and the DS, which lets me sneak in some Professor Layton, FFTA2 or Civilization Revolutions while waiting for bug fixes to be confirmed.

I was neglecting the NDS a bit, so I decided to look for some fun homebrew stuff to do with it. Here are some I tried (You&rsquo;ll need some sort of flashcart to use these. Mine is an R4.):
 Pocket Physics &ndash; a neat little toy app that allows you to draw diagrams on the touch screen that would then become affected by physics. It&rsquo;s a bit like a free-form The Incredible Machine that&rsquo;s portable.

<p><strong>Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates</strong> is an action-RPG by Square Enix. The original Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles came out on the NGC. <strong>Ring of Fates</strong> is a different game for the NDS, though I guess it&rsquo;s sort of a spiritual successor. I finally managed to get some NDS time and finish this game last night.</p>

<p>On my way home today I passed by Megamall as usual, and there was a Scrabble tournament going on. I stopped for a few minutes and watched. I realize a lot of people would probably find watching Scrabble games boring, seeing only two geeky people spelling out words at random, not even making any sense. But watching the Scrabble games brought me back to a time when I didn&rsquo;t have the internet to keep me up at nights.</p>
<p>Scrabble is a game close to my heart, me and my brother Kerwin practically grew up with the game.</p>

<p>Eagerly awaited, the fourth installment of the Ace Attorney series has arrived, with a brand-new leading defense attorney. Of course, not one week after I got my copy, I&rsquo;m done. It kept me up at nights and made me come in to work late; well worth it.</p>
<p>To those who are not familiar with the Ace Attorney games, it&rsquo;s hard to explain the appeal of the game; with all the thinking and reading to be done, it&rsquo;s definitely not exciting to watch. Anyone who&rsquo;s finished one of them knows what it is though. There&rsquo;s that feeling you get when you all the testimony and evidence finally come together, and you figure out how it was done but <strong>you still have to figure out how to prove it!</strong></p>
<p>Detailed review (and spoilers) follow.</p>

Despite the fact the allure of Final Fantasy Tactics PSP, I was still decided on finishing Advance Wars: Days of Ruin. This was only the second game in the series that I was playing, although I had greatly enjoyed Advance Wars: Dual Strike, so my hopes were high for Days of Ruin.
Pros:
&ndash; Still Advance Wars, battles are fairly good and challenging enough
&ndash; New units: Bike &ndash; infantry on wheels, can capture as well; Flare &ndash; helps in Fog of War situations; Carrier &ndash; revamped from the AWDS Carrier, this one can now create its&rsquo; own Seaplanes; Antitank &ndash; a ranged unit that can counterattack, strong against Tanks, surprisingly; Duster &ndash; a hybrid air unit that has a weaker ground attack than a Bomber, and weaker air attack than a fighter

Bought one last week, had not had time to log it until now. It was not so much planned and maybe a bit more of an impulse buy. Something like a cellphone conversation with my brother who&rsquo;s standing in a store in Singapore pressuring me with &ldquo;Well? Should I buy one or not?&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t like pressure, so obviously I just said, &ldquo;Ok, whatever!&rdquo;
The inevitable question arises: which one is better, PSP or NDS?

Despite it&rsquo;s age, I&rsquo;ve only recently gotten around to loving Advance Wars: Dual Strike on the DS. It&rsquo;s just the sort of game I enjoy: challenging enough not to bore me but not so difficult that I give up in frustration and has enough extras to keep me coming back. A bit of a learning curve though, and probably not for casual gamers. I beat the normal campaign last week (just barely &ndash; winning on Day 28 of a 28-day target), and I&rsquo;m hoping I can finish the hard campaign before the release of Advance Wars: Days of Ruin next week.

2 days ago: My brother Alvin and Brian report suspicious activities on the computer in their room. Random Chinese popups appearing, mysterious processes in the taskbar. As needed, virus scans and adware scans are done. Trojans are identified and quarantined, but keep reappearing. Brian plays WoW on the machine despite the issues.
Yesterday: Alvin decides to reformat the machine and begins backing up. Brian plays WoW on the machine in my room instead.

The game was not as long as I had hoped, although I finished without completing stuff. (Only had 11 hearts when facing the final boss). I told a friend that the current Zeldas are too easy compared to the Zeldas of old. There are a lot more hints this time around on how to get past stuff, etc. He told me that the 3d Zeldas are even easier. One of the sacrifices they had to make to become popular I suppose.

Can holding a stylus cause carpal tunnel syndrome? Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass for a few days now; the controls are purely-stylus driven so my wrist aches a bit after a few hours of play. Of course the game has been consuming a good number of my waking hours (I didn&rsquo;t even play any Magic this weekend), but that&rsquo;s not what this post is about. This post is about the original Legend of Zelda.

The official title is quite long. Actually, the English Title for Gyakuten Saiban 3 is even worse!
Ace Attorney is an awesome series, I finally got around to playing the second game since the third one is scheduled for an English NDS release in September. I started playing the day I arrived in HK &ndash; so I beat the game in six days.
Justice for All is a more difficult game than the original, putting the title character in more difficult situations, and making it a lot more tedious to ‘cheat&rsquo; with the save file.

I obviously don&rsquo;t have much time for gaming if it takes me more than a month to finish a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; choose-your-own-adventure style game like Phoenix Wright. Very entertaining game, it puts you in the shoes of a novice defense attorney, Phoenix Wright and your adventures in trying to uncover the truth behind several murder cases. The gameplay is composed of two parts: investigative sequences where you go around various locations gathering information and evidence, and the actual trial part where you have to spot contradictions in witness testimonies and prove your clients to be innocent.

Wow. It took me three months to finish FF12!
Fun game, weak story.
No strong lead character to carry the game.
Gameplay is very MMORPG-like. The grinding was ok, but they could&rsquo;ve done some quests like WoW to make it better.
I&rsquo;ll fight the optional bosses someday.
Will I play the next FF game? Don&rsquo;t know. Time is the most difficult factor, as it demands a lot. Took me about 65 hours to finish this one, playing 3-4 hours a day after I came back from Hong Kong.

Via insertcredit.com :
Apparently, DQ IX coming out on the DS is a big deal over in the land of the rising sun. And the fact that the combat system will be action-style instead of turn-based. Did they really expect the game to keep doing the same thing again and again forever? Anyway, the DS is a better platform for it&hellip; Square-Enix already has one flagship RPG series on the consoles (Final Fantasy), and none yet on handhelds, so why not just move their second-oldest title there?

Something I didn&rsquo;t expect from the Youtube phenomenon: apparently, FAQ writers can now link to instructional videos for difficult to describe game walkthroughs. If you don&rsquo;t have any idea what I mean, an &ldquo;FAQ&rdquo; is a document that helps someone to do a particular thing by providing answers to Frequently Asked Questions. In my case, I most often read FAQs for video games to help through the difficult spots, usually from GameFAQs.

<div class="content p-summary">
Awesome article in The Escapist titled The Rise and Fall of Troika, which gives a good view of the problems facing game development studios with regards to production/publisher issues.
I got the link from the blog at rampantgames.com which I&rsquo;ve been following for a while now. I find the articles about the indie gaming field very enlightening, and I have to say going the route of an indie game developer is much more appealling to me especially after reading about all the issues game dev studios have with big-time publishers.

on the PSP. How sad that my all-time favorite console game is getting a bunch of spiffy new features on a handheld I chose not to support. =(
At least we are getting a Dragon Quest release for the DS.

I predicted it as soon as I saw one of those DS thingies:

I didn&rsquo;t even get to three whole weeks without losing it. =/
The stylus should have a little rope tying it to the DS.

Soul Kerfuffle: The View From the Top
Funny, just before I read this blog post, I was thinking about how I didn&rsquo;t really have time for WoW.
I&rsquo;ve never gotten to 60, so I don&rsquo;t know how addictive the end game is. But is it really all raiding? I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be able to devote 12+ hours on weekends for raids. 3-4 hours maybe, but 12 hours? Well, my brother just hit 60 recently, so I suppose I should ask him after a few weeks what it&rsquo;s like.

Mario Kart &ndash; it&rsquo;s Mario Kart! Yay! Although we now have six DS owners at the office, we haven&rsquo;t yet had time to pull off a six-player race. I&rsquo;m pretty sure it will be insane though.
Brain Age &ndash; mildly nerdy, strngely addictive. It&rsquo;s not so much a game, more of a series of mental training exercises. Too bad the speaking portion doesn&rsquo;t easily recognize my voice (and/or my accent)

One would think the Nintendo DS, with it&rsquo;s unique dual-screen layout and styles usage would not be that vulnerable to piracy.
You&rsquo;d be wrong though.

In the current handheld wars, I&rsquo;ve sampled both the PSP and the Nintendo DS, and I have to say, I&rsquo;m much more impressed with the DS. The PSP seems to be a very serious device, as if you tried to cram a PS2 into a handheld and toss in a media player alongside. The DS on the other hand, is just plain fun.
Since we&rsquo;ve been putting in a lot of long hours at work lately, one of our developers had the bright idea to bring his DS to the office.

Suikoden V is hands-down the best game in the Suikoden series.
In almost all respects, it beats out the previous best game of the series (Suikoden 2): The story manages to follow the old pattern of &ldquo;oh I need to flee my home and now I&rsquo;m leading a band of rebels in a civil war!&rdquo; but infuses with a lot of new elements: usurpers to the throne, historical wars of succession, threats of foreign invasion.

<div class="content p-summary">
One would think it an unfair comparision, seeing as how BG2 is at least 5 years older that Suiko5. But BG2 holds up pretty well, I end having a mental coin toss as to which game I will play at any one time. They both have their merits.
Suiko5
Pros: Awesome story, lots of background and character depth.
Cons: Extremely narrow gameplay, heavily scripted. Hero looks girly.
Status: 12 hours in.

(My previous practice was never to post an entry about a game until I&rsquo;d finished it. This was a good idea during those days that I had a lot of free time and could finish the average RPG in a week. I haven&rsquo;t been in that state for four years.)
My brother warned me that according to reviews, the first eight hours or so of Suikoden V were quite draggy. When I thought about it, that should be expected.
