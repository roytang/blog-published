    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fxbd5/im_sick_of_this_entire_dlc_scam_cutting_content/">&#39;I&#39;m sick of this entire DLC scam - cutting content out of a game to re-sell it is wrong in so many ways. So So how easy and cohesive is it to pirate DLC for games?&#39; on /r/gaming</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>What if they didn&rsquo;t bundle DLC separately and just straight-up sold the game for a higher price (and with a slightly later release date), would you prefer it? Or if the game was released with the same price but no additional DLC at all? Or the game is released with no DLC but six months later a new full version of the game is released with slightly more content that could have been released as DLC but instead you now have to buy a full game again?</p>
<p>Personally, I find that DLC is a good idea as it allows customers to pick and choose which content they want. I&rsquo;m not going to bitch about it, I don&rsquo;t have to buy the DLC if I don&rsquo;t want to. In fact for longer games like RPGs I just wait for the GOTY to come out later.</p>
<p>Also, the phrase &ldquo;cutting content out of the game&rdquo; shows misunderstanding of how software development in general works. Like all other software development gigs, game development is largely constrained by schedules and real-world budget and resource constraints. And most of the time they&rsquo;re going to fall short of those schedules and have to decide what features to cut so they can make it on time. Having the option of releasing them as DLC creates less pressure on the team and creates an opportunity for content that would otherwise have been cut or saved for a larger expansion disc to be made available. And please don&rsquo;t take at face value the rantings that because 90% of a DLC&rsquo;s content is already on the disc that it should have been included at release - you haven&rsquo;t considered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-ninety_rule">the other 90%</a> yet.</p>

<p>Games gives you carrots to chase all the time (quests, getting to the end of the level, mission objectives), achievements are just an additional layer of that for people who like having goals.</p>

<p>The medium(Normal) computer isn&rsquo;t very good as a gauge of your abilities as it isn&rsquo;t very difficult at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a particularly good MvC3 player, but here&rsquo;s some ideas: Are you able to block correctly? Do you use assists to create openings? If you have trouble doing hypers on the fly, have you tried doing them in training? Completing a few missions?</p>
<p>Actually I think Wolverine can do Berserker Barrage X (QCF + AA) off most light or medium attacks, so you should be able to practice like Light into Medium into down-forward + Light + Medium at least. I find this easier on an arcade stick instead of a controller though due to the button layout.</p>

<p>Really? Did you get that from the multiple game of the year awards it garnered? :p</p>
<p>Dunno whether bnet is &ldquo;shitty&rdquo; or not but I&rsquo;ve personally logged more than 500 games online, and I&rsquo;m no pro just a casual player mostly. Hundreds of games are ongoing at any one time on bnet, I&rsquo;m not sure under what definition of shitty that qualifies.</p>
<p>Tldr sc2 is an awesome game</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not one to troll :)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that much of an FPS player so I never really got into the Half-Life series.</p>
<p>Their naming convention is weird with HL2E1 and HL2E2, I initially thought they were like parts of HL2 or something.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the definition of &ldquo;expert&rdquo; in the post that&rsquo;s throwing me off. By that definition, the only people who can be considered experts have to be playing FPS, RPGs, Platformers, and every other genre that has one of the &ldquo;must play&rdquo; video games.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>A newlywed couple moves into their new house. One day the husband comes home from work and his wife says, &ldquo;Honey, you know, in the upstairs bathroom one of the pipes is leaking, could you fix it?&rdquo; The husband says, &ldquo;What do I look like, Mr. Plumber?&rdquo; A few days go by, and he comes home from work and his wife says, &ldquo;Honey, the car won&rsquo;t start. I think it needs a new battery. Could you change it for me?&rdquo; He says: &ldquo;What do I look like, Mr. Goodwrench?&rdquo; Another few days go by, and it&rsquo;s raining pretty hard. The wife finds a leak in the roof. She says, &ldquo;Honey, there&rsquo;s a leak on the roof! Can you please fix it?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;What do I look like, Bob Vila?&rdquo; The next day the husband comes home, and the roof is fixed. So is the plumbing. So is the car. He asks his wife what happened. &ldquo;Oh, I had a handyman come in and fix them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Great! How much is that going to cost me?&rdquo; he snarls. Wife says: &ldquo;Nothing. He said he&rsquo;d do it for free if I either baked him a cake or slept with him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Uh, well, what kind of cake did you make?&rdquo; asks the husband. &ldquo;What do I look like,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;Betty Crocker?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apparently I am already qualified to get something called a Bounty Hat, but I do not have Team Fortress 2. I would like to see what the fuss is about and why there are hats, so if anyone could spare the cash to gift me TF2, it would be great! My steam id is same as my reddit username :D</p>

<p>Are these as good as the first two Monkey Island games? I enjoyed them as a kid but haven&rsquo;t played the newer ones.</p>
<p>Also, is Telltale Games ok? Do they work like Steam?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>It is not like Age of Empires, the gameplay is turn-based instead of real-time, and much more massive scale.</p>
<p>Reading through the manual might help you decide whether to buy or not. Or maybe look for videos of Civ 4 gameplay (I remember seeing some introductory videos to Civ 4 on youtube) to get an idea of what a Civ game is like.</p>

For the record, I purchased an original R1 copy of Street Fighter IV for the PS3 last Tuesday, and we&rsquo;ve been pretty much playing it whenever we had free time at home. The one time I came in late to work during the month of February was because of Street Fighter IV.
Street Fighter IV came in with ridiculously high reviews for both the XBox 360 and PS3 versions, the PS3 version garnering a 94 (universal acclaim) on Metacritic It can&rsquo;t be denied that it&rsquo;s an awesome game, although not everyone agrees.

Fun little widget from Capcom allows you to put yourself into an SFIV battle video. Here&rsquo;s me as Ryu!

Street Fighter IV is out next week, hopefully we&rsquo;ll be slinging fireballs by next weekend!

Amazingly, despite my work schedule I still managed to finish a rather old-school RPG. I finished Star ocean: Second Evolution for the PSP today, clocking in 30 hours of playtime. I have to say I quite enjoy playing RPGs on handhelds. RPGs are usually rather long games so it&rsquo;s nice being able to handle them in bite-sized chunks while commuting, et cetera.
Star Ocean: The Second Story was probably one of the best Japanese RPGs to come out of the Playstation era, despite the lackluster translations of that time (hey, it was pre-year 2000, all translations were pretty bad then!
