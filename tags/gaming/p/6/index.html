<div class="content e-content">

<p>They need to deliver the game to the console guys (Microsoft/Sony) for certification months before the release date (I believe for ME3 it was submitted for certification in January). So your suggestion is that even if they have a chance to work on additional content earlier, they should NOT do that at all? Like, just have those guys work on the old republic or something?</p>

<p>In my opinion any plot related dlc available on launch day should be free.</p>

<p>Strictly out of curiosity, for what value of N would &ldquo;DLC released N days after the launch day&rdquo; be okay for you, but &ldquo;DLC release N-1 days after launch day&rdquo; not be okay?</p>

<p>Good DLC adds something new to the game.</p>

<p>I like how your criteria for &ldquo;Good DLC&rdquo; doesnt include whether it was a day one release or not. And if you&rsquo;re saying &ldquo;day one&rdquo; means it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;new&rdquo;, would day two be better?</p>

<p>I like how the statue is part of the game&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that time I bought FF7 and later there were action figures of cloud and sephiroth being sold in the store, but they should give those to me for free because they&rsquo;re part of the game content! Oh, and I should also get a copy of Advent Children for free!</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve tried both the PS3 and the PC demos. The PC version looks better, but the control scheme seems clunky for the keyboard/mouse (the loot dialog doesn&rsquo;t even seem to have any keyboard shortcuts) and better for the controller. I&rsquo;m also not too thrilled that the PC version required me to login to my EA account. Any feedback on the full version, is it ok, better than the demo?</p>
<p>Anything else I need to consider in weighing PC vs PS3? Do we expect mod support? Also, if I buy the retail version (off the shelf copies are a lot cheaper than digital downloads where I am), will it be for Steam or Origin or Neither?</p>

<p>Are you suggesting that r/gaming should be filled with posts begging for stuff? You&rsquo;re not the only poor gamer you know.</p>
<p>r/gaming is not averse to giveaways, but the supply of people who can giveaway stuff is a lot less than the people who want stuff, so it&rsquo;s more acceptable to post a thread giving away stuff than begging for stuff</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/Games/comments/oggsn/origin_is_required_for_all_pc_editions_of_mass/c3h4jzs/">a comment by niton on &#39;Origin is required for all PC editions of Mass Effect 3&#39; on /r/Games</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>I dislike the whole thing not because of the DRM (I don&rsquo;t even see Steam as DRM), I dislike it because the Origin service at the moment is crappy. They don&rsquo;t have the same amount of sales Steam does, and their customer service is horrid (there are horror stories about Steam customer service)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for having a competing service to Steam, but hopefully that competing service is a good one that forces Steam to innovate and improve to keep up (not that they&rsquo;re doing a bad job at the moment). Origin is nowhere near that yet.</p>
<p>Mass Effect 3 being exclusive to Origin isn&rsquo;t a bad thing per se, but it&rsquo;s a bit like a much anticipated game being exclusive to a console that only 5% of the market uses - the other 95% are sad, but we just move on because our platform of choice already has a vastly superior library anyway.</p>

<p>I just crafted four times and got four X% off Valve coupons. I love it. Anyone want to trade for some other coupons?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s been a good sale and christmas hunt. I did get one game from the gift pile (SpaceChem), and bought quite a few cheap ones.</p>
<p>I hope you guys had a good holiday sale :D</p>

<p>If those are the DLC you&rsquo;re buying, then yeah, you would have a problem. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I managed to get 2 pretty good Fallout:New Vegas DLCs for the price of those &ldquo;few guns&rdquo;</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I like the Civ DLC. I don&rsquo;t enjoy map packs, but then again I don&rsquo;t have to buy them. But I like the additional civs being added every now and then. Keeps the game fresh. In fact, I&rsquo;d like to have as many civs as possible, but I don&rsquo;t want to have to wait forever for that game. And with Steam, I never have to buy them full price, I just wait for the next big sale.</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t mind not having religion or corporations, I already have Civ4 for that. :D</p>

<p>Stay out of the scary places for now. Try fighting aboveground things first&hellip; fiends or or radscorpions and such, so you get used to paying attention to looking at your radar (lower left corner) to be aware of nearby enemies. Also you might want to increase your perception stat so that enemies show on the radar earlier.</p>
