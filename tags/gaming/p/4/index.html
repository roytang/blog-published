<div class="content e-content">

<p>So, I purchased it on GMG before watching the review, might have been a good idea to do it in the reverse order. I still would have purchased it anyway.</p>
<p>Anyway, I found out from the review that this is the last expansion for civ 5? I&rsquo;m kind of disappointed because I was hoping they would implement a &ldquo;random events&rdquo; system like what they had in the last civ4 expansion. Still probably gonna spend a couple of hundred hours here though :p</p>

<p>Already made the purchase, but I didn&rsquo;t get any credit so I guess neither did you. Sorry man, maybe I did it wrong or something.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the helpful post though! Have some upvotes instead :D</p>

<p>I just finished The Last Of Us! Fantastic game (as everyone has been saying)</p>
<p>I also started up Infamous 2 again (I lost my save when my old PS3 hard drive had a problem, and I didn&rsquo;t have cloud saving enabled then)</p>
<p>Also doing a little BlazBlue on the Vita on the side. The missions are hard!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily that they&rsquo;re damning. It&rsquo;s more likely that most of them are questions they can&rsquo;t answer yet right now, maybe a lot of details are not yet finalized and they&rsquo;d rather not risk committing Microsoft&rsquo;s mistake of putting out an inconsistent message.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>They&rsquo;re not going to change anything this early in the game, when the consoles aren&rsquo;t even out, for the same reason that the die-hard XBox fans are still going to buy the machine on launch, even if they&rsquo;re a minority now - it&rsquo;s still too early to tell what&rsquo;s going to happen, and Sony still has a lot of chances to screw things up. Sony may have won E3, but that was just E3, the real test is where we are 2 years down the road.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>The console features weren&rsquo;t very exciting so if they had something new there that might have helped. Although TBH the hardware spec bump is pretty significant already, I don&rsquo;t mind this so much.</p>
<p>More exclusives would have been nice, although I have to say Second Son is looking pretty sweet. I don&rsquo;t actually care for the XBox &ldquo;exclusives&rdquo; myself, but the longer list of titles on that side makes it easier for XBox fans to talk themselves out of switching.</p>
<p>And Vita owners everywhere will say: more Vita support, more Vita games, Vita/memory card price drops. The Vita is a clear differentiator over MS (and even Nintendo - the Vita and the 3ds dont actually occupy the exact same market niche in terms of games) so more PS4 x Vita features would have been great too.</p>
<p>Right now, they clearly won over MS, but that&rsquo;s only because MS made so many blunders along the way. If all of the above had been provided, xb1 might have been buried so hard whoever manages to pull it out of that hole would be named king of england.</p>

<p>There is no guarantee that blocking used games will increase profits. It&rsquo;s even possible for it to decrease profits since consumers will have less money to spend due to being unable to sell their used games.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I started up Persona 4: Golden on the Vita. It&rsquo;s mildly addictive, because I keep wanting to maximize what I do everyday. If you haven&rsquo;t played it, it&rsquo;s a weird cross of dungeon crawling with Pokemon-like battles (elemental weaknesses, etc) and Life/Dating Sim (for the noncombat parts); the relationships you build in the noncombat parts improve the Personas (pokemon) you can use in the dungeons, the noncombat stats unlock quests that require you to farm in the dungeons, etc. I think I&rsquo;ve played some 20-30 hours since starting it around Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>If the Xbox One (a) lets me play all my PS3 discs and PSN downloads AND (b) had an online service that gave out lots of value in free games, that&rsquo;d turn me for sure. I&rsquo;m not terrible interested in Xbox franchises like Halo or Gears of War. (I originally typed GoW, but realized that means God of War)</p>
<p>PS4 has (b) but not (a), but I&rsquo;m not rushing out to get that on release date either, and I figure given enough time and Gaikai, Sony would be able to figure something out for (a)</p>
