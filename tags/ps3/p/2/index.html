<p>Some info:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The giveaway games are all minis: Velocity, Breakquest, Canabalt, Wizorb</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The codes will only work on the Europe store (you can just create a EU account if you really want them)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 of my codes worked fine; but for Canabalt, the store said the code was already used =/</p>

<p>A sense of ownership is not necessary to enjoy games and play them. Think of it like having a friend who has a library of games you can borrow any time, as long as you pay him $50 a year. Every month he even gets new games you can borrow!</p>

I have some questions</a></h4>
<p>I have a 500 GB WD external HDD, and a friend told me I could take it out of it&rsquo;s case and use it as the replacement HDD for the PS3. Can someone confirm that this will work? (I don&rsquo;t want to take apart the drive just to find out it won&rsquo;t work with the PS3).</p>
<p>All the youtube guides I&rsquo;ve seen are saying to get a laptop hard drive but those are more expensive and I already have this external available.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>It should be tied to the PSN account that purchases it. You&rsquo;d have to have the same account available on both systems in order to download the game.</p>
<p>Once you have downloaded the game to a system, any account on that system can play the game (as long as the original account used to download it is still on the system)</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I can only sympathize with the Sony developers who are probably putting in massive overtime because of all the public pressure (including from places like reddit) that makes their manages push hard on them. They&rsquo;re probably being given impossible deadlines/targets too, and when they inevitably slip, Sony has to give an update like this. Estimation isn&rsquo;t easy people, especially under pressure!</p>
