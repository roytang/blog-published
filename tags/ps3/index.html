<div class="content e-content">

<p>PS3 games are not region-locked. (AFAIK the only exception is Persona 4 Arena). Your PS3 console can play any game from any region.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more important is actually the region for your PSN account. PS Store digital purchases are tied to the region of your PSN account. Your PS3 can hold accounts from any region (you just need to create an account with an address in that region)</p>
<p>Some DLCs may not work with game discs from different regions (varies by game,  but I think it&rsquo;s more common that they don&rsquo;t work.)</p>
<p>For example, if you&rsquo;re playing an R1 (America) game disc, but you purchase the game&rsquo;s DLC from the EU PS store, the game probably won&rsquo;t recognize the DLC.</p>
<p>Some functionality such as cross-play/cross-save may not work across regions.</p>

<p>So Sony will stop with the Instant Game Collection when Ps4 is released?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Um, no, where did you get that. New games are added to the IGC regularly. Once the PS4 is releaed, the IGC will include PS4, PS3 and PS Vita games.</p>

<p>You only need one subscription for ps3, ps4 and psvita.</p>
<p>The longer you wait, the less free games you get. (You can no longer avail of free games that are removed from the Instant Game Collection before you subscribe)</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Wow, I&rsquo;ve had a PS3 since &lsquo;08 played zero of those lol. It&rsquo;s no surprise I didn&rsquo;t get one at launch, the only thing there that remotely interests me is Marvel:UA and that Genji thing looks like it might be interesting.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<blockquote>
<p>For instance, there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a post on there about uncharted or xcom being free at the moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They have a weekly PS store update post which includes the PS+ IGC games for that week, Uncharted 3 and X-Com are covered here: <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/06/11/playstation-store-update-295/">http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/06/11/playstation-store-update-295/</a></p>
<p>Edit: Also <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/06/10/playstation-plus-e3-2013-sale-free-machinarium-uncharted-3-xcom-more/">http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/06/10/playstation-plus-e3-2013-sale-free-machinarium-uncharted-3-xcom-more/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, there is a lot of other crap on there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s only because it&rsquo;s E3 this week.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Was hoping there might be a PS+ specific feed somewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know about that, but since the blog is an official source, literally every PS+ free game and sale gets announced there at some point. Between reddit (r/PlaystationPlus) and the blog, I don&rsquo;t see any chance of &ldquo;missing out&rdquo; on any deals.</p>
<p>Edit: I only thought to try this after writing this post, but you can just subscribe to their PS+ tag directly to get the PS+ content only. Try the following URL: <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/tag/playstation-plus/">http://blog.us.playstation.com/tag/playstation-plus/</a> (it worked in Google Reader)</p>

<p>I only play the occasional Street Fighter / SFxT / Blazblue / Injustice match online (then get crushed due to being a noob and/or lag). Any other online play I get is on the PC</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<ol>
<li>As large as you can, especially if you&rsquo;re getting PS+. I&rsquo;d recommend 160 at the minimum. For PS1 classics, I think FF9 is 1.5 gigs, that should be typical. For PS3 games, they range in size from 5-20gb (I think Uncharted</li>
</ol>
<p>3, which will be free on PS+ after Jun 11 will be more than 20gb)</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>I would just get the latest model unless BC is really, really important, the only BC models are the really old ones, the first generation so they&rsquo;re likely to have more hardware problems. There are some PS2 games available on PSN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s usually 10 PS3 games and some number of PSP/Vita games available in the instant game collection at any one time. Around 4-5 of them cycle in and out every month. You can check this link for the current list for the NA store: <a href="https://store.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/#!/en-us/free-games/cid=STORE-MSF77008-PSPLUSFREEGAMES">https://store.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/#!/en-us/free-games/cid=STORE-MSF77008-PSPLUSFREEGAMES</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New PS+ free games are added weekly for North America, but announcements are made before the first Tuesday of the month. Not sure how it works for Europe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have no idea</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>So my friend has an R2 copy of Injustice while mine is R3, and apparently we can&rsquo;t play against each other online? When we get the invite from the other person it asks us to quit the current Injustice game and insert the &ldquo;Injustice Gods Among Us&rdquo; disc, even though that&rsquo;s what we currently have.</p>
<p>Is there any workaround for this? It&rsquo;s quite sucky =/</p>

<p>One thing to note is that store purchases using credit cards will require a credit card with an address from that region. This is true for the US store at least; I live outside the US but I use a US account, so I can&rsquo;t use my credit card and have to buy prepaid PSN cards instead.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>This was the obvious conclusion, and it&rsquo;s why I won&rsquo;t be buying a PS4 for some time. I&rsquo;m prepared (and willing) to just have the PS3 as my console for a couple more years. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re still going to get some good games later in the release cycle.</p>
