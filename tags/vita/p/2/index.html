<p>I don&rsquo;t see a problem. It could be a one-way crossbuy where getting the PS3 version nets you both of the Vita versions. Heck, even if the PS3 version got you only FFX Vita, that would already be pretty sweet.</p>

<p>Well, that might take a while longer then. &ldquo;The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time.&rdquo; - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-ninety_rule">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-ninety_rule</a></p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I have both (well technically, I have access to both&hellip;the 3DS is my brother&rsquo;s and he doesn&rsquo;t use it.) I&rsquo;ve had access to the 3DS longer, the Vita is only a couple of months old.</p>
<p>I use the Vita a lot more because reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The screen is very very nice, especially compared to the 3DS screens. My eyes hurt a bit after a while of using the 3DS (even with 3D off). The Vita games also look a lot better compared to 3DS ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Playstation Plus. Nuff&rsquo; said.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No online account for the 3DS means I&rsquo;m not going to make digital purchases off the eShop, which limits my available library. I&rsquo;m worried about losing or breaking the system and losing access to all my purchases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just find that I like more games on the Vita. I like Mario and Zelda on the 3DS (the new Legend of Zelda will probably be the next game I play on 3DS), but aside from that most of the library is meh for me. I played Tales of the Abyss and Paper Mario Sticker Star on the 3ds but both got boring for me quickly. I might try out Fire Emblem, and if there&rsquo;s a new Advance Wars I&rsquo;d jump on that. On the Vita, I&rsquo;ve been playing P4G, Disgaea 3, Gravity Rush and I want to go through SFxT and Blazblue:CS, then there&rsquo;s Uncharted, Final Fantasy Tactics and I heard Zero Escape was good, and I want to try Guacamelee, and one of these days I&rsquo;m going to give in to impulse buying urges and get Xenogears off the store, oh and if LBP vita went on sale I&rsquo;d get that, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achievements/Trophies. I realize a lot of people don&rsquo;t care for them and don&rsquo;t &ldquo;get&rdquo; people who like them and that&rsquo;s fine, more power to you. But I do like them, though I&rsquo;m not like a platinum hunter or anything like that.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure whether the SFxT character DLC comes as a code with the game (in which case there wouldnt be any problem), or if I somehow need to login the Vita with my R3 account.</p>
<p>Edit: To be clear:</p>
<p>PSN account on my Vita - US</p>
<p>SFxT PS3 copy - R3 (Asia) (I already have this)</p>
<p>SFxT Vita copy - R3 (Asia) (I plan to buy this)</p>
<p>I already know the DLC from the Vita copy will work with the PS3 copy (since they&rsquo;re both R3); what I don&rsquo;t know is whether (a) the SFxT Vita copy will come with a redemption code for the character DLC that I can just redeem in the PSN Store on my PS3 (I have R3 accounts for this- HK and SG); or (b) I would need to have an R3 account on my Vita to be able to get the DLC</p>

<p>I keep waiting for this announcement. I love Disgaea, but I never get anywhere playing them when I&rsquo;m stuck on a console. Handheld is great so that I can just play it when I&rsquo;m somewhere waiting for something.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I think the normal battery life is around 3 hours. When I go out, I put mine on flight mode, that allows me to get more battery life out of it (5-7 hours active play time I think)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not an American, so I&rsquo;d love a citation on that one.</p>
<p>Regardless, even if they couldn&rsquo;t sell it, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that suddenly it becomes &ldquo;finders keepers&rdquo; where the first person who sees it can just get it.</p>
<p>You know what, I&rsquo;m not judging or anything, whatever floats your boat. If you think it&rsquo;s okay to get something for free without even asking the owner go ahead. I&rsquo;m just saying if it were me I&rsquo;d probably ask the manager or an employee first if I could have the cross buy copy. Maybe even use your arguments that they&rsquo;re not going to use it anyway.</p>

<p>So how is this at all different from one person buying the game and letting someone else have their cross-buy version</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did the place it was rented from say the first renter could have the cross buy version? If not, then it&rsquo;s seems closer to one person buying it and the second person borrowing the game under the pretext of playing it then using the cross-buy version without permission. The one who bought the game is the one entitled to get the cross-buy version, and unless he explicitly let you have it then you&rsquo;re taking advantage of his ignorance.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>It&rsquo;s fine, just keep going through the levels until you get the hang of it. If you&rsquo;re missing 1/10 attacks it just means you&rsquo;re trying to attack an enemy whose SPD is too high for your hit. If some of your characters are consistently unable to hit, try giving them equipment that boosts their HIT.</p>
<p>Your lower level guys are going to have trouble hitting/damaging higher level guys, use them in combos with your higher level guys so that they can gain some EXP from kills. (Put them side-by-side or right behind the higher level guy who will do the attack and there&rsquo;s a chance for a combo)</p>

<p>I just bought a Vita (yay me!) so I could take advantage of my existing plus subscription. My brother tried it out and he seems interested to get one too, but he&rsquo;s asking me whether we would be able to use the same PSN account on two vitas (so that we both have access to the IGC)?</p>
