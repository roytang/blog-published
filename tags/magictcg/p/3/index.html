<div class="content e-content">

<p>Wild Ricochet is a legal target while it is resolving. The last step of spell resolution is:</p>
<p>608.2k As the final part of an instant or sorcery spell&rsquo;s resolution, the spell is put into its owner&rsquo;s graveyard. As the final part of an ability&rsquo;s resolution, the ability is removed from the stack and ceases to exist.</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1u59mm/i_made_a_20_standard_deck_including_sideboard/ceeqen7/">a comment by SlairStyle on &#39;I made a $20 Standard deck (including sideboard) that doesn&#39;t suck. 5-0 @ FNM&#39; on /r/magicTCG</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>The next standard daily was like six hours away so I just played a few games in the tournament practice room instead. I used the same decklist with minor changes (Guildgates -&gt; Temples and Thoughtseizes instead of Duress in the SB; SB Celestial Flare -&gt; SB Hero&rsquo;s Downfall because I didnt have the flares oddly enough)</p>
<p>I only played single games since I wanted to get a hang of the deck. I lost the first two due to poor handling (played a High Priest into an empty board, wasting it, and thinking the newt did -4/-4 when I only had the cauldron and not the witch), but won the next 3.</p>
<p>Some comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Grim return seems poor/situational, I never got to use it once. Though, it can hit opponent GYs right? I guess an upside would be he could animate the discard off that rat guy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have trouble/a slow start if you don&rsquo;t have an early newt; your only way to tutor him comes out turn 4 at the earliest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seem to have trouble/no way to recover if the opp gets into an early creature advantage. My two losses had 4+ creatures on the other side</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Nope. Timestamp order only matters for effects in the same layer (i.e. if you resolve &ldquo;set creature&rsquo;s P/T to 0/1&rdquo; then afterwards resolve &ldquo;set creature&rsquo;s P/T to 3/3&rdquo;, it becomes a 3/3), but for effects in different layers, they are applied simultaneously regardless of timestamp order.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really care about the UI, but they really need to do something about server stability, lag and recovery from crashes.</p>
<p>MTGO&rsquo;s convenience is a big plus for me, since I can&rsquo;t really allocate any large amount of time towards paper Magic anymore (and most of the people I grew up playing Magic with have moved to faraway places). The server issues are the only real problem and the reason why I dont play large events any more.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;m in the process of going through all the cards now. My current scheme is 3 groups: rares/mythics (sorted alphabetically), commons/uncommons (sorted alphabetically), excess trash commons/uncommons.</p>
<p>I still keep trash cards, but no more than 1 playset. (This part might be a bit irrational), the rest go into the 3rd group</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only at letter C at the moment, but I&rsquo;ve already filled up more than one booster box of trash cards, I&rsquo;ll dispose of them somehow once I&rsquo;m done with everything. Aside from the excess trash, I have roughly one booster box each of A, B and C, and one fat pack of A,B,C rares/mythics sorted.</p>
<p>I already have all the other cards sorted by letter, I just need to go through them to classify and group each bucket. I started around 3 weeks ago and just sort/organize a few stacks of cards at a time. The cards are currently stored in numerous booster boxes, fat packs and such; I&rsquo;ll think about better storage when I&rsquo;m done with all this sorting.</p>
<p>I also separate all the foils, regardless of rarity. I have about 2/3rds of a booster box worth of foils, not yet sure what to do with them. Maybe I&rsquo;ll make some sort of weird unbalanced cube.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a picture of some cancels: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/yuyzcM5.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/yuyzcM5.jpg</a></p>

<p>I feel like 90% of people would prefer casual play, but once you&rsquo;ve gotten into competitive play it starts to get into your blood and it&rsquo;s hard to go without it for an extended period.</p>

<p>It protects you from a different set of things than single color protection would. Brave the elements will only protect from one color at a time, and you need to have it at the time you want your creature protected. Soldier of the pantheon&rsquo;s protection is built in - no need for an extra spell! And you can still brave the elements him if you want!</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Additional info: these aren&rsquo;t valuable cards (most of them anyway), just random foils accumulated from years of Magic, so I&rsquo;m not inclined to sleeve them. When I get a valuable foil I keep it separate (and unbent) or just trade it away.</p>

<p>Whenever a creature with deathtouch deals damage, it&rsquo;s always lethal (to other creatures), whether that damage is via combat, via fighting or via abilities like &ldquo;T: Deal 1 damage to target creature&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edit: The relevant rule is the state-based action based on deathtouch, which doesn&rsquo;t discriminate as to the type of damage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>704.5h If a creature has toughness greater than 0, and it&rsquo;s been dealt damage by a source with deathtouch since the last time state-based actions were checked, that creature is destroyed. Regeneration can replace this event.</p>

<p>Yes, first the active player gains priority, then when he passes the non-active player will receive priority. This happens regardless of whether triggers go on the stack.</p>
<p>Comp. rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="503">
<li>Upkeep Step</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>503.1. First, any abilities that trigger at the beginning of the upkeep step and any abilities that triggered during the turn&rsquo;s untap step go on the stack. (See rule 603, &ldquo;Handling Triggered Abilities.&quot;)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>503.2. Second, the active player gets priority. Players may cast spells and activate abilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>116.3a The active player receives priority at the beginning of most steps and phases, after any turn-based actions (such as drawing a card during the draw step; see rule 703) have been dealt with and abilities that trigger at the beginning of that phase or step have been put on the stack. No player receives priority during the untap step. Players usually don&rsquo;t get priority during the cleanup step (see rule 514.3).</p>

<p>Yes it does. An effect resolves all in one go, so Polkranos damages your dude, then your dude damages Polkranos. Only after the effect has resolved will things &ldquo;die&rdquo; (state-based effects like being destroyed due to damage are not checked in the middle of other effects resolving)</p>

<p>Mutavault is very hard to kill with Supreme Verdict or any other sorcery-speed effects.</p>
<p>Does not use up a creature slot in your deck, but still gives you a potential win condition.</p>
<p>You choose when it is a creature, so you can use that timing to your advantage. i.e. wipe the board of creatures, then activate your manland to attack.</p>

<p>DAE cringe at &ldquo;life points&rdquo;? :p</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re at 20, almost all damage is as we say locally &ldquo;malayo sa bituka&rdquo; (far from the gut), so I&rsquo;d almost always take the first 5 damage from the 5/3 before chump blocking. Remember, it&rsquo;s really only the final point of damage that kills you.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>It would have to be enough life to stave off death from aggro attacks for 2-3 turns because (a) you wasted a turn casting it and (b) you still need to naturally draw into whatever answer you&rsquo;re looking for within the window the life gain gives you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say 12 might be borderline playable, depending on the environment. 15 is already reasonable and will probably see sideboard play. 20 seems a bit overboard, but it could be balanced if aggro becomes really strong/fast</p>

<p>I can see where the parsing might have been misunderstandable.</p>
<p>Anyway, just show him this thread. Or ask a judge. Or show him some youtube videos on MTGO/pro level play of how it&rsquo;s used.</p>
<p>Op&rsquo;s friend: Your interpretation is wrong, sorry!</p>
