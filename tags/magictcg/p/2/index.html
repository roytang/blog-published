<div class="content e-content">

<p>I sorted all my commons/uncommons a while back, somewhere between 20-25k cards all in all (a good number from pre-Modern sets). Booster boxes can hold like 2-3 letters at a time, i.e. one booster box is enough for all As, Bs and half of Cs. All the Ss needed more than two booster boxes =/</p>
<p>Also, I probably need better storage than booster boxes</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>If there is a more appropriate subreddit for this, feel free to advise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m travelling for work and will be in London for a few months. I get to play in a GP while I&rsquo;m here, yay!</p>
<p>However, i need a few more cards to fill out my standard deck. Can some kind London MTG&rsquo;er tell me where is a good place to buy singles? Either a brick and mortar store or a good online place that can deliver within London.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in East London near Stratford, if that matters. Thanks!</p>

<p>The count is just an estimate. I currently have them stored in a around 25 booster boxes. Commons/uncommons separate from rares/mythics, each separately sorted alphabetically. While the alphabetical sorting makes looking for particular cards easier, it&rsquo;s a bit cumbersome since the booster boxes are stacked on top of each other. I&rsquo;m thinking of looking for some storage options like longboxes where the cards are arranged in rows and I can easily pull out the relevant row and quickly rifle through it. I&rsquo;m not in the US or any country where I can easily order stuff off Amazon or whatever. I&rsquo;d be willing to consider DIY options.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Aside from looking for a cheap competitive deck (probably red), look for a team. Having a team of players lowers the costs considerably since it gives the team access to a pool of cards, more than just one person can have. Not all team members may be available for all events, so you may be able to just borrow decks from time to time. Even if you don&rsquo;t contribute much financially to the team, you can still be a solid contributor by providing good playtesting and support.</p>

What Theros block staples would be good to stock up on now?</a></h4>
<p>Obviously we have no idea what the meta will be post-rotation, but I&rsquo;m wondering if there are any cards that are good to get now that are sure to hold value. I&rsquo;m leaning towards Green - Sylvan Caryatid and Courser of Kuphrix seem like good choices. Anything else?</p>
<p>Edit: I already have Thoughtseizes. From Lorwyn lol.</p>

<p>I used to follow mulldrifting&rsquo;s MTGPlayers list, but that seems to have been removed, does anyone have any suggestions?</p>
<p>Edit: To be clear, I don&rsquo;t want to follow them one by one, I want to use Twitter&rsquo;s existing lists feature where I can subscribe to a list maintained by someone else.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to reply Alison. Wizards has always been very good in engaging the community, so hopefully at some point there can be a more open dialogue to discuss the feedback with the community and the perceived problems with the new client.</p>
<p>I personally do not mind using the new client, but some of the reports here like slower machines being unable to run it at all are worrying; if enough of the population have a problem with the new client, it may negatively affect the user base.</p>

<p>Very true, the man likes to draw the extra cards, that&rsquo;s not too much of a bad thing though.</p>
<p>Blue is very good in Theros as well, so I wouldn&rsquo;t mind recommending it for the prerelease anyway (a lot of people I know seem to prefer White, which is cool too)</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Now that all of LSV&rsquo;s limited reviews are up, here&rsquo;s some stats for JOU:</p>
<p>Total score of commons in each color:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>W - 29.5</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>U - 30.5</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B - 29</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R - 28</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>G - 28.5</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Total score of uncommons in each color:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>W - 28</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>U - 30</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B - 24</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R - 26</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>G - 23.5</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, these stats could mean nothing and don&rsquo;t take into account how individual cards stack against each other and you should still use your best judgment, and LSV isn&rsquo;t always right/accurate, but if you have no time at all to study up on the set and don&rsquo;t know what color to pick for the prerelease, I&rsquo;d go with Blue, with White as a second choice.</p>
<p>Have fun at the prerelease everyone!</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1w6kxn/probably_a_dumb_question_about_rakdos_lord_of/">&#39;Probably a dumb question about Rakdos, Lord of Riots, by a noobie building his first Standard deck.&#39; on /r/magicTCG</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>That last ability isn&rsquo;t like a spell effect that is only determined when the creature spell resolves. It&rsquo;s a static continuous effect that is in effect all the time as long as Rakdos, LOR is on the battlefield. The expression &ldquo;life your opponents have lost this turn&rdquo; is thus evaluated continuously, instead of based on a fixed time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this wording is not addressed directly in the comprehensive rules, mostly because the term &ldquo;this turn&rdquo; is most commonly used on spells and abilities instead of continuous effects. I suggest trying the Judge chat (<a href="http://chat.magicjudges.org/mtgrules/">http://chat.magicjudges.org/mtgrules/</a>) to see if they could cite any gatherer rulings from similar cards (the gatherer page for Rakdos, LOR does not have anything relevant)</p>
<p>It should be noted that the alternative (that the reduction is only determined at casting time) would probably be implemented using counters, i.e. something like &ldquo;Rakdos, Lord of Riots enters the battlefield with X evil counters, where X is the amount of life your opponents lost this turn. Creature spells you cast cost 1 less to play for each evil counter on Rakdos, Lord of Riots.&rdquo; The counters are needed because without them, there would be memory issues with such an effect.</p>

<p>I was just answering your question :p i agree it has some problems, since youre not likely to be both aggroing and prepping for a big spell at the same time in competitive standard. The stats arent even too good even with tribute</p>
