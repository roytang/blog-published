<p>I already have like 50-60% of the shocks from Ravnica, and for some I have more than a playset. Does this mean the price of the shocks will go up so I can sell/trade the extras?</p>

I have a question</a></h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m just curious how long it takes them to send out the prize money? I placed in a GP a bit more than a month ago (Manila) and they said I&rsquo;d be receiving some notification by e-mail if the check has been sent out. I&rsquo;m curious as to when I should expect it.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for the responses! Looks like I have to wait a while more.</p>

<p>Index doesn&rsquo;t draw you a card, it&rsquo;s a -1. It doesn&rsquo;t help you when the cards on top are terrible. It&rsquo;s not even that good when attached to a creature (Sage Owl)</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>In such cases, the judge basically has to listen to each player&rsquo;s explanation and make a judgment as to who is more likely to be telling the truth.</p>
<p>In this case, the UW player is clearly caught with the Batterskull in hand which was sent to the bottom of the library just the last turn, with the only shuffle of his deck being the one where he scooped it into his hand. A judge would be easily able to determine it in this case.</p>
<p>It reminds me of something that happened in GP Manila a couple of weekends ago. One guy had accused his opponent of drawing extra cards and the head judge had to intervene to straighten things out. The head judge basically managed to count every single card the guy had drawn since the start of the game and proved conclusively that the other guy had drawn at least one extra card. The onlookers were very impressed.</p>

<p>If you have two sublime archangels, they grant each other an extra instance of exalted, i.e. the lone attacker gets +4/+4</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>If he plays the Death Wind after blockers are assigned, you do not take damage. Blocked creatures remain blocked even if the blocker is removed.</p>
<p>In order to deal damage to you, he would have to Death Wind before you block.</p>

<p>They are separate events, but triggered effects don&rsquo;t go on the stack until one of the players gains priority, and then they all go on the stack at the same time for each player. The sequence here goes something like:</p>
<p>Damage is dealt</p>
<p>State-based effects are checked, sending tokens and Obliterator to the GY (they &ldquo;die&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Active player gains priority, all pending effects that triggered from the previous effects go on the stack (active player&rsquo;s effects first, then opponent&rsquo;s)</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>You&rsquo;re the active player, your trigger (Obliterator) goes on the stack first. Then your opponent&rsquo;s triggers (spirits) go on the stack. If you both pass, they resolve top to bottom, spirits first, then Obliterator, so he can sac the spirits to the Obliterator trigger</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>It depends on which one has more value to you. The huntmaster is more prevalent in the current standard meta, but SCG has Sorin a bit more expensive than Huntmaster by around $5</p>

<p>Copying a spell means a new copy of that spell is put on the stack but you don&rsquo;t pay the costs. It does not counter the spell. The card itself says it only affects instants and sorceries.</p>

<p>Sorry, I don&rsquo;t know what to tell you but that&rsquo;s how this game is played on the competitive level. When the world/internet has already built the top tier of decks, the option exists to simply tweak one of those decks for your meta and rely on your play skill to see you through. You can go against the tide and build your own deck, but you better be damn well prepared for the top tier decks regardless. Budget isn&rsquo;t really an excuse.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always casual play with friends where you can agree not to play netdecks.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Disclaimer: I&rsquo;m really bad at explaining things to kids! Especially since this involves probability.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s late in the game and you already have 8 swamps in play. You don&rsquo;t want to draw any more lands, you just want creature to attack with or spells to kill stuff with. If you had 24 swamps in your deck, there&rsquo;d be 16 more lands you can draw after playing 8 swamps! If you had only 32 cards left in your deck, half of those would be lands!</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say instead of 24 swamps, you had 4 marsh flats and 20 swamps instead. And instead of having 8 swamps in play, you have 6 swamps and 2 marsh flats. Everything else is the same (32 cards left in the deck) If you use the two marsh flats to remove 2 swamps from your deck and put them into play, you now have only 30 cards left in your deck. More importantly, now only 14 of them are lands! (12 swamps and 2 marsh flats). So now your odds of drawing odds are slightly less than 50% - 14/30!</p>
<p>It all boils down to improving probabilities and thinning your deck, making it a bit easier to draw useful cards later on.</p>

<p>nope, real life is harsher. sorry dude.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not trying to discourage you, but the &ldquo;standard meta decks&rdquo; are tuned by hundreds of players regularly, that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re standard. it&rsquo;s difficult for a lone player with a rogue deck to match the level of tuning these decks have.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying you can&rsquo;t do it, there&rsquo;s a chance you&rsquo;ve hit on some interesting concept that may crush a lot of other decks out there. or maybe you&rsquo;re a deckbuilding genius savant, i dunno.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>It&rsquo;s actually the opposite for me, i play more video games than magic as i&rsquo;ve gotten older. Mostly because most of my play group has moved away so i dont enjoy tournaments as much. I dont really play magic for the social interaction, i can get that elsewhere, and video games are way less expensive as a hobby :p</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Nope, you assign blockers all at the same time, with no room for playing spells or abilities in between.</p>
<p>For MTM, at the beginning of your upkeep the &ldquo;discard or sacrifice&rdquo; trigger will go on the stack. At that point you can respond to the triggered ability by playing the other abilities, and they will resolve before the triggered ability.</p>
<p>(Note that this is your first chance to play spells or abilities during your turn, there is no &ldquo;after untap but before upkeep&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Er, sorry but no. You have to do it before the declare blockers step. Assigning blockers is an acion that happens at the start of the declare blocks step and does not use the stack</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>The damage is removed and the giant growth is removed, both at the same time. The important thing is state-based effects (including the thing that checks whether your creature is dead due to damage &gt; toughness) do not check in between; once all end of turn effects are cleaned up, that&rsquo;s the only time things are checked to see if they are alive or dead. So, the correct answer is (1)</p>
