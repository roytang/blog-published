</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>It would have to be enough life to stave off death from aggro attacks for 2-3 turns because (a) you wasted a turn casting it and (b) you still need to naturally draw into whatever answer you&rsquo;re looking for within the window the life gain gives you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say 12 might be borderline playable, depending on the environment. 15 is already reasonable and will probably see sideboard play. 20 seems a bit overboard, but it could be balanced if aggro becomes really strong/fast</p>

<p>Anyway, just show him this thread. Or ask a judge. Or show him some youtube videos on MTGO/pro level play of how it&rsquo;s used.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I don&rsquo;t see it as a problem. We don&rsquo;t know how large the print run is going to be (people are just speculating about it), and no matter how limited it was, it&rsquo;s still adding some N number of modern legal cards into the wild, which is better than adding 0.</p>

<li>
<p>&ldquo;unmanipulated open market&rdquo; is exactly why MM is expensive - demand is high and buyers are willing to pay at a high price and sellers are free to sell at the price (because the market is &ldquo;unmanipulated&rdquo; and &ldquo;open&rdquo;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would you feel if you ripped a Voice of Resurgence from a booster pack and Wizards told you that you could only sell it for $5 or trade for another card with the same rarity 1:1?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if there was some magical way to force retailers to sell product at MSRP, buyers will just turn around and sell them at expensive prices because that&rsquo;s what the market is willing to pay. Again, supply and demand.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>You are confused. The bonus from giant growth does not yet exist at the time your thaumaturgist ability resolves (since the giant growth has not yet resolved). Therefore the creature dies.</p>
<p>Layering does not interact with the stack at all; the stack if for spells and effects currently being played to determine in what order their effects happen. Layers determine how different type of effects combine.</p>
<p>To put it another way: The stack resolves effects one at a time so that they can change the current state. Layering tells you what the current state it when multiple effects have changed it in conflicting ways.</p>

<p>Hey, while you&rsquo;re here: Any chance of DOTP providing something extra for buyers of the previous version(s)? Maybe make some of the decks from older versions available in the new one?</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1dq2s4/one_of_my_favorite_blocks_is_time_spiral_purely/">&#39;One of my favorite blocks is Time Spiral, purely based on the references to older sets. Lately I&#39;ve found that these subtleties are lost on many players, so I&#39;ve thrown together a gallery that calls out these allusions in text, art, and flavor. Enjoy!&#39; on /r/magicTCG</a>:

<p>I&rsquo;m planning to play in a WMCQ in a couple of weeks, but I haven&rsquo;t played Standard in a while (like for half a year maybe). I have the shell of a UW Delver deck available (Snapcasters, Restoration Angels, etc) that I can try to fill out until then, but will it have a fighting chance in standard at the moment?</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for the feedback guys, looks like I&rsquo;ll have to look for other options.</p>

<p>Seriously, there&rsquo;s always people around who blame their losses on the shuffler or to mana screw. It&rsquo;s like deck building and mulliganing decisions aren&rsquo;t relevant. A lot of people don&rsquo;t understand randomness either - people complain about not having mana screw runs in real life compared to mtgo are often unaware of their own negative bias and most probably are not sufficiently randomizing their decks in real life.</p>
<p>Earlier, there was this guy complaining to me about mana screw and I was like &ldquo;dude I have 3 lands to your 6&rdquo;. And he replied that at least I was casting my spells. Well maybe I had a smaller curve and only two colors (he had 4 colors of land out by the time the game ended) and I kept my hand even with 2 lands because it already had 3 two-drops. When your opening hand is 2 forests, a green card and 3 white cards and you think to yourself &ldquo;Surely I&rsquo;ll draw a plains!&rdquo; then you don&rsquo;t draw one for seven turns, that&rsquo;s not really mana screw, that was a bad keep.</p>
<p>Sigh, sorry about the rant. I just hate it when people complain so much about the same things. (Yet they still keep coming back to play magic)</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Sorry, it&rsquo;s just not as good as you think it is. The bar is set pretty high in order for creatures to be playable in constructed. They either have to have really, really good stats (power, toughness, combat abilities) for their casting cost or be able to generate card advantage (not just 1-for-1)</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/14mqng/lets_talk_about_triggers_part_two/c7epzse/">a comment by ubernostrum on &#39;Let&#39;s talk about triggers, part two&#39; on /r/magicTCG</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>In that case, do you know what were the circumstances leading to the ruling that the player forgot the trigger? Is it because the attacking player made no sign of any sort to acknowledge the trigger?</p>
<p>I would think swinging a Pyreheart Wolf into an Augur of Bolas that could block and kill it without the trigger means he was expecting to get through with damage. I guess that&rsquo;s what bothering a lot of people, such an attack seems to indicate that you assume you&rsquo;re getting through and therefore are aware of the trigger.</p>
<p>How about the story the other day of a craterhoof player saying he was attacking for lethal, and the opponent later claiming that the craterhoof trigger had been missed. (I believe this was from the Melissa deTora article). Is this also &ldquo;not a great example&rdquo;?</p>
<p>BTW, I fully support this discussion and agree that on its face the current trigger rules are probably better than earlier incarnations, I just want a clearer guideline of when I would be considered to have forgotten my trigger.</p>
<p>Edit: Fixed some words</p>

<p>If your opponent starts to declare blockers, and you interrupt and point out the trigger at that point, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry, but I&rsquo;m unclear on this, isn&rsquo;t this what happened in Owen&rsquo;s case, except that there was something about Owen waiting a few seconds after the attack to declare blocks?</p>

<p>Yeah I get that, but the effect doesn&rsquo;t seem to be big enough to be worth it; I can understand how big it would be if there were multiples, but he only has 1 in the main, and they really only pump up the Staticasters for a single attack (the rest won&rsquo;t be able to attack on the same turn)</p>

<p>That ability&rsquo;s still going to resolve though, it&rsquo;s just that the negative power makes use it useless. If the Elder was killed by some other means (Lightning Bolt), the damage would still go through using the last known information about the Elder&rsquo;s power</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I dont follow him on twitter or read his articles so when people talked about him i always visualized him looking like owen wilson. So yes, i&rsquo;ve imagined owen wilson single-blocking a pyreheart wolf. Also, owen is totally in the right here. The rules may be terrible at the moment, but until a better solution is found one should follow the rules as given</p>
