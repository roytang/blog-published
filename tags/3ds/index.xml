&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve played (and enjoyed) SMT4, P3P and P4G. I know there&amp;rsquo;s different gameplay for Soul Hacker and Devil Survivor Overclocked, that&amp;rsquo;s fine. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably get both eventually. But which one is better to play first?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can grab another worker by talking to the guy who stands between the magic shop and the sword shop. VERY IMPORTANT. You might have to do a quest or two to unlock this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I had read this 8 hours ago when I started that 10 hour thing with one worker!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;There is no other way to acquire those items other than renting/buying them from that guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, do not be concerned by the item rental system, it&amp;rsquo;s still a ridiculously good game even if you don&amp;rsquo;t like it.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Yes, it does. I&amp;rsquo;m in the same situation, the Mii on my new 3dsxl&amp;rsquo;s is my brother&amp;rsquo;s since we system transferred his old 3ds to mine (so we could sell the old 3ds)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the EO4 demo, (not so much the having to map things manually, but that was manageable), but haven&amp;rsquo;t purchased it yet. Is it better to get EO4 or this one?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Thanks for the advice, it worked. He also has SMT4 but has not gotten to the point where you can enable Streetpass. I just switched SMT4 cartridges with him, loaded by game on his 3ds and activated the streetpass, so now it works yay!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Yup. As mentioned, I already have SMT4 streetpass activated. And I&amp;rsquo;ve already received other SMT4 street passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A coworker has Etrian Odyssey IV streetpass activated on his 3ds, while I have SMT4 streetpass activated on mine. But I&amp;rsquo;m not getting any streetpasses from him (other than Mii Plaza of course)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded from the eShop the &amp;ldquo;Shin Megami Tensei IV Update&amp;rdquo; released on 07/16, is this the one that enables streetpass with Etrian Odyssey IV? Or there&amp;rsquo;s something else I have to download or install or set?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m 30+ years old, and I play my 3ds or Vita everywhere, on the commute, when in line for anything, while waiting at a restaurant, etc. I don&amp;rsquo;t really care what other people think. :p&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best story, during one of my commutes I was riding in a shuttle type thing with people sitting on every side of me and I had my DS (this was maybe half a decade ago) playing this tower defense game Ninja Town and I was in a dire situation and had to activate this power which required me to blow into the DS to activate it. To the uninitiated it must have looked really weird, but what the hell, I went ahead and blew as hard as I could into the DS that day. No fucks were given, lol&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I always get physical for 3ds. I buy digital on Steam and PSN and the AppStore, but not on the eShop because Nintendo won&amp;rsquo;t implement the primary advantage digital downloads for me: tying the purchase to an account so that even if something bad happens to my device I can still access the game on a future device. It&amp;rsquo;s doubly important for handhelds!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Too lazy to do the adding, but what are the totals up to the 16th month? (May 2013 for the Vita)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy ToA (haven&amp;rsquo;t finished yet, but I&amp;rsquo;m about 80% through the game). Too much unnecessary walking around for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunno about EO4, but I enjoyed the demo.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Of these, only the new Zelda piques my interest.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m fine with requiring a button to run. Not only is that how Mario works, but I&amp;rsquo;m afraid I&amp;rsquo;m going to be randomly walking at the wrong time if it depends on the tilt on the analog stick.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This was my first 3D Mario, so that&amp;rsquo;s how it works for me :D&lt;/p&gt;
