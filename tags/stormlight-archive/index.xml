My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1537966035&#34;&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The first book I read for 2016 was Words of Radiance by Brandon Sanderson second book of the Stormlight Archive. It&amp;rsquo;s a huge book, and the first half took me more or less three weeks to slog through (I started it in late December), but by the time I got to the middle of the book, a lot of exciting things were happening and my pace improved considerably. I finished the second half of the book in around 2-3 days. The great thing is that the book resolves a lot of the dangling plot lines from Way of Kings, rewarding the reader with serious payoffs for the stories of Kaladin and Dalinar and a deeper look at Shallan&amp;rsquo;s back story. The first half builds up to a second half full of great action sequences that the reader is anticipating. Interspersed with Kaladin and the Kholin family&amp;rsquo;s action is Shallan&amp;rsquo;s back story and her dangerous forays into studies and investigations that dig up even more plot lines left to be resolved for later books. Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s world-building is again top notch as he introduces us into new exotic locales in this world and constructs an interesting mythology around the spren and the Parshendi. The book ends on a satisfying note at the same time leaving some threads hanging and the greater plot looming on the horizon. It&amp;rsquo;s too bad the next book isn&amp;rsquo;t scheduled until 2017
