            &lt;p&gt;- I watched Endgame exactly 365 days after watching Infinity War! (And also 3 years to the day after watching Civil War)&lt;br/&gt;- I approve of this movie as a fitting end to the last decade of Marvel films. This is a slam dunk ending. They could end it here, with no additional MCU movies/shows coming out and that would be completely fine&lt;br/&gt;- I approve of how little information about the movie managed to leak, I approve of the trailers and the marketing campaign: just enough to get hyped but nothing too spoilery&lt;br/&gt;- There is a lot to unpack, but its impossible to cover anything without getting into spoilers, but I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with the movie and the fan service, especially as a comic book fan. &lt;br/&gt;- the plot starts out slow and moves quickly at the end. If you have to pee, better to do it sometime during the first hour; I found myself holding my pee for the last hour of the movie and not wanting to miss anything, it was not pleasant&lt;br/&gt;- Imax was fine, but without probably also would have been fine&lt;br/&gt;- There is supposedly no post-credits, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know as I couldn&amp;rsquo;t hold it much longer and left mid-credits. The first half of the credits was nice though&lt;br/&gt;- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: No, same issue as Infinity War, too many characters to follow&lt;br/&gt;- They&amp;rsquo;re going to earn a bajillion dollars with this one&lt;/p&gt;
