<p>How do you feel about the liberal party? If you hate them, why? I personally feel they are no more worse than other poltical parties like the NPC, Lakas-CMD, PDP-LABAN etc</p>
<p>In what timeline of the liberal party&rsquo;s existence are you referring to?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry, I missed this one. I mean more like moving forward. Would you automatically reject any candidate backed by the liberal party or something like that? Is it mainly because of what you perceive as involvement with &ldquo;the Reds&rdquo; as you say</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Thank you for replying! Some follow-ups, if I may:</p>
<p>​</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three words. Geopolitical Power Play</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Should I take this to mean you are okay with his tolerance of China&rsquo;s taking over our islands?</p>
<p>​</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why the hell would I convince you to support him? I can only present from my own perspective and that&rsquo;s about it. It&rsquo;s you who should decide whether you support him or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not expecting you to be able to convince me. For me, the purpose of this exercise is to foster more understanding across divides; maybe you have something you can say that would be able to convince the skeptics to support the president or at least improve their appreciation of him. It&rsquo;s okay if you don&rsquo;t have any such statement. But would you not think it&rsquo;s important for Filipinos to have a better understanding of where our fellow citizens are coming from? Or convincing other people to understand your perspective better is not a priority for you? This part is not a criticism - you have certainly been generous with your replies; but I have observed that few people are willing to reach out to those they tag as &ldquo;dilawan&rdquo; etc to explain their POV, so I wonder if people just don&rsquo;t care about that kind of thing.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>&gt;  What would be a dealbreaker for you</p>
<p>Would you have a response for this part?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>&gt;  Ugh. As I said. Everyone is in cahoots for political favors. It always has been.</p>
<p>Given this and some other things in your response, my main takeaway is that you believe that Duterte is just being honest with how things are in reality, and that the issues people have with him are issues that would be true regardless of whoever is in power. Would this be accurate?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>If the above is accurate, do you think we (as a country) deserve better? Would it be better to have leadership that does not use rhetoric to glorify the bad things about our reality?</p>

<p>Thanks for indulging us. May I ask (pasensya na, medyo madami, thanks in advance if you choose to respond!):</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>- how do you feel about the way the admin is handling our relationship with China?</p>
<p>- how do you feel about the alliances with known or perceived corrupt politicos/families like the Marcoses or GMA?</p>
<p>- how do you feel about the way the president plays fast and loose with the facts, pulls out allegations out of nowhere without explanation, attacks the press, the church, etc</p>
<p>- how do you feel about the death of Kian? do you think such abuses by the cops are common or rare?</p>
<p>- &quot; I hope a REAL opposition will be formed in the senate roster for check and balance. Not the 8D type of opposition. &quot; What does this mean? What makes 8D not &ldquo;REAL opposition&rdquo;?</p>
<p>- you mentioned opposing corruption, what about his appointees who had stolen from the public and have never been punished, like the Tulfos? I am not aware of any significant anticorruption successes by this administration (which means prosecution, cases filed etc), forgive my ignorance. I know he has removed some officials for corruption, but have they been prosecuted?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>- In spite of all the negatives you mentioned, you still feel like this admin is a net positive?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>- My top 3 issues with Duterte are: (a) encouragement of a culture of violence; and (b) support for GMA and the Marcoses; (c) apparent willingness to submit to the Chinese govt. For me the vast number of killings (including those done by vigilantes and those of cops trying to fill quotas, imagined or otherwise, and those of innocents) is completely unacceptable. Is there something you can tell me to convince me to support him?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>- Have there been instances that made you doubt your support for the administration?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>- What would be a dealbreaker for you, i.e. something this administration would do that would end your support? In my opinion, the president has personally expressed support and/or</p>

In my opinion, the president has personally expressed support and/or tolerance for murder, lying, planting evidence, suppressing the press, political dynasties, vote-buying, making allegations without proof, and so on, so I find it difficult to imagine what could be worse than all of these.</p>

The results are disappointing, but that&rsquo;s only because we expected better. Historically, those who have made it into the Senate did so mostly on name recognition. What does it matter if Diokno had the best resume of all the candidates, if many of the voters did not know who he was? How could he compete against someone who appeared on a hit primetime TV series right up until the start of the campaign period?

The PH senatorial and local elections are on Monday. I almost didn&rsquo;t want to write the usual election post, mostly because I was annoyed with and tired of the electorate and the politicians and the system and all that. But we shouldn&rsquo;t give in to despair.
Often when choosing who to vote, it will be difficult to find candidates who align perfectly with your values. You make compromises to prioritize those issues you think are more important.

From a friend&rsquo;s Facebook post:
 Less than 2 weeks to the elections, I want to share a hard lesson I learned from the previous one. Especially given that I&rsquo;ve had formal lessons in rhetoric and logic.
Do not believe that logical fallacies are fallacies. Or rather&ndash;understand that they are logical fallacies, but that the world does not run on logic and so any classroom lessons on what arguments are fallacious have no relevance.

Last Monday, a magnitude 6.1 earthquake hit northern Luzon. The rocking was felt strongly in Metro Manila; I normally don&rsquo;t feel any earthquakes and only learn of them after the fact via friends or social media. But this time I was on a bed and I could feel it physically shaking, which was impressive given I was only on a second story. Imagine what it must have been like to be in a high-rise condo.

via /u/haveanicedayreddit on reddit:
 The very fact that our nation&rsquo;s highest court is weighing in on the amount of cruelty we can inflict upon those we put to death suggests we&rsquo;ve taken a wrong turn. And yet the very subject invites some to ask why we should even care about the feelings of rapists or murderers.
Here&rsquo;s why we need to care. We need to care because our justice system demands it.

<p>It was really bad for us a early last week, maybe a couple of hours of low pressure and the rest of the day wala. Things got a bit better after the whole bypass brouhaha. Ngayon mga half the day meron, and the pressure is enough to get some weak water pressure sa 2nd floor</p>

Scenario: Someone I know, let&rsquo;s call him/her Person A, appears to be supporting Party B, who in my opinion represents some of the worsts traits of Philippine politics (including but not limited to corruption, patronage, personality politics, etc). Now, I like to be optimistic about people and give them the benefit of the doubt, so in a bid to understand I tried to list down some possible motivations for Person A to do so.

The EDSA revolution was a promise. &ldquo;Never again.&rdquo; They cried. But the scope was never clear. Never again to a dictator? Okay, but if not that, then what? What of corruption, of patronage, of poverty, of oligarchy, of ignorance? We thought the job finished and patted ourselves on the back and assumed everything would go back to normal, without regard to what &ldquo;normal&rdquo; needed to be. The same evils took different guises, and today the forces of darkness and dictatorship are almost close to fulfilling their return.

I had some free time the other day so I randomly decided to post in the PH subreddit&rsquo;s regular afternoon random discussion thread, asking for questions about software development. I ended up typing some longish answers, I thought I&rsquo;d copy them over to the blog in case anyone was interested. TBH I meant more like StackOverflow type questions with specific technical problems, but I ended up answering mostly career-related questions, which is fine, but disclaimer: I don&rsquo;t claim to be an expert, these are just my opinions on things.

<p>Nah, I like living here, in spite of everything, and I&rsquo;m programming avails me a good living naman. I&rsquo;ve worked abroad on short stints (pinadala ng company), but TBH, I had never even considered leaving the country long-term, but I started looking into it after 2016. Hassle for me na ma-uproot and to try to start over elsewhere.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Wait, what do you mean? Web services are like web pages, except they&rsquo;re endpoints that usually do only one thing and return some machine readable format like JSON or XML instead of HTML that can be rendered and viewed by a human in a browser. Basically you send them an HTTP request and they maybe do some processing and spit back an HTTP response that you consume.</p>
<p>Some types are simpler than others - REST-based web services are usually very simple for example, and can sometimes be invoked directly via the browser address bar. Some follow more complicated protocols (SOAP) that support things like authentication and signing and so on.</p>
<p>Web services are developed the same way as normal web pages, with the usual backend processing and stuff (but there are some frameworks to make this easier, especially for complicated protocols like SOAP), but the client program (the one calling the web services) does not have to be another web application. It can be a mobile app for example.</p>
<p>One of the typical usages would be third-party integration. For example, Philhealth I believe currently has some kind of e-Claims web services in development (maybe? IDK the current status), where the idea is to allow third-party systems to submit Philhealth claims electronically. The idea is that individual hospitals have their own medical records systems, those systems can send HTTP requests to the e-claims web services in order to for example check whether a patient is eligible for a claim.</p>
<p>Ok, sorry I know that explanation doesn&rsquo;t really work for a 5-year old lol</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Shifting careers from IT support isn&rsquo;t an unreasonable proposition, but you need to already know your stuff before going in for interviews. You will also still need some basic level of programming knowledge. A lot of things you&rsquo;ll need can be learned on the fly/on the job (like usage of specific languages or tools or libraries), but you need a good basic foundation to build on.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m interviewing someone coming from a nonprogrammming background, I&rsquo;ll basically be treating her as an entry-level candidate. You will need to be able to justify why I should hire you over say, a fresh grad who still remembers his java programming from his college days. The interviewer will need to know you&rsquo;re not trying to BS your way into the position. Having some work you can show off (side projects or whatever) can be a big help. You can also cite anything you&rsquo;re doing in your current domain that might show off some related skillset. Like, if you did some minor scripting to gather support statistics, something like that? IDK if IT support people do that kind of stuff. See my other interview tips in the other answer elsewhere in this thread too.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>See my edit above. It&rsquo;s hard to give an average. At 15 years, I&rsquo;d certainly be expecting a six-digit ask at least. I did interview a dude once who was older than me, but his asking salary was below 100k (I think he was running some side business or sth so he didn&rsquo;t care too much). The range would also be highly dependent on skillset and the client and the position - at 15 years it&rsquo;s not unreasonable to be CTO of a small-medium-sized company. If you can get a remote job (working for US companies or such), a few hundred thousand a month wouldn&rsquo;t be unreasonable. Sorry for the non-answer</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Why do people keep asking about salary? That&rsquo;s not really a programming or software dev question. I am a freelancing consultant at the moment, so I can&rsquo;t really give a simple answer to that anyway (it&rsquo;s almost always &ldquo;it depends&rdquo;)</p>
<p>I will answer the experience one - 15ish years in the industry (yeah, I&rsquo;m old).</p>
<p>Edit: Also, there is a high range in the salaries of software devs in this country (not sure if the same elsewhere, probably), because:</p>
<ul>
<li>some people are better at selling themselves than others</li>
<li>some devs are way better than others (and thus are more valuable)</li>
<li>each dev&rsquo;s career path and growth is often unique, so it&rsquo;s difficult to compare, especially once you rack up some years of experience</li>
</ul>
<p>i.e. for a given number of years of experience, the salary band will be quite wide.</p>
<p>I get that when you&rsquo;re starting out, salary is a big deal, but honestly if you&rsquo;re a decent enough programmer, you can get into any place with above average salary. You can grow your salary a bit faster by hopping jobs every so often, but too many hops looks bad on a resume.</p>
<p>Anyway, my advice is that once you get to a decent salary range that is good for you (i.e. you&rsquo;re not starving), focus less on comparing yourself to other people, and more on increasing your own value and managing your work/life balance. Money isn&rsquo;t everything, beyond basic survival.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;ve technical interviewed a lot of entry-level/junior level devs. Honestly any kind of project would probably be okay, as long as you&rsquo;re able to explain what role you played, bonus points if you&rsquo;re able to discuss technical decisions you made (why was this choice made, and why not this other one etc) or specific technical challenges you were able to overcome. That kind of stuff. Really, if you can demonstrate that you really worked on a project (and not just coasted by on teammates help etc), you&rsquo;re already an above average interview.</p>
<p>Entry-level candidates might have more trouble since they often won&rsquo;t have a portfolio, but the quality of candidates is a bit low locally, so if you can demonstrably do simple stuff like loops, recursion, stacks, etc you&rsquo;re probably already an above average interview. Bigger companies will have written exams to filter out peeps who can&rsquo;t do that though.</p>
<p>More random technical interviewing tips, even though you didn&rsquo;t ask for that: being able to communicate well is a big plus, mandatory even. Lack of confidence makes the interviewer worry that you don&rsquo;t really know what you&rsquo;re talking about. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll slip in something I know to be wrong &ldquo;Diba pag cinall mo yan, ganito mangyayari?&rdquo;, and see how the candidate reacts</p>

Filipinos have this weird concept of nationalistic/Pinoy pride where we as a nation brag about anyone who has even remote traces of Filipino blood and gets some sort of global recognition. I&rsquo;ve even seen a few meme images about it:

<p>I get the common (and highly likely) speculation that the funds are coming from the government. There are some worse scenarios though, what if they&rsquo;re coming from a foreign government?</p>

Well, last week I did! I passed by on a weekday afternoon about 4pm after running some errands.

Some random notes I had jotted down about Christmas:
 Filipinos love Christmas. Filipinos are well-known for celebrating the longest Christmas season, with decorations and Christmas songs starting to become common around September. The most well-known meme around this time is about the song Christmas in our Hearts by Jose Mari Chan, which is one of the songs malls often play during the season. Many memes leading up to December or even earlier imply Jose Mari Chan preparing to strike on unsuspecting Filipinos.

The other day I was passing through the QC memorial circle (as is my wont) and I decided to walk around the tiangge/flea market that&rsquo;s often there. It seemd larger than usual that day, so I figured I should finally take a look. And in the process I remembered what I dislike about local flea markets: 90% of the stalls are selling some form of clothes (which I have no interest in browsing - maybe if these stalls sold something my size for once!

<p>Any recommendations? Baka lang may alam kayo na di ko pa alam lol</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Book Sale sa malls of course, but the selection isn&rsquo;t really that good.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Bookay-Ukay in Teacher&rsquo;s Village, selection is a bit better than Book Sale, but parang hindi sya bukas the last time I was in that area.</p>
<p>There used to be a small used book store with a pretty good selection called Chapter IX in Circle C mall along Congressional Avenue, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be there anymore.</p>
<p>The best one I&rsquo;ve found sa Metro Manila was this pop up stall that often appeared in Greenfield near Shaw on Friday evenings. Haven&rsquo;t been there for a few years, so IDK if this is still a thing, pero maganda yung selection nila madaming sci-fi/fantasy classics (I got my copy of Dune there)</p>

I have no plans of running for elective office (though it is a running joke among some of my circles), but if I were, one of the problems I would focus on would be education. As such, I have a list of suggested additions to the High School curriculum here in the Philippines.

There was some kind of event going on in the main plaza for the Department of Agriculture; Secretary Pinol was there giving a speech. I walked a couple of rounds around the park so I could meet my daily steps target.

For the past few weeks or so, many in the country were consumed by a sort of lotto fever. The PCSO 6/58 Ultra Lotto had gotten up to a record high jackpot prize of more than 1 billion PHP (roughly 20M USD &ndash; I know some lotteries in the US have prizes way higher than that, but hey, we&rsquo;re not the US.) Many people who normally don&rsquo;t play the Lotto were participating due to the sheer size of the pot.

A few days ago I read this great Reddit comment about how increasing hyperpartisanship makes it easier to influence the entire population. Quoting the relevant part:
 Once you've done that, you have a population that's easier to manipulate. You have, say, 30% that's 100% sure on both ends, and probably another 15% on both ends that are 80% sure, and a remaining 10% that could go both ways. The more you do this, the more the 15% will be set in stone.

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Locals will have a tendency to fawn over Westerners who come to the country, so at least at the start you might feel like you can do no wrong.</p>
<p>Locals are also a lot less&hellip; direct than Westerners and if there are problems they may dance about the issues a bit for fear of looking bad. You might need to be less direct with any criticism than you&rsquo;re used to with Westerners. And some might have difficulty talking to you if they aren&rsquo;t confident in their English (most Filipinos will be able to speak/understand English to some extent, but not everyone will have decent grammar etc)</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a strong sense of power distance in the company, so they might be a bit afraid of you especially if you are perceived as being &ldquo;higher in the food chain&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Going out with them for meals and maybe treating them every once in a while (don&rsquo;t let them get used to it) would be good ways to become accepted as part of the group. But that power distance may be difficult to breach.</p>
<p>All of these are generalizations of course, not all locals are like the above (I consider myself an exception - I&rsquo;m quite direct even when talking to foreigners), so YMMV.</p>
