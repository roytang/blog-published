</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>You know how a lot of Pinoys are so proud of Pacquiao whenever he wins a match - I don&rsquo;t get that. I don&rsquo;t relate to him just because we happened to be born on adjacent chunks of land. I had no hand in his upbringing or victories. He and I are around roughly the same age, but I doubt we had very similar experiences in life</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably different in a country like the US where they have some notion of what it means to &ldquo;be an American&rdquo;. Here in the Philippines, I don&rsquo;t think there is any such notion. I don&rsquo;t know what it means to &ldquo;be a Filipino&rdquo;. We aren&rsquo;t really that united in terms of culture and we don&rsquo;t have a strong national identity that all of us can rally around.</p>
<p>Maybe in the end our own diversity can be good for us too, as it means we aren&rsquo;t constrained or tied to a single point of view but are able to work with a veritable melting pot of different cultures and dialects and what-not. Maybe this is what it means to be a Filipino. Maybe this is what it means to be human</p>

<li>
<p>People always assume I play basketball</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have to always be aware of headroom (to avoid accidentally hitting my head)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bus and plane rides can be uncomfortable due to both lack of leg room and seat backs being too low to comfortably rest head/neck on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UV express and jeepneys can be a bit difficult too, depending on where you manage to sit, people are really bad at estimating that you need more space to pass</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Difficult to hide in crowds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People always feel like I&rsquo;m looking down on them (lol)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can reach things in high places easily</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>The API is pretty inconsistent and poorly designed. There&rsquo;s a lot of articles out there, here&rsquo;s one: <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/</a> It&rsquo;s not very elegant, and features seem to be added willy-nilly. Compare to languages like Python and Ruby, where new additions are reviewed with a focus on being &ldquo;Pythonic&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ruby like&rdquo; so that the entire language has a certain consistency</p>
<p>PHP is also the most common introductory web development language (since most Apache installations support it by default), so there is a lot of poorly written beginner code in the wild, leading to more hate against the language</p>
<p>That being said, if that&rsquo;s what you know, there&rsquo;s no problem with that, as long as you use it well. But it&rsquo;s also good to expose yourself to other languages so you can see if there are others that you will prefer</p>

<p>For example, some suggestions I would make:</p>
<ul>
<li>for the president to come out with a strongly worded message enjoining law enforcement to observe proper procedures, rules of engagement and due process</li>
<li>provide regular summary reports, probably weekly of the progress of the &ldquo;drug war&rdquo;: how many buy bust operations, how many drug dealers captured alive, how many died in encounters, how many died while in custody, and so on</li>
<li>provide and publicize a channel/process for family members of people alleged killed unjustly in police operations to air their grievances and file cases. Provide protection and legal counsel (via the PAO?) as needed</li>
<li>related to above, appoint someone to be in charge of investigating extrajudicial killings. that person should provide regular weekly update reports on the cases being investigated and act as a spokesman for the PNP (I assume he would be from the PNP) on this matter and liaise with the senate and the CHR for any investigations</li>
<li>provide regular reports on the status of the vigilante/cardboard killing cases</li>
</ul>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>Edit, some additional:</p>
<ul>
<li>automatically perform autopsy on any alleged criminals killed in a police encounter. Check for powder burns, prints on the weapon, and so on, and regularly release these autopsy reports to promote transparency</li>
<li>conduct re-training for police on how to handle suspects in custody to avoid &ldquo;nang-agaw ng baril&rdquo; even though naka handcuffs. Punish policemen na naagawan pa rin ng baril kahit nakaposas na</li>
</ul>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Spanish is actually the easiest Duolingo language to pick up for Filipinos, because a lot of the words are similar to either Filipino usage or English usage.</p>
<p>The main issues are (1) word gender (a concept that exists in neither English nor Filipino), (2) subject-verb agreement (unlike English where the choice is simply between singular and plural, Spanish adds the complication of different verb forms depending on first, second or third person, with variations depending on gender and singular/plural), and (3) object pronouns, that shit is hard. These are the main issues you have to focus on in order to have relatively decent grammar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at 50% Spanish fluency, I started like early 2015. I think I actually got to 60+% fluency but I stopped for a few months so it dropped. When I started I would keep each category at full strength - whenever one of them dropped I would go back and strengthen it again, but that led to slow progress. This time I&rsquo;m going through all the categories first (I&rsquo;m down to the last 10 or so categories), then will go back and reinforce them later. Not sure if this will be more effective, but I figure I would go wide first then strengthen those places where I turn out to be weak</p>
<p>As with all sorts of learning, the key is really to practice, practice, practice. Devote time and energy to it. It would help if you had a Spanish-speaking friend you could talk to regularly</p>

Need some help</a></h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for anyone who has a physical CD copy of their album &ldquo;Time and Chance&rdquo;, specifically the Philippine release. This version has an extra track at the end titled &ldquo;I Remember&rdquo;, which does not appear in most releases in other countries. I am not sure which countries&rsquo; releases had this track, but for sure it is in the Ph version. I would like to get a digital copy of this track. It is not on iTunes, Spotify, torrents, etc, so the best chance is if someone could rip it from the actual CD. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p>This happened to me back in the late 90s. I think I passed even less than 23 units :p Yes, you will be in probation for one sem. I don&rsquo;t remember if I wrote a letter of appeal, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard if you need to, just promise to focus more on your studies and to do better (and you really should! Engg won&rsquo;t give you another chance)</p>
<p>I suggest you talk to your adviser before following any advice from this thread.</p>

<p>150k isn&rsquo;t a lot, it can vanish in an instant if you&rsquo;re not careful. Put your money in a savings account first, you&rsquo;ll need it as a buffer for emergency expenses. You only have a year of college left, prioritize finishing that, then look for a decent job.</p>
<p>Try to track your expenses, don&rsquo;t spend too much on unnecessary things until you have stable income. If you have time, take on some part-time work while finishing your studies.</p>

<p>As long as you&rsquo;re not in a hotspot area (the Comelec takes over such areas), it should be fine. Traffic will probably be weekend-bad in Metro Manila.</p>

<p>Polls open in 3 hours. I find myself unable to sleep.</p>
<p>The past few days I&rsquo;ve toned my social media posts and tried to tell myself that I can live with whoever the public decides to elect. That I will think positively, and support him when he does well, and call him out when he does not. But now I find my guts feel sick when I think about who the public is likely to elect.</p>
<p>The man stands for violence and authoritarianism. Not only is change coming, change is already here. The campaign period has changed our country, and the change is for the worse. His supporters openly and proudly threaten violence against anyone who disagrees with their opinion. There are even reports of others being threatened or harassed in real life simply for harassing other candidates. They either knowingly spread misinformation and half-truths, or can&rsquo;t be bothered to verify the information they&rsquo;re spreading. Forget about being a good example for kids, he&rsquo;s not even a good example for adults.</p>
<p>I know I shouldn&rsquo;t judge other people for the choices they make, but I can&rsquo;t help but be disappointed when people I know come out in support for the man, people who I believe should know better, who should hold better values. I don&rsquo;t understand how they could justify supporting him in spite of his violent rhetoric and the significantly good chance that he&rsquo;s a murderer. It changes how I see these people</p>
<p>I would like to remain hopeful. I would like to hope that one of the other candidates manages some sort of miracle (hopefully of the legal kind) and overcomes the odds. Barring that, I would like to hope that I am wrong about him and that the worst-case scenario does not come to pass. I would like to hope that he would not push our society further in the direction of violence and authoritarianism. I would like to hope that the supporters do not become even more insufferable in the wake of victory. I would like to hope that we can move past the level of vitriol and toxicity throughout this campaign peri</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to try to change your minds, but which of the following views do you hold (EJK = extra judicial killings):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I think there are no EJKs in Davao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think there are EJKs in Davao, but the authorities/the mayor are not involved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think that those allegedly killed by EJKs were killed by authorities in legitimate operations or self-defense</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think there are EJKs in Davao, and the authorities are involved, but it&rsquo;s okay because:
a. They&rsquo;re criminals and they deserve it
b. Going through the judicial system takes too long
c. Hindi naman ako affected
d. It is an acceptable price to pay for peace and order/progress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit: I don&rsquo;t want to think about it kasi wala naman akong first-hand info</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something else (feel free to explain)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are uncomfortable giving your answer in public, feel free to PM me</p>

This has been one of the most divisive and shenanigan-filled election campaign seasons ever, and politics is normally crazy in this country so that&rsquo;s saying something. There&rsquo;s a strong use of social media this time around, and it&rsquo;s led to the internet being a hotbed of opinions and propaganda and memes and lies and half-truths and threats of violence. I was hoping greater citizen involvement via social media and the debates would mean citizens have more information and thus would get to be more discerning, but it seems that things have only gotten worse.

<p>I&rsquo;m 37, thanks for saying na bata pa ako.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re saying is that it takes more than 3 terms to make things better in the long term right? Kung magsalita kasi si Mayor parang isang pitik nya lang maayos na lahat e. In 3-6 months nga mawawala na ang krimen. Pagkahalal nga nya kakausapin nya lang ang senado&rsquo;t kongreso ng kung anong gusto nyang batas, in one week meron na agad</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a testament to how poor his management of Davao City actually was that he goes away for 3 years and things go to shit. Good management means things get better regardless of who is in power, which means strengthening institutions. If Davao City goes to shit whenever he&rsquo;s not mayor, what happens to Davao City when he dies?</p>
