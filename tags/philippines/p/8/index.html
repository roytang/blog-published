Or anyone here from Cebu Pacific?</a></h4>
<p>I have an international Cebu Pacific flight out of NAIA early morning on Nov 20 (4:50am). I&rsquo;m from QC and plan to leave for the airport around 12mn-1am. I&rsquo;ve just done the web check-in. My flight is <em>not</em> on Cebu Pacific&rsquo;s list of cancelled flights found here: <a href="https://www.cebupacificair.com/Pages/travel-advisory.aspx?id=110">https://www.cebupacificair.com/Pages/travel-advisory.aspx?id=110</a></p>
<p>Does anybody know:</p>
<ul>
<li>if there&rsquo;s any chance that my flight could still be affected despite not being on the list above? There&rsquo;s supposedly a no-fly zone, but I couldn&rsquo;t find any information on whether that&rsquo;s applicable 24 hours or what.</li>
<li>if I&rsquo;ll even be able to make it to the airport? There&rsquo;s some road closures on Airport Road I think? I&rsquo;m not sure how my taxi would be able to get into NAIA T3.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried calling the Cebu Pacific hotline to ask, but it seems their call center is always busy and I just end up spending a lot of time on hold. If anyone else here is successfully able to fly out of NAIA during the APEC days, that would help assuage my worry :p</p>

<p>Edit: I&rsquo;ve assembled multiple desktops myself, I don&rsquo;t want to do it anymore. SM North Cyberzone para I can do a price check while I&rsquo;m there running errands.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Because I can afford to pay other people to do it? I&rsquo;ve already assembled enough desktops when I was young and had a lot of free time. It&rsquo;s an easy waste of half a manday, maybe more if you make mistakes. If you have it assembled right there in the shop they&rsquo;ll spot any problems right away and you can replace any problematic parts immediately</p>

<p>Yes, but he and his family refuse to acknowledge the sins of his father and refuse to return the money they stole</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Move on na from martial law</p>

<p>We can move on once the Marcoses atone and give reparations</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re free to vote someone else for VP</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The choice of Marcos and the political compromise by itself speak towards Miriam&rsquo;s character. What compromises will she make if she gets elected?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a strategic/political choice to increase the chance to win</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ends don&rsquo;t justify the means. And I think the pro-Marcos crowd vastly overestimates their numbers. I think strategically this is a net negative</p>

<h4 id="posted-on-rphilippines-rphilippines-what-do-you-think-of-this-anti-binayhttpsredditcomrphilippinescomments3frke5rphilippines_what_do_you_think_of_this_antibinay">Posted on r/Philippines: <a href="https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/3frke5/rphilippines_what_do_you_think_of_this_antibinay/">r/Philippines, what do you think of this (anti-Binay)</a></h4>
<p>Something I originally shared over Twitter/FB:</p>
<p>Any friends here who are graphic designers and are anti-Binay? Just an idea: instead of just of sharing stuff on social media, how about someone designs an easy to print flyer with quick bullet points that are easy to understand why he should not be supported? Then any of us anti-Binay middle class folks can print a few copies and give them to drivers or vendors or whatever other common people we encounter, or leave them behind in buses or carinderias. The flyers can have English and Tagalog versions, and we can leave copies somewhere on the internet (the flyer itself can have the link) and also encourage other people to design and distribute their own flyers</p>
<p>Some bullet points I would include are:</p>
<ul>
<li>supports political dynasties</li>
<li>wants to get rid of term limits</li>
<li>thinks he shouldnt be held liable for contracts he signs off on</li>
<li>encourages his supporters to defy the law (re: suspension of junjun)</li>
<li>wants us to give up our claim vs China
etc</li>
</ul>
<p>maybe other people can suggest things that would have more impact on the masses. I would avoid anything outright libelous though (all of my examples above are from known articles)</p>
<p>Sharing stuff on social media is easy, and it&rsquo;s great, but we really only reach the people who are already smart enough to be against Binay. The aim of this idea is to get a grassroots-type thing going that can reach even common people. What do you think? Is it doable? Is it a terrible idea?</p>
<p>Share if you think it&rsquo;s a good idea</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the point of the post! :D</p>
<p>To ask the online crowd to come up with materials that we can print out and try to distribute to locations where people who aren&rsquo;t online can have access to them and get more information about why they shouldn&rsquo;t vote for Binay</p>

<p>Incompetence is not an impeachable offense</p>
<p>Anyway, Filipinos need to learn to live with the consequences of their election choices and not to call for resignations at the drop of a hat. PNoy and Binay being in office is everyone&rsquo;s fault. Yes, even the ones who didn&rsquo;t vote for them, we should&rsquo;ve done more to convince more people not to vote for a do-nothing and a corrupt mayor</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>When I was growing up, I was acutely aware of how much my parents worked hard and sacrificed to not only get me and my brothers through school but also buy us nice toys and other things on occasion. They would spend overtime at work, commute every day for hours at a time, sometimes even pull some extra work on the side when the family needed extra money. I promised myself that when I graduated I would try to ease their burden as much as possible, and I put in my share - paying some of the bills and putting my youngest brother through college, especially once my mother retired (my father is still working). And my parents are certainly very grateful for any help that I do provide, and never ask anything of me unless there is no alternative (usually ako na ang nagvovolunteer)</p>
<p>Everyone has a different situation; maybe you are not as grateful to your parents for some reason; maybe they can easily support themselves and your siblings without your help; maybe you have nothing to spare even for yourself. You are certainly not obliged to take on their burdens (especially if they are more than capable of doing so), but there is no harm in showing gratitude for the life they have given you, if you can spare it.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Well, my first thought was: what are you watching on local tv that is so important to be on time? I&rsquo;m not trolling or anything, I literally don&rsquo;t watch any local tv except maybe news if I catch it while it&rsquo;s on, so I have no idea if there&rsquo;s anything people watch except for crappy telenovelas</p>

<p>How are you pronouncing it?</p>
<p>Try saying something like &ldquo;hanging&rdquo;. Now remove the &ldquo;ha&rdquo;. Then replace the &ldquo;ing&rdquo; with&rdquo; &ldquo;ayon&rdquo;</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/1t0lv1/do_you_have_health_insurance/">&#39;Do you have health insurance?&#39; on /r/Philippines</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Are you employed? Many employers will provide health insurance. If your employer doesn&rsquo;t you might want to find one that does.</p>
<p>You can also apply to Philhealth even if you&rsquo;re not employed (you&rsquo;ll have to make contributions manually)</p>
<p>You should also be able to apply with private insurance groups for personal coverage (again, you&rsquo;ll have to make the contributions yourself). The only ones I&rsquo;ve tried are Intellicare and Medocare.</p>
<p>It is bad not to have health insurance if you are accident prone, or your family has a history of hereditary illnesses, or you are growing older (in your 30s maybe, but I would recommend getting health insurance as soon as possible)</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s not something serious like cancer or a stroke, diagnostic procedures can cost as much as 10k-30k or more, so having insurance to cover some or all of that definitely helps.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Datablitz doesn&rsquo;t have used games but that doesn&rsquo;t mean the market doesn&rsquo;t exist. There are shops in greenhills that will buy and sell used games. iTech also sells some used PS3 games, not sure if they will buy them off you as well.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t we have any redditors working at the telecoms who can shed light on this sort of things?</p>
<p>I understand the billing systems are automated, but the telecoms should at least have some sort of system that flags for manual review any bills that are above a certain threshold.</p>

<p>There is a Comic Quest in SM North EDSA, it should be on the second floor in the main building (unless it has moved recently)</p>
<p>There is also a Comic Odyssey in Trinoma, it&rsquo;s in a cart-like stall in the area behind the Starbucks on the second floor</p>

<p>If SSS is so successful and stable</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not. The current actuarial life of the SSS is only up to 2039, and they have had to increase required member contributions in order to ensure the fund lasts longer than that. (Citation: <a href="http://business.inquirer.net/129887/sss-revives-proposal-to-hike-contributions-to-ensure-benefits-in-perpetuity">http://business.inquirer.net/129887/sss-revives-proposal-to-hike-contributions-to-ensure-benefits-in-perpetuity</a>)</p>
<p>Adding more benefits like college plans would require even larger contributions (educational plans are typically expensive). Even if it was optional, I suspect that only a small percentage of the SSS membership would be able to afford it. And seeing how private business (which are supposedly more efficient/streamlined than government procedures) were unable to keep up with the rising costs of education, it seems unlikely for it to be viable for the SSS.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>July and August might get fairly rainy.</p>
<p>Weekend trips: the popular ones are the beaches (Boracay, etc), there are cheap local flights if you buy ahead of time. You can also head up north to Baguio, it&rsquo;s a nice place, though people usually travel there during summer (April-May)</p>
<p>Safety is a concern, yes, but don&rsquo;t let that stop you. Just be more wary especially if you&rsquo;re in a seedy-looking area. I think the Makati central business district is pretty safe most of the time.</p>
<p>Most people will have some level of English understanding, though some might respond to you in broken English. A few key phrases might help, but are unnecessary.</p>
<p>The basketball thing, hard to say, you have to know people who participate in leagues (the local term is &ldquo;liga&rdquo;). If you&rsquo;re working for a big company, the employees there will be able to help you, most guys are basketball fans.</p>
<p>Have fun and enjoy your stay!</p>

<p>While in an ideal world this sounds like it might be a good idea, I feel like it is likely to be corrupted over here. i.e. whoever reviews the reports is going to get bribed by prisoners who won&rsquo;t even do the work.</p>

The content of this post is regarding my own opinion and who I plan to vote for. If you want to do your own research (I highly recommend it), here are some links to get you started:
 Movement for Good Governance briefers on Senatorial candidates Rappler Senatorial profiles I would also Google &ldquo;rappler [candidate name] interview&rdquo; for the interview article for each candidate (too many to list here)  Here&rsquo;s a link to a Google doc of my own notes on each candidate, which I used as basis for recommendations below.
