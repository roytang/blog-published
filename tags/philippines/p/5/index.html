<p>The first post remains neutral. The additional info I put in a separate post. I only put cons here because that&rsquo;s the info I have. The whole point of the exercise is for people to provide any info they have also, so if you have additional info (whether pro or con), you can comment them also.</p>

<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s already an abundance of information on the presidential candidates. People just need to decide which flaws they are willing to overlook. That being said, I do have a spreadsheet I&rsquo;ve been using to help decide, but it is quite specific to my own stand on the issues. If you are still undecided you may find it useful: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MTPMAhGCiG_7jWC0vLNnJNQLPXGbBBLlfHri8-RqgaI/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MTPMAhGCiG_7jWC0vLNnJNQLPXGbBBLlfHri8-RqgaI/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>For VP, I have no inputs as I have already made my choice.</p>

<p>This thread is great because I knew nothing about this guy except the positives spreading on social media, and now I know he&rsquo;s anti-RH, strongly religious, etc</p>
<p>How about we have similar threads for each of the other 50 senatoriables? Some of them are hard to find info on</p>

<p>Anonimized to protect the guilty lol</p>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;We should vote for candidate A, his platform promises X, Y and Z!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Have you listened to the speech by candidate B?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just empty promises!&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;Candidate A said [something stupid]&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Ungas talaga yang si candidate A, ang kapal ng mukha! Bakit ba may boboto jan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;Candidate B said [some other stupid thing]&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Wala namang perpektong kandidato&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;People say candidate A is involved in [something illegal]&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Grabe talaga si candidate A! Dapat ikulong na yan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;People also say candidate B is involved in [something else also illegal]&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Wala naman silang ebidensya, bakit nde sya kasuhan sa korte!&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;May nagkakalat na maling kwento tungkol kay candidate B mula sa supporter ni candidate A!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Kagagawan yan malamang ni candidate A!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;May nagkakalat na maling kwento tungkol kay candidate A mula sa supporter ni candidate B!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Aba, hindi siguro tunay na candidate B supporter yan, malamang binayaran lang ni candidate A para magmukha kaming masama!&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;Inendorse daw ni Celebrity X si candidate B!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Idol ko talaga yang si Celebrity X! May integridad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;Inendorse daw ni Celebrity Y si candidate A!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Grabe, idol ko pa naman yang si celebrity Y, mukhang nabayaran!&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Comment if you have your own examples :p</p>
<p>Edit: Most of these are from FB btw. I&rsquo;ve found that this sub is slightly more rational compared to FB threads when it comes to politics discussion (although meron pa din trolls)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tanggalin ang LAPIDA or Liberalization, Privitization, and Deregulation of social services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which social services are currently in the most need of these changes? Isn&rsquo;t it a problem that the government has insufficient resources to provide social services which is why some need to be augmented by the private sector? Also, how does that acronym even make sense</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mass-oriented, nationalist, and scientific education system</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What exactly does mass-oriented mean here? Does nationalist mean dapat may communist propaganda sa curriculum?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Address the landlessness of many farmers by enacting GARB or Genuine Agrarian Reform</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t the movement have lawmaker allies? Have they introduced any legislation towards this end?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pantay na karapatan sa mga kababaihan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which rights specifically are a problem right now? I understand that society still doesn&rsquo;t treat women equally, but that seems to me to be primarily a cultural problem and not of policy. I mean, in terms of policy I believe women already basically share the same rights as men in this country (suffrage, etc). There are probably still some outliers, but maybe not being a woman I&rsquo;m not aware</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More investments ng gobyerno sa scientific sector</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this something the movement is a strong advocate of? I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever heard of NPA spokespersons discussing this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So far yan lang ang nakikita ko.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are your personal suggestions right? Is there nothing like a central leadership that establishes such policies? Like some sort of quarterly announcement &ldquo;Guys, eto yung mga gusto natin mangyari ok?&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the socialist revolution, which comes after enacting genuine national democracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What exactly does that mean? No propaganda BS. Like if someone came up to your leadership and said, sige ano yung top 10 action items na kelangan gawin para matapos na ito?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The business investments themselves are taking advantage of the workforce surplus in an impoverished setting through cheap labor. Papasok diyan yung &ldquo;at least [insert statement here]. We should not settle for less. As Filipino citizens, we should be entitled to the same rights and opportunities, regardless of socio-economic status.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, what exactly does that mean? What exactly should a business be doing to not be victimized by the NPA? If ako business owner ako, and I want to bring jobs to the people, why should I bother going to regions where there is a strong NPA presence?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That I don&rsquo;t know. Sa unit ko, walang ganyan. Cliche na pero, each unit in different areas operate independently from one another, so kung majajustify nila yun, sila na yun.</p>

<p>Please find someone who can answer, that would be great</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t you think NPA activities in the poorest provinces act as a hindrance to business investment and development in those regions?</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean to imply that they are good candidates (I agree my wording was poor here, IDK about Sanders, but Trump certainly isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;good&rdquo; candidate), but rather that they are taking advantage of a subset of voters that is known to be previously not participating in the elections by offering something significantly different from the establishment candidates.</p>

<p>Er, didn&rsquo;t I say that even if abstaining for president you should consider voting for VP and senators?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While I personally don&rsquo;t have a problem with people not voting for a president, the least evil argument is pretty valid here. Heck, look at the anti-Binay sentiments you see all over.</p>

<p>If you want to vote for someone just so Binay doesn&rsquo;t win, that&rsquo;s fine. But the last time people voted for a candidate just so the supposed terrible candidate would not win, we got GMA as president, so there&rsquo;s that to consider. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m considering as well</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I think the mandate by which the president wins matters, which means abstention matters, since it informs the strength of the president&rsquo;s mandate.</p>
<p>One of the reasons PNoy was able to push through many of his initiatives early on during the presidency was that he was elected with a relatively strong 42% mandate. A president elected with a relatively weaker mandate (say, 25-30%) will have a much tougher time with controversial issues and will be facing a much more independent senate (many of whom will be elected by more voters than the president)</p>
<p>The strength of the mandate even affects those who don&rsquo;t win - Erap placed second in 2010 showing himself to still be a strong political force which leads to his still being influential today</p>
<p>The comparison to the US low voter turnout is interesting, since the voter turnout for their primaries this year is significantly higher compared to 2012 mainly because both parties have significant anti-establishment candidates (Sanders for the Dems, Trump for the Reps) which would lead one to believe that their historically low voter turnout is precisely due to a lack of good candidates, an opportunity which Sanders and Trump can potentially take advantage of. That is the same message that a significantly large abstention (although unlikely) could send - not saying it will, but it&rsquo;s a possibility.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying abstention is some magic thing that will send a message (although it&rsquo;s a possibility if enough people do so), but that people shouldn&rsquo;t be ashamed to abstain if they don&rsquo;t find the options palatable. Even if your reason is something as simple as &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t decide&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s fine, your abstention still has meaning since it indicates that you consider none of the candidates outstanding enough to support</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>If you feel that there is a candidate worthy of your support, go ahead and vote for him/her. I encourage you to do so. I&rsquo;m not saying people should abstain, I&rsquo;m saying people can. It&rsquo;s a valid choice and every voter has the right to withhold his vote if he so chooses. There&rsquo;s no need to downvote if you disagree</p>
<p>I understand that we would prefer high voter turnout so that the will of the people is more accurately reflected, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we should lower our standards and just vote anyone into power. If there were 5 Binays running for president, choosing one at random is the same as not voting.</p>
<p>Even choosing a &ldquo;least evil&rdquo; candidate is still a choice and can be spun into support. If you decide to vote for say, Mar Roxas because you consider him the least evil choice, if Mar Roxas wins with like 30% of the vote (unlikely at this point, but whatever), he&rsquo;s going to be able to point to that and say, &ldquo;this is my voter base, these people support me. If you are against me, you disenfranchise them&rdquo;. You will be tacitly endorsing his incompetence and saying you&rsquo;re fine with that, it&rsquo;s acceptable for you. (Not dissing on Roxas in particular, I can make an example of any of the other candidates). If that&rsquo;s not something you want to be part of, you shouldn&rsquo;t be forced to.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I have a number of otherwise intelligent friends who often post things in favor of certain candidates that are obviously biased. And if you call them out on their bias they will just be all defensive and ask if you have a better idea, etc.</p>
<p>Like literally, one of my friends posted something along the lines of:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Candidate A - lists negative points; Candidate B - lists negative points; Candidate C - lists positive points. Easy decision right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not even pretending to be fair or anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s normal to be turned off by such things, especially for people who are truly undecided and trying to weigh pros and cons of the candidates. I try to stay informed and read everything even the biased ones post, but I tend to give more weight to those who I know to be undecided and are trying to be objective.</p>
<p>I have to agree that none of the presidential candidates look good enough (at the moment, at least), and I wouldn&rsquo;t object to abstaining the presidential slot. Abstaining is a vote too, in and of itself.</p>
<p>Edit: If you also find that none of the candidates meet your standards and are considering abstaining, you might want to read this: <a href="http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/abstain4president2016/">http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/abstain4president2016/</a></p>
<p>But at the very least consider voting for the other positions. There is (in my opinion) at least one worthy candidate in the VP slot, and your vote could help some of the more worthy senators get past the cringe-worthy ones in the bottom half (sadly, I think we&rsquo;re going to have to live with another term of Senator Sotto)</p>
