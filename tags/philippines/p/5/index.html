<p>Polls open in 3 hours. I find myself unable to sleep.</p>
<p>The past few days I&rsquo;ve toned my social media posts and tried to tell myself that I can live with whoever the public decides to elect. That I will think positively, and support him when he does well, and call him out when he does not. But now I find my guts feel sick when I think about who the public is likely to elect.</p>
<p>The man stands for violence and authoritarianism. Not only is change coming, change is already here. The campaign period has changed our country, and the change is for the worse. His supporters openly and proudly threaten violence against anyone who disagrees with their opinion. There are even reports of others being threatened or harassed in real life simply for harassing other candidates. They either knowingly spread misinformation and half-truths, or can&rsquo;t be bothered to verify the information they&rsquo;re spreading. Forget about being a good example for kids, he&rsquo;s not even a good example for adults.</p>
<p>I know I shouldn&rsquo;t judge other people for the choices they make, but I can&rsquo;t help but be disappointed when people I know come out in support for the man, people who I believe should know better, who should hold better values. I don&rsquo;t understand how they could justify supporting him in spite of his violent rhetoric and the significantly good chance that he&rsquo;s a murderer. It changes how I see these people</p>
<p>I would like to remain hopeful. I would like to hope that one of the other candidates manages some sort of miracle (hopefully of the legal kind) and overcomes the odds. Barring that, I would like to hope that I am wrong about him and that the worst-case scenario does not come to pass. I would like to hope that he would not push our society further in the direction of violence and authoritarianism. I would like to hope that the supporters do not become even more insufferable in the wake of victory. I would like to hope that we can move past the level of vitriol and toxicity throughout this campaign peri</p>

<div class="content p-summary">
This has been one of the most divisive and shenanigan-filled election campaign seasons ever, and politics is normally crazy in this country so that&rsquo;s saying something. There&rsquo;s a strong use of social media this time around, and it&rsquo;s led to the internet being a hotbed of opinions and propaganda and memes and lies and half-truths and threats of violence. I was hoping greater citizen involvement via social media and the debates would mean citizens have more information and thus would get to be more discerning, but it seems that things have only gotten worse.

<p>I&rsquo;m 37, thanks for saying na bata pa ako.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re saying is that it takes more than 3 terms to make things better in the long term right? Kung magsalita kasi si Mayor parang isang pitik nya lang maayos na lahat e. In 3-6 months nga mawawala na ang krimen. Pagkahalal nga nya kakausapin nya lang ang senado&rsquo;t kongreso ng kung anong gusto nyang batas, in one week meron na agad</p>

His son Paolo is the Vice Mayor. And his daughter in law is city councilor. Why do people think he is the CHANGE candidate?&#39; on /r/Philippines</a>:

<div class="content e-content">

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a testament to how poor his management of Davao City actually was that he goes away for 3 years and things go to shit. Good management means things get better regardless of who is in power, which means strengthening institutions. If Davao City goes to shit whenever he&rsquo;s not mayor, what happens to Davao City when he dies?</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s one of those guys who works hard but isn&rsquo;t too noisy, so people don&rsquo;t really have strong opinions about him either way.</p>
<p>He only really got involved in government service in the 90s, before that it was mostly business.</p>
<p>His martial law experience (from wikipedia):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a son of Marcos&rsquo; political rival, Osmeña was imprisoned in 1972. In November 1974, he embarked on a hunger strike along with his cellmate &ndash; ABS-CBN&rsquo;s Eugenio &ldquo;Geny&rdquo; Lopez, Jr. &ndash; to protest the unjust detention of thousands of innocent Filipinos. This resulted in the release of 1,022 political prisoners in December 1974. Defiant to the very end, Osmeña and Lopez escaped from their maximum security prison cell in Fort Bonifacio in 1977. This exploit was enacted in the 1995 movie, Eskapo.</p>

<p>This was for the Dacer-Corbito double murder case. He was cleared of it by the SC in 2011 so he was able to return home.</p>
<p>However, I think it speaks a bit ill of him that he chose to evade the law until he was cleared. (I guess some would say it&rsquo;s justifiable given our justice system, but as a lawmaker and police officer maybe he should be one of the first to abide by the rules)</p>

<p>The first post remains neutral. The additional info I put in a separate post. I only put cons here because that&rsquo;s the info I have. The whole point of the exercise is for people to provide any info they have also, so if you have additional info (whether pro or con), you can comment them also.</p>

[2021.04.08] This was originally a huge reddit thread where I had more than 100 comments, which resulted in so many posts to this site. I decided to merge most of the top level content into this large single post.
Posted on r/Philippines: 2016 Senatorial Candidates Information Megathread Hello /r/Philippines!

<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s already an abundance of information on the presidential candidates. People just need to decide which flaws they are willing to overlook. That being said, I do have a spreadsheet I&rsquo;ve been using to help decide, but it is quite specific to my own stand on the issues. If you are still undecided you may find it useful: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MTPMAhGCiG_7jWC0vLNnJNQLPXGbBBLlfHri8-RqgaI/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MTPMAhGCiG_7jWC0vLNnJNQLPXGbBBLlfHri8-RqgaI/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>For VP, I have no inputs as I have already made my choice.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>This thread is great because I knew nothing about this guy except the positives spreading on social media, and now I know he&rsquo;s anti-RH, strongly religious, etc</p>
<p>How about we have similar threads for each of the other 50 senatoriables? Some of them are hard to find info on</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<blockquote>
<p>Tanggalin ang LAPIDA or Liberalization, Privitization, and Deregulation of social services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which social services are currently in the most need of these changes? Isn&rsquo;t it a problem that the government has insufficient resources to provide social services which is why some need to be augmented by the private sector? Also, how does that acronym even make sense</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mass-oriented, nationalist, and scientific education system</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What exactly does mass-oriented mean here? Does nationalist mean dapat may communist propaganda sa curriculum?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Address the landlessness of many farmers by enacting GARB or Genuine Agrarian Reform</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t the movement have lawmaker allies? Have they introduced any legislation towards this end?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pantay na karapatan sa mga kababaihan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which rights specifically are a problem right now? I understand that society still doesn&rsquo;t treat women equally, but that seems to me to be primarily a cultural problem and not of policy. I mean, in terms of policy I believe women already basically share the same rights as men in this country (suffrage, etc). There are probably still some outliers, but maybe not being a woman I&rsquo;m not aware</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More investments ng gobyerno sa scientific sector</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this something the movement is a strong advocate of? I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever heard of NPA spokespersons discussing this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So far yan lang ang nakikita ko.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are your personal suggestions right? Is there nothing like a central leadership that establishes such policies? Like some sort of quarterly announcement &ldquo;Guys, eto yung mga gusto natin mangyari ok?&rdquo;</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/4bihe9/hello_rphilippines_im_an_npa_rebel_ama/d1a17rd/">a comment by NPAofMNL on &#39;Hello, r/Philippines! I&#39;m an NPA rebel. AMA.&#39; on /r/Philippines</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<blockquote>
<p>After the socialist revolution, which comes after enacting genuine national democracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What exactly does that mean? No propaganda BS. Like if someone came up to your leadership and said, sige ano yung top 10 action items na kelangan gawin para matapos na ito?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The business investments themselves are taking advantage of the workforce surplus in an impoverished setting through cheap labor. Papasok diyan yung &ldquo;at least [insert statement here]. We should not settle for less. As Filipino citizens, we should be entitled to the same rights and opportunities, regardless of socio-economic status.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, what exactly does that mean? What exactly should a business be doing to not be victimized by the NPA? If ako business owner ako, and I want to bring jobs to the people, why should I bother going to regions where there is a strong NPA presence?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That I don&rsquo;t know. Sa unit ko, walang ganyan. Cliche na pero, each unit in different areas operate independently from one another, so kung majajustify nila yun, sila na yun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please find someone who can answer, that would be great</p>
