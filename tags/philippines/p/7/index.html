<p>I&rsquo;m really only looking forward to this so that the series can finally end. I&rsquo;ve been reading this series for almost two decades, stuck through it when it was draggy just for the heck of it. I can barely remember any of the things that happened in the middle books. If I had time I&rsquo;d reread them all again before the last book comes out but meh, what can you do. There better be a damn good ending!</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/14ju9f/is_pacquiao_loss_a_big_deal_amongst_filipinos/">&#39;Is Pacquiao loss a big deal amongst Filipinos?  Let&#39;s hear your say on it.&#39; on /r/Philippines</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>For me it&rsquo;s not. I haven&rsquo;t really cared about Pacquiao that much; I&rsquo;m not the type of person that would be proud of someone just because we randomly happened to be born in the same country.</p>
<p>That being said, he really should have quit his game when he went into politics. His being in politics annoys me more than this loss.</p>
<p>Fun story, I was playing a game on my PC (Saints Row the Third if you&rsquo;re curious) and my dad was like &ldquo;Wala pa bang balita kay Pacquiao&rdquo;, and I was like &ldquo;nagstart na ba? I&rsquo;ll check later&rdquo;, but by the time I was finished playing (about 2 hours later) the fight was already done. Lol hindi ko man lang naramdaman. How long did that fight last anyway</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>It&rsquo;s actually worse during mornings at North EDSA, since the mass of people there trying to get into the station reaches all the way to the ground level at EDSA itself, sometimes extending maybe a quarter of a kilometer on either side (thankfully, the cops keep them on the sidewalk and don&rsquo;t let them spill out onto the road itself anymore)</p>
<p>No one likes riding the MRT, far too overcrowded. I support raising the fares because (a) I don&rsquo;t want to subsidize this shit and (b) hopefully we either get more trains or less people riding due to higher fares (kinda antipoor I know, but there you go)</p>

Time for some Monday morning quarterbacking!
Disclaimer: I Am Not A Lawyer. I&rsquo;m just a guy with opinions. And you know what they say about opinions&hellip;
Today, the Philippine Senate has impeached the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court by a vote of 20 to 3.
I&rsquo;ve generally kept silent about the CJ trial, mainly because I know people who are rabidly pro-Corona and I don&rsquo;t feel like getting into an argument with someone who&rsquo;s obviously biased (I&rsquo;m sorry my friends, we are going to have to agree to disagree now).

<p>Yeah, I was having a discussion about it with some friends just this week about how our prices and ISPs are generally terrible here compared to nearby countries such as HK and SG. Understandably, those guys are way ahead of us economically, so I guess the comms infrastructure comes into play when determining our broadband costs, but still the difference is like the gulf between the earth and the sun, it&rsquo;s really hard to find it justifiable.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Most Filipinos already speak English, I don&rsquo;t think there will be a big enough market (there are too many people here who can teach English). Although there are also a lot of Koreans who come here to learn English, so I dunno. Shrug. Your best bet might be English accent training for call centers (locals can&rsquo;t compete with a native American English speaker in this field) OR teaching at international schools (they may prefer expats)</p>
<p>Haha sorry for not being very helpful.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>No offense, but you were probably applying for the wrong companies (obvious if you consider they have some sort of padrino system), either that or you were aiming for jobs you werent qualified for. Not only have i found my current job without any sort of connections, i do not personally know anyone who needed connections to land their job. I&rsquo;ve also interviewed dozens of applicants for entry level positions, everytime i had to fail an applicant it was because he didnt have the talent we needed, connections never came into play.</p>

For President, I&rsquo;m voting Dick Gordon, because I believe that the Philippines should be a meritocracy where people are chosen as leaders based on the strength of their accomplishments and qualifications.
For Vice President, I&rsquo;m voting for Mar Roxas, as he&rsquo;s simply the most qualified and with the strongest history of government service. The E-VAT thing is actually a plus for him, as it shows he has the capacity to make difficult decisions if needed.

If Cory Aquino ever went out in public without wearing bright yellow clothes, would people recognize her?

<p>Given what today is, I thought it would be a good idea to say a few words on the current brouhaha. Instead of just enjoying the holiday watching DVDs that is.</p>
<p>Just something I posted on a certain mailing list a few days ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I find it hard to believe that ousting GMA now would lead to any true change. We&rsquo;ve seen what the countless political episodes have exposed: corruption at almost every level of government, both the executive and legislative branches beholden to bribery and extortion. The problems in our government are systemic in nature, and it would take more than the ouster of a single person to effect any meaningful change. Even if we were to find someone *with good intentions* to replace the president, he&rsquo;s still likely to be swallowed up by the system.</p>

I don&rsquo;t particularly care one way or another whether Gloria falls out of power or not. I suspect a lot of people don&rsquo;t. And a lot of people probably don&rsquo;t give a hoot about Trillianes either. I am however of the opinion that he is an idiot.
What exactly did he hope to accomplish yesterday anyway? The only difference between now and Oakwood a few years ago is that since then he&rsquo;s gotten the pity vote to actually be able to call himself a senator.

When you get off at the SM North station, there are always a million people lining up at the entry turnstiles (where you insert your ticket before exiting the station). The outermost lines are always the slowest ones, because effectively three to four lines of people are trying to use that line. To save time, instead use one of the innermost lines.

Ban the distribution of sample ballots and election paraphernalia on election day within the vicinity of voting precincts. Seriously, check out the amount of trash generated on election day near the precinct:  
And I noted that the current level of trash is already an improvement from last year!
In Quezon City at least, the local government seems to have been able to keep people from plastering campaign posters all over the place (relatively), so banning campaign materials on election day should not be too much of a stretch.

I still don&rsquo;t know how I am voting on Monday.
Or even if I am voting at all.
I&rsquo;m thinking of voting for those 3 guys from Kapatiran, simply to reward the sheer chutzpah of their candidacies.
The GO and TU coalitions seem largely irrelevant to me, you can be fairly sure those coalitions won&rsquo;t mean squat after the elections, so all these surveys keeping score of administration vs opposition seem a bit useless.

So, I was there in the taxi with my youngest brother Brian. And I brought up the topic of the noontime TV show Wowowee, which we had just seen about half an hour of before we got in the taxi.
I told him that I thought of it as a really terrible show. Sure, poor people win relatively-large cash prizes and stuff from it, but it feels so exploitative. Hundreds, maybe thousands of poor folk from god-knows-how-far-away queue up outside the studios every day hoping to get into the studio audience to participate in the cash giveaways.

Like a howling banshee, typhoon Milenyo tore through most of Metro Manila last Thursday, leaving chaos and devastation in its&rsquo; wake. The Philippine Star&rsquo;s headline was most apt: ‘Milenyo&rsquo; shuts down Metro. Literally. Most places in Luzon lost power before noon of Thursday, owing to ravaged electrical transmission lines and substations. As of last night, at most 60% of areas have had power restored. Luckily it included both my place of work and place of residence, as losing access to electricity makes me feel like a peon in the dark ages.

I read this awesome article on driving in Taiwan , apparently written by an American living in Taiwan. Lots of pictures, and very descriptive.
I suppose any foreigners coming to the Philippines would say that the situation in Metro Manila is pretty much the same as the one outlined in the article, but after I read it I can&rsquo;t help but feel that it&rsquo;s just a little bit worse over there.

Lest I be accused of avoiding the real world by writing about TV shows while events start to unfold which may or may not plunge our nation into chaos, I suppose I should put my two cents into the matter. For those who read this text in the future at a time when all these links are broken, the current President of the Phillipines, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has declared a state of national emergency today, claiming that a broad alliance encompassing traditional oppostion groups and the far left and the far right are trying to bring her down.

pamie.com: Open Up and Say Yumburger.
Awesome, awesome blog post about some &ldquo;Ugly Americans&rdquo; and their um&hellip; &ldquo;unique&rdquo; experience dining at Jollibee. Highlights the world of difference between the American palette and the Filipino one. While they make a good point that Jollibee is the &ldquo;crappy burger joint food&rdquo; of the Philippines as compared to McDonald&rsquo;s which is the &ldquo;crappy burger joint food&rdquo; of the US, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever heard any Filipino reference Jollibee food in any such disparaging manner.

In a few months people will forget anyway.
Yesterday 74 people died in a tragic stampede.
The reason? Crowding to get into the one-year anniversary show of a local noontime variety show. Wowowee.
This is ridiculous, an obvious barometer showing how desperate many of our countrymen have become. The show was offering prizes in the form of raffle draws and contests, and many were hoping to win a house and lot or at least some cash to help them get by.

I&rsquo;m no music critic; often I can&rsquo;t even carry my own tune. But I do know what I like, and I know I like the Eraserheads&rsquo; music. If you don&rsquo;t know who the ‘heads are, they&rsquo;re basically the Beatles of the Philippines, galvanizing the local music industry and serving as an example and inspiration to numerous other bands that followed after them. It&rsquo;s only fitting then that many of the current crop of Filipino performers pay tribute to them in the form of Ultraelectromagnetic Jam.

Optical media and the MRT/LRT
I&rsquo;m pretty sure what is described in the above blog post (confiscation of unlabelled optical media from LRT/MRT commuters) is obviously stupid, though probably not illegal. The rail authorities can probably refuse entry to anyone for any reason they consider valid.
It&rsquo;s probably legal, but I doubt it&rsquo;s enforceable though. Anyone who&rsquo;s ridden the MRT during rush hours knows what I&rsquo;m talking about. Security inspections last roughly half a second for every three passengers; the security personnel will simply make a quick pass through your bags with their stick.

RP troop pullout not cowardice, at least not according to Malacanang. The whole world knows by now that the Philippine government has capitulated (or intends to, at least) to the demands of terrorists kidnappers holding Filipino truck driver Angelo dela Cruz hostage.
Even Jay Leno took his shots at our country, with the following quote from opening monologue of Wednesday night, July 14, 2004:
 For the 2nd time in the past few days, a new world record has been set in the 100 meter dash.

&hellip; that disgraceful slow-count of an election canvass that is. I can&rsquo;t help but wonder whether anyone actually bothered to follow the last few days of the canvassing on TV&hellip; I mean, the proceedings are boring as hell! You know what would have been better for the country as a whole? When I saw a small portion of it, the only thing I could think of was that we should have WWE&rsquo;s The Rock on the National Board of Canvassers!
