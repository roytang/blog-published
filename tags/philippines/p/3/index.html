<div class="content e-content">

<p>Putting your picture on your resume when your appearance shouldnt have any effect on the job you&rsquo;re applying for is a silly thing Pinoys do that should end. It contributes to a culture of shallowness where people judge you based on your appearance.</p>
<p>Aside from it being better for society, you would probably not want to work at the sort of places that expect your resume to have a picture.</p>
<p>That being said, if you have any sort of facebook presence, you can be sure you&rsquo;re gonna get online-stalked before any intervieew.</p>

Ever since I came of age, I&rsquo;ve exercised my right (and duty) to vote in every election that comes around. Except for Barangay/SK elections. I&rsquo;ve never voted in Barangay elections.
I understand that voting is a civic duty, and I have no real justification for shirking it. But the fact is that my level of awareness re: barangay-level government is very low. I have no idea what their responsibilities or jurisdiction is supposed to be.

<p>Can you imagine what it was like to be the poor hapless employee who wrote this barely-recognizable-as-English text?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huy, teka ba&rsquo;t ako? Ba&rsquo;t ako magsusulat neto? Wala bang iba? Alam nyo naman mahina ang English ko? Anlaki ng budget natin, wala ba tayong marunong talaga magsulat? Teka lang, wag nyo ko madaliin, kinakabahan ako. Sige na, sige na, susubukan ko. Pano ba dapat to? Wala ba kong makokopyahan? Ngayon lang ba tayo gumawa ng ganitong id? Ano ba dapat nakasulat dito? Kasi naman, ba&rsquo;t ba ako nandito, e sabi ko nung nagapply ako PCSO, hindi PCOO. Eto na, eto na, saglit lang. Ano ba English ng isaoli? May magrereview naman siguro nito ano? Kelangan pa ng pirma ni secretary e, may magsasabi naman siguro kung may mali? Walang sisihan ha, pinipilit nyo ko, e lahat ng pinapanood ko sa tv tagalog, sana pumasa ingles ko. Bakit may pulang underline ito sa Word? Ano ba ibig sabihin nun? Ok ba yun? Sige na, bahala na si Batman, send ko na lang to. May magrereview naman siguro bago iprint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>TRAIN is neutral to okay for the middle class, who get to pay less taxes. Prices will go up, but since they have some discretionary funds to spend, they can simply manage their budget accordingly.</p>
<p>TRAIN is bad for the poor, who weren&rsquo;t paying taxes before anyway. They get no direct benefit, and yet have to suffer higher prices. They already have low discretionary funds to spend, so they have to stretch their budgets further.</p>
<p>TRAIN is a bit bad for the upper class (those who pay the correct taxes at least), but they have wider discretionary budget to spend so they will just pay a little more (or more will be driven to evade taxes completely)</p>
<p>TRAIN is good for the government, since it means more collections and less money spent on enforcement (since taxes on consumption are easier to collect/implement than personal income taxes)</p>
<p>Lastly, TRAIN is very bad for ROHQ employees due to the presidential veto.</p>

<p>Well, if it&rsquo;s true that the new jeeps are more profitable in the long run for the drivers, why do we need to enforce the phaseout? Why not let drivers choose whether to use the old models or the new ones, and let the old model die out naturally to market forces?</p>
<p>I mean, I get all the benefits, but these jeepney drivers don&rsquo;t really earn that much. Anlaki ng cost for them nung new models, so mahihirapan talaga sila if we force them to transition.</p>

Random thoughts while walking at night: The structure of government can be a bit analogous to the structure of a software development project.
The Constitution is like the requirements for a project. It&rsquo;s kind of high-level and (I believe) shouldn&rsquo;t be too detailed. Supposedly the requirements are written by the client. For a country like the Philippines the client is &ldquo;we the sovereign Filipino people&rdquo;.
Slight tangent: I used to know this guy who was one of those rabid &ldquo;we need to amend the constitution&rdquo; types and he asked me to review a &ldquo;mathematical model to track the budget as a function of tax collection and monetary policy&rdquo; that he wanted to include in a proposed new constitution.

"Grabe naman kasi ang ginagawa nyo sa pasahero" (This is too much for the passengers), she said. She was a short, old lady trying to get to the front of the bus so that she could disembark. But like most city buses in Metro Manila during rush hour, the bus was filledto the brim with people, many of them standing tightlypacked in the aisle, holding on to handrails on the bus ceiling or the nearby seats.

<p>I&rsquo;m curious whether this sort of thing is prevalent only in pro-Duterte groups, targetting admin critics. Or meron din sa kabilang side?</p>
<p>Other examples: rumors na nakipagmeet daw si Bam Aquino sa Maute in Marawi, fake Jim Paredes statement calling Mindanaoans &lsquo;taga-bundok&rsquo;, etc.</p>
<p>Edit: to be clear, I&rsquo;m looking for fake memes/quotes/rumors that make the admin look bad</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>I have friends who are faculty on both sides of this issue, but the Engg side seems underrepresented online so I&rsquo;ll present some of their points here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, re: K-12/SHS. The idea is that some of the GE stuff would be covered by the additional two years of senior high school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re: K-12 again, another concern is that with students entering college two years later than before, having a 5 year course would be an unnecessary burden on students (who should already have a more rounded education given the +2 years from senior HS), thus they&rsquo;ve been looking at cutting 5 year courses to 4 years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there seems to be some assertion that the changes are being railroaded, but one of my friends involved with the process (although she was not unable to attend the actual vote on the issue) tells me that they&rsquo;ve been studying the options available for ~2 years now (starting from when K-12 was announced.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand the concern from the humanities side, of course, and the perception that lightening the load will make UP more of a &ldquo;diploma mill&rdquo; (whatever that may imply). Personally, I am not convinced the engineering courses need to be cut to four years. I would prefer they remain appropriately difficult. I do however support the argument that with the +2 years from SHS, we should consider reducing the GE load since this may create redundancy (meaning unnecessary expense) for the students. By how much that load needs to be reduced? ¯\\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯</p>

<p>Ask her why she is so emotional about it.</p>
<p>The Jim Paredes thing was really stupid (although IDK if it&rsquo;s true that he&rsquo;s not a Filipino citizen). He shouldn&rsquo;t have fed the trolls</p>

<p>If you want to shut up the critics of the drug war, all you have to do is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cite the statistics (and where they&rsquo;re sourced from) justifying claims of an epidemic</li>
<li>Tell us what mechanisms you are putting in place to prevent abuse of increased police activity</li>
<li>Tell us what procedures are in place to verify that any kills during police operations are justified</li>
<li>Tell us what mechanisms are available for those falsely placed on drug watchlists or those falsely accused of drug crimes to clear themselves</li>
<li>Give us regular updates on the status of investigations into the spate of homicides particularly those that seem drug-related</li>
<li>Tell us what mechanisms are being put in place to prevent further murders</li>
<li>Take down more of the supply side, i.e. large scale drug busts, top level drug lords, etc</li>
</ol>
<p>Are these suggestions helpful enough?</p>
<p>Instead what we get is:</p>
<ul>
<li>random anecdotes (&ldquo;sabi ng mga lgu madami na daw ulit!&quot;)</li>
<li>blanket statements with nothing to back them up (&ldquo;4M na ang addict! We are observing human rights! We are just doing our jobs&rdquo;), minsan may kasamang iyak</li>
<li>condescending dismissal of any criticism from outside the country (&ldquo;the filipino people support us&rdquo;, &ldquo;you dont know how it is here&rdquo;)</li>
<li>the president backing a team of cops accused of executing a high profile prisoner</li>
<li>the foreign secretary saying critics are just helping criminals (if you&rsquo;re killing them illegally, you&rsquo;re criminals too!)</li>
<li>death penalty rammed down our throats (AFAIK wala pa rin nacite na justifications or studies showing this would be helpful sa prevention, feel free to correct me if wrong)</li>
</ul>
<p>We are even told that drugs are becoming resurgent because tokhang was suspended, e hindi pala effective yung solution nyo so bakit nyo pinagpipilitan? Is the expectation that we should have tokhang forever?</p>
<p>Anlakas magcall for unity tapos critics are either given meaningless patronizing statements or outright dismissed or even bullied. If you want unity, maybe take other people&rsquo;s concerns into account and not just your own.</p>
<p>Last drug war rant since Lent na. After Easter na ulit (or hopefully di na kelangan at that time?)</p>

As of today, our country (The #Blessed Republic of the Philippines) is already at war with:
 Drugs Illegal gambling Communist rebels  Some other things we might consider declaring war on (in no particular order):
 Poverty Ignorance Misinformation (sorry, &ldquo;Alternative facts&rdquo;) Abusive government officials Traffic Rights abuses Pollution High power rates Political dynasties Poor quality of local cinema offerings Politicians putting their names everywhere Internet trolls and bullies Lack of critical thinking Redundancy Overtime without overtime pay Government officials blatantly lying or pulling statistics out of thin air Slow and expensive internet The MRT breaking down Cruelty to animals Poor quality of local anti-piracy ads Jejespeak SMS spam Typhoons Taxis that don&rsquo;t give exact change War Irony Spoilers Pineapples on pizza Poor grammar and/or spelling Hashtags Hypocrisy Multi-level marketing Working at &ldquo;Edi sa puso mo&rdquo; Redundancy Low effort blog posts that start out serious but end up trying a bit too hard to be funny People who don&rsquo;t understand sarcasm People who stand in malls and shove fliers in your face Commenting on posts without reading the actual article Lists that end abruptly at weird numbers so you&rsquo;re not sure if there&rsquo;s more or what

How can we breach the divide?</a></h4>
<p>Edit: By &ldquo;breach the divide&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t really mean persuading others that you are correct, more like trying to find common ground and to learn from each other. At the very least we should be able to agree on certain things like the need to verify information and not simply believe everything we read on the internet or to be respectful to others that hold different opinions, but it seems many people aren&rsquo;t even open to that. It&rsquo;s just frustrating sometimes.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>This reminds me of back when the footbridge near the corner of Commonwealth and Tandang Sora was still under construction. At that time pedestrians could already climb up one side even though it was not yet done, so at one point I saw it and was like &ldquo;cool, may footbridge na pala&rdquo;, went up and got to the halfway point only to find that it didn&rsquo;t reach all the way to the end /glare</p>

<p>D: &ldquo;You want answers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m entitled to them&rdquo;</p>
<p>D: &ldquo;You want answers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want the truth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>D: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t handle the truth! Son, we live in a world that has drugs, and those drugs have to be defeated by men with guns. Who&rsquo;s gonna do it? You? I have a greater responsibility than you could possibly fathom. You weep for the collateral damage and you curse the police. You have that luxury, you have the luxury of not knowing what I know. That the collateral deaths, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and impenetrable to you, saves lives. You don&rsquo;t want the truth because deep down in places you don&rsquo;t talk about at parties, you want me on that wall, you need me on that wall. We use words like slaughter, obosen, killings. We use them as a backbone of a life spent defending something. You use them as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very safety that I provide and then questions the manner in which I provide it. I would rather you just said thank you, and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon, and kill some druggies. Either way, I don&rsquo;t give a damn what you think you are entitled to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you order the extrajudicial killings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>D: &ldquo;I did the job I &ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;DID YOU ORDER THE EXTRAJUDICIAL KILLINGS?&rdquo;</p>
<p>D: &ldquo;YOU&rsquo;RE GODDAMN RIGHT I DID&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Sana may mag act out, with corresponding accent lol)</p>

(Disclaimers: I&rsquo;m not a lawyer or any kind of expert. Understandably, the resource persons may be reluctant to answer some of these in open session, in which case an executive session could be done.

<div class="content e-content">

<p>You know how a lot of Pinoys are so proud of Pacquiao whenever he wins a match - I don&rsquo;t get that. I don&rsquo;t relate to him just because we happened to be born on adjacent chunks of land. I had no hand in his upbringing or victories. He and I are around roughly the same age, but I doubt we had very similar experiences in life</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably different in a country like the US where they have some notion of what it means to &ldquo;be an American&rdquo;. Here in the Philippines, I don&rsquo;t think there is any such notion. I don&rsquo;t know what it means to &ldquo;be a Filipino&rdquo;. We aren&rsquo;t really that united in terms of culture and we don&rsquo;t have a strong national identity that all of us can rally around.</p>
<p>Maybe in the end our own diversity can be good for us too, as it means we aren&rsquo;t constrained or tied to a single point of view but are able to work with a veritable melting pot of different cultures and dialects and what-not. Maybe this is what it means to be a Filipino. Maybe this is what it means to be human</p>
