            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.insider.com/rep-eric-swalwell-says-gop-representatives-like-wwe-wrestlers-2021-7&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; about how a US Democratic representative says his Republican colleagues are like WWE wrestlers (excuse me, they&amp;rsquo;re called &amp;ldquo;Superstars&amp;rdquo;) who behave differently in private versus in public. Basically their politics are performative, they act a certain way in public to appeal to their bases, but in private they don&amp;rsquo;t actually really believe in many of the things they say in public. It speaks to a certain lack of integrity and deceptiveness. It&amp;rsquo;s the kind of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/09/lying-and-salesmanship/&#34;&gt;laying and salesmanship&lt;/a&gt; that I really dislike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading this article reminded me of supporters praising Duterte back during the 2016 campaign (or even until now) because he is a &lt;em&gt;totoong tao&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. an authentic person). I guess it&amp;rsquo;s kind of appealing to people who are sick and tired of two-faced performative politics, such that they applaud his &amp;ldquo;authenticity&amp;rdquo; even when he says terrible things in public. It&amp;rsquo;s the same thing for people who support Trump because he &amp;ldquo;tells it like it is&amp;rdquo;, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a weird kind of &amp;ldquo;authenticity&amp;rdquo; because Duterte is actually two-faced in public as well. There&amp;rsquo;s his formal &amp;ldquo;good Duterte&amp;rdquo; version where he pays lip service to human rights and being a decent human being, then there&amp;rsquo;s his ranting extemporaneous vindictive mode where he&amp;rsquo;s cussing everybody, making misogynistic jokes, threatening and/or admitting murder or other crimes, etc. I agree that this is probably &amp;ldquo;authentic&amp;rdquo; to who he is in real life, as in, he is probably two-faced in real life as well, saying what he thinks his current audience wants to hear. I assume Trump is the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think their supporters think their being two-faced in public is &amp;ldquo;authentic&amp;rdquo; because they assume people/politicians are naturally like this and people like Duterte are just showing their true selves in public. At the same time other politicians who always present in public as &amp;ldquo;decent&amp;rdquo; (a term that one would assume to be universally accepted as positive, but has been degraded by negative propaganda) are rejected as &amp;ldquo;plastic&amp;rdquo; because people assume they just behave just as badly as Duterte in person/private? It&amp;rsquo;s like they don&amp;rsquo;t believe good people can exist. This is my same reaction whenever someone is criticized for &amp;ldquo;virtue signaling&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s kind of a similar thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look at politicians like the Vice-President Leni Robredo, whose public image is generally both decent and competent and may or may not run for President next year, with cautious optimism. We can&amp;rsquo;t really know what public personalities are like in person since we aren&amp;rsquo;t in their inner circles, but I think in generally, we should at least prefer politicians with good public images, instead of praising someone who behaves badly in public as &amp;ldquo;authentic&amp;rdquo;. After all, no matter how they behave in private, it&amp;rsquo;s their public actions and statements that are more likely to affect society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Obviously, I don&amp;rsquo;t approve of presenting as good/decent to hide bad/illegal activities, but absent such problems, I think it&amp;rsquo;s fine to be cautiously optimistic about people&amp;rsquo;s good nature.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This felt a bit ranty. Kind of like Duterte. I&amp;rsquo;m like this in person too, if you&amp;rsquo;re curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/1269550611659292672/&#34;&gt;When someone tells you who they are, believe them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s August!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-quote&#34;&gt;A quote:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: there is no real life. There is no full, meaningful, &amp;ldquo;best life.&amp;rdquo; There are, at best, more and less meaningful pursuits, from your perspective, based on your upbringing, imprinting, and your own specific cocktail of longings. It is natural for us to feel anxiety about how we spend our limited time. No matter how happy you convince yourself to be, you will sometimes feel the vague ache of other possible lives.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/berkun/status/758664382867832832&#34;&gt;SandwichBear via Amy Hoy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some good news for the country last Monday, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philstar.com/business/2021/07/28/2115647/president-dutertes-last-sona&#34;&gt;the old man&amp;rsquo;s last SONA&lt;/a&gt; (where I heard he spent more time talking up China than discussing the pandemic response). The good news was actually that the country &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/1419655504289095688/&#34;&gt;finally got an Olympic gold via champion weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz&lt;/a&gt;, after we some commentators described our country during the opening ceremony as having the dubious distinction of having won the most Olympic medals without a gold. Additionally, a couple of our boxers are still in the running for another gold, currently guaranteed a silver and a bronze each. Go sports!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that the delta variant is here, on Thursday the IATF announced that &lt;a href=&#34;https://pia.gov.ph/news/2021/07/29/ncr-to-remain-under-gcq-with-heightened-restrictions&#34;&gt;NCR would be on &amp;ldquo;GCQ with heightened restrictions&amp;rdquo; up to Aug 15&lt;/a&gt;, despite calls for a &amp;ldquo;circuit breaker&amp;rdquo; lockdown to face the delta threat. Not 24 hours later, they changed their mind and said &lt;a href=&#34;https://pia.gov.ph/news/2021/07/30/ncr-to-be-placed-under-ecq-starting-aug-6&#34;&gt;the NCR will undergo the stricter ECQ lockdown starting Aug 06&lt;/a&gt;. I suppose we should be happy they flip-flopped reasonably quickly? As is typical for the pandemic response so far, we still don&amp;rsquo;t have a clear idea what specifically this new season of ECQ will entail and whether or not there will be ayuda for the poor.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2008: I bought a cellphone with my own money for the first time. It was a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2009/08/3067225022/&#34;&gt;Nokia 5800&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;; My favorite sketch this week was this Roy Mustang one I did early in the week:&lt;/li&gt;

I enjoyed this one and liked how it turned out, but it took me over an hour because I was playing with various #Procreate tools and brushes. Here&amp;rsquo;s a timelapse: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOYUkG1ac38&#34; title=&#34;Roy Mustang #sketchdaily 205/365

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/reviews-casino-gunpowder-halloween-masters/&#34;&gt;Casino Royale (2006), Gunpowder Milkshake (2021), Batman the Long Halloween (2021)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During this week&amp;rsquo;s Saturday gaming session we did a rewatch of &lt;strong&gt;Mortal Kombat (1995)&lt;/strong&gt;, a fitting followup to our rewatch of &lt;strong&gt;Street Fighter&lt;/strong&gt; a couple of weeks ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TV: Here&amp;rsquo;s the review for &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/reviews-casino-gunpowder-halloween-masters/#masters-of-the-universe-revelation-season-1-part-1&#34;&gt;Masters of the Universe: Revelation (season 1 part 1)&lt;/a&gt;. I also watched the new season of &lt;strong&gt;The Movies That Made Us&lt;/strong&gt; on Netflix; not much commentary needed here, but I really enjoy learning about the ins and outs of movie production and how movies can sometimes take years to get off the ground, even before filming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;m close to completing all the &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn (PS4)&lt;/strong&gt; Frozen Wilds quests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding matches on &lt;strong&gt;Guilty Gear Strive&lt;/strong&gt; has gotten a bit more difficult lately. I think it&amp;rsquo;s mostly because I got promoted to a higher floor? A new DLC fighter came out last week though, so hopefully that means a resurgence of players?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went ahead and bought &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/1420071833718591489/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Steam! I did a Let&amp;rsquo;s Play + commentary with some friends for the first hour or so of the game: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jAUOpQUO4&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jAUOpQUO4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magic Arena:&lt;/strong&gt; Still drafting the latest MTG set &lt;strong&gt;Adventures in the Forgotten Realms&lt;/strong&gt; on Magic Arena, you can follow via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgafr&#34;&gt;MTGAFR tag&lt;/a&gt;. I managed a couple of quick drafts this week, one of them a 7-winner! I may end up wrapping up the AFR run this coming week because on the 12th we&amp;rsquo;re getting Jumpstart Historic Horizons which was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ign.com/articles/jumpstart-historic-horizons-spoilers-mtg-arena-digital-only-card-reveal-details&#34;&gt;just unveiled last week&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;ll probably want to focus on collecting that. There&amp;rsquo;s also a Standard Open going on this weekend, and I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/08/1421693688900505603/&#34;&gt;somehow managed to qualify for Day 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I managed to hit both Mythic on Arena and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/1421158845007634433/&#34;&gt;Masters on Eternal&lt;/a&gt; this past month, a feat I haven&amp;rsquo;t managed to do in a while!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular Saturday group played some &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/blood-rage/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/a&gt; again, as usual. I just keep copying this sentence over from previous weeks lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A friend has been trying to convince me to get the just-released &lt;strong&gt;Orcs Must Die 3&lt;/strong&gt; on Steam, but I complained that we haven&amp;rsquo;t even finished our long-running coop run of &lt;strong&gt;Orcs Must Die 2&lt;/strong&gt; yet, so we did just that this weekend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: Mostly just comics again this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No quiz night this past week, just the usual NY Times crosswords and spelling bee with the trivia team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;August is fairly stacked, and that kicks off this week with James Gunn&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/strong&gt;, which should be out by Friday. Despite being an MCU fanboy, this is the superhero movie I&amp;rsquo;ve most been looking forward to this year!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also some &lt;strong&gt;Street Fighter V&lt;/strong&gt; reveals/updates &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/StreetFighter/status/1420384085302730753&#34;&gt;slated for Aug 3&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not playing the game regularly anymore, but I am willing to be sucked back in, especially since the upcoming DLC character Akira is a favorite of mine from Rival Schools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;a-quote&#34;&gt;A quote:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I just wanna keep being proof that good people with no hidden agendas still exist in this world.&amp;rdquo; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/diorkenn/status/1416160966560161792/&#34;&gt;@diorkenn on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This past week in Metro Manila was very cold and rainy, which came with the attendant problems like flooding and such. There&amp;rsquo;s a typhoon nearby, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s in the PAR; instead it&amp;rsquo;s just doing this thing where &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/07/21/news/pagasa-habagat-causing-rainin-metro-manila-parts-of-ph/1807856&#34;&gt;it drags in rains and winds via the Habagat monsoon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/7/16/Delta-variant-Philippines-local-transmission-COViD-19.html&#34;&gt;feared delta variant is here in the PH&lt;/a&gt; and has been since May. The DOH &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/7/22/DOH-confirms-Delta-variant-local-transmission.html&#34;&gt;confirms local transmission&lt;/a&gt;. And the response in Metro Manila is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/7/23/NCR-4-other-provinces-GCQ-with-heightened-restrictions-until-July-31.html&#34;&gt;to revert back to &amp;ldquo;GCQ with heightened restrictions&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. For only a week? Seems super optimistic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local food delivery app FoodPanda is in a bit of a PR crisis after suspending some drivers for protesting. Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/roycanivel_inq/status/1416922167896203272&#34;&gt;a twitter thread about it.&lt;/a&gt; Some lawmakers are already calling for investigations into whether local food delivery drivers should be treated as employees and given benefits, which this level of control certainly implies. We&amp;rsquo;ll see if that goes anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internationally: The 2020 Olympics held their opening ceremony this past weekend. Yes, that is surprisingly still on, in spite of (waves arms around) all of this. Gamers everywhere were surprised to hear &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tokyo-2020-olympics-opening-ceremony-uses-video-game-music-for-team-entrances/1100-6494313/&#34;&gt;some of their favorite video game soundtracks during the opening ceremony&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Because as long as you have advertising, you have this perverse incentive to make it manipulative. You can’t have a behavior-modification machine with advertisers and have anything ethical; it’s not possible. You could get away with it barely with television because television wasn’t as effective at modifying people. But this, there’s no ethical way to have advertising.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2019: Jonathan Hickman took over the X-Men books with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/07/186514742325/&#34;&gt;House of X #1&lt;/a&gt;! Can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s been two years of this Krakoa Kraziness!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2018: The last time I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgnats2018/&#34;&gt;managed to participate in the MTG PH Nationals&lt;/a&gt;. Not sure if I&amp;rsquo;ll ever get that deep into paper Magic again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2007: Inmates at a Cebu prison went viral &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMnk7lh9M3o&#34;&gt;for performing the &amp;ldquo;Thriller&amp;rdquo; music video&lt;/a&gt; (I&amp;rsquo;m surprised this has survived all these years without being DMCA&amp;rsquo;ed or whatever)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the annoying thing about all this rainy weather we&amp;rsquo;ve been having is that I don&amp;rsquo;t get to go out on my daily walks. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried doing some time on the stationary bike instead, but I am much less inclined to do that (it&amp;rsquo;s more boring!), so less exercise for me this week overall. I should try to do the bike thing while watching TV stuff maybe?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;; As it usually happens, I am behind by a couple of sketches during the weekend. I think part of it is because the Friday prompt &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/SketchDaily/&#34;&gt;on the subreddit&lt;/a&gt; is always free draw, and I&amp;rsquo;m often too lazy to think something up, so I get blocked. Anyway, I used up one of this week&amp;rsquo;s daily sketches to participate in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tumindig&#34;&gt;#Tumindig&lt;/a&gt; thing on Twitter:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/dad-aotd-vatcoatp-omelas/&#34;&gt;Die Another Day (2002), Army of the Dead (2021), Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During this week&amp;rsquo;s Saturday gaming session we managed to watch &lt;strong&gt;Gunpowder Milkshake (2021)&lt;/strong&gt;. Will include a review in my next &amp;ldquo;Reviews&amp;rdquo; post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TV: Finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/dad-aotd-vatcoatp-omelas/&#34;&gt;Superstore season 5&lt;/a&gt;. Also, Ted Lasso season 2 &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/1418852829381337088/#superstore-season-5&#34;&gt;has started&lt;/a&gt;! I had also forgotten that &lt;strong&gt;Masters of the Universe: Revelation&lt;/strong&gt; is out on Netflix this weekend, we ended up binging it during the Saturday gaming session as well, so I&amp;rsquo;ll also include it in the next reviews post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still the usual regular games &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Guilty Gear Strive&lt;/strong&gt;. Been trying to start some new games like &lt;strong&gt;Avadon the Black Fortress&lt;/strong&gt;, but nothing has stuck yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still drafting the latest MTG set &lt;strong&gt;Adventures in the Forgotten Realms&lt;/strong&gt; on Magic Arena, you can follow via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgafr&#34;&gt;MTGAFR tag&lt;/a&gt;. I only managed one (terrible) draft this week though, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if we can get more done next week since there&amp;rsquo;ll be Quick Drafts available now. Instead, I seem to be doing well in constructed this month! I managed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/1416936573212389378/&#34;&gt;hit Mythic early&lt;/a&gt;, and then the next day I managed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/1417339197384323075/&#34;&gt;win the Standard challenge&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular Saturday group played some &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/blood-rage/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/a&gt; again, as usual. I just keep copying this sentence over from previous weeks lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finally managed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/1418849098460016643/&#34;&gt;win a game of Advance Wars By Web&lt;/a&gt;! It was a three-way free-for-all game so it took a while with a lot of back and forth. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit worried about this web-based game because it&amp;rsquo;s obviously not licensed by Nintendo and it keeps running into server issues, so it might not be long for this world lol. But I am grateful for the chance to play some Advance Wars again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: Mostly just comics again this week, but I did mange to read &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/dad-aotd-vatcoatp-omelas/#the-ones-who-walk-away-from-omelas-by-ursula-k-le-guin&#34;&gt;The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas by Ursula K. Le Guin&lt;/a&gt;, which is much more of a short story than a book, but I&amp;rsquo;ll count it in my &amp;ldquo;books read for 2021&amp;rdquo; anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oh, we joined an online quiz night this week, it was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/PopQuizPH/&#34;&gt;PopQuizPH&lt;/a&gt; fifth anniversary game! We actually did fairly well, ending up in a triple tie for first place, but the tiebreaker was about local actress Jolina Magdangal and we were terrible at it, so we finished the night in third place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition, the trivia team is still enjoying the NY Times crosswords and spelling bee, which we now regularly do on the weekends whether there is a quiz night or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s the last week of July! Supposedly we are getting the &lt;strong&gt;Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&lt;/strong&gt; on Steam this week, as it says it&amp;rsquo;s releasing July 2021, but we don&amp;rsquo;t have a definite release date yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our erstwhile president is delivering his last SONA tomorrow. I kind of want to unplug from social media for the day mostly because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear about his nonsense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;; As is typical, I&amp;rsquo;m behind by a couple of days again. I liked this sketch I did of the Cantina band (or part of them at least):&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Actually managed to watch a fair amount of movies this week!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James Bond run continues with Brosnan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/wine-barry-loki/&#34;&gt;The World is Not Enough (1999)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The watch-along movie during this week&amp;rsquo;s Saturday gaming session was one of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/10/my-top-10-favorite-movies-of-all-time/&#34;&gt;my all-time favorites&lt;/a&gt;: Street Fighter the Movie (1994). Still super quotable!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TV: Watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/wine-barry-loki/&#34;&gt;Barry season 1 and of course the Loki season 1 finale&lt;/a&gt;. Also started watching &lt;strong&gt;Superstore&lt;/strong&gt; season 5, since I saw it&amp;rsquo;s on Prime Video now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still playing &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Guilty Gear Strive&lt;/strong&gt; regularly. Also decided to revive my &lt;strong&gt;Wasteland 2&lt;/strong&gt; save for some reason. Also woke up my &lt;strong&gt;Disgaea 4 (Vita)&lt;/strong&gt; save game since I had to wait in a corridor for a while during an errand this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still drafting the latest MTG set &lt;strong&gt;Adventures in the Forgotten Realms&lt;/strong&gt; on Magic Arena, you can follow via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgafr&#34;&gt;MTGAFR tag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular Saturday group played some &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/blood-rage/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/a&gt; again, as usual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some friends got me into playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://awbw.amarriner.com/&#34;&gt;this web-based version of Advance Wars&lt;/a&gt;, which hopefully Nintendo takes a while to notice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: No books this week, mostly just comics. Yet again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No online quiz night for the trivia team this week, we just indulged ourselves with the NY Times crossword and spelling bee again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Huh no big events coming up, maybe I can actually get some stuff done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You are the books you read the films you watch, the music you listen to, the people you meet, the dreams you have, the conversations you engage in. You are what you take from these. You are the sound of the ocean, the breath of fresh air, the brightest light and the darkest corner. You are a collective of every experience you have had in your life. You are every single second of every single day. So drown yourself in a sea of knowledge and existence. Let the words run through your veins and let the colours fill your mind.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Jac Vanek&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2014: We &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2014/07/10153077595843912-0/&#34;&gt;bought a Nintendo console&lt;/a&gt; again after more than a decade!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HELTH&lt;/strong&gt;: Had a bit of a scare early in the week, as I ran a fever starting from Sunday evening. Pre-pandemic, it&amp;rsquo;s nothing I&amp;rsquo;d just take some biogesic and sleep it off, but now we have to worry about Covid. To be sure, I had an RT-PCR swab test taken by Monday lunch time. My brother and his family had passed by the house Sunday morning and we hung out a bit outside shooting the breeze, so aside from the seniors I live with, I was worried for them, so the test was mostly to be sure and for peace of mind. I thought the test itself would be uncomfortable, but it was super quick, swab went in and out once per nostril, then one more in the throat. It was a bit pricey, as someone comes to your home to do it, but the results came quickly, got the NEGATIVE result the next morning. Hugh sigh of relief. By then my fever had gone down. I self-isolated for a couple more days just to be sure. Am completely fine now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote a bunch of words on the blog this week. Other than the usual media reviews, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/comsat-and-compshops/&#34;&gt;this post on Compshop culture in the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/on-being-president/&#34;&gt;some commentary on what it takes to be President of this country&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;; Nothing I&amp;rsquo;m too proud of this week, kind of phoned in a lot of them. Here&amp;rsquo;s Squeeks from &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/2789a7cda3fd16feca84b58fae45811b/&#34;&gt;Transformers: The Last Knight&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;








    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Actually managed to watch a fair amount of movies this week!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James Bond run continues into the Brosnan era with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/goldeneye/&#34;&gt;Goldeneye (1995)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/tomorrow-never-dies/&#34;&gt;Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/black-widow/&#34;&gt;Black Widow&lt;/a&gt; came out this week of course, bringing the MCU back to the movies. Linked review starts spoiler-free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched some dumb movies (&lt;strong&gt;America the Motion Picture (2021)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Ice Road (2021)&lt;/strong&gt;) &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/saturday-10-movies/&#34;&gt;during the Saturday gaming watchalong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not much TV this week apparently. Still keeping up with Flash, Rick and Morty, Loki. Mildly annoyed that Loki has one episode to go and we still don&amp;rsquo;t have any real idea who the big bad is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduced gaming a bit during the few days I was sick, but I did resume &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Guilty Gear Strive&lt;/strong&gt; towards the end of the week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latest MTG set &lt;strong&gt;Adventures in the Forgotten Realms&lt;/strong&gt; has dropped on Magic Arena! I&amp;rsquo;ve started streaming drafts as usual, you can follow via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgafr&#34;&gt;MTGAFR tag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also thinking of streaming some non-MTG Steam games next week, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if that pushes through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular Saturday group played some &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/blood-rage/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/a&gt; again, as usual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steam Sale ended without me taking any damage! Also, I think I&amp;rsquo;m pausing this month&amp;rsquo;s Humble Choice again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: No books this week, mostly just comics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No online quiz night for the trivia team this week, we just indulged ourselves with the NY Times crossword and spelling bee again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loki season finale!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;During a company holiday party in the mid-2000s our theme was &amp;ldquo;statement shirts&amp;rdquo; and I decided to jokingly go with a somewhat tight-fitting purple shirt with the caption &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;ROY TANG FOR PRESIDENT&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;








  




&lt;a href=&#34;#22451104b998a7054a48115679501f63-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/on-being-president/DSC02047_hufdda2f4c8c6905ef8cb86c69586b0853_430961_300x0_resize_q75_box.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;I&amp;#39;m not even running yet and I already have opposition!&#34; title=&#34;I&amp;#39;m not even running yet and I already have opposition!&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not even running yet and I already have opposition! (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;22451104b998a7054a48115679501f63-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/on-being-president/DSC02047.JPG&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not even running yet and I already have opposition!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;8 Jul 2021 11:33am&#34;&gt;8 Jul 2021 11:33am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This was the best picture of the shirt I could find; It&amp;rsquo;s probably still in the house somewhere, but it probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t fit me anymore.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, this phrase became a running joke among my friend groups, especially since I tended to be opinionated and to comment a lot on current events on social media and such. It was not uncommon for me to post some rant about something stupid our political leaders have done or some essay about how things could be improved, and someone would comment with the eventual &amp;ldquo;Roy Tang for President!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a joke of course. Running for president requires some level of fame, political experience, connections and even ridiculous amounts of money. I&amp;rsquo;m a nobody who has none of these things. there&amp;rsquo;s no way I&amp;rsquo;m running for president! That being said, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to claim I&amp;rsquo;ve never thought about it; it&amp;rsquo;s the sort of thing that&amp;rsquo;s fun to fantasize about once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It actually feels like a really insane idea to run for president. Being president is a terrible, thankless job. The country has so many systemic issues that it&amp;rsquo;s simply a gargantuan task to address them all or even make a significant dent in a single term. Even assuming you&amp;rsquo;re an honest, well-meaning person who just wants to do good things for the country, you&amp;rsquo;re going to run afoul of so many vested interests who will stand in your way and try to take you down: politicians benefiting from corruption, elites and oligarchs profiting from inequality, the criminals and corrupt who want to evade accountability, basically anyone in power looking to preserve the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t run the country alone, so you have to be lucky enough to know or find people to work with who you can trust to be honest and well-intentioned and not abuse their authority. And because we aren&amp;rsquo;t in a dictatorship, the president would often have to find a way to work with many different parties and sectors to get things (such as legislation) done, even if some of those people may be part of the very vested interests opposing you. You would have to do all of these tasks while constantly being criticized for your every move, and also managing public opinion and handling whatever random tragedy or crisis happens every week. And you have to find a way so that when everything is done, somehow the small gains you&amp;rsquo;ve made will be preserved and be built upon by future leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s not a job with a lot of work-life balance; you don&amp;rsquo;t step being president after 5pm. I can only imagine that once you decide to take on the job, you are basically committing six years of your life to the country, and not everyone has that privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about these things for the past couple of weeks as I read many of the testimonials given by people who&amp;rsquo;ve worked with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/weeknotes-2021-06-27/&#34;&gt;recently deceased former President Noynoy Aquino&lt;/a&gt;. By most accounts he was an honest, sincere person who wanted to do a good job. He was &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/indiohistorian/status/1407928646547902465&#34;&gt;a data driven President&lt;/a&gt; and tended to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ANCALERTS/status/1408370950530158593&#34;&gt;work hard&lt;/a&gt;, often making his staff work late into the night and such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had some issues he had trouble dealing with, namely in transportation and crisis management. But his biggest problem was his lack of charisma and political savvy; he tended not to show emotion and he wasn&amp;rsquo;t good at espousing his own causes or letting the public know how hard he worked or empathizing with other people. His political opponents capitalized on this and he was the target of bad propaganda, ending his term with him and his family name mocked and vilified by certain sectors of society. Someone I know called him &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LaTtEX/status/1407939921868824579&#34;&gt;a &amp;ldquo;misunderstood nerd&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and I think it&amp;rsquo;s a stereotype that fits perfectly - the sort of awkward person who knows how to do the work, but not how to effectively manage his relationships with other people and the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So hard work and good intentions are obviously not enough for the job. You also need charisma, political will and the savvy to navigate the cesspool of politics. With all of these challenges, it&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to find truly good and honest people willing to go for the job of president. Most will be experienced politicians who are already compromised in some way, perhaps thinking they can still leave a good legacy behind; or worse, some will be the truly corrupt, who see the position as an opportunity to further their own agendas, whether that be power or enrichment or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the scary part is that often, it&amp;rsquo;s the bad ones who have the knowhow or skills needed to get elected, which means elections here will always be a challenge. Maybe someday we&amp;rsquo;ll figure things out or just get really lucky and roll a chain of natural 20s and actually get a series of good presidents (or candidates even), enough to make some headway in improving the country, instead of the typical riffraff we find running for president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this country, there is a constitutional requirement that the president must be at least 40 years old which for me means next year&amp;rsquo;s elections would be the first one where I would actually be eligible to run for president! The presidentiables are already starting to make their moves so I want to make this clear: I have not yet decided whether or not to run for president. (Lol.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I&amp;amp;rsquo;m not even running yet and I already have opposition!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I was on a Twitch chat for a local streamer yesterday and someone bought up the term &amp;ldquo;comsat&amp;rdquo;, popular in local computer shop or &amp;ldquo;compshop&amp;rdquo; (also called &amp;ldquo;internet cafes&amp;rdquo;) culture. In the context of multiplayer games, it means to spy on what your opponent is doing by peeking at his screen. I&amp;rsquo;ve never heard this term used other than by Filipino gamers, so I have reason to believe it&amp;rsquo;s a local thing. There is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=comsat&#34;&gt;an Urban Dictionary entry&lt;/a&gt;, but the submitter might just be a Pinoy as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the younger gamers weren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the origins of the term. Someone even said they thought it mean &amp;ldquo;computer satellite&amp;rdquo;, as in someone who hovers over the opponent&amp;rsquo;s computer to see what they&amp;rsquo;re up to. The term actually originates from the original &lt;strong&gt;Starcraft&lt;/strong&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/ComSat_station&#34;&gt;a Terran building&lt;/a&gt; used to enable scanner sweeps. Starcraft was one of the earliest popular LAN games in the Philippines; we used to play it a lot on the lab computers after hours in college. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this kind of thing is now frowned upon, but back then one of the regular players in our lab was one of the younger teachers, so whatever. I suppose when compshops started to proliferate, many of the initial patrons were familiar with Starcraft and hence the term comsat and it propagated to later generations of gamers who played mostly games like the various versions of &lt;strong&gt;DOTA&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Counterstrike&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compshops were a popular small business back in the day. In fact, I briefly considered running one myself, the startup capital needed wasn&amp;rsquo;t too high. (But like many potential endeavors, it felt like too much work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compshops in the Philippines of course had their uses other than gaming - many students used them to do schoolwork or get something printed. But they became popular mostly for gaming, especially among the youth. Many were so obsessed we got memes like the one below with kids continuing to play despite floods, an image I&amp;rsquo;ve seen even in international gaming forums.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;I never got too much into compshop culture, particularly playing versus strangers and all that. I think part of that is because I was already graduating when they really took off in Metro Manila around the mid 2000s. But I also wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a fan of the multiplayer games that became popular locally - the aforementioned DOTA and Counterstrike - or the popular MMOs like &lt;strong&gt;Ragnarok Online&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only multiplayer PvP games I really played over LAN were Starcraft (mostly with labmates during the college days) and occasionally Warcraft III. I was comfortable with Warcraft III because &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2005/03/games-warcraft-iii-rude-and-annoying-teammates/&#34;&gt;I played it on Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; back home so I didn&amp;rsquo;t mind playing it with friends. I never really got into that phase where I would hang out in compshops and play with strangers. Between work and my home gaming, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really have time for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did enjoy the occasional game night out with coworkers after work - there was a small compshop near Tektite we&amp;rsquo;d go to. The only games I remember playing this way were &lt;strong&gt;Left 4 Dead&lt;/strong&gt; / &lt;strong&gt;Left 4 Dead 2&lt;/strong&gt;. I find that coop games like these tend to generate more funny moments overall, and we had a lot of fun shouting over the computers to try to get our party&amp;rsquo;s act together. Once we got tired of L4D, I&amp;rsquo;d take my leave to go home early while the more hardcore players stayed behind to play DOTA or CS late into the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably been a decade or even more since I&amp;rsquo;ve last been to a compshop. Interest in this kind of LAN gaming kind of faded among PC owners in the 2010s, around the same time that most games stopped offering LAN play in favor of online gaming. The writing was on the wall when &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2009/06/2402550844/&#34;&gt;Starcraft 2 announced in 2009 that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t support LAN&lt;/a&gt;. There was no reason for compshop owners to spend for legit copies of Starcraft 2 just so their clients could play it. PC owners who preferred to play SC2 or other newer paid games ended up mostly just playing online at their own homes. And with the rise of modern online voice chat, you could still replicate the experience of shouting at your teammates or opponents, although of course it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really the same as hearing the trash talk in person at a compshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compshops still continued to exist well into the 2010s of course, though perhaps not as prevalent as before. They offered mostly F2P or freemium games, although many still came with old / pirated copies of the classics - many players still played the older games because that&amp;rsquo;s what they knew. The clientele became primarily the less privileged who didn&amp;rsquo;t have access to a PC or internet or the latest games at home, many of them minors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think even during the pandemic, compshops still managed to survive. They&amp;rsquo;re kind of essential for less privileged students who all have to take online classes now. I imagine the industry will still be right there well into the 2020s - so long as the inequality and lack of access to PCs and internet persists, so will the humble compshops be there to help the less privileged enjoy some PC gaming as well.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the Fourth of July, which really only means something in the US. Over here it used to be &amp;ldquo;Philippine-American Friendship Day&amp;rdquo;, but apparently that was phased out while I was still in grade school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-quote&#34;&gt;A quote&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts&amp;rdquo; - W. Churchill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our current president and one of our possible future presidents, who are ostensibly allies / partymates &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/07/01/2109536/duterte-teases-vp-bid-calls-pacquiao-a-shit&#34;&gt;have been feuding over the past week&lt;/a&gt;. Just another sign of how tenuous political alliances in this country are; they are no match for ambition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DOH &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1454411/doh-says-ph-now-low-risk-for-covid-19-octa-disagrees&#34;&gt;says we are now &amp;ldquo;low risk&amp;rdquo; for COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; (which feels a bit like &lt;a href=&#34;https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/obama-awards-obama-a-medal&#34;&gt;Obama awarding himself a medal&lt;/a&gt;, but whatever). While it&amp;rsquo;s nice to be optimistic, we should still be cautious, especially in light of &lt;a href=&#34;https://asiatimes.com/2021/06/delta-variant-wreaking-havoc-on-viral-indonesia/&#34;&gt;the delta variant ravaging our neighboring countries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other than the pandemic, if you need to be reminded of the world&amp;rsquo;s other problems, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npr.org/2021/06/28/1010836214/all-time-records-fall-as-a-heat-wave-roasts-the-northwest-u-s&#34;&gt;the Pacific Northwest in the US and Canada have been experiencing record-setting heat waves over the past week or so&lt;/a&gt;. Also, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/EoinHiggins_/status/1411075158006284290&#34;&gt;the ocean was on fire&lt;/a&gt; for a while.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tvaziri/status/1410330742010171392&#34;&gt;this twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; of people posting great shots from movies of the past decade, although I have &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/1411197557028495362/&#34;&gt;a complaint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2020: It&amp;rsquo;s been one year since I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/1277249348716212225/&#34;&gt;deactivated my Facebook account&lt;/a&gt;! Here&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/quitting-facebook/&#34;&gt;corresponding essay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2013: Google &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2013/06/351351791226589187/&#34;&gt;shut down Google Reader&lt;/a&gt;, forever changing the adoption trajectory of RSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2011: Google launched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2011/07/86804113995730945/&#34;&gt;Google Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was again a busy week due to family-related errands, mostly involving escort missions to the hospital (nothing major, just routine checks and such.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hit the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/1410485781219536901/&#34;&gt;900 daily streak on Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;! Road to 1000!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;; this week, I really liked my rendition of the classic &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=616&#34;&gt;Icy Manipulator&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;








&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Actually managed to watch a fair amount of movies this week! Watched both Dalton Bond films: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/69d2374b0f0232065102954a54736506/&#34;&gt;The Living Daylights (1987)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/4e93006d466cb2f6a53325cba8e27b63/&#34;&gt;License To Kill (1989)&lt;/a&gt;; looking forward to Brosnan next! Caught the Matt Damon film &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/c7033ad094d89afab1a8e1abcb2c3015/&#34;&gt;Downsizing (2017)&lt;/a&gt; because I was stuck in a waiting room, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/cb5279cfdbc686e55eef33bd58e8aaeb/&#34;&gt;Under Siege (1992)&lt;/a&gt; because the Saturday gaming group decided we can do watch-alongs while playing our online boardgames. I actually have been paying attention to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/&#34;&gt;r/movies&lt;/a&gt; lately so I keep wanting to actually watch more movies, let&amp;rsquo;s see if that happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managed to catch up with most of the Arrowverse stuff this week. That&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Flash&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Legends of Tomorrow&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Superman and Lois&lt;/strong&gt; (Supergirl still on hiatus). Current season rankings: S&amp;amp;L &amp;gt;  Legends &amp;gt; Flash. These shows are pretty good to have in the background while I do other stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dove into the Frozen Wilds DLC for &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4! Apparently I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too tired of the game yet, despite playing it for over two months now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still playing &lt;strong&gt;Guilty Gear Strive&lt;/strong&gt;. Wrote some words about it &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/fg-complex-ggs/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular Saturday group played some &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/blood-rage/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/a&gt; this weekend, same as last weekend. I finally rolled Lizard Cult in random select!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still managing to avoid Steam Sale damage! (A few days still remain.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: Finished reading: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/linchpin/&#34;&gt;Linchpin by Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;strong&gt;Einstein&amp;rsquo;s Dreams&lt;/strong&gt; by Alan Lightman (will probably write a short review this week)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No online quiz night for the trivia team this week, although we&amp;rsquo;ve still been regularly doing the Saturday NY Times crossword and spelling bee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Loki, Rick and Morty, etc episodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black Widow is out this week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New set Adventures in the Forgotten Realms drops this week on Magic Arena! I&amp;rsquo;m not a big D&amp;amp;D fan (though I am a bit familiar), so I&amp;rsquo;m not super hyped specifically for the set, but any shakeup to constructed formats is welcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s almost July, which means 2021 is just about halfway done, and yet here we still are in pandemic mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-quote&#34;&gt;A quote&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Each year that passes rings you inwardly with memory and might. Wield your heart, and the world will tremble.&amp;rdquo; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://scryfall.com/card/lrw/247/doran-the-siege-tower&#34;&gt;Doran the Siege Tower&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last Thursday, former PH President Noynoy Aquino III &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/former-president-benigno-aquino-iii-dies&#34;&gt;passed away quietly&lt;/a&gt;. This led to the usual condolences and accolades from across the political spectrum, although many noted the delay in the palace issuing a statement (I suspect it was because the current president was still asleep). Many of his friends and supporters came out with stories of his time in office, many portraying him as misunderstood, uncharismatic, and quiet; holding his emotions close to his chest, but devoted to the job. My favorite entry is &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.abs-cbn.com/ancx/culture/spotlight/06/25/21/pnoy-was-my-boss-a-delayed-dispatch-from-a-palace-speechwriter&#34;&gt;this post by his former speechwriter&lt;/a&gt;. His legacy was tainted by several problems and a lot of black propaganda near the tail end of his term, leading many online to preface their accolades with phrases like &amp;ldquo;He wasn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, but&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, perhaps to avoid being tagged with the divisive &amp;ldquo;Dilawan&amp;rdquo; label or to avoid being targetted by the hordes of online trolls. This is silly; no one is perfect, so &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1408053878579294208/&#34;&gt;such a preface is unnecessary&lt;/a&gt;. All presidents have their pros and cons, their accomplishments and faults, but Noynoy was unquestionably better overall than his murderous successor, and arguably over his probably corrupt predecessor as well. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2010/05/elections-2010-my-ballot/&#34;&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t vote for him&lt;/a&gt; in 2010, and I had my fair share of criticisms especially over &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/01/685359171198308352/&#34;&gt;his transport policies&lt;/a&gt;, but the man deserved better. (Maybe the political opponents are worried about &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/treseroApol/status/1408079723591258113&#34;&gt;prophecy&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3138399/national-security-law-apple-dailys-main-editorial&#34;&gt;Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily prints its final issue&lt;/a&gt; after arrests and funds frozen from a government crackdown due to &amp;ldquo;national security&amp;rdquo; issues, furthur cementing China&amp;rsquo;s control over their wayward territory and taking away HK&amp;rsquo;s democratic freedoms&lt;/li&gt;

It&amp;rsquo;s a free upgrade from Windows 10, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1408096350764343300/&#34;&gt;some PCs might not be able to run it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Actually managed to watch three movies this week: the just-released-on-Netflix &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/rurouni-kenshin-final/&#34;&gt;Rurouni Kenshin: The Final (2021)&lt;/a&gt;, final Moore Bond film &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/7d38789afe70956e56d61914ed7d195a/&#34;&gt;A View To A Kill (1985)&lt;/a&gt;; and the very poorly reviewed &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/2789a7cda3fd16feca84b58fae45811b/&#34;&gt;Transformers: The Last Knight: 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also managed to finish binge-watching the award-winning comedy &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/schitts-creek/&#34;&gt;Schitt&amp;rsquo;s Creek&lt;/a&gt; and also catch up on &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1409018870111768584/&#34;&gt;Boku No Hero Academia season 5&lt;/a&gt;. This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/schitts-creek/&#34;&gt;Loki&lt;/a&gt; was still meh for me, I need more exciting MCU stuff! &lt;strong&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/strong&gt; first episode for the season was ok, but it led to some discussions with friends about how it&amp;rsquo;s a very mean-spirited show lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally finished the main game of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1407592883184488451/&#34;&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/a&gt; on PS4! I was thinking of taking a break from the game afterwards, since I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing it for like 2 months now, but a friend insisted I do the Frozen Wilds DLC (I assume because it&amp;rsquo;s good?!?) so I might do that and maybe also attempt a Platinum run?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still playing &lt;strong&gt;Guilty Gear Strive&lt;/strong&gt; during weeknights and generally being a scrub online. At least I&amp;rsquo;m using a second character now!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular Saturday group played some &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/blood-rage/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/a&gt; this weekend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steam Sale is ongoing right now, but my discipline is holding and no damage so far, though I am considering Hades and some other small games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: Still reading: &lt;strong&gt;Linchpin&lt;/strong&gt; by Seth Godin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia team got third place in this week&amp;rsquo;s comedy-themed About Quiz and third place overall for the current season. Could be better!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Loki, Rick and Morty, etc episodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a few more family errands and escort missions to do this week, and probably a few more in the weeks to come. Kind of disruptive to the daily rhythms, but it is what it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Today is father&amp;rsquo;s day. If you&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough to have a good father in your life, be sure to show your appreciation. Today&amp;rsquo;s weeknotes are shorter than usual for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-quote&#34;&gt;A quote&lt;/h3&gt;

The admin is all like &amp;ldquo;ha ha we don&amp;rsquo;t care, you have no basis, we won&amp;rsquo;t cooperate, etc etc&amp;rdquo;, but despite the posturing, it kind of feels like they&amp;rsquo;re a bit scared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the pandemic front, NCR is now on GCQ &amp;ldquo;with less restrictions&amp;rdquo; mode or whatever it is they&amp;rsquo;re calling it this week. NCR cases are going down (but still a lot), but cases in Visayas and Mindanao are on the rise. Davao in particular is a hotspot, and coincidentally, it looks the bulk of what little Pfizer we had is going there too. Luckily, just today the government announced they&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1448436/ph-seals-deal-for-40-m-doses-of-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine&#34;&gt;sealed a deal for 40M more Pfizer doses&lt;/a&gt;; hopefully they arrive in a timely manner as that should greatly help with vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In comic book news, Batman got into a bit of controversy this week when &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JoeOtterson/status/1404495349520244736&#34;&gt;DC apparently claims there are certain things he just can&amp;rsquo;t do&lt;/a&gt;. Zack Snyder tried &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ZackSnyder/status/1405702805948538881&#34;&gt;to get in on the fun&lt;/a&gt; but nobody knows where he got that image.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seems like I had a relatively chill / relaxed week, which is good because last week was a bit stressful. I did have a bunch of family errands and escort missions to do, but nothing too major.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;; this week, I had fun drawing Spider-man villain Sandman playing around in a sandcastle:&lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Only one movie again this week, continuing the James Bond run: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1639118365d91bdbd1a41eb9b170a9a0/&#34;&gt;Octopussy (1983)&lt;/a&gt;. Only one more Moore to go! I also wanted to watch &lt;strong&gt;Rurouni Kenshin: The Final&lt;/strong&gt;, which came out on PH Netflix last Friday, but haven&amp;rsquo;t found the time yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My regular background watching this week was seasons 2 and 3 of &lt;strong&gt;Schitt&amp;rsquo;s Creek&lt;/strong&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;m already halfway through season 4 now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s episode of &lt;strong&gt;Loki&lt;/strong&gt; felt a bit meh and mostly setup, but I must admit I am enjoying Owen Wilson&amp;rsquo;s performance and his back-and-forth with Tom Hiddleston.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spent the week clearing up all the pending non-main quest stuff in &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4, including the hunting trials and all the collectibles. I believe only main quest and ancient armory remain. Still have yet to do any Frozen Wilds content though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular Saturday group played some &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/blood-rage/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/a&gt; this weekend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Been playing &lt;strong&gt;Guilty Gear Strive&lt;/strong&gt; on a regular basis during weeknights. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get through all the missions since GGS is fairly complicated with a lot of systems and mechanics, and the missions are very good as a tutorial. I typically do a few missions per night then play around 9 games online (3 sets vs 3 different opponents). I am not very good at the game, but I am having fun, and I really like how it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to find matches compared to SFV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: Still reading: &lt;strong&gt;Linchpin&lt;/strong&gt; by Seth Godin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia team got second place in this week&amp;rsquo;s comedy-themed About Quiz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got some positive feedback this week on some stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve done, in a couple of different realms. Positive feedback is always great, tell people if you enjoy their work!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Loki episode this wednesday!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Rick and Morty season beings this week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two quiz nights this coming week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;You are not required to accomplish anything at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparison is the thief of joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baka merong may copy. In the strip, Patrolman Durugas has stopped Mang Dagul for a traffic violation, tapos pinilisopo sya ni Dagul, so binigyan sya ng ticket, nakasulat &amp;ldquo;violation: pilosopo&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would guess it&amp;rsquo;s from the early books, kasi I remember medyo raw pa yung art style. Probably somewhere in books 1-3, kasi I have book 4 here, parang mas polished na yung art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance to anyone who can help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Bakit walang flair na &amp;ldquo;Question&amp;rdquo;? Sige na nga, &amp;ldquo;Culture&amp;rdquo; na lang)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the last week of May (more or less), and I&amp;rsquo;m mostly looking forward to a new month because I&amp;rsquo;m tired of ridiculous summer heat and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping the sun tones it down a bit in June. The one aircon we have in the house has been busted all summer, so we have been suffering through the heat and surviving mostly through stacking multiple fans and also an excessive number of showers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-quote&#34;&gt;A quote&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We must be willing to let go of the life we planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us.” ― Joseph Campbell &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2014/05/468028741092794373/&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Israel finally &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-ceasefire-palestinians-gaza-survey-destruction/&#34;&gt;agreed to a ceasefire in the Gaza strip&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly afterwards, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ajplus/status/1395716586342948865&#34;&gt;Israeli police stormed the Al-Aqsa mosque&lt;/a&gt;, claiming &amp;ldquo;there were riots&amp;rdquo;.&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://nypost.com/2021/05/21/amid-tentative-ceasefire-hamas-claims-victory-over-israel/&#34;&gt;Hamas claimed victory&lt;/a&gt;. As an example of how the pro-Israeli slant towards these issues is starting to shift, &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.yahoo.com/john-oliver-condemns-israeli-attacks-184359089.html&#34;&gt;John Oliver condemned the Israeli attacks&lt;/a&gt;. All in all, still a very complicated situation; if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in further reading, Andy Baio put together &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/1393630514469244929&#34;&gt;a list of stuff to read on the topic&lt;/a&gt;. One can only hope the ceasefire holds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local pandemic stuff: After people mobbed a vaccination site distributing Pfizer jabs, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1433727/doh-suggests-no-vaccine-brand-announcement-in-jab-site&#34;&gt;DOH declared that LGUs should not announce ahead of time the brand of vaccine to be used at vax sites&lt;/a&gt;, a directive that is problematic at best. Not everyone can get every vaccine, and this seems like it would just waste people&amp;rsquo;s time if they go to a site only to find out what&amp;rsquo;s there won&amp;rsquo;t work for them. I understand trying to reduce vaccine hesitancy, but that can be solved by more transparency and explanations of efficacy and vaccine safety, not less. I did get &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/first-sinovac-dose/&#34;&gt;sinovac myself&lt;/a&gt;, but I do understand the sentiment of prefering the Western brands due to the supposed higher efficacy and effectiveness in preventing transmission. Personally, I just want as many people as possible to get vaccinated, using any brands that are available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vaccination drive (and overall pandemic response) still feels pretty tepid, but at least &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/HerdImmunityPH/status/1395997730556682241&#34;&gt;the vaccination rate is starting to tick up&lt;/a&gt;. Actually hitting the wall of vaccine hesitancy might be a good problem to have soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This weekend was Eurovision, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/05/1129879612534558726/&#34;&gt;something I don&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;get&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, but it got me thinking: why don&amp;rsquo;t we have some kind of Asian equivalent, an &amp;ldquo;Asia-vision&amp;rdquo; if you will. I suspect the authoritarian states won&amp;rsquo;t like it though, as the venue might be used to publicize their nefarious deeds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Making the rounds on Twitter this week: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/angryasianman/status/1395490103913377794/&#34;&gt;The Linda Lindas, a band of young girls, performs &amp;ldquo;Racist, Sexist Boy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; (in a library of some kind). &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3msSlr4PkDE&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the whole set&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was recently reminded of this story from a couple of months back: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dreams_of_sloth/status/1377051721655066629&#34;&gt;A new hire joined a software company, fix a bug that&amp;rsquo;s been bugging him from before the job, then promptly filed his two week&amp;rsquo;s notice&lt;/a&gt;. There is a bit of romantic adventurism here, as I imagine retiring to become a legendary wandering software developer, travelling from company to company, smiting bugs and vanishing just as quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netflix released &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUy0RgeggCQ&#34;&gt;the official trailer for Trese&lt;/a&gt;, an upcmong anime based on a Filipino comic. I&amp;rsquo;m not particularly looking forward to it and I haven&amp;rsquo;t read the source material, but a lot of my friends are hyped about it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My Fitbit strap broke off yesterday morning. I immediately ordered a new one on Lazada before thinking &amp;ldquo;wait, I&amp;rsquo;ve only had this one for around half a year, that seems ridiculous&amp;rdquo;. So I cancelled the order, and instead asked someone to help me &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1396076491021058050/&#34;&gt;apply a DIY fix&lt;/a&gt;. (I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it myself due to poor manual dexterity.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of Fitbit, now that I&amp;rsquo;m fully vaccinated and the NCR case rates are going down again, I&amp;rsquo;ve resumed taking at least some of my walks outside our subdivision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;, once again falling behind on the weekends. Briefly considered just breaking the streak and living with it, but no! The 365 counter is a commitment to doing at least a year of these! As today&amp;rsquo;s sample, here&amp;rsquo;s Batman getting vaccinated:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: This week I watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/ea715fa4d23937c15e47022adf93e192/&#34;&gt;The Spy Who Loved Me (1977)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/09b5a24d69042602b9ac909e277987a6/&#34;&gt;Mortal Kombat (2021)&lt;/a&gt;. My James Bond run is now officially crossing over into the &amp;ldquo;movies released after I born&amp;rdquo; territory. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping I can somehow get through the rest of them before the latest one (No Time To Die) comes out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still playing a bunch of &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4 and &lt;strong&gt;Street Fighter V&lt;/strong&gt; on Steam and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; with the regular Saturday group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still looking for a single-player game to play and stream on twitch when Arena limited is off season, so that I&amp;rsquo;m not only doing Arena streams for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: I finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/c72ceb2e3748ccd8611baab1cbfdfe74/&#34;&gt;What Matters Now, compiled by Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt;, a quick and easy read. After that, I decided to delve into some Agatha Christie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had quiz night last night, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t do particularly well, about the same as the previous week. There is another online quiz night announced and scheduled for next week, by a different group, with topics that we like, but we are hesitant because they have an increased entry fee which is supposed to contribute to a prize pool. Doing online trivia for charity or just for fun has been okay, but I&amp;rsquo;m not really comfortable competing for cash prizes, given that it&amp;rsquo;s all done online and it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to police whether the participants are googling or have a whole army sitting behind them or such. That&amp;rsquo;s also true even if there weren&amp;rsquo;t a prize, but having the prize just gives a lot more incentive for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of trivia for fun, this past week I migrated the &lt;a href=&#34;https://triviastorm.net/&#34;&gt;triviastorm&lt;/a&gt; site back-end code in order to merge it with this site&amp;rsquo;s backend. The motivation for this was to resolve some memory issues on my cheap DigitalOcean droplet; basically running two Django instances meant I was using twice as much memory as necessary. After merging the backends, I replaced the front end of the triviastorm site with a new VueJS-based static site. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write a blog post about VueJS as well, and dipping my toes into it again helped me solidify some thoughts, will probably do sometimes this coming week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern Horizons 2 spoilers (not that I expect to be playing Modern any time soon)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;a-quote&#34;&gt;A quote&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who has never killed an hour? Not casually or without thought, but carefully: a premeditated murder of minutes. The violence comes from a combination of giving up, not caring, and a resignation that getting past it is all you can hope to accomplish. So you kill the hour. You do not work, you do not read, you do not daydream. If you sleep it is not because you need to sleep. And when at last it is over, there is no evidence: no weapon, no blood, and no body. The only clue might be the shadows beneath your eyes or a terribly thin line near the corner of your mouth indicating something has been suffered, that in the privacy of your life you have lost something and the loss is too empty to share.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Mark Z. Danielewski, House of Leaves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Violence escalated in the Israel-occupied Gaza strip over the past week, as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-airstrike-gaza-kills-8-children-u-s-envoy-arrives-n1267490&#34;&gt;IDF bombarded Palestinian-occupied civilian areas and buildings&lt;/a&gt; (including a building housing the Associated Press and al-Jazeera) supposedly in retaliation for missile strikes from Hamas. I won&amp;rsquo;t pretend to be knowledgable in the history and complexities of the Israel-Palestine conflicts. We kind of grew up in a world where the international media narrative has almost always had a pro-Israel slant (especially since the US government tends to support them), so our opinions are often biased in that direction. But this time feels different, this time feels like the state of Israel is losing control of the narrative and more and more people are supporting the Palestinians. I would suggest anyone who has grown up exposed to the pro-Israel narrative to start following some sources espousing the POV from the Palestinian/Arab world. I personally follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tha_rami&#34;&gt;Rami Ismail&lt;/a&gt;, an indie gamedev who happens to be Muslim, his coverage of the current crisis over the past few days has been insightful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, in the US &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ransomware-attack-on-pipeline-propels-gas-to-near-3-a-gallon/&#34;&gt;a gas pipeline fell victim to a ransomware attack&lt;/a&gt;, causing people to worry about a gas shortage and apparently start &lt;a href=&#34;https://god.dailydot.com/americans-freaking-gas-shortage/&#34;&gt;pumping gas into plastic bags&lt;/a&gt;. Eh, what?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US CDC has issued guidance that vaccinated people are no longer required to wear masks indoors, but apparently this relies on some sort of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ryanstruyk/status/1392952564514238467&#34;&gt;honesty system&lt;/a&gt;. Not sure this is going to end well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lockdown restrictions are being lowered in the NCR+ bubble, and the powers-that-be have decided to define an entirely new classification level &amp;ldquo;GCQ with heightened restrictions&amp;rdquo;. Meanwhile, Singapore and Taiwan are increasing their lockdown levels because they got a few dozen cases. The contrast is stark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Cory Doctorow writes about &lt;a href=&#34;https://doctorow.medium.com/the-memex-method-238c71f2fb46&#34;&gt;The Memex Method&lt;/a&gt; (warning: Medium), basically reflections on 20+ years of blogging and how it has affected his thinking and note taking and such.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big of Doctorow as a blogger and have been basically following him since his days at &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/blogs-of-yesteryear/&#34;&gt;Boing-Boing&lt;/a&gt;. It feels like we&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging for around the same time, but he&amp;rsquo;s gone a lot further with the practice. I wish I had the energy and capacity he has for the regular, daily blogging and linksharing that he does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of Doctorow, I like &lt;a href=&#34;https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/08/copyfraud/#beethoven-just-wrote-music&#34;&gt;his recent discussion of how copyright filters lead to wage theft&lt;/a&gt;. Excerpt:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impossibility of automating copyright judgments didn&amp;rsquo;t stop Google from trying to perfect its filter, adding layers of complexity until Content ID&amp;rsquo;s appeal process turned into a cod-legal system whose flowchart looks like a bowl of spaghetti. &amp;hellip; The resulting mess firmly favors attackers (wage stealers, fraudsters, censors, bullies) over defenders (creators, critics). Attackers don&amp;rsquo;t need to waste their time making art, which leaves them with the surplus capacity to master the counterintuitive &amp;ldquo;legal&amp;rdquo; framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris McCormick writes about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mccormick.cx/news/entries/one-million-people-saw-my-dumbest-tweet&#34;&gt;how a million people saw his dumbest tweet&lt;/a&gt;, yet another reflection on withdrawing from social media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scott Berkun writes about how &lt;a href=&#34;https://scottberkun.com/2021/why-bad-ceos-fear-remote-work/&#34;&gt;Bad CEOs Fear Remote Work&lt;/a&gt;, a mindset that will hopefully become rarer as we move towards the pandemic-ushered future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StumbledUpon used to be a thing, and there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://stumbled.cc/stumble&#34;&gt;a new site&lt;/a&gt; that kind of aims to be a spiritual successor I guess? I haven&amp;rsquo;t found anything interesting yet in my few rolls though.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent most of my afternoon yesterday &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/going-merry-kit/&#34;&gt;putting together this One Piece ship model kit I got in Japan back in 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;, although I am once again behind by a day or so, something that seems to typically happen on the weekend. My favorite sketch this past week may have been this one I did of ramen noodles:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: This week I watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/ba2999c2cc9d8803ad982d24e52035e6/&#34;&gt;The Man With The Golden Gun (1974)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1392042759863689217/&#34;&gt;The Mitchells vs The Machines (2021)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still playing a bunch of &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4 and &lt;strong&gt;Street Fighter V&lt;/strong&gt; on Steam. Kind of stuck in a rut with Balrog (Boxer), need to leve up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currently looking for a single-player game to play and stream on twitch when Arena limited is off season, so that I&amp;rsquo;m not only doing Arena streams for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had quiz night last night, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t do particularly well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did some more work on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://triviastorm.net/&#34;&gt;triviastorm&lt;/a&gt; back-end code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh, nothing in particular I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to this week. Anything I missed?&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;This post is being published a day late. Things happen okay? Sometimes you get busy and things need to be pushed back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;like the thug that he is, our dear president &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1390134185222832132/&#34;&gt;claimed that the arbitral award ruling in the PH&amp;rsquo;s favor was nothing more than a sheet of paper he could easily discard&lt;/a&gt;. He also challenged former justice Antonio Carpio to a debate over the West Philippine Sea issue, a challenge the latter quickly accepted. As basically everyone expected, Duterte later chickened out, and offered his spokesman Roque as a distraction, er, proxy for the debate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debris from a Chinese rocket was expected to crash back into Earth sometime this weekend, but no one could predict when or where. Some of my chat groups remarked that if it hits the PH, we are well and truly cursed. It finally landed in the Indian Ocean yesterday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controversial billionaire Elon Musk hosted SNL this weekend and for some reason, this caused Dogecoin to crash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bill and Melinda Gates announced they are divorcing. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1389349579091365888/&#34;&gt;timing is suspicious&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the tech world, enterprise software maker Basecamp got into a bit of brouhaha this past week after a policy announcement of &amp;ldquo;no politics discussion at work&amp;rdquo; eventually led to around a third of their workforce choosing to resign. Casey Newton has &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406673/basecamp-political-speech-policy-controversy&#34;&gt;a great writeup about it&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a big disappointment because the founders of Basecamp have always had a reputation of promoting positive workplace practices, including a book titled &amp;ldquo;It Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Have to Be Crazy At Work&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-29/ignoring-the-rules-sometimes-works-for-elon-musk&#34;&gt;Money Stuff a while back&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;On the other hand, if you send out those cars to drive themselves everywhere and they all crash and kill a bunch of people, that will be bad! You will be in bad trouble. “It’s better to ask forgiveness than to ask permission,” you will say, but this is not quite right; maybe it is better to announce success and then smugly add “sorry we didn’t tell you first,” but it is strictly worse to fail catastrophically and apologize. If you are going to fail it is better to ask permission, because forgiveness will not be forthcoming. If you are going to succeed, sure, it is better to ask forgiveness. “There’s nothing to forgive, you’re perfect, you little scamp,” everyone will reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are doing some bold novel thing, you probably do not know, ex ante, if you will succeed or fail. Therefore you do not know, ex ante, if you should ask permission or forgiveness, if you should follow the law or not. But if you are the founder and chief executive officer of a company whose goal is to do some bold novel thing, you have been selected and encouraged precisely for your borderline-crazy optimism and self-confidence. You can’t do impossible things unless you first believe that you can, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are certain that you will succeed brilliantly in all your endeavors, then often the optimal strategy will sometimes be to ignore the law, or at least the parts of the law that stand in the way of your vision. Not, like, the objectively optimal strategy, but the strategy that you consider optimal given your subjective certainty that everything will work out for you&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signal &lt;a href=&#34;https://signal.org/blog/the-instagram-ads-you-will-never-see/&#34;&gt;tried to release instagram ads that highlighted how targetted advertising works&lt;/a&gt; but their account conveniently got disabled for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zdnet.com/article/facebook-accuses-signal-of-lying-about-its-attempt-to-run-transparent-instagram-ads/&#34;&gt;what Facebook claims was &amp;ldquo;an unrelated payments issue&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.garbageday.email/p/finally-a-weapon-to-surpass-groverhaus&#34;&gt;a recent Garbage Day&lt;/a&gt;, about Spotify&amp;rsquo;s algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve seen how Facebook&amp;rsquo;s algorithmic recommendation of content, based on an algorithm that&amp;rsquo;s maximized for engagement, has started to distort reality. It has started to undermine democracy and amplified really harmful ideologies like white supremacy and white nationalism. And you can already kind of start to see this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bands have kind of started to figure out like, “oh, all of our songs that sound kind of like this do super well with the Spotify algorithm, let&amp;rsquo;s just make more songs like that.” And you can&amp;rsquo;t fault the band for doing that. There&amp;rsquo;s so few opportunities for bands to make a living from their art at this point. But it terrifies me to think about a future where music is created to please some cold-blooded algorithm. And there&amp;rsquo;s just like something uniquely gross about that to me, when I think about how music is something that humans have been making for literally 1000s of years. It&amp;rsquo;s something that&amp;rsquo;s sacred, and, you know, not to pretend that it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been commodified in a variety of different ways for decades, or maybe even centuries. But this feels like a new frontier. That type of automated commodification of something that should be about humans and not robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marvel released what is basically a sizzle reel for the MCU&amp;rsquo;s next 3 years worth of movies: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdpxoFcdORI&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdpxoFcdORI&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m such a fanboy, I will gleefully admit that I got goosebumps when the video continued past the Shang-chi preview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rolling Stone lists the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-lists/best-tv-sitcoms-1162237/&#34;&gt;best TV sitcoms of all time&lt;/a&gt;. The comments are full of complaints about notable omissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got my &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1391294087064477699/&#34;&gt;second dose of the Sinovac vaccine yesterday&lt;/a&gt;! Supposedly it&amp;rsquo;s fully effective about two weeks after the second dose, although studies show the efficacy is rather low. But some protection is better than none. Some better vaccines are starting to come in, we are supposedly due to get (a small amount of) Pfizer soon. I reckon since I&amp;rsquo;m hunkered down at home most of the time anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m okay with the weaker Chinese vaccine and don&amp;rsquo;t mind if the more effective vaccines go to the masses that have to go out and mingle for work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;, although I&amp;rsquo;m a couple of days behind due to the aforementioned alleged busyness. Should catch up soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Didn&amp;rsquo;t watch any last week, should correct that soon. I&amp;rsquo;m not even a third of the way through my James Bond run!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing too notable, now that Invincible is done and we don&amp;rsquo;t have any running MCU series at the moment. Well, I did enjoy the recent two-part story on Supergirl where two characters travelled back to the past to meet young Kara and Alex in school. The rest of the season has bit a bit meh, so this was the highlight for me so far. The young versions were so perfectly cast!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drafted a bit more &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgstrixhaven/&#34;&gt;Strixhaven&lt;/a&gt; on Arena, and finally ran the Sealed Open yesterday!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still playing a bunch of &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4 and &lt;strong&gt;Street Fighter V&lt;/strong&gt; on Steam. Hey, I got Balrog (Boxer) to bronze!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finally finished the second run of Fire Emblem: Three Houses! There&amp;rsquo;s one more branch to explore (well, technically two, but I&amp;rsquo;m not too interested in the other one), but I might put the game aside for a while and find something else to play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Finished reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/snow-crash/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/strong&gt; by Neal Stephenson&lt;/a&gt;, still looking around for what to read next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t have any quiz nights this week! Instead, I started digging a bit into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://triviastorm.net/&#34;&gt;triviastorm&lt;/a&gt; back-end code and added some improvements I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do for a while. When I&amp;rsquo;m done, I hope the answer checking becomes a bit more robust. Will also probably add a new batch of questions to the bot sometime this month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh, nothing in particular I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to this week. Anything I missed?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This mindset reflects someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t respect institutions or the  law or civilized agreements, and basically respects only one thing:  power. That&amp;rsquo;s why he thinks people who oppose China want war and why he  doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to offend China, power is all he sees and values, like the thug that he is.  For this kind of person, you can&amp;rsquo;t be right because of the law or  because of principle, or because of justice, you can only be right if you had the ability to  enforce that right. Basically the type of leader who would just  collaborate with any invaders who managed to overpower us and would say wag na lang tayo gumawa ng gulo, andyan na e.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s already May? April felt like it came and went so quickly. But then again, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/1242953238497751040&#34;&gt;time has little meaning in this accursed pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The brouhaha over community pantries (as &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/weeknotes-2021-04-25/&#34;&gt;described last week&lt;/a&gt;), seems to have calmed down and they are now generally coordinating with LGUs for assistance in maintaining health protocols&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, the government has embarked on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1387324164910981121/&#34;&gt;propaganda campaign to assert that we aren&amp;rsquo;t the worst in terms of pandemic response in the world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certain congress people continue to promote the usage of the drug Ivermectin, which has no known effect on Covid-19, as a Covid-19 cure or something. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1388100027684331520/&#34;&gt;DOH/FDA keep saying there&amp;rsquo;s no sufficient evidence&lt;/a&gt;, but that has no effect when the people promoting it aren&amp;rsquo;t motivated by evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looks like the Office of the Solicitor General of the Philippines &lt;a href=&#34;https://restofworld.org/2021/philippines-data-exposure/&#34;&gt;accidentally leaked a bunch of sensitive legal documents&lt;/a&gt; due to a misconfigured public directory on their web server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently last weekend was the Oscars, which just goes to show how irrelevant they are now that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know until I saw the tweets about it happening live. They tried to re-arrange the awards with Best Actor last, apparently with the hope of ending with a posthumous award to Chadwick Boseman, but the award went to Anthony Hopkins instead, who wasn&amp;rsquo;t even at the ceremony. Awkward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/feb/16/how-to-have-better-arguments-social-media-politics-conflict&#34;&gt;How to have better arguments online&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have this mentor. And one of the best pieces of advice that he gave me is ‘always give someone the golden gate of retreat’, which is: give someone enough compassion, enough opportunity in a conversation for them to look good changing their mind. And it’s a really important thing to be able to do, because if you’re just like, ‘Oh you said this thing! You’re racist!’, you’re forcing that person to say, ‘No I’m not’. Et cetera. There’s no golden gate of retreat there. The only retreat there is to just barrel right through the opposing opinion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a constant practice of getting curious about all of the aspects of your experience. Not with the intention of receiving any adult-mind narrative answers, but with the curiosity of a talking monkey who has no ability to understand the universe. &amp;hellip; By continually introducing the immediate experience of not-knowing to your operating system, you will undo the stale old perceptual and cognitive habits of the adult-mind that thinks it knows, that thinks it has seen it all, that it has seen any of this before. It’s a skill like any other, and as you improve with practice you will get better at meeting everything for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/04/how-yahoo-became-internet-villain/618681/&#34;&gt;Yahoo the Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;, on the once-great internet company not being great at preserving the content under its purview. I&amp;rsquo;m still bitter over &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/10/1048949973801267200/&#34;&gt;not being able to recover my Yahoo Messenger convos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drew DeVault writes about &lt;a href=&#34;https://drewdevault.com/2021/04/26/Cryptocurrency-is-a-disaster.html&#34;&gt;how cryptocurrency is an abject disaster&lt;/a&gt;. I was tempted to write about my own experiences working with crypto, but I worry that not enough time has passed for me to talk perhaps a bit unkindly about some of the companies I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manuel Matuzovic writes about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matuzo.at/blog/html-boilerplate/&#34;&gt;his current HTML boilerplate&lt;/a&gt;, which at the very least is a good look at how many different tags and other things one needs to put in by default to support various modern web things including social media previews and such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone shared to me this version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyE80ebItlA&#34;&gt;Never Gonna Give You Up with Japanese lyrics&lt;/a&gt; that I enjoyed for some reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extremely satisfying: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/moylato/status/1387139670962843658&#34;&gt;Belgian man parks his car in a super narrow garage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found this &lt;a href=&#34;https://acesubido.net/ph-inflation-calculator/&#34;&gt;Philippines inflation calculator online&lt;/a&gt;. Prices have almost doubled from when I started working back in 2003!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For some reason all the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketches&lt;/a&gt; for the past week were done with pen and paper on this tiny pad I keep near my desk. Much quicker to do, but the sketches are also much simpler than anything I do in Procreate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Caught &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/3bf3bc036db88610a1c7b3474555eb69/&#34;&gt;Green Hornet (2011)&lt;/a&gt; on cable, a movie I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know existed. I should resume my James Bond run soonish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched the &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/05/99d3f5dffa9b1e1f2a4029f66c2b4f2a/&#34;&gt;second season of Jack Ryan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/04/183ab94b6cb10f5db0431e715cde1945/&#34;&gt;finished up season 1 of Invincible&lt;/a&gt;, both on Prime Video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Been drafting a bit more &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgstrixhaven/&#34;&gt;Strixhaven&lt;/a&gt; on Arena. I thought the Sealed Open was this weekend, but turns out it was actually next week. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably shift to Quick Drafts next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a bunch of &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4 already after it dropped for free last week. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big fan of the intro sequence, but I&amp;rsquo;ve warmed up to it as the story and the world gradually opened up. I can tell this will take a while to finish though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a bit of Street Fighter V again this week, though I&amp;rsquo;m still languishing in the Bronze ranks again. Have tried shifting to Balrog (Boxer) as my main, though I&amp;rsquo;m not super familiar with the combos and matchups. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how that goes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My regular Saturday gaming group immediately picked up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1586100/Root_The_Riverfolk_Expansion/&#34;&gt;new Riverfolk expansion for Root&lt;/a&gt; when it dropped last week and we had a lot of fun with some of the creepy new additions last night. And I really should get on with that Root review!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: I am close to finishing &lt;strong&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/strong&gt; by Neal Stephenson, should be done this week, hopefully have time to write the review as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia: Didn&amp;rsquo;t do too well in this week&amp;rsquo;s About Quiz, so we ended up in a distant finish in the league overall. No trivia next week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No new One Piece, BNHA, etc, I assume due to Golden Week. Boo!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strixhaven Sealed Open on Arena next week, for real this time!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting my second shot of Sinovac next Sunday!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was a bit rushed, so typos etc are a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a bit busy this weekend (see below), so this post is running a bit late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ongoing saga right here in the Philippines:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last weekend, community pantries for the needy started sprouting up in Metro Manila and all over the country, largely inspired by one started in Maginhawa here in Quezon City. The central idea was &amp;ldquo;give what you can, take what you need.&amp;rdquo; Stories spread of heartwarming stories like a poor old man donating some food even though he had very little and an ice cream vendor giving away the remnants of his cart for the day to those in the queue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government critics pointed out the need for these pantries was largely a result of the lack of support from the government. (They&amp;rsquo;re not wrong.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predictably, it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for the government to butt in, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/roytang/status/1384280033351462912&#34;&gt;the police reportedly investigating the people behind the pantries for communist links&lt;/a&gt;. Some other national government people even said they might require permits. For what, giving food away?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The backlash was predictably quick, with netizens and even local government offcials and senators castigating the critics. Mayors started chiming in that the community pantries were welcome in their cities and that there was no permit required to help each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, notable spokespersons of the NTF-ELCAC still insisted on insinuating communist links to the pantries. There were also the usual critics who decried people getting stuff for free, speaking from the privilege of their safe houses and expensive cars. Critics also raised whether these pantries were spreading covid because of how people spend a lot of time queued up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some women in Pasig went viral for a bit after they were caught on video raiding a community pantry and getting much more than could be reasonably expected, one of them even carting off a trayful of eggs. They supposedly claimed they were going to give away to their neighbors. They later &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.msn.com/en-ph/entertainment/other/mga-babaeng-nanlimas-sa-community-pantry-sa-pasig-dumepensa-na/ar-BB1fUtan&#34;&gt;apologized&lt;/a&gt;, but supposedly they &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/news5ph/status/1384855185932042241&#34;&gt;were planning to file charges against the person who took a video of them&lt;/a&gt;. My take: the thing about decentralized movements like this is that they tend to easily self-correct through the vigilance of the participants as seen here. There have been no other reports of similar incidents after this one went viral, so at the very least they served as an example of what not to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last Friday, a community pantry started by actress Angel Locsin ended in disaster when an old man died while in the queue. Blowback from the pantry critics and the DDS was fierce. Locsin &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gmanetwork.com/entertainment/showbiznews/news/76345/angel-locsin-issues-apology-after-senior-citizen-dies-in-line-at-her-community-pantry/story&#34;&gt;quickly issued an apology&lt;/a&gt; and accepted the blame, drawing contrasts with how the national government never apologizes or admits to mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently, news broke that the National Security Adviser &lt;a href=&#34;https://onenews.ph/gag-order-imposed-on-parlade-badoy&#34;&gt;had imposed a gag order on the notorious NTF-ELCAC spokespersons re: community pantries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probably one of the reasons we can&amp;rsquo;t have nice things: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LaTtEX/status/1384416859701792771&#34;&gt;people can&amp;rsquo;t be generous without some other people becoming suspicious and assigning nefarious motives&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens with these pantries moving forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of covid, India&amp;rsquo;s experiencing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56798248&#34;&gt;worst surge of the pandemic so far&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://mashable.com/article/twitter-hides-tweets-critical-indian-government-handling-covid/&#34;&gt;accused of censoring tweets critical of the Indian government&amp;rsquo;s covid response&lt;/a&gt;. The US is facing calls to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/25/us-pressed-to-lift-export-ban-to-help-india-fight-surge-in-covid-cases?CMP=twt_gu#Echobox=1619342451&#34;&gt;loosen export bans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/24/covid-vaccines-patents-pharmaceutical-companies-secrecy&#34;&gt;lighten up on vaccine patents&lt;/a&gt; to help out India (and the rest of us in the global south, really).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some lighter news: One year ago in Apr 24 2020, an epic battle among a ton of people named Josh was scheduled a year in advance, to fight for the name. It &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gothspiderbitch/status/1386031209457852418&#34;&gt;happened yesterday&lt;/a&gt;! They had a pool noodle battle and named a 5 year old &amp;ldquo;King Josh&amp;rdquo; or some such. Lots of fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messaging app Signal, famous for its encryption protections, raised concerns about vulnerabilities in software often used by authoritarian regimes to bypass the security of such apps: &lt;a href=&#34;https://signal.org/blog/cellebrite-vulnerabilities/&#34;&gt;Exploiting vulnerabilities in Cellebrite UFED and Physical Analyzer from an app&amp;rsquo;s perspective&lt;/a&gt;. The great thing is how the report does a hilarious &amp;ldquo;wink wink nudge nudge&amp;rdquo; implying the users of such apps might not want to target Signal in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some stuff about blogging and personal websites:

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gq.com/story/get-fit-from-just-walking&#34;&gt;How fit can you get from just walking?&lt;/a&gt; One of the tragedies of the pandemic is that I&amp;rsquo;ve had to reduce my general walking output, since I can&amp;rsquo;t just wander around as far as I want anymore.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In the Spanish dub of Terminator 2, instead of &amp;ldquo;Hasta la vista, baby&amp;rdquo;, the Terminator says &amp;ldquo;Sayonara, baby!&amp;rdquo; via &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/mwv4nd/fun_fact_in_the_spanish_dub_of_terminator_2_he/&#34;&gt;reddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Local liturgical song Tanging Yaman, often attributed to Carol Banawa, was actually &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/04/03/21/behind-the-music-tanging-yaman-by-fr-manoling-francisco&#34;&gt;first recorded by now-Senator Risa Hontiveros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The big thing for me this week (that I hinted at in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/weeknotes-2021-04-18/&#34;&gt;the previous weeknotes&lt;/a&gt;) is that I decided to give &lt;a href=&#34;https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48&#34;&gt;LUDUM DARE 48&lt;/a&gt; a shot! It&amp;rsquo;s a game jam, where you make a game in 48 hours (well, that&amp;rsquo;s the mode I&amp;rsquo;m participating in). Tt&amp;rsquo;s the first time I&amp;rsquo;m doing one, despite a lifetime of flirting with the idea of gamedev. Initial build is &lt;a href=&#34;https://hungryroy.itch.io/diver&#34;&gt;already available&lt;/a&gt;, even though there&amp;rsquo;s still 9ish hours to go. (I need to sleep!) I&amp;rsquo;ll probably (should) write more about this experience in a future post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Around the middle of this week, I got the first ever email that actually complied with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/about/contact/&#34;&gt;the contact protocol I had specified here in the site&lt;/a&gt; and on LinkedIn, namely putting a certain keyword in the subject line. I&amp;rsquo;ve had that condition for years, so I was really amazed someone actually read it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;still sketching&lt;/a&gt;, though I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen a couple of days behind due to the game jam. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1385224243848179719/&#34;&gt;tried to do one on paper like a comic&lt;/a&gt; but my handwriting was so terrible I had to edit it digitally!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/b178a1efcfc005930f062c7be447d7c1/&#34;&gt;Rocky (1976)&lt;/a&gt;, and I meant to watch the next Bond flick too, but ran out of time. New Mortal Kombat movie also came out this past week, I might watch that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt; season finale ran last Friday. A lot of people are happy with it (and the season overall), but I felt like some parts were too rushed and the finale suffered as a result. Will probably post more thoughts on it this week. After this, we won&amp;rsquo;t have MCU content until Loki kicks off next month I think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Invincible&lt;/strong&gt; is getting to the good part!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still drafting a bunch of Strixhaven on Arena (though I had to stop for the weekend due to the game jam). Most of my drafts went well, though the last 2 I did this week were terrible. I ended up listening to &lt;a href=&#34;http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-593-strixhaven-first-impressions/&#34;&gt;the Limited Resources podcast&lt;/a&gt; for the first time and got some good tips, hopefully that improves my drafts moving forward. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably play in the Sealed Open next weekend! Follow along via &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgstrixhaven/&#34;&gt;the MTGStrixhaven tag&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/strong&gt; actually had some progress this week. I really should finish this run soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downloaded &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4 because it&amp;rsquo;s temporarily free! I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to play this for a while, hopefully I have time for it this coming week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played some Street Fighter V again this week; I figured since a new character dropped, it might be easy to find matches again. I did manage to fight quite a few, but I also did quite poorly, dropping back to Ultra Bronze. Thinking about switching to a different character since everyone seems to know how to fight Ryu, so I unlocked Honda! We&amp;rsquo;ll see who I actually end up using.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Trivia: Pop Quiz is back (albeit monthly now, not weekly), so the trivia team was able to join two quizzes this past week. We didn&amp;rsquo;t win either though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a couple of birthdays in the family this weekend, so my game jamming was interspersed with zoom / messenger calls and food deliveries and such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Invincible, One Piece, BNHA, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new expansion dropping for Root, one of the digital boardgames we&amp;rsquo;ve been playing (and the one I have yet to write a review for&amp;hellip; sounds like a perfect opportunity!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strixhaven Sealed Open on Arena next week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was a bit rushed, so typos etc are a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to think of this past week, feels like it went by quickly. I may have spent too much of it daydreaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NCR+ bubble is now one week into modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ - an acronym that makes no sense). Cases still seem to be pretty high on a day-to-day basis, though we&amp;rsquo;re told the R number is dropping slightly, so that&amp;rsquo;s good I guess? Still, would be nice if the case numbers would calm down. Still lots of stories about people having trouble getting into hospitals and dying in ICUs. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/4/12/Roque-un-Christian-COVID-19-confinement.html&#34;&gt;the presidential spokesperson claims it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;unchristian&amp;rdquo; to ask how he managed to get a hospital booking despite all the problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quezon City is out of vaccines, at least for now, until the national government gives them some more. They were able to vaccinate around 100,000 people so far, which isn&amp;rsquo;t too bad. The two seniors I live with still haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten vaccinated, so hopefully supplies come back up soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a rare show of spine, the Philippine government, in coordination with American friends, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.esquiremag.ph/politics/news/china-backs-down-a00293-20210416-lfrm&#34;&gt;have sent coast guard ships to chase away the Chinese invaders&lt;/a&gt; in Julian Felipe reef!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not sure what&amp;rsquo;s happening with the rest of the world, haven&amp;rsquo;t really been paying attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I guess we could note that in the US, cops are killing more black people while protests about previous killings are going on while a former police officer is on trial for a previous killing, but this sort of thing doesn&amp;rsquo;t really feel &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; for the US anymore. Now, if they actually do something to fix the systemic rot in their police system, that would be news. (Not that our cops here are much better&amp;hellip;) Don&amp;rsquo;t really feel like providing links for this one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google is rolling out a new Chrome feature called FloC that allows the browser itself to profile you for ads, instead of using third-party cookies. &lt;a href=&#34;https://seirdy.one/2021/04/16/permissions-policy-floc-misinfo.html&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s some more info.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://margint.blog/2021/04/05/creating-software-at-scale/&#34;&gt;Everyone is still terrible at creating software at scale&lt;/a&gt;. (I would argue humans are terrible at creating anything at scale&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I might not play it, but I like the aesthetic of upcoming Metroidvania &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXDcMVvtPh4&#34;&gt;GetsuFumaDen: Undying Moon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;! Practiced &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1383150746334466051/&#34;&gt;sketching some elaborate hair&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;rsquo;s always a challenge for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tried out &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1382290950483976200/&#34;&gt;these three-cheese donuts from Lola Nena&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;, after I heard about them from a local streamer. Pretty good!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1381509474259673090/&#34;&gt;Airplane! (1980)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/ced0a77eea2857ad31bd014fac3ded9a/&#34;&gt;Live and Let Die (1973)&lt;/a&gt; to continute the James Bond run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt; was mostly set up for the finale next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have also been enjoying &lt;strong&gt;Invincible&lt;/strong&gt;, but I guess that I will reserve commentary until the season is done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did not watch this year&amp;rsquo;s Wrestlemania.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new set, Strixhaven, has dropped on &lt;strong&gt;Magic Arena&lt;/strong&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;m having fun drafting it. Follow along via &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgstrixhaven/&#34;&gt;the MTGStrixhaven tag&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also randomly decided into &lt;strong&gt;Eternal&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Stormbreak open this weekend, did terribly, as could be expected lol. At least I got to open a bunch of packs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other than the card games, I actually didn&amp;rsquo;t get much gaming done this week. I should correct that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/strong&gt; has no progress this past week lol. I really should finish this second run. I did play a bit of &lt;strong&gt;Pac-Man 99&lt;/strong&gt; on the Switch, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t manage to actually win a game, seems harder than Super Mario 99.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Currently reading &lt;strong&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/strong&gt; by Neal Stephenson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia: This past Saturday, our trivia group split into two teams: one played in an Attack on Titan-themed trivia (I didn&amp;rsquo;t join because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be spoiled) while the rest of us played in the regular AboutQuiz, with a poetry-themed game. Coincidentally, we finished in third place for both quizzes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier finale!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Invincible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rose DLC character for Street Fighter V drops on the 19th, part of season 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn will be free on PSN on the 19th, no PS+ required!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final Civ6 balance update drops on the 22nd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A couple of family birthdays next weekend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We actually have two regular trivia events this coming week, since PopQuiz is back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mystery event on Saturday the 24th, I&amp;rsquo;ll post about it if I decide to participate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and Queen Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s husband, has passed away. So has DMX, American rapper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big facebook breach reported, etc. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like news, really. My &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1379404077319168000/&#34;&gt;phone number was among the data leaked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The country is still experiencing a surge in cases, hospitals and  ICUs still bursting to capacity. Yet in spite of the crisis, the president has not been around. This has prompted questions of whether he&amp;rsquo;s  still alive. This in turn prompted multiple proof-of-life photos and videos from the senator-who-is-also-presidential-assistant, some of which &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/News5PH/status/1380408229495119875&#34;&gt;may or may have been photoshopped&lt;/a&gt;. We are told he will make a public appearance Monday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of the president, it feels like an ABS-CBN reporter did more to defend our sovereignty vs China when &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/multimedia/slideshow/04/09/21/china-boat-chase-abscbn-news-team-chiara-zambrano&#34;&gt;they went to report on Chinese vessels near Ayungin Shoal and were harassed for their trouble&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After two weeks of ECQ, the NCR+ bubble is &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ABSCBNNews/status/1381142347489013761&#34;&gt;now placed under MECQ status until the end of the month&lt;/a&gt;. No, I have no idea what that means.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once again, the Philippines in the international news after &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/07/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-cases?#a-man-died-after-being-forced-to-do-300-squats-for-breaking-curfew-in-the-philippines&#34;&gt;a man died because he was made to do 300 squats for breaking curfew&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Wrestlemania weekend! And apparently it&amp;rsquo;s a two-night event this year. I don&amp;rsquo;t really follow WWE anymore, but I do often take the time to at least watch Wrestlemania and the Royal Rumble every year, so I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can get myself a copy somehow.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;! My favorite sketch for this week is of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1379656430081351687/&#34;&gt;Akira Kazama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOdgfo7OaLI&#34;&gt;upcoming fighter&lt;/a&gt; in the Street Fighter V season 5 DLC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/first-sinovac-dose/&#34;&gt;got my first dose of Sinovac vaccine today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing the James Bond run with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/8fd56682f77942eb0badef9444d465a4/&#34;&gt;Diamonds are Forever (1971)&lt;/a&gt;, Connery&amp;rsquo;s last outing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt; was great, and those last 10 minutes were intense!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other than that, just the usual weekly shows, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday gaming group decided to pick up &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1075190/A_Game_of_Thrones_The_Board_Game__Digital_Edition/&#34;&gt;Game of Thrones The Boardgame on Steam!&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve played this one IRL before, only once, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t remember much. The digital version reminds me why: It&amp;rsquo;s super complicated! Our first game took two hours, I didn&amp;rsquo;t win. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have time for a second one since I had to get up early for the vaccine appointment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses still progressing very slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This month&amp;rsquo;s Humble Choice was revealed, and was meh for me, so I immediately paused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did get Days Gone via PS+ on PS4 though, I might actually play that one. Though they are also planning to give away Horizon Zero Dawn sometime this month, that might be a higher priority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Finished reading Alexis Ohanian&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Without-Their-Permission-Century-Managed/dp/1455520020&#34;&gt;Without Their Permission&lt;/a&gt;, will write a review soonish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our trivia group posted a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1379623251479908354/#comments&#34;&gt;new trivia video&lt;/a&gt;. Like and subscribe to the channel etc. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly just us playing games and trivia, having fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;h3 id=&#34;the-on-site-process&#34;&gt;The on-site process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got my first shot of the Sinovac vaccine earlier today at Pinyahan Elementary School in Quezon City. My appointment was for 9am, I arrived on-site a bit before 8:30am. There was a short queue outside, so I waited there for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 9am, they called out for anyone booked for 9am and let us inside. They handed us health screening forms and waivers to fill up while we were queued up inside. So many steps!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;initial screening to verify your appointment and categorization (I was under A3 - person with comorbidity) and your QC residence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vitals check (temp and blood pressure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;second screening to&amp;hellip; review things again?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;third screening to check my patient id against the online registration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fourth screening to review medical conditions and hand me my vaccination card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(inside the vaccination room) one more screening to verify registration and some medical things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finally get the shot!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after the shot, go to another room for observation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they take your blood pressure first, then you have to wait for a bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every so often someone comes in to give a briefing about possible side effects and what to do for the second dose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every 20-30 mins, they call out who are the people who are cleared and can already go home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the shot a bit before 11am, and was done by 11:30am. All in all about 3 hours for me on site, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s only because they had to start late? I imagine if your time slot was 11am, it&amp;rsquo;d be a bit quicker for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing this around 3 hours after I got the shot, feeling fine, no apparent ill effects, though they said to monitor for up to 6 hours after the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly satisfied with how things were handled on-site, mostly because the past few days I&amp;rsquo;ve heard horror stories about chaos at some of the other sites, mostly because some sites allegedly allowed walk-ins. The staff at Pinyahan were handling things as well as could be expected, although the whole process felt a bit too redundant with all the checks. Here, when someone asked outside if walkins would be accepted, they were told that the doses available for the day were only those allocated for those who had booked online. Also, they did that annoying thing with the queues for people sitting in chairs where every few minutes you&amp;rsquo;d have to get up and scoot over to the next chair over, until you eventually got to the front of the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;online-registration-and-processes&#34;&gt;Online registration and processes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least the on-site process was a bit better than the online registration, which was kind of a disaster. Basically, early on they said vaccinations would be handled via their Quezon City ID initiative, so people should sign up for that. I applied for mine digitally, while the parents submitted paper forms to the barangay, since someone came around the subdivision surveying seniors who wanted to be registered. My QC ID was approved after a couple of weeks, but up to now still no word on my parents&amp;rsquo; QC ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime in March, they announced that there would be two ways to get vaccinated: one was to register via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.ezconsult.io/&#34;&gt;app.ezconsult.io&lt;/a&gt;, or if you had a QC ID, you could wait for the LGU/barangay personnel to process the lists and give you an appointment. Second option felt like it might take a while, so I went ahead and created an account for myself on ezconsult. My plan was to create an account for the parents after I&amp;rsquo;d seen the process, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to successfully book a vaccine appointment because apparently I had registered too early and the integration hadn&amp;rsquo;t been enabled yet??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, they announced ezconsult was available for everybody, so I proceeded and was able to book an appointment for april 27th, the earliest I had seen available. Weirdly, when I was searching for vaccination sites, it included sites in other cities like Las Pinas, who I assume also have an arrangement with ezconsult. I also created accounts for the parents and submitted them for review. When filling up the form expressing interest in vaccination, some of the fields still assumed you were a health worker, since this sytem was initially used for the A1 priority groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people online were reporting problems with the app saying the email was already taken; turns out they had batch imported some QC ID data and auto-created accounts for those people without informing them, so people had to reset passwords (something a nontechnical person wouldn&amp;rsquo;t think to try!). Since I had created my account before this import, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a problem. Then there also were reports of people being able to book vaccination schedules without being one of the currently allowed priority groups; apparently the site doesn&amp;rsquo;t validate for that. And because Sinovac, the only widely available vaccine in the country, was not advised for seniors, QC government had to advice seniors not to book yet since there were very few stocks of Astra Zeneca for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while my brother, who had previously registered the same slot as me on the 27th, mentioned he had been able to reschedule to an earlier slot, today at 9am. I was like, how did you do that? When I checked the app I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see any free time slots available earlier than the 27th. Checking online, a lot of people were reporting there were free slots, while others said they couldn&amp;rsquo;t see any, so I assume they were doing some kind of manual / batch updates to set free slots, I ended up having to check every few days. It was only last Thursday I was only able to reschedule my appointment to today. And at that time, my parent&amp;rsquo;s accounts were still under review!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then last Friday, the ezconsult app was down for most of the day for some reason. (So, I was lucky to rebook right before that!) Lots of complaints from people, of course. By Saturday morning they were back up, and thankfully, I found that my parents accounts&amp;rsquo; could now schedule an appointment! Except&amp;hellip; there were no slots available again! At this time, the QC government had to send out advisories telling people not to go if they weren&amp;rsquo;t among the priority groups, as apparently large numbers of such people were causing chaos at some of the sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in the queues earlier, I asked about the availability of AstraZeneca for seniors, but I was told they didn&amp;rsquo;t have any today and couldn&amp;rsquo;t say if it would be available until the day itself when they got their deliveries. A few days ago, the FDA had approved Sinovac for seniors, so the few senior citizens in the queues today were getting Sinovac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I got my shot, we were told by a doctor in the observation room that the system would send us an automated email about the schedule for the second shot, but we were told to DISREGARD IT and instead come back on the date specified at the back of the vaccination card. So, their automation wasn&amp;rsquo;t going well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I can&amp;rsquo;t really blame the developers of the app for all the problems, I can only imagine the rapid pace of changing requirements they were subjected to, especially with the flip-flopping on whether seniors could go, or comorbids could go, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully all of the problems are just growing pains and such, and that the systems and processes get better and clearer as time goes on, since we definitely to ramp up and scale up vaccination in this country! Not to mention, they also need to provide alternative methods of registration/scheduling for non-technical people (probably requires legwork by barangay officials), as right now the process is largely inaccessible to the poorer sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s April! Or as it&amp;rsquo;s otherwise known, March 2020 month 13. As is usual, we are suffering the sweltering summer heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it&amp;rsquo;s Easter Sunday, if that means anything to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surprising almost no one, the PH government extended the ECQ lockdown in the NCR+ bubble. Anyone with half a brain could have told you that the one week ECQ was no way going to be enough, given what we know about the virus&amp;rsquo; life cycle. Meanwhile, we continued to hit record numbers of new cases, our 7-day rolling average now the highest in SEA since the pandemic began. It&amp;rsquo;s like we&amp;rsquo;re in the same situation we were in last year, except the numbers are much, much higher. And yet our leadership is like &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/inquirerdotnet/status/1377810270500790274&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not so bad, even France has lockdowns!&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Sigh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Austin Kleon reminds us that we all need &lt;a href=&#34;https://austinkleon.com/2018/01/19/something-to-look-forward-to/&#34;&gt;something to look forward to&lt;/a&gt;. (Arbitrary stupid goals!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was fascinated by this &lt;a href=&#34;https://theconversation.com/the-man-with-no-plot-how-i-watched-lee-child-write-a-jack-reacher-novel-51220&#34;&gt;article about how Lee Child writes Jack Reacher novels on the fly&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because that seems like the sort of &amp;ldquo;less work&amp;rdquo; approach I&amp;rsquo;d prefer when writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a curiosity: &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law&#34;&gt;Benford&amp;rsquo;s Law&lt;/a&gt;, or the law of anomalous numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://newrepublic.com/article/161106/defense-nothing&#34;&gt;In defense of doing nothing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent a long time working with Java projects, so &lt;a href=&#34;https://advancedweb.hu/a-categorized-list-of-all-java-and-jvm-features-since-jdk-8-to-16/&#34;&gt;this long list of new features from Java 8 to 16&lt;/a&gt; was interesting to me. After reading this, I asked my old workmates what version of Java they were now using, and they were still on Java 8, the same version as when I left there 6 years ago! Time flows differently in the enterprise universe I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My friends were amazed I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-1Ue0FFrHY&#34;&gt;Long, Long Man japanese commercials&lt;/a&gt; before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Peu6lw0nido&#34;&gt;this case study by Elsa Charretier of a Hawkeye comic book panel by David Aja&lt;/a&gt;. Probably helpful in my own sketching! Subscribed to her channel as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sony announced that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-store-shut-down-ps3-vita-psp&#34;&gt;they will be shutting down the PS3, Vita and PSP stores&lt;/a&gt;. End of an era really. A lot of people are complaining about content that will be forever lost, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure that there are people working to archive this stuff and make it available through other means. &lt;em&gt;Wink wink&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a person with comorbidities (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2005/05/hypertension/&#34;&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;), I&amp;rsquo;m in vaccine priority group A3, right after senior citizens (A2s). And since the stock of AstraZeneca is limited, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/QCGov/status/1377997094431129606&#34;&gt;QC is now allowing A3s to go ahead of A2s&lt;/a&gt;, so I was able to book a vaccine appointment on the 27th. Its a ways off, but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that means they&amp;rsquo;ve learned to streamline their on-site processes by then, so hopefully things go smoothly. It&amp;rsquo;s weird to have booked a schedule even before the more at-risk parents though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a bid to minimize having to go outside, we decided to try ordering groceries online via &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.metromart.com/&#34;&gt;Metromart&lt;/a&gt;. The first-time experience wasn&amp;rsquo;t great; we had to buy from a different grocery (since our usual one wasn&amp;rsquo;t available), not all the regular items we needed were there, and some items were way more expensive. And worst of all, I ordered Tostitos cheese dip and they bought spinach dip instead!! The weird thing is, there were some other items that were out of stock that they called me about (even though I explicitly set that if there were missing items, just don&amp;rsquo;t buy them??), yet for the dip, they just went ahead and bought a different flavor. I ended up having a long convo with their customer support about how disappointed I was, and somehow despite saying there&amp;rsquo;s nothing they could do, they later ended up offering me P100 store credit as compensation. I guess it will be useful if ever we decide to try this again. Anyway, we ended up doing a supplementary grocery run yesterday to cover the items the online delivery didn&amp;rsquo;t get (and the cheese dip!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only one movie watched this week, continuing the James Bond run: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1a1ab3ad610478ba3b672b0a89c26333/&#34;&gt;On Her Majesty&amp;rsquo;s Secret Service (1969)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supergirl&lt;/strong&gt; has started up again, carrying over baggage from the cut-short previous season, same as Flash. The writing was marginally better though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt; was pretty good, though I still found Wandavision more exciting overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tried grinding to Master Rank in Eternal on the last day of the month, but I ran out of time with half a level to go. Sigh. Arena I didn&amp;rsquo;t even bother and ended the month in platinum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a couple of Civ6 games, mostly achievement hunting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a bit more &lt;strong&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/strong&gt;, now down to 1 achievement remaining, but it requires going through all the secret levels, I think?? That might take a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s multiplayer games with friends: Blood Rage, Sentinels of the Multiverse, Root, and Orcs Must Die 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Finished reading Discworld&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Men at Arms!&lt;/strong&gt;, maybe I can write book review(s) this week. Need to find a new book to read, probably a nonfiction one this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was the second Holy Week in a row where we were just stuck at home all day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Falcon and Winter Soldier, Invincible, One Piece, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the last weekend of March. It feels like the month went by quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local covid response: The government introduced the concept of an &amp;ldquo;NCR Plus&amp;rdquo; bubble last Monday, restricting travel in and out of the NCR and adjacent provinces, in response to the rising cases. Still, the daily counts kept rising, hitting record highs of almost 10k cases daily. Even before the dust has settled on the bubble response, they decided to announce last night a reversion to the stricter ECQ. Shades of last year, during the run up to the first lockdown announcement: rumors circulated via chat groups about the impending lockdown before the government finally made their announcement. As can be expected, memes quickly circulated about how we came back to ECQ more than a year after the first lockdown. The lockdown is imposed only for one week, during the Holy Week period, presumably to take advantage of the two holidays in the week to minimize economic impact. The fact that they imposed two different levels of responses one after another &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1375737016407625729/&#34;&gt;reeks of poor planning and analysis&lt;/a&gt;, as if they were just making all this up as they go along, which might not be far from the truth. What happens if the case counts continue to rise until next Sunday?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a bit of economically-devastating-yet-unintentionally-hilarious world news: a very large container ship, the MV EVER GIVEN, ran aground in the Suez Canal, blocking passage, and has been stuck there since Tuesday-ish, clogging up global shipping trade through the canal. Apparently losses are at the order of $400M per hour or something? IDK, I&amp;rsquo;m not an economist. All I&amp;rsquo;m sure of is the internet almost immediately produced a &lt;a href=&#34;https://nypost.com/2021/03/25/the-best-suez-canal-memes-the-stuck-ship-ever-given-inspired/&#34;&gt;bunch of memes&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=&#34;https://jezebel.com/yes-people-are-writing-horny-fanfic-about-the-suez-can-1846562940&#34;&gt;horny fanfic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read this interesting post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.ayjay.org/blogging-and-the-blogosphere/&#34;&gt;blogging and the blogosphere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something that interested me mostly for trivia purposes: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nme.com/photos/30-covers-that-are-better-than-the-originals-1405281&#34;&gt;30 covers that are better than the originals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/mar/22/douglas-adams-note-to-self-reveals-author-found-writing-torture&#34;&gt;Douglas Adams&amp;rsquo; note to self reveals author found writing torture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul Graham reminds us to &lt;a href=&#34;http://paulgraham.com/simply.html&#34;&gt;write simply&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Sketching, sketching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing my run on the Bond movies with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/fb71576d1974213ea471b5cda8a20948/&#34;&gt;You Only Live Twice (1967)&lt;/a&gt;. Secret volcano lair!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also managed to convince myself to sit down and watch &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/snyder-cut/&#34;&gt;Zack Snyder&amp;rsquo;s Justice League&lt;/a&gt;. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t manage to sit down for four hours straight, so it was two sittings over two days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second episode of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier last Friday. Still a bit meh, mostly because there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been anything I haven&amp;rsquo;t expected yet. But that&amp;rsquo;s bound to change as I think all the content from the trailers have been shown by now. Some good acting by Sebastian Sean though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finished watching &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek The Animated Series&lt;/strong&gt;, Star Trek TV series completion!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First 3 episodes &lt;strong&gt;Invincible&lt;/strong&gt; have dropped on Prime Video. Most of the first episode is good, clean superhero fun, but by the end of the episode you are dissuaded of that notion. Pretty good pacing, seems mostly accurate to the source material, looking forward to the rest of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also been rewatching The Office as my background watching, mostly because I listened to a podcast of Office trivia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run: Still ongoing, somehow. It feels like I&amp;rsquo;m doing these in real time, only advancing one week of the game per week of real life. At that rate, I should be done in like six months lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After five years of playing Street Fighter V, I managed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1374367400276025345/&#34;&gt;dig myself out of the pits of the bronze ranks and hit silver&lt;/a&gt;! Surprisingly, on the next two days after this, I had trouble finding ranked matches again. I took that as a sign to take a break before attempting to climb up to gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final Civ6 NFP drop came out as expected. Not super hyped, but I have started a Portugal game already, they seem really strong especially on island maps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strixhaven official previews kicked off, and I&amp;rsquo;m really hyped for the set, mostly because I really &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1375147827110629379/&#34;&gt;like the Mystical Archive cards&lt;/a&gt;. Collecting all of them on Arena is gonna be a challenge though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supposedly Magic Arena is now available &amp;ldquo;everywhere&amp;rdquo; on mobile, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/mdf9dp/androidios_versions_not_available_in_southeast/&#34;&gt;not in Southeast Asia though&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; I mentioned last week that I started reading the Discworld book &amp;ldquo;Guards! Guards!&amp;rdquo;, but for some reason everything seemed so familiar, and soon I realized it was because I had &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/12/805050532834353152/&#34;&gt;already read it back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Doh! I was enjoying it anyway, so I finished the re-read and will probably publish a review, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have one in 2016. But I&amp;rsquo;ll finish the next City Watch book first: Men at Arms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AboutQuiz this week a bit better than last week, but I still miss the other trivia groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1374212757189369861/&#34;&gt;I hit the 800-day streak on Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New FatWS episode, etc etc. I presume new Invincible episode as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe the world will miraculously be better next week? IDK, one can always hope right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Holy Week! Normally a big deal for the RC faithful in this country, but this time everyone has to stay at home for the second year in a row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ECQ! Well, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect me much, though there are now some errands that we have to push back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over the past couple of days, our nationwide daily covid cases broke 7000+, the highest recorded so far.  Have to be super careful when going out for errands. Not that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t being careful even before, mind you. Just now, government has announced we are still under GCQ (see my post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1373562580375986178/&#34;&gt;the PH quarantine levels&lt;/a&gt;), but with more restrictions, etc. Looks like they are still hesitant to provide a stronger lockdown which would require paying people to stay home so they don&amp;rsquo;t starve to death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.protocol.com/internet-archive-preserving-future&#34;&gt;The internet is splitting apart. The Internet Archive wants to save it all forever. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/01/checklist-achievements-happiness-boxes/617756/&#34;&gt;Stop Keeping Score&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also could&amp;rsquo;ve sworn there was a bunch of funny stuff I read on Twitter this week that I can&amp;rsquo;t find anymore. I need to get better at marking/sharing things I find funny or interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Sketching, sketching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing my run on the Bond movies with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/273eae12d668c24135d4db358511c9d4/&#34;&gt;Goldfinger (1964)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/c6152994fa5ddf4b9c3302bcddfdd699/&#34;&gt;Thunderall (1965)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I keep threatening to watch the Snyder Cut, but have yet to find a four hour block of time to do it. FOUR HOURS!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, I watched the first episode of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Kind of meh, though I appreciate the emotional angles they&amp;rsquo;re going for. Might have been more hyped if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware a certain character was going to be introduced in this series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finished watching &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;, now almost through the Animated Series. Almost to Star Trek TV series completion!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run: Still ongoing, somehow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to play Valkyria Chronicles 4 on Steam since I got it from Humble Choice, but since I&amp;rsquo;m still in the middle of a Fire Emblem run I keep putting it off. It feels weird to have two anime-styled tactical RPGs running at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I actually managed to finish a run of &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127610/Iris_and_the_Giant/&#34;&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/a&gt;! I still have a few more achievements to get, then I&amp;rsquo;ll probably write a review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually managed to play a fair bit of Street Fighter V over the past week, after getting inspired by watching some Justin Wong videos. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve found the sweet spot / happy hour for actually finding matches where I am, so here&amp;rsquo;s hoping to play more moving forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Finished reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/neuromancer/&#34;&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/a&gt;. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d follow it up with some lighter reading, so I got started on a Discworld book: &amp;ldquo;Guards! Guards!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/2021-site-update/&#34;&gt;Site changes applied!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We did an AboutQuiz this week, but it was terrible (for our team at the very least). I&amp;rsquo;m hoping the more mainstream pop culture trivia quizzes like PopQuiz and Geekfight come back some time soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe (could be wrong) that the Invincible animated series is coming out on Prime Video at the end of the week. I read a fair bit of the comic, though I don&amp;rsquo;t remember much of the later parts, so I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to this. I feel like JK Simmons as the protag&amp;rsquo;s dad is going to turn out to be a great casting decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;final drop in the Civ6 New Frontier pass, with new Civ Portugal, is coming out this week. I&amp;rsquo;m not very hyped for it, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy the recent barbarian update too much, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll give it a go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Falcon and Winter Soldier etc etc. WandaVision really got going by the end of episode 3, but FatWS is only 2/3rds as many episodes, so I assume important things are gonna be happening in episode 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Happy Pi Day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the one year anniversary of the world&amp;rsquo;s longest lockdown. In some kind of sick anniversary celebration, local covid cases are on the rise. Yesterday, 5000 new cases were reported, the highest daily rate in 6 months or so. And now a Philippine variant has been detected. Now is not the time to be complacent, we all need to be more careful. The government seems unwilling to impose another widespread ECQ and are focusing on targetted, granular lockdowns. Not sure how effective this would be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://seirdy.one/2020/11/23/website-best-practices.html&#34;&gt;An opinionated list of best practices for textual websites&lt;/a&gt;. Reading this reminded me there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of updates to this website I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bikobatanari.neocities.org/posts/2020/personal-museum.html&#34;&gt;My Website is a Personal Museum: the creative freedom we lost in the age of social media&lt;/a&gt;. This article, and the referenced &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/&#34;&gt;How the Blog Broke The Web&lt;/a&gt; are nostalgic for the days of curated homepages instead of blogs/social media platforms characterized by chronological feeds. Taking these into account as I consider how to reorganize the content on this website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/19/can-not-quit-facebook/&#34;&gt;Facebook invested heavily in the one feature it knew people couldn’t leave behind: Their groups&lt;/a&gt;. It kind of feels like an opportunity for a new contender to sneak in and develop a better social media platform that&amp;rsquo;s group-centered. Yahoo Groups provided this service in the 00s, but Yahoo being Yahoo, they screwed it up and YG had to close up last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/KimsConvenience/status/1369013822145576964&#34;&gt;Kim&amp;rsquo;s Convenience has been cancelled&lt;/a&gt;. I liked &lt;a href=&#34;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/kims-convenience-the-end-of-the-dream&#34;&gt;Noahpinion&amp;rsquo;s writeup about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;, not missing a beat apparently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in the final season of &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also started reading up on the show&amp;rsquo;s reception, which apparently wasn&amp;rsquo;t great, especially compared to the other Trek shows it succeeded. Not surprising, but the show isn&amp;rsquo;t that bad, really. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of doing a blog post reviewing all the Trek shows, but I should probably watch The Animated Series first for completion purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a long time now I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to watch the old pre-Brosnan Bond movies, which I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen. Maybe mostly for trivia purposes. I got started on this last week with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/2b14f8356f57460da0a4790b27b44b8a/&#34;&gt;Dr No (1962)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/096b7c67797c165b01283d0c7cd6c016/&#34;&gt;From Russia With Love (1963)&lt;/a&gt;. Side note: I&amp;rsquo;m a bit amazed about how they&amp;rsquo;re able to do a sequel based on the success of the previous film in just a year. Modern day Hollywood films cost so much and are so complicated the typical spacing for sequels is at least three years. Next is Goldfinger!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run: Such slow progress, but progress nonetheless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still trying to finish &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127610/Iris_and_the_Giant/&#34;&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Still very slowly reading cyberpunk classic &lt;em&gt;Neurmancer&lt;/em&gt; by William Gibson. I&amp;rsquo;m about 75% through, so maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll finish this in a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started applying some layout changes and other stuff to the site, things will probably be moving around for a bit. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll write a blog post about it when I&amp;rsquo;m done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coming out this week: Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Zack Snyder&amp;rsquo;s Justice League! More looking forward to FatWS than ZSJL obviously. I am awaiting ZSJL with more of a morbid curiosity than anything else, i.e. my expectations are low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have more medical errands to conduct this week, seems like a bad habit that I keep having to get into too often. Comes with the age, I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;March has begun. Did it ever really end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vaccination finally starts in the country, with initial donated batches of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccine arriving in the country. Just in time for the one year anniversary of the world&amp;rsquo;s longest lockdown. SinoVac isn&amp;rsquo;t the best choice, but many of my doctor friends say they&amp;rsquo;ll settle for it if that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s available for them. I think QC is planning to use AstraZeneca for their citizens, but worrying is that AZ&amp;rsquo;s efficacy has been shown to be not so good against certain variants such as the South African one, which has already been detected in the country. Cases have been on the rise in the past couple of weeks as well, possibly due to the variants. We may very well be in a race against time now (maybe we always have been). The next month may be the most crucial phase of the pandemic for us, as vaccination drives hopefully kick into gear to try to overcome the accelerating spread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohhelloana.blog/catching-up-on-my-bookmarks/&#34;&gt;OhHelloAna.blog shared a whole bunch of bookmarks&lt;/a&gt;. Quite a few look interesting. Looking forward to going through this list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/&#34;&gt;Great article about cutting loading times in GTA&lt;/a&gt; went around last week. A case study in the problems with blindly relying on dependencies perhaps, and the complexities of C code performance, and even software performance in general.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rachel True had &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RachelTrue/status/1365461618977476610&#34;&gt;problems with iCloud&lt;/a&gt; after accidentally inputting her last name in lowercase. Feels like the sort of thing that can be maybe part of standard QA test suites? Hope she gets it resolved soon!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this fan video: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UngE0qn3VRY&#34;&gt;What if Wes Anderson directed X-Men?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/NonsenseIsland/status/1366449816042102787&#34;&gt;this thread on classical music in classic cartoons&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m no musical expert by any means, so it was even educational for me!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve switched back to doing digital sketches via Procreate, with kind of a different style this time? I kind of like it, more or less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today I was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/lzagfz/eli5_whats_the_difference_between_joules_watts/gq0i81h/?context=3&#34;&gt;mentioned via the u/hungryroy syntax on reddit&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. Not a big deal, I was just surprised lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally the pandemic and the quarantine hasn&amp;rsquo;t hit me as bad as other folks. My day to day routine hasn&amp;rsquo;t actually changed that much, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t really go out too often even pre-pandemic. That being said, I do miss being able to go out to places just to wander around, take my daily walk in a public place like &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1366349139559129088/&#34;&gt;the QC circle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/01/saturday-morning-up/&#34;&gt;the university campus&lt;/a&gt;, or even just loitering at the mall. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I miss being able to hang out with other people (although I do to some degree as well). More like I miss the ability to be outside, alone, in public, just sitting quietly and letting the universe wash over me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; is done! Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/wandavision/&#34;&gt;a spoiler-free review&lt;/a&gt;, something I used to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/spoiler-free-review/&#34;&gt;do more regularly&lt;/a&gt;. I have more spoiler-related thoughts, but they may be too much for this space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m almost done with season 2 of &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;, which means I&amp;rsquo;m about halfway through the series overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Flash&lt;/strong&gt; started its new season last week, but it feels like their episodes are like 90% nonsense now. (Used to be closer to 60% nonsense.). Second ep of &lt;strong&gt;Superman and Lois&lt;/strong&gt; was okay, although we are definitely getting more moody teenager problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run: still WIP. Moving forward slowly, ever so slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got last month&amp;rsquo;s Humble Choice, and decided to go ahead and install and try out some of the games in the bundle.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started by playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127610/Iris_and_the_Giant/&#34;&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice little tactical battle indie game with CCG mechanics &amp;ndash; think Slay the Spire, but with turn-based tactical RPG battles that can also feel very puzzle-like. I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying well-designed indie games recently, and this one seems to fall into that bucket. It has a unique, minimalist aesthetic and the story is about a young girl&amp;rsquo;s mental health? Maybe? I&amp;rsquo;ll know more if I actually managed to finish a run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also tried to play a game of &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/392110/Endless_Space_2/&#34;&gt;Endless Space 2&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not unfamiliar with 4X games of course, but this one was a bit confusing for me. In the one game where I managed to get anywhere, it felt like I was always behind in tech, and there&amp;rsquo;s so many indicators and UI elements on the different views that I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand. I can see there&amp;rsquo;s going to be a learning curve for this one, so it may take a few games for me to get the hang of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of Humble choice, the next one has Control as a showcase game, but I already got that off PS+, so I think I&amp;rsquo;m pausing on this one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday regular gaming group decided to play &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1015930/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/a&gt; again yesterday, and we found out there was new DLC so we all decided to buy that and try it out. Might do a review for this game this week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also did quite a few Starcraft 2 1v1s with friends this past week. I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself very proficient with SC2, mostly because I&amp;rsquo;m very micro-averse, but I still enjoy playing it. Maybe not ladder though. We recorded some of our games, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bINjaPjt1M&#34;&gt;the first one is up on the Team Camote youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;, if you&amp;rsquo;d like to watch me be terrible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of reasons, I browsed some Ludum Dare games the other day. My favorite is this short and simple one: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/a-monster-hunter-story&#34;&gt;A Monster Hunter Story&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Still very slowly reading cyberpunk classic &lt;em&gt;Neurmancer&lt;/em&gt; by William Gibson. I&amp;rsquo;m about halfway through, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I understand everything that&amp;rsquo;s going on. Might need to look for a recap later on. Still, I soldier on!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh, nothing. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s going to be one of those weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A while back I saw &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/thorstenball/status/1317488308285558784&#34;&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt; talking about drawing memes from before the internet, and I was reminded that was a thing we had around here too when we were kids!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had our own version of that &amp;ldquo;giraffe in the window&amp;rdquo; drawing, except the one I remember was made so that you could switch the answer to &amp;ldquo;cat hugging a pole outside the window&amp;rdquo; to troll whoever you were asking to guess:&lt;/p&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#3e378b94e9485846954887298c03fb57-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/pinoy-drawing-memes/giraffe_huebf412353da86573fd7078a4d4fb0161_188068_300x0_resize_box_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;3e378b94e9485846954887298c03fb57-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/pinoy-drawing-memes/giraffe.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;6 Jan 2021 6:25am&#34;&gt;6 Jan 2021 6:25am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common ones I remember were the ones involving a &amp;ldquo;man wearing a straw hat/salakot&amp;rdquo;, a typical depiction of rural people back in the day. The drawing would just be two concentric circles (see #1 below), representing the view of the man from above.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest in the picture above are kind of specific to local flavor. Can you guess what they are? Answers in the spoiler tag below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;details class=&#34;spoiler&#34;&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;(Spoilers)&lt;/summary&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#2: magtataho. Basically a man carrying two pails across a stick he carries on his shoulders; this is the typical way taho is sold on the streets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#3: sorbetero. An ice cream man on foot with a cart in front of him containing ice cream; a typical way ice cream used to be sold back in the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#4: a guy peeing against a wall in public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#5: another guy peeing against a wall in public, except he&amp;rsquo;s laughing at a joke #4 is saying while they pee together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are others I can&amp;rsquo;t remember, and probably others that younger generations made up. Maybe some pinoy friends will chime in?&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;These weeknotes are coming in late in the day because of reasons. (The reasons being laziness and procrastination.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been kind of phoning in the weeknotes over the past few weeks, they&amp;rsquo;ve mostly been &amp;ldquo;hey, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy, so nothing of significance happened, but here are some things I watched/played.&amp;rdquo; Supposedly one of the side effects of writing regular updates is that you tend to look out for more interesting things to do so you have something to write about, even on an unconscious level. In the past few weeks, that has been problematic because (a) as mentioned, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with some things, so my excess time is devoted to less mentally taxing things like just watching movies/shows or destress with games; and (b) we are still in the middle of a pandemic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the pandemic, I read this piece recently on the Financial Times: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ft.com/content/32d79c87-1ade-4b63-8d14-7af1a553d963&#34;&gt;We won’t remember much of what we did in the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, about how the sameyness of our days in quarantine means our brains compress that data since so little of it is meaningful, affecting our perception of time. When 99% of your activities take place in the same environment, in your room during a zoom call, everything just tends to blur together. And I guess that reflected in the weeknotes too! (For that reason, I&amp;rsquo;m switching up the weeknotes format today to be more freeform prose, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if it sticks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the pandemic part 2, one thing I have been doing since the pandemic started is writing a regular series of notes, first as &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/covid19/&#34;&gt;one long post that I kept updating every couple of days or so&lt;/a&gt; then later I transitioned to regular weekly update notes, on the same day as these weeknotes. The idea was that in the future I could just browse the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/covid19/&#34;&gt;covid19 tag&lt;/a&gt; on the site and I could recall what things were like during the days of quarantine and the quality of the government response. And this was fine during the start, since things happened and unfolded quickly. But these past few months, the updates have fallen in the quagmire of sameyness as well: I only went out once every 1 or 2 weeks, everything was always getting worse, cases were always going up, government response was always terrible, and so on. One thing the last few months has made clear for me is that the government has no clear plan on controlling this thing and so I am highly pessimistic that things will change anytime soon. For that reason, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to pause on doing the covid19 update notes for now, unless some drastic change happens.(I have no expectation of Russia&amp;rsquo;s vaccine having any effect on our status quo anytime soon!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so how was my week? I wrapped up the things causing my busy-ness towards the middle of the week, so I expect to be less busy/stressed during the coming weeks. At the very least, I should be able to write on the blog more, and maybe do some work on some of my other side projects. I actually thought about writing some posts already last week but I was like you know what, I&amp;rsquo;ll just relax and watch things and play things and leave the writing to next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching and playing the past week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marvel&amp;rsquo;s Agents of SHIELD had their series finale last Thursday. I enjoyed the first half of this season, but the second half and the finale were just ok, maybe slightly meh. Still, the series finale was pretty good, wrapping things up nicely with a big bow. This series had a lot of haters, I think mostly because of mismatched expectations, because people wanted it to be more directly tied-in to the MCU movies, but that was never going to happen (maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll get that more with the coming Disney+ series). But I like it, it had a lot of fans, and it had a pretty good run. And it had Ghost Rider!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One things I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a bunch is Amonkhet Remastered, which came out on Magic Arena last Thursday. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing drafts over on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&#34;&gt;the twitch channel&lt;/a&gt;, and archiving them to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsD8jNRlYkw&amp;amp;list=PLmU0vkKslGXg6Pdu3_kaKx5oumTwftUUe&#34;&gt;this playlist on the Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly fun, though I need to play better. Watch me on Twitch/Youtube, or like and subscribe, all that jazz, if you like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oh, I also finally finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/08/1293051269129486337/&#34;&gt;Divinity Original Sin 2&lt;/a&gt;! I really dragged out that last act for a few months, but I finally got there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/08/1294146833359364097/&#34;&gt;tried out Fall Guys on PS4&lt;/a&gt; (free on PS+!). It&amp;rsquo;s fun but kind of frustrating, I guess this is why I don&amp;rsquo;t really play these battle royale kind of things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a little bit Street Fighter x Tekken because of a reddit thread and am once again disappointed that (a) it was such a missed opportunity; and (b) up to now it&amp;rsquo;s still not available on Steam in SEA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so one of the reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing these &amp;ldquo;watching/playing lately&amp;rdquo; posts and segments is because I want to track what I have been watching/playing at any particular point in the past. And maybe I can have like a widget on the site with things like &amp;ldquo;Recently played&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Last movie watched&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;d also want to be able to search/query for things like &amp;ldquo;what year did I watch so-and-so movie?&amp;rdquo; (Helps with trivia quizzes!) I feel like I need to be recording these detail in more of a machine-readable format or a database in order to do those kinds of things. Maybe some kind of Goodreads-like system? It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;d need to figure out how to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, this is already longer than I thought it would be. More things will be posted to the blog (hopefully!) later this week!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Still kind of busy, although there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of things I hope I can finally wrap up this week, so I can move on to the long list of other things I want to be doing. The world continues to be bleak, so I&amp;rsquo;m still hiding from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/08/forty-two/&#34;&gt;Forty-two.&lt;/a&gt; I thought about just merging these into a single post for the day, but nah, this seems better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reworking the old charity side project still ongoing. I was hoping to finish all the changes last week and next week would be testing and deployment, but stuff got in the way (and estimates may have been a bit off), but the spillover is small and we should still be fine for finishing everything next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots more SC2 coop this week, mostly in the wee hours to destress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost impulse-bought a Switch yesterday; a friend&amp;rsquo;s logic and my inexorably large gaming backlog held me back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG Arena: Nothing of significance, but Amonkhet remastered comes out this week so looking forward to that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually did a bit better in 1 of the two quizzes we played this week, but I think we had way more fun playing Codenames online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background watching: Jeopardy on Netflix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binged the new Transformers Netflix series, since it was fairly short (six episodes). A very bleak take on the Autobots&amp;rsquo; struggle against the Decepticons on Cybertron, and also a very obvious tie-in to the current War for Cybertron toy line since most of the main characters have toys in that line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also watched Craig Ferguson&amp;rsquo;s Netflix special Tickle Fight, mainly because I happened to have watch a few of his late night segments on YT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also started watching the last season of Agents of SHIELD, since I&amp;rsquo;m told the season finale is coming up next week. First three episodes seem pretty good for network TV, hopefully I have time for the rest of the (short) season in the next couple of weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links: Nothing of note this week. Even though I have read some interesting stuff, I think my link-capturing workflow really needs improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still in a pandemic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So, NCR got sent back into MECQ, a stronger quarantine lockdown. I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually felt the difference, since I&amp;rsquo;m at home most of the time. We went out yesterday for a grocery run, and not much seemed different out there either, still a lot of cars and people out of doors. I don&amp;rsquo;t actually remember what the last MECQ was like, but I kind of assumed things would be closer to how they were at the onset of the lockdowns in March, but this feels still mostly like the GCQ of past weeks. IDK if this 2-week MECQ stretch really serves any purpose except to show the government is trying something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching mass via Facebook again today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 126,885 cases (+4226 from the day before, +28653 from last week, huge jump week-on-week), 2,209 deaths (+41 from the day before, +170 from last week, thankfully not as big a jump as from last week), 67,117 recoveries (+287 from the day before, +1852 from last week, a predictably much smaller jump after last week&amp;rsquo;s miraculous &amp;ldquo;mass recoveries&amp;rdquo;). We hit record high daily deaths again over the first few days of the MECQ. We seem to have settled at a much higher average daily rate since then. Luckily, the death rate hasn&amp;rsquo;t gone up that much. We are now #1 in confirmed cases in SEA, overtaking Indonesia. The govt claims nothing to worry about, it&amp;rsquo;s only because we are testing more, but our relatively large positivity rate (around 8.6% as of this writing) implies transmission is outpacing testing? &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at around 19.8 cases (+1.8M from last week, slope holding steady for maybe 3 weeks now?) and almost 730k deaths. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Kind of a busy week for me again, so the week kind of passed me by quickly. It&amp;rsquo;s August! In one month it will be (PH) Christmas season! It feels like July went by more quickly than other quarantine months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bit of consulting work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reworking the old charity side project still ongoing. I was hoping to finish all the changes last week and next week would be testing and deployment, but stuff got in the way (and estimates may have been a bit off), but the spillover is small and we should still be fine for finishing everything next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starcraft 2 came out with a 10th anniversary patch that had some sweet new features and changes for coop. They added unlockable prestige talents for each of the 18 commanders, each talent alters their gameplay so they play out a bit differently. We had actually been getting a bit bored with SC2 coop and had been playing it less, this patch did a lot to invigorate our enthusiasm for it. We&amp;rsquo;ve been playing it quite a bit to unlock the prestige talents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG Arena: Didn&amp;rsquo;t hit mythic last month, but that&amp;rsquo;s fine. I switched my historic deck to Monored for faster games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only played 1 quiz last week for reasons. Instead, trivia group played some online Codenames (via &lt;a href=&#34;https://codenames.game/&#34;&gt;https://codenames.game/&lt;/a&gt;) on Saturday night, with voice chat over discord. It was a bunch of fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s new episodes of Jeopardy on Netflix, so that quickly replaced Family Guy as my background watching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s actually a bunch of new stuff to watch too: Umbrella Academy S2 is out, there&amp;rsquo;s a new Transformers series on Netflix etc. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get around to all of these things someday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some fixes to the trivia app backend, but I can&amp;rsquo;t really get too much into the (other) side projects until I get past my current busyness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internet seems to be having some DNS issues this past week. Occasionally can&amp;rsquo;t access various URLs, but is fine on refresh. Problem survived multiple router reboots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The right-click button on this gaming mouse I got last year is starting to get less responsive. I only got for $13 in Walmart, but even then it&amp;rsquo;s one of the more expensive mice I&amp;rsquo;ve bought, so I hope it doesn&amp;rsquo;t die too quickly. Maybe I should clean it out?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Couple of somewhat related blog posts resonated with me: &lt;a href=&#34;https://rubenerd.com/why-arent-you-more-serious/&#34;&gt;Why aren’t you more serious?&lt;/a&gt;, asserting the personal blog&amp;rsquo;s right to write about whatever the blogger wants, and not just to focus on specific serious or technical topics; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://om.co/2020/07/30/write-like-a-human/&#34;&gt;Write like a human&lt;/a&gt; is kind of self-explanatory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great follow-up to a previous survey on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pudding.cool/2020/07/song-decay/&#34;&gt;Defining the 90s Music Canon&lt;/a&gt;. Also had an &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/roytang/status/1288899712112717824&#34;&gt;interesting exchange about this with a friend over on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; re:how this might reflect locally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDK, maybe I&amp;rsquo;m getting used to the pandemic. Is this what they mean by &amp;ldquo;new normal&amp;rdquo;? I&amp;rsquo;ll move the pandemic notes to the end of these weekly updates.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Pandemic thoughts and updates, Aug 2 edition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We ended July with around 90k active cases. Despite the threat of sending Metro Manila back to ECQ if we breached the 85k mark, the govt did not push through. Over the weekend, this led to a clamor from doctors and other frontliners to have a &amp;ldquo;time out&amp;rdquo; of 2 weeks for the NCR, a temporary quarantine, to give the healthcare system some breathing room. The knee-jerk response from the palace was to say it wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessary, but they quickly flipped their flops and said the IATF would discuss it. Enraging people and doctors, a certain outspoken-on-social-media doctor tried to shame doctors for not being heroic enough, and a certain senator implied that we can&amp;rsquo;t afford it so frontliners just need to work harder and be more passionate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching mass via Facebook again today. Churches have actually been holding limited physical services, but in solidarity with the call for ECQ, they said they will temporarily suspend such services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went to get some Jollibee takeout last Thursday; apparently they are already allowing limited dine-in customers, that seems unwise, eh. Was anxious the entire time I was waiting for my takeout order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 98232 cases (+4963 from the day before, +19820 from last week, huge jump week-on-week), 2039 deaths (+17 from the day before, +142 from last week, moderate jump), 65265 recoveries (+93 from the day before, +39513 (!) from last week, a miraculous jump). We hit record high daily deaths over the past few days, and the huge spike in recoveries is because the DOH decided to do a &amp;ldquo;mass recovery&amp;rdquo; of mild/asymptomatic cases that are already 14 days or older, supposedly in line with WHO guidelines. I can kind of see some logic behind this, but the communication was not handled very well. &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at around 18M cases (+1.8M from last week) and almost 690k deaths. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hm. I was a bit busy this week, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t paying too much attention, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have too much to rail against today. Well of course, things are still ongoing. There&amp;rsquo;s still the pandemic, fascist police state philosophy continues to rear it&amp;rsquo;s ugly head in the US, PH gov&amp;rsquo;t continues to be dumb, etc., but this week seemed a bit tame comparably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Pandemic thoughts and updates, July 26 edition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching mass via Facebook again today. The nearby Church actually holds services, but last I heard it was only 10 people per mass, and need to call ahead of time. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem likely we&amp;rsquo;ll be going anytime soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grocery run yesterday, without incident&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;last Thursday I finally &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/1286105826743091201/&#34;&gt;got a haircut&lt;/a&gt; my last one was around New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day, so this was around six and a half months of hair cut off. I didn&amp;rsquo;t go to a barbershop, this was a home service haircut, care of a lady who works at a neighboring salon, who actually came over to do some home care service for my mom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 78412 cases (+2019 from the day before, +13108 from last week, slight acceleration week-on-week), 1897 deaths (+20 from the day before, +224 from last week, lower jump than last week), 25752 recoveries (+1278 from the day before, +3685 from last week, much less than last week&amp;rsquo;s jump). The admin claims that if we breach 85k cases by end-July, Metro Manila may go back to NCQ. First, that seems likely to happen so we&amp;rsquo;ll see. Second, it seems a bit unfair and illogical to make Metro Manila&amp;rsquo;s quarantine status dependent on national case numbers, but whatever. &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at 16.2M cases (+1.8M from last week, slight acceleration) and almost 650k deaths. The US retains a comfortable lead over second placer Brazil. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        






    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Busy with rebuilding the UI for the old project. I&amp;rsquo;m having fun with it, so that&amp;rsquo;s something. I think this week went by more quickly for me because of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake completed! Review &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/ff7r-review/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I played through a couple of Civ6 games, trying out the new civs and game modes from the New Frontier pass. Fun and challenging. Apocalypse mode: it&amp;rsquo;s an insane feeling the first time you see a comet strike take out a city. I was actually streaming the gameplay to a friend on Discord when this happened and we both went &amp;ldquo;Woah!&amp;rdquo; and he said that pushed him to get the DLC as well. Secret societies: Only tried Voidsingers so far; their cultists are great for culture victory since they&amp;rsquo;re a constant source of relics for tourism, and the Old God Monument gives you GW slots for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG: Still playing a bunch of JumpStart, but also put together Bant Ramp for Historic. Currently at Diamond 4, I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can grind Mythic for constructed before end of month. Related: I watched Maro&amp;rsquo;s Comic-con stream for Zendikar Rising last night, but left kinda underwhelmed. Set boosters are neat, but I kind of wanted more info/spoilers about the set itself. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to be excited about the set boosters when my MTG involvement is primarily through Arena these days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only played 2 online quizzes this week (the third one didn&amp;rsquo;t fire due to not enough participants). There was a fun Scientists/Inventors round which I could have perfected if I had gone with my gut answer (Rutherford) and not listened to my teammates lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a new season of Family Guy on Netflix, so I&amp;rsquo;ve started to watch that in the background while I&amp;rsquo;m working on other things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I watched a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ew.com/events/comic-con/scott-pilgrim-cast-reunion-table-read/&#34;&gt;for-charity cast-reunion live-table-read for Scott Pilgrim vs the World&lt;/a&gt; last week. I enjoyed it so much, I went and rewatched the movie on Netflix as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technically, this old project I&amp;rsquo;m revamping used to be a &amp;ldquo;side project&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing of note.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;My country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are days when I have to consciously temper my rage at the shenanigans of this government. I can&amp;rsquo;t write about them today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/covid19-07-19/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s pandemic notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a busy work week again; at the same time I also picked up an older charity project where the client asked for UI updates. Had issues with running the old code, and it was small enough, so I decided to rewrite it in a new tech stack. Might write about it at some point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am like 98% through the FF7R hard mode run. I&amp;rsquo;m totally making these percentages up, but I do have only one trophy left, and it&amp;rsquo;s this annoying minigame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started trying out some of the new leaders/civs in the Civ6 New Frontier pack. Another drop should be coming this week, so looking forward to that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG JumpStart is out this week! I tried it a couple of times on Arena. Some combinations are much better than others; the sad things is if you picked a miserable pair you have to stick with it longer before you can get your requisite two wins. Here&amp;rsquo;s an (ongoing) &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/1283901490206109698/&#34;&gt;thread of my JumpStart results&lt;/a&gt; will probably update it through the month it&amp;rsquo;s available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t win any online quiz this week, boo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After watching Atomic Blonde last week, I watched the Old Guard for back-to-back Charlize Theron action flicks. Pretty fun, although some plot points might make you go what?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of stuff coming out in July that I might watch: new season of Umbrella Academy, and there&amp;rsquo;s a Transformers anime coming out on NF, and well, there&amp;rsquo;s also a long backlog of things to watch&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing to note, too busy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;My country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday afternoon the House of Representatives voted to deny the franchise application of the nation&amp;rsquo;s biggest broadcaster ABS-CBN. This despite all agencies of the executive testifying that the company had no violations. Justifications cited were mostly personal reasons. The Palace claims they remained neutral on this issue, but no one really believes that. Probably not even then. What now, Philippines?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/covid19-07-12/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s pandemic notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a busy week work-wise. Learning a lot about Vue and Laravel though, so that&amp;rsquo;s fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am like 95% through the FF7R hard mode run. Only a 5% difference from last week, progress is slow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I bought a few games off the Steam Sale: Civ 6&amp;rsquo;s New Frontiers Pass (not actually on sale), Disco Elysium, and Garou Mark of the Wolves. You can watch me struggling in Garou &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yQ6B9IlwHU&amp;amp;t=70s&#34;&gt;on Youtube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We only played one online quiz this week, didn&amp;rsquo;t do too well D:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I watched Atomic Blonde yesterday. I thought it was like a John Wick style action flick. That&amp;rsquo;s true, but it&amp;rsquo;s also a Cold-War era spy thriller with lots of double-crosses and whatnot. Fairly engaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing to note.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.dev/one-line-layouts/&#34;&gt;Ten modern layouts in one line of CSS&lt;/a&gt;. I could have used this two weeks ago!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.swiss-miss.com/2020/07/alike-an-animated-short-film.html&#34;&gt;Alike, an Animated Short Film&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of an allegory for modern life.&lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;My country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday afternoon the president sighed the controversial &amp;ldquo;Anti-terror law&amp;rdquo; that vastly expands police powers, allows people to be arrested without warrants on mere suspicion of terrorism etc. Interesting timing, right after China applies a new anti-terror low to Hong Kong (and rightly gets castigated for it by countries all over the world) and also right after the PNP (who &lt;em&gt;promise&lt;/em&gt; not to abuse their newfound powers) are under criticism for killing some soldiers in a &lt;em&gt;misencounter&lt;/em&gt; and tampering with the crime scene to cover it up. Many are afraid of the chilling impact on freedom of speech, but I like to think that I will be as complain-y as I used to be. I am privileged to be able to do that, so might as well keep going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Congressmen &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/abscbn-bias-press-freedom/&#34;&gt;tightening the screws on ABS-CBN&lt;/a&gt; during the franchise hearings reminds me that: given how complicated the various laws and statutes are, anyone with an agenda who wants to harass you can always find some obscure laws or regulations that you allegedly violated. That is not to say we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t follow such regulations, but given when one randomly keeps digging up new issues, it becomes obvious that there is a vendetta at work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I often ruminate about what I can do to help the state of my country today. Or maybe even the state of the world? I used to think being a good citizen and making good voting choices was enough, but it&amp;rsquo;s not. The systems are rigged to perpetuate inequality, exploitation, and bad people in power. I read somewhere recently that one should imagine the path towards the future he wishes to claim and take the steps to make it happen, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think my imagination is up to the task at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/covid19-07-05/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s pandemic notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fair bit of consulting work for this coming week, might be busy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have already &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/quitting-facebook/&#34;&gt;deactivated Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. If I would be honest, I still find myself sometimes instinctively thinking about checking the Facebook feed. Hopefully, it&amp;rsquo;s an instinct that gets weaned away with time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am like 90% through the FF7R hard mode run, but I&amp;rsquo;m currently stuck at a certain point trying to beat the so-called &amp;ldquo;hardest fight in the game&amp;rdquo;. Hopefully I can finish it this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinity OS2 inched along slightly as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday gaming group picked up a new board game on Steam, it&amp;rsquo;s Blood Rage, about vikings trying to earn glory for Ragnarok. A bit more violent than Scythe, lots more fighting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG: I did six twitch streams/yt episodes of M21 drafting, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXZO7Ukg5Xk&amp;amp;list=PLmU0vkKslGXiz0shcCJgV1YTP5emzWgr4&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s a playlist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Able to play a couple more online quiz nights this week, but still didn&amp;rsquo;t do well lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some new movies on Netflix lately. Decided to watch Mission Impossible Fallout. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I ever watched Rogue Nation though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to plan out the next set of updates for the trivia thing, but I might be too busy in the coming weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I changed the fonts on this blog. Again. Someday I&amp;rsquo;ll probably try Comic Sans just for the heck of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again: I should probably write more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This list of &lt;a href=&#34;https://whimsical.club/&#34;&gt;websites that spark joy&lt;/a&gt; is great, have some new sites to browse!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A walk back through the history of web trends and standards: &lt;a href=&#34;https://pavellaptev.github.io/web-dark-ages/&#34;&gt;dark ages of the web&lt;/a&gt;. As someone &lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.technology/@schwartz/104450459330476402&#34;&gt;commented on Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; though: &amp;ldquo;dark ages for development, golden age for content.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/covid19-06-28/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s pandemic notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easily the most annoying thing this week: our broadband modem conked out Wednesday night. Customer support isn&amp;rsquo;t super responsive for local telcos: I called their support line the next day (support line is not even available 24/7!), got put on hold for 45 minutes TWICE before they agreed to send a repair crew over the next day (Friday). Friday morning I got a text that the technician visit was actually scheduled for SATURDAY morning. They arrive Saturday AFTERNOON, due to traffic apparently. And unluckily, they are out of spare modems for the replacement. They promise to come back first thing in the morning SUNDAY. They come back Sunday LUNCHTIME. And I finally have internet back. An annoying experience, and I&amp;rsquo;m also worried that my mobile plan might be charged for the two one-hour calls I had to do to their support line (hopefully I can clear that up), and I&amp;rsquo;m told I can also call them up to ask for a rebate for their days we had no service, but eh, I&amp;rsquo;d have to sit through another long on-hold period!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One would think that being offline for half a week would lead to some kind of gigantic productivity boost, but no such luck. I still had my mobile internet for my doomscrolling after all. I did manage to read/write/watch a few more things than usual I guess?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finished Final Fantasy VII Remake (before the internet outage)! So I spent a lot of the outage (including my time on hold with tech support) playing through hard mode, already about half-way through. Still not sure I&amp;rsquo;m going to do achievement completion, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see. Hard mode is actually an enjoyable challenge, nothing too insane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinity OS2 inched along slightly as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;won my &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/1274581114628108289/&#34;&gt;first Trivia Royale&lt;/a&gt;, I can quit now lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the internet outage coincided with the start of this week&amp;rsquo;s Steam Summer Sale. There&amp;rsquo;s some games/DLC I&amp;rsquo;m considering buying, but realistically in terms of backlog I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t lol. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if willpower holds out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the new MTG core set also came out on Magic Arena during the outage. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get back into regular streaming for M21 limited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still tried to join the Zoom and voice chats for the online quizzes with only my tethered mobile internet, but that was kind of a miserable experience. Still, I was able to contribute a bit, though we didn&amp;rsquo;t actually do too well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finished watching season 2 of Harley Quinn. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve written about the show before. The whole Harley/Poison Ivy dynamic isn&amp;rsquo;t really for me, but I like the show&amp;rsquo;s take on Gotham and the wider DC universe and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of fun characters like King Shark and Clayface. Also, Riddler was recognizably voiced by Dean Pelton from Community, and that was fun lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also did a rewatch of Spider-Man Far From Home on Netflix, before the internet problems and all. Still a pretty good movie, and watching it made me eager to get back to the MCU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also watched the Sonic the Hedgehog movie while things were offline. The best thing about this is Sonic being recognizably voiced by Ben Schwartz, who apparently &lt;a href=&#34;https://thesuperheroesnetwork.tumblr.com/post/622121477003739136/supernova-swirls-gothammite-he-really&#34;&gt;voices everyone blue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As soon as my internet came back, I started watching Ghost Fighter/Yu Yu Hakusho, which came out on Netflix (as you guessed it, during the outage)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also tried reading a book. It was a Discworld book. &amp;ldquo;Tried&amp;rdquo; being the operative word. I&amp;rsquo;ll write about it if I manage to get to the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uh, proceeding apace I guess?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again: I should probably write more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/covid19-06-21/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s pandemic notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some days still hot, but weather beginning to turn for the better. Sleep kind of better and a bit more regular too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did my quarterly medical checkup this past week (slightly delayed). No issues, but I need to do an FBS test for next time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep schedule kind of settling back into my usual biphasic sleep. Although the second phase seems to move around a lot&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not much work-wise the past week, and a bit more family-related expenses. Medical and government stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;still playing a lot of Final Fantasy VII Remake. I think I&amp;rsquo;m already in the final chapter. I am quite happy with the adaptiation, bit I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;m going to bother with achievement completion for this one; it requires hard mode completion, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the issue. The problem is the abundance of these dexterity-based minigames! I thought everything was fine when I did the squats thing, but then later there&amp;rsquo;s a harder pull-ups thing! And I haven&amp;rsquo;t even cracked the bottom of that darts leaderboard&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinity OS2 inching along slightly. But probably will be finished after FF7R at this rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s a new trivia app by the makers of the QuizUp, which we used to play a lot back in the day. The name is Trivia Royale, it&amp;rsquo;s currently iOS only and it&amp;rsquo;s basically battle royale quizup: you join a game with 1000 players, and you play 10 head-to-head matches until you get a winner. Took me most of the wook to actually win my first one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;did poorly in the AboutQuiz and PopQuiz games this week. Actually, we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing poorly for a while now lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing to log. Maybe a good thing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://triviastorm.net/&#34;&gt;triviastorm&lt;/a&gt; stuff this week. Most of it are some backend fixes to make later planned new features easier to build. Planning to clear/reset leaderboards at the end of the month. Some roadmap things:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allowing users to submit their own questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make the discord bot usable for public usage, i.e. let other people add it to their discord&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I should probably write more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot of posts off &lt;a href=&#34;https://lobste.rs&#34;&gt;lobste.rs&lt;/a&gt; lately, so I finally pulled the trigger and asked around for an invite to the site. A &lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@ignaloidas&#34;&gt;helpful person&lt;/a&gt; provided me one via Mastodon. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting site, basically an invite-only reddit-like site, mostly focused on tech stuff, so in theory the discussion quality should be fairly high. The chain of invites is public too, each user&amp;rsquo;s profile shows you who invited him, so in that way it&amp;rsquo;s kind of similar to a certificate chain of trust? We&amp;rsquo;ll see if this scales up well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this &lt;a href=&#34;https://mxb.dev/blog/the-return-of-the-90s-web/&#34;&gt;recent article about the 90s web&lt;/a&gt;. I will easily admit that I am an easy sucker for any post that appeals to my nostalgia for how the web was better &amp;ldquo;back in the doy&amp;rdquo;, rose-tinted glasses or no.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed the song Fast Car, so it was interesting to read about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/tracy-chapman-fast-car-revival-luke-combs-khalid-1014843/&#34;&gt;its origins and its surprising popularity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The founders of BaseCamp recently released &lt;a href=&#34;https://hey.com&#34;&gt;Hey&lt;/a&gt;, a new email service that has &lt;a href=&#34;https://hey.com/features/&#34;&gt;some interesting ideas about new features&lt;/a&gt; to support the typical email workflow. I don&amp;rsquo;t nearly use email enough on a personal basis to pay for it (though I do have an invite!), but I&amp;rsquo;m glad someone is innovating in this space, although they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be using open standards. They promptly &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation&#34;&gt;got into a fight with Apple over App Store policies&lt;/a&gt; which has sparked some debate in the tech community on the value of curated app stores. So maybe they&amp;rsquo;re actually going to push for innovation in two different areas?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, no new crises have emerged during the past week. I think. More of the same crises, carrying on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Friday was the PH independence day holiday. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like celebrating. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like we are free. In any case, a protest rally against the yet-to-be-signed terror bill took place at the university that morning, inspite of threats from the authorities that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t allowed. The protestors spaced themselves out and everything. Some friends reported trouble getting into the university though. Apparently a heavy police/military presence was manning many of the entrances for some reason. &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/DailyGuardianPH/posts/3416858255000782&#34;&gt;Basta&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/move-ph/263710-police-blocks-entry-protesters-rally-independence-day-2020&#34;&gt;News report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/covid19-06-14/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s quarantine notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much better weather this week, some nights were comfortably rainy and chilly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep schedule kind of settling back into my usual biphasic sleep. Although the second phase seems to move around a lot&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disappointed in the PS5 reveal. None of the shown games are must buys from me, and I was hoping for a price and release date. Highly unlikely I&amp;rsquo;d get a PS5 on launch though. Historically I&amp;rsquo;ve waited at least a year to get consoles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinity OS2 run stalled this week because&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip; most of my gaming this week spent on Final Fantasy VII Remake. I&amp;rsquo;m only around 12ish hours in. Game is pretty great, and not just for the nostalgia bit. There is a large amount of added content, and some plot details play out differently. Looking forward to how this all ends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also purchased the &lt;a href=&#34;https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality&#34;&gt;itch.io BLM bundle&lt;/a&gt; this week. Wow that&amp;rsquo;s a ton of value. Over 1600+ games, assets, etc for minimum $5? I was originally hesitant since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have an itch.io account and really I don&amp;rsquo;t need more backlog, but it&amp;rsquo;s for a good cause, and did I mention also a ton of value? Better than Humble Bundles ever were.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somehow managed to win Geekfight this week, and it&amp;rsquo;s the last one until July. We got third place in PopQuiz and as usual did poorly in AboutQuiz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team Camote Pop Culture Trivia Challenge S01E01 is out: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQytLl61PCQ&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQytLl61PCQ&lt;/a&gt;. We had a lot of fun, and we recorded this around a month ago I think, editing took a while. We have a few more episodes in the queue, feel free to like and subscribe!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My dad has been watching a lot of Two and A Half Men, which means a lot of incidental watching from me whenever I&amp;rsquo;m in that same room. The Charlie Sheen firing came really abruptly since he was binging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Huh, I guess not much TV/movies for me last week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worked a bit more on &lt;a href=&#34;https://triviastorm.net/&#34;&gt;triviastorm&lt;/a&gt; stuff this week. Cleaning up the old questions, prepping new question sets, etc. Will probably load new question sets and reset both the twitter bot and discord leaderboards around the end of the month, and hopefully can expand upon the app after that, and prepare it for more general use and other cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My urge to completely revamp the site has passed&amp;hellip; for now. Other plans proceed apace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/&#34;&gt;Sort By Controversial&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s two years old, but it&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic read, a fictional (or maybe not so fictional?) take on how society can easily be cleaved apart by the right discussions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;The world isn&amp;rsquo;t letting up. The virus is still around, but both the US and my own country have gotten distracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US is in its second week of police brutality/black lives matters protests. Meanwhile, our government took on a sidequest of trying to enact a wide-ranging and easily abusable anti-terror bill, triggering some smaller (by comparison to the US).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t written about the terror bill, mainly because I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the opportunity to dig into it too deeply. But my general impression leaves me two points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the justification for asking for increased police/anti-terrorism powers? We don&amp;rsquo;t actually get that many terror attacks pulled off, the last big one was Marawi (which I heard some Congressmen citing, tbf), which was back in 2017. And that was mostly a problem with Islamic militants. I don&amp;rsquo;t hear any of the bill proponents talking about how specifically the limits on govt powers holds them back. How would these added powers prevent another Marawi? Did they actually have intel leading up to the Marawi siege that they couldn&amp;rsquo;t act on due to limited powers? I find this difficult to believe because&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what about the authorities&amp;rsquo; history of impunity? It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that they are being restricted by the law in anti-terror activities when they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to let the law get in the way for much lesser things. I guess this is the crux of the issue for most people, one of trust. Even if you say there are safeguards in the law, they are still easily abusable. The bill extends the detention period for terror suspects to I think is it 30 days, extendable? But given the speed (or lack thereof) of local courts, even if you challenge any violation of the safeguards, the challenge may take longer to resolve than the detention period. Maybe we should consider cleaning up our justice system first? People wouldn&amp;rsquo;t object if our systems were trustworthy&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, also China banned mocking their national anthem in HK, or something to that effect. China being China. Better not to lose track of what is probably the greatest threat to democracy in the coming century&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/covid19-06-07/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s quarantine notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was hoping the weather would get much cooler than this. Where&amp;rsquo;s our &lt;em&gt;hanging amihan&lt;/em&gt;?!?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tiny bit of consulting work again this week, mostly integration work. And it&amp;rsquo;s in PHP, which means I&amp;rsquo;m once again tempted to write a &amp;ldquo;bad things about PHP&amp;rdquo; post lol. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll collect a few more gripes before I do that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep schedule slightly better and more regular, but my eyes seem to be heavy a lot more often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;m like in the final act for Divinity OS2. Need to finish it soonish because&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip; my PS4 is back! My brother finally passed by the house to pick up some stuff and returned my console. I already hooked it up and did the installation things for FF7R. Will probably start it this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Humble choice is up, but it&amp;rsquo;s meh again. Will probably pass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was looking forward to the PS5 reveal this week, but it got rescheduled due to everything happening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least previews for the next Magic set have already started. Some cool stuff. Instant planeswalker abilities! Phasing! Prowess! &lt;a href=&#34;http://mythicspoiler.com/m21/cards/peerintotheabyss.html&#34;&gt;Really creepy art&lt;/a&gt;! We also got some bans and an actual rule change to address companions, both of which are sure to shake up the formats. I finally caved and paid gems for the Ikoria mythic pass on Arena (I&amp;rsquo;ve saved up a bunch anyway. Still totally F2P!). Hopefully I can max out the levels/rewards before the mastery rotation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt; Geekfight was fun this week (theme was Marvel comics, right up my alley), although I didn&amp;rsquo;t win. We did poorly in the other two online quizzes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legends of Tomorrow season finale was weak and didn&amp;rsquo;t really make sense, but still somehow the best of the Arrowverse finales this season. Oh well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By contrast, I really liked the Rick and Morty season finale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also started watching Space Force; only 3 episodes in, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit meh. Not super funny or anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worked a bit on &lt;a href=&#34;https://triviastorm.net/&#34;&gt;triviastorm&lt;/a&gt; stuff this week. I&amp;rsquo;m preparing new questions and cleaning up the old ones, and also some work on a tighter checking algorithm. There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of features I want to add to this side project, let&amp;rsquo;s see if I manage to get around to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also spent a couple of hours fantasizing about rewriting the site again, maybe back to a dynamic backend, or some kind of hybrid, mostly to address the issues scaling with so many posts. Lol, will probably not do this yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s in the back of my mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No recent links for now. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll be more diligent about this next week.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Equal Protections

            <pubDate>Thu, 28 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/equal-protections/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/25/mafia-logic/#mafia-logic&#34;&gt;recent post on Cory Doctorow&amp;rsquo;s pluralistic blog&lt;/a&gt; had a really good take on the general worldview of &amp;ldquo;the right&amp;rdquo;, describing it as &amp;ldquo;mafia logic&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m going to quote a huge chunk of it here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This follows perfectly from the second definition. The purpose of the law is to protect the rightful rulers, so the law can&amp;rsquo;t – by definition – punish them. And it is &amp;ldquo;mafia logic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holbo was talking about Michael Gove – a UK Tory Minister – excusing his the Prime Minister&amp;rsquo;s advisor Dominick Cummings repeatedly breaking the quarantine rules that Cummings is responsible for creating and enforcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it could apply equally well to Trump&amp;rsquo;s pardons for his crooked henchmen, or the legions of Karens who think the cops should come and bust some Black kid&amp;rsquo;s head for selling lemonade without a license, while ignoring their own anti-vax playground quarantine-breaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s pure Blue Lives Matter logic: the law should protect cops from Black people, but not Black people from cops. It should punish Black people who break the law, but protect cops who break the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a meaningful difference between reactionary and progressive, left and right. It&amp;rsquo;s the difference of property rights vs human rights – whether you exact the right to hoard while others starve, or the right not to starve while others hoard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the difference between pluralism and elitism: whether you think some of us were born to be ruled over, or whether you think we should have a government selected by its people to serve those people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the difference of equal protections and duties under the law, as opposed to impunity for the powerful and the legalized oppression of the powerless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resonates with me a lot because &amp;ldquo;equal protections under the law&amp;rdquo; may be a pretty big ask in this country when individual citizens find it difficult to apply judgement equally to both those they support and those they don&amp;rsquo;t. Double standards abound, both for the government and many of the citizens. There are a lot of people in this country who support the people in power blindly because of some form of tribalism; they chose this person so they feel they have to support them no matter what, no matter how incompetent, no matter how blatant the abuses are, and so on. It&amp;rsquo;s a weird case of trying to justify a purchase after the fact, even if it turned out to be horrible, out of some sense of pride, maybe? People hate being wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of someone I used to know who was an avid supporter of a particular candidate during the 2016 elections. Whenever he would fail to convince us of the merits of his candidate (or be unable to answer our concerns about his human rights record, etc), he would simply say &amp;ldquo;you guys just don&amp;rsquo;t trust him&amp;rdquo;. Which is a really weird thing to say because why trust any politician based on anything other than his track record and what he says or does? It always felt like he had already decided to trust this candidate and that nothing else mattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like so many people in this country are so used to our politicians taking advantage of them that they have become hostage to this form of &amp;ldquo;rule&amp;rdquo;: ordinary people are subject to the harshness of the law, while for those in power, the law must be &amp;ldquo;tempered with compassion&amp;rdquo;. Being progressive and believing in pluralism in this country requires that we challenge those norms wherever we can, that we hold the powerful to account, regardless of political affiliation. It can be challenging to get people to look beyond their tribalistic nature, but it&amp;rsquo;s something we need to figure out if we are to survive and evolve as a truly democratic &amp;ldquo;rule of law&amp;rdquo; society and not devolve into some kind of right-wing populist authoritarian &amp;ldquo;rule of men&amp;rdquo; wasteland (if we aren&amp;rsquo;t already there yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the Doctorow quote (which I&amp;rsquo;ve already strayed from a bit&amp;hellip; the last few paragraphs turned out a little ranty about the state of the country, but I&amp;rsquo;ve actually already rewritten it a couple of times to be&amp;hellip; less ranty I guess?), this model of how &amp;ldquo;the right&amp;rdquo; thinks can be a useful tool when engaging in debate or discussion with others (something I am less inclined to do these days). The two sides of this model are mostly incompatible, thus when discussing with anyone you can ask yourself (or them directly) which side of that divide they lie on. (I don&amp;rsquo;t imagine anyone would say out loud they believe people in power deserve special treatment, because that sounds absurd. Or evil. But that might just be the leftist perspective in me.) Whether they agree with you or not, at the very least it gives you a model in which to frame further discussion, or even to decide whether further discussion would even be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer 1: Doctorow is of course primarily left-leaning, hence his bias towards these definitions. It would be interesting to see what the equivalent definitions would be on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer 2: Every individual is slightly different. I use &amp;ldquo;the right&amp;rdquo; in quotes here to indicate that the generalizations are describing a significant subset of people who might consider themselves &amp;ldquo;right-wing&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;conservative&amp;rdquo; or whatnot. I use this label more for this particular way of thinking rather than a political alignment. (And I dislike labelling people anyway, as much as possible.)&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A bit of brouhaha a couple of weeks ago after the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.manilatimes.net/2020/05/05/news/headlines/ntc-orders-abs-cbn-to-shut-down-operations/722798/&#34;&gt;National Telecommunications Commission ordered the country&amp;rsquo;s biggest broadcaster ABS-CBN to cease operations because Congress had been remiss in renewing their franchise.&lt;/a&gt;. This despite the NTC earlier promising they can operate provisionally while the franchise renewal is being processed, a change of heart apparently due to a legal opinion by the SolGen. Some thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bias&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bias&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker of the house &lt;a href=&#34;https://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2020/05/15/cayetano-slams-bias-at-abs-cbn/&#34;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you are one of the reasons why there are issues with your network. In the eyes of some, there is clear bias and meddling in the elections, which is against the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, IDK what this supposed election meddling is that he&amp;rsquo;s talking about (If they have really done such a thing that is illegal, they can be charged in court, but AFAIK there are no such cases?), but speaking on the issue of &amp;ldquo;bias&amp;rdquo;: we cannot require that a news entity be unbiased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeating for emphasis: &lt;strong&gt;we cannot require that a news entity be unbiased&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, you say? It comes back to the nature of bias, and the nature of humans. Every individual human is biased towards certain things, as a result of their experiences growing up. No matter how well-read or well-traveled or well-learned you are, your individual human experience is but a fraction of a fraction of an infinitessimal fraction of the collective human experience. Therefore, you will exhibit bias naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations are pretty much the same, since they are composed of biased humans. Any given organization can strive to be less biased by having members with diverse points of view and opinion. And in fact it would be better if our news entities were as unbiased as possible, this would be ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we (through the state) cannot require that such entities be unbiased, for the simple reason that determination of bias will itself be tainted by bias. There can be no absolute, objective standard for being unbiased, because who would make that judgement? Who would make the rules? Humans, who are also biased? Imposing such a vague restriction on news entities (&amp;ldquo;you must be unbiased&amp;rdquo;) is tantamount to imposing someone else&amp;rsquo;s will (and bias) upon the entity, and that encroaches upon the freedom of expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can impose specific restrictions on freedoms of expression and the press through law; examples are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disallowing knowingly publishing falsehoods through libel laws (although this too is problematic, since truth is also not always measurable nor absolute)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disallowing child pornography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;false fire alarms in a crowded theater&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing is that specific, measurable things can be disallowed, since presumably these can be evaluated fairly (or as fairly as possible). More dangerous are restrictions that depend upon the whims of those in power, such as commonly found in authoritarian countries like China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get into the nitty-gritty legalities of it, since I am not a lawyer. But my main point is that like it or not, we can&amp;rsquo;t require news entities to be unbiased. We want them to be as close to that as possible ideally, but we can&amp;rsquo;t require it, because that is not enforceable fairly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About ABS-CBN specifically, I don&amp;rsquo;t even see any bias; I mean, if anything, many of their news anchors and celebrities seem to be supportive of the administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(You might disagree with me, but that&amp;rsquo;s just your bias, and that&amp;rsquo;s fine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;press-freedom-access-to-information-and-other-concerns&#34;&gt;Press Freedom, Access to Information, and other concerns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people have commented that press freedom still exists in the Philippines despite the ABS-CBN shutdown, citing reasons such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;existence of other networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ABS-CBN still being able to broadcast over digital channels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people still being able to criticize the government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is true, that the Philippines does still enjoy some press freedom, undoubtedly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any reduction in the diversity of news sources is harmful to democratic society since it reduces access to information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not everyone has access to cable or internet channels through which ABS-CBN programs can still be accessed, thus depriving many people of a source of information (and in some cases the only source of information they had available)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the mere fact that the government, on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/168137-duterte-block-abs-cbn-franchise-renewal&#34;&gt;president&amp;rsquo;s whim and vindictiveness&lt;/a&gt; (no one really believes the NTC and the SolGen and even the House are acting independently), has taken the biggest network off the air leads to what is called a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect&#34;&gt;chilling effect&lt;/a&gt;, basically sending a message to everybody else. If even the biggest network in the country can be taken down, what chance do smaller outfits or independent journalists have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have cited other reasons why ABS-CBN should have not been taken down, like the fact that X number of workers would lose their jobs. For me, that&amp;rsquo;s extraneous. Of course we don&amp;rsquo;t want anyone to lose their livelihoods, but that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t even be necessary to contemplate: on the basis of the harms to democracy and press freedom alone this should not have happened. And especially not during a pandemic, when getting information out to people can be crucial!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand the requirement for Congress to approve broadcast franchises, since broadcast frequencies are a limited resource. But if it were me: the grant of provisional franchise upon expiry would be automatic unless explicitly revoked by Congress with clear violations specified as the cause of revokation. And the grant of franchise should probably explicity specify the conditions upon which the franchise may not be renewed. The grant or renewal of broadcast franchises should be as free of politics as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-police-bad-news-entities&#34;&gt;How to police &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; news entities?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can&amp;rsquo;t impose unbiasedness, and shutting them down violates press freedom, how do we control wayward news entities? Since humans are biased, we have no universal definition of &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo;, but there are still some controls that society can impose, not necssarily through law:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;through law, specific restrictions as described above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally, it should be the market and news consumers themselves who are able to control the biases of the news entities, by not patronizing news entities that tend to be editorialized. (Although this probably requires a more educated populace, see: Fox News). ABS-CBN itself is still super popular, in spite of everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;etc&#34;&gt;Etc&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chilling effect on free expression has a slippery slope. Already the government has started going after critics allegedly for social media posts. If we are not careful, we might be on the road to becoming like China. (Which might be what Duterte and his cult following want, but certainly won&amp;rsquo;t be good for a democratic Philippines).&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I originally had this as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/roytang/statuses/1241993156696010753/&#34;&gt;tweetstorm/rant&lt;/a&gt;, but it ended up quite long, so I&amp;rsquo;m posting it to the blog too. It is mostly frustration at how poorly the people in charge are handling things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of asking for more budget, the govt should be telling us first how they are planning to spend the money they are already allocated, which they claimed was sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of saying we can&amp;rsquo;t do mass testing because of limited kits, they should be telling us about their plans for getting more testing kits, ppes, hospital capacity, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of telling off the LGUs for being creative, they should tell us how they plan to support the LGUs in keeping the quarantine under control and in feeding the poor people who are most affected. It&amp;rsquo;s the difference between &amp;ldquo;Sumunod ka na lang!&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Ok, we can see you&amp;rsquo;re having trouble, ano pwede namin matulong?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Sige, eto itutulong namin para hindi nyo yan kelangan gawin.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of sending just confirmed cases home due to lack of hospital capacity, tell us what measures you are doing to set up new isolation units etc. Maybe seek out private enterprises that have now unused buildings that can be used?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of complaining about the haters, tell us what you are doing to address their concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be ok to admit to mistakes. &amp;ldquo;We tried this, it didn&amp;rsquo;t work, these are the other things we want to try now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of increasing fear, uncertainty and doubt with poor messaging, lay out your plans and principles and tell us clearly what we should expect. Messaging should aim to reassure people, not to threaten or confuse or to make excuses for past mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of asking for emergency powers, maybe use your existing powers better! Not everything can be solved by throwing more authoritarianism at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private sector is stepping up to do what it can. Ordinary citizens are stepping up to donate and support and help where they can. Now is not the time for the government to be mediocre. Be better!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;This post will largely be about the effects of the COVID-19 virus on my country, the Philippines, including government and society&amp;rsquo;s response, largely from a personal POV. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a bit difficult to write about, but I figure it&amp;rsquo;s something I would like to be able to look back on in the future, so let&amp;rsquo;s give it a shot. The reason it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to write about is that events are unfolding and changing rapidly, and a lot of things are still unclear. On top of that, there is anxiety to contend with, and all the news can make it difficult to think. And so we write, both as a record of events and to help clear my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was originally going to write about the recent COVID-19 virus happenings during this week&amp;rsquo;s weeknotes, but I ended up writing so many words about it, so I decided to make a separate type of post. And its a new type of post, one that I tagged under &amp;ldquo;diaries&amp;rdquo;. The post is being published early on the 15th, but the intent is I will be updating this post as events unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;january-the-29th-govt-says-no-travel-ban-needed&#34;&gt;January the 29th: Govt says no travel ban needed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/250506-coronavirus-scare-travel-ban-mainland-chinese-not-for-now-duque&#34;&gt;Even with coronavirus scare, no mainland Chinese travel ban for now – Duque&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/1/29/duterte-on-china-travel-ban.html&#34;&gt;Duterte not keen on banning travel to China amid coronavirus scare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;january-the-30th-first-positive-case-in-ph&#34;&gt;January the 30th: First positive case in PH&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/1/30/Philippines-coronavirus-case.html&#34;&gt;Philippines confirms first case of novel coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;january-the-31st-travel-ban-from-hubei&#34;&gt;January the 31st: Travel ban from Hubei&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/1/31/Philippines-novel-coronavirus-China-travel-ban.html&#34;&gt;Duterte orders travel ban from China province amid coronavirus scare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;february-the-2nd-travel-ban-from-china&#34;&gt;February the 2nd: Travel ban from China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;march-the-7th-first-confirmed-local-case&#34;&gt;March the 7th: First confirmed local case&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2020/03/07/1998804/philippines-has-first-local-case-covid-19&#34;&gt;Philippines has first local case of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;march-the-9th-president-declares-public-health-emergency&#34;&gt;March the 9th: President declares public health emergency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;march-9th-march-11th&#34;&gt;March 9th-March 11th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locally, our country had a very small number of confirmed cases coming into the last week, I think it was at around 20 or less before Sunday the 8th. And only 1 confirmed death. The president had previously addressed the country in some kind of incoherent drunken rant that didn&amp;rsquo;t say much but was easily repurposed by internet memers into some kind of spoken word poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a shortage of face masks. People are reminded to wash their hands regularly and practice social distancing when possible. The DOH claimed we had everything under control. &lt;em&gt;Eat Bulaga&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Showtime&lt;/em&gt; have been running shows without a live studio audience. Life was still mostly normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But during this week, more and more cases were reported, in ever-increasing quantities. As of Saturday (the 14th) night, we were up to 111 confirmed cases and I think 8 deaths, with 40+ reported during that day alone. That fatality rate of around 7%, is way higher than the global 1-3%, which is a good indicator of how many unreported cases we probably have locally, due to the severe lack of testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thursday-march-the-12th-lockdown-announced&#34;&gt;Thursday, March the 12th: Lockdown announced&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explosive growth in cases finally made the government take drastic action; around Thursday lunchtime, rumors started circulating in online circles that the authorities were planning a lockdown of the National Capital Region. This included a leaked memo listing the recommendations that the president would have to decide on. Many details were not known, like what exactly would happen in such a lockdown. What we did know was that the lockdown would start reportedly start on Sunday, the 15th and would last for 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markets did not take the rumors well. Shortly before closing, the Philippine Stock Exchange circuit breaker was triggered after the index had dropped more than 10% on the day. The index recovered slightly before closing at around -9.x%. It was a bloodbath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my late afternoon walk I decided to pass by the nearby grocery because there had already been reports of large crowds. Sure enough there were way more people than usual. I really only wanted to get Tostitos dip, but they were out of stock of that. Why were people hoarding it? Alcohol and hand sanitizer were out of stock as well, as expected. From the chatter I overheard, people were well aware of the rumored announcement later that day. My parents weren&amp;rsquo;t planning to do our weekly grocery run until Friday night, but I decided to pick up a few essentials (bread, eggs, canned goods, etc) early since I was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A press conference was announced for around 6-630pm. True to form, the conference only started around a couple of hours late. Most of it consisted of the president telling the people to listen to the health authorities, reading out the details of the memo (exactly the one that was leaked, leaving many questions), in his usual annoying rambling style. (To his benefit, he seemed way more lucid than his last public speech.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lockdown covered Metro Manila, banning domestic travel over land, sea, and air. International travel was still around. The press conference did not provide any details of how the lockdown would be enforced or any plan for increased testing or support for health care front-liners or new health care supplies. No details of how people who live outside the NCR but work there during the day would be handled. No word on support programs for people who will lose paying work because of the arrangements. The president did not acknowledge the efforts of public health care workers, but instead for some reason, decided to thank China for supposedly supporting us. (Even though the virus came from them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of my group chats are abuzz, discussing the turn of events and the lack of details, with the general consensus being: &lt;em&gt;ANG LABO!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A doctor friend reports that she has been in quarantine and is awaiting results of the COVID19 test because she was in contact with possible carriers. We wish her good luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people I knew had flown out of the NCR to the provinces for some R&amp;amp;R and their flight back would be from Saturday night to Sunday early morning, so they would be caught by the lockdown. I jokingly said that since international flights weren&amp;rsquo;t banned, they could just fly out to Malaysia or such, then fly back in to NAIA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I note that on this day, 16 new confirmed cases were reported, while 9 and 4 cases were reported the two days prior. This implies to me that we&amp;rsquo;re looking at 25 cases the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My opinion: I general accept that the lockdown is probably necessary, but not with the implied threat of police/military action. Focus should be on improving testing and healthcare resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;friday-march-the-13th&#34;&gt;Friday, March the 13th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Friday the 13th! This morning, the PSE circuit breaker triggers again, mere minutes after trade opens. The markets did not like last night&amp;rsquo;s announcements either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/1238286699706200064/&#34;&gt;Twitter tells us&lt;/a&gt; that the MRT officials have started applying social distancing rules, only letting a limited number of people on the trains per station. This results in very long lines outside the stations, kind of negating the social distancing anyway. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I&amp;rsquo;m no longer a regular commuter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend to my parents to do the regular grocery run earlier, and as a result I have to accompany my mom on the trip, just after lunch. Even then, the nearby grocery was packed, with maybe 200% more people than the usual peak. Sanitation items like hand sanitizer and alcohol were out of stock. Eggs were too for some reason (luckily I had already bought some the day before). Common canned goods were still on shelves, but the more popular ones were in short supply. The &amp;ldquo;panic buying&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t as much as we see reported in other countries where many shelves are bare. Friends who go to larger groceries like SNR report 2-hr wait times at the checkout line. Ours takes around 30 mins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokespersons for different government agencies have begun issuing statements clarifying how things will actually work during the lockdown &amp;ndash; excuse me, &amp;ldquo;community quarantine&amp;rdquo;. The air and sea restrictions are pretty clear, but the land restrictions seem impossible to implement without massive traffic. The intent is to have checkpoints at roads in and out of the metro, and to inspect passengers one by one to make sure their trips are essential. There is still no plan on how to support people who cannot work due to the lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local churches announce suspension of mass services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group chats are abuzz all day with discussions such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how their companies are preparing for WFH. Some of my friends work at a company with over 200 people and they had been preparing a business continuity plan during the week, but last night&amp;rsquo;s announcements have accelerated plans. They need to purchase laptops and pocket wifis for those who don&amp;rsquo;t have hardware or internet at home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disinfectant alternatives due to lack of supply of alcohol and hand sanitizer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;word is a doctor at the Philippine Heart Center has been intubated because a patient lied about her travel history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My doctor friend happily reports that she has tested negative, but that she still has to stay quarantined for 14 days. Our healthcare system will not survive any uptick in cases which causes large swathes of our medical professionals to be taken out of play for 2 weeks at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I note the strong parallels between Trump and Duterte&amp;rsquo;s approaches: both held disastrous press conferences that resulted in markets crashing!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell everyone that since things are unclear, just stay home as much as possible. I am privileged enough that I can largely follow this advice, and many of my friends work in industries where WFH is viable. The ones who will be disproportionally affected are the poor - the ones who can&amp;rsquo;t afford not to work or have no way to work remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mayor of Quezon City has declared a state of calamity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the trading day, the PSE has managed to recover a bit, closing at +1.x% up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only 3 new confirmed cases are reported today, defying my pattern recognition skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;saturday-march-the-14th&#34;&gt;Saturday, March the 14th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Pi day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a small extended family lunch gathering today, mostly as a send-off to some &lt;em&gt;balikbayan&lt;/em&gt; relatives who are flying back to the US in a couple of weeks. The gathering was originally scheduled for Sunday, but because of the announcement we rescheduled to Saturday to avoid complications. Fewer people are able to attend, and we just have takeout instead of going to a restaurant as originally planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, there is a presscon where the MMDA/PNP/some mayors are talking about a one month curfew from 8PM-5AM. The interior secretary threatens arrest for those who refuse to go home during the curfew. This causes a mix of reactions on social media and in the group chats. During the time I was still a regular commuter, by 8PM I would not have been able to get on a bus yet. The authorities are also requesting that malls close except for essential services such as supermarkets, banks and pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strain in the healthcare system is starting to show. Multiple reports of healthcare personnel lacking alcohol, hand sanitizer, gloves, and other personal protective equipment (PPE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local media giant ABS-CBN announces their hit primetime dramas are going off the air starting next week, to be replaced by reruns. Finally, a villain that &lt;em&gt;Ang Probinsyano&lt;/em&gt; is unable to defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All day there are reports of massive crowds at the bus stations of people planning to leave the metro before the lockdown. The exodus is worse than Christmas or Holy Week holidays. Airline ticketing offices are also swamped with people looking for refunds and rebookings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the evening, they start rolling back the curfew announcement, saying it was just recommendations, and that the MMDA has no authority to impose a curfew, unless the LGUs pass ordinances to enable such. PCOO&amp;rsquo;s Andanar calls such reports &amp;ldquo;fake news&amp;rdquo;. (Never mind that the government people were live on TV talking about it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the day, 47 new confirmed cases had been reported, for a total of 111. (If my pattern recognition had held, today would have seen 36 new cases. Not too far off.) Some posts from healthcare workers suggest that some of the new cases are from the poorer Payatas and BASECO areas. An outbreak in those areas would be really bad, as the spread would be very difficult to control. And the tests are delayed by about two days - by now many people may have been infected in those areas. The DOH is yet to release details of the new cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late in the evening, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ANCALERTS/status/1238843668485685248&#34;&gt;NCRPO announces&lt;/a&gt; that instead of checkpoints, they will just implement increased police visibility at the metro exit points. Thread says they had meetings late into the night, I suspected they realized how ridiculous the original plan was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we near the start of the lockdown, only the LGU of Muntinlupa has confirmed a curfew, starting Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes increasingly clear how poor the planning and coordination for this event was, that they are just ironing out details and making plans up more or less on the fly. We had weeks where they were saying not to worry and things were under control, that time should have been spent preparing for contingencies such as this. This does not inspire confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minor annoyance: social media people who say we should just obey without question. We don&amp;rsquo;t have to obey dumbass rules!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, my intent is just to stay at home as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-march-the-15th&#34;&gt;Sunday, March the 15th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard mass online through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/quiapochurch/&#34;&gt;facebook page of the Quiapo Church&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayala and Robinson&amp;rsquo;s malls have announced that their Metro Manila malls will be closing indefinitely starting tomorrow. SM malls announced a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TheSMStore/status/1239123144851390464&#34;&gt;similar closure except limited to a few cities and areas&lt;/a&gt;, Quezon City not included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayor Belmonte has &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/notes/quezon-city-government/mayor-joy-belmonte-on-declaration-of-public-safety-hours-in-quezon-city/226925012028597/&#34;&gt;declared a curfew in Quezon City&lt;/a&gt; starting Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A family friend has been suffering from a fever for a couple of days but refuses to go to the hospital for checkups. His two daughters, both doctors, are reportedly very exasperated at his stubbornness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently the US has &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/amanbatheja/status/1239175709823819776&#34;&gt;attempted to acquire exclusive rights to a possible vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. Capitalism ho!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lockdown is generally going smoothly. I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone was questioning the need of course. The real challenge in implementation will be tomorrow when people start going to work. My earlier expectation of general chaos, confusion and traffic has been tempered by the fact that the NCRPO supposedly reduced it to just police visibility instead of hard checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Sunday evening, we are at 140 cases (+29) and 12 fatalities, around 8.5% fatality rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of my friends however are quite worried about whether the police are sanitizing themselves after every check. If not, they might well become another vector for spreading the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t left the house since the grocery run on Friday. I&amp;rsquo;m considering resuming my afternoon walks starting tomorrow. I mean, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably be fine right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some handy trackers: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ncovtracker.doh.gov.ph/&#34;&gt;https://ncovtracker.doh.gov.ph/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;https://covid19ph.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monday-march-the-16th-enhanced-community-quarantine-announced&#34;&gt;Monday, March the 16th: Enhanced community quarantine announced&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, throngs of people out in the streets trying to commute to work. So much for social distancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go out for a quick medicine run (to ensure I have one month&amp;rsquo;s worth). The nearby drugstore is less crowded than the last time I passed by, although still well above expectations for the early afternoon hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A THREAD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        






    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the people in my group chats are starting to get overwhelmed by anxiety at the mishandling of the situation. I send them the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not saying we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take things seriously and/or prepare for the worst, I&amp;rsquo;m saying be mindful of your mental health by exposing yourself to too much anxiety and worry. i&amp;rsquo;m sure each of us here is already doing as much as possible to avoid risk/exposure for us and our families, it&amp;rsquo;s ok to step back from all the updates every so often&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word starts to spread that the government is meeting to plan a heightened lockdown. A press conference is announced for this afternoon. It seems like they announced the presscon even before the meeting starts, which means they have a presumption that an announcement will be needed. I expect that meeting to run long, most likely it will be this early to mid evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/gmanews/posts/10158510980196977&#34;&gt;breaking news post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUST IN: Presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo says President Duterte has ordered an enhanced community quarantine of entire Luzon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under enhanced community quarantine, the government says strict home quarantine will be implemented in all households, transportation will be suspended and provision for food and essential health services will be regulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of uniformed personnel to enforce quarantine procedures will be heightened under enhanced community quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kind of slept through the actual announcements. Tighter lockdown as expected. No more going to work, only essential travel. No public transpo. Outbound international travellers have 3 days to get to their flights (luckily my &lt;em&gt;balikbayan&lt;/em&gt; relative had previously decided to panic-rebook to this Thursday, just inside the window). Luzon-wide travel ban. Food distribution etc. Looks like a lot of the implementation problems are being left to the LGUs to decide. Government asking landlords, etc to defer rents, business to advance 13th month pay if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of edge cases seem unhandled, mostly for poor people without cars: how do they get to groceries, hospitals? How do healthcare workers without cars get to the hospitals? Etc. Some of the people in my chat groups are very pessimistic and are worried about the implementation of food distribution and other support for the poor. If not implemented properly, could lead to social unrest. I suspect we&amp;rsquo;re going to see another major announcement within 1-2 days to iron out some details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading at the PSE is suspended until further notice. Just as well - otherwise we might be in for daily bloodbaths. Stocks were down 7.9% today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news is only 2 confirmed cases today, and no additional deaths. One of the new cases is Senator Zubiri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increased lockdown is harsh, but might be necessary for containment at this point, given the earlier mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuesday-march-the-17th&#34;&gt;Tuesday, March the 17th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I caught part of the morning DZMM program with Noli de Castro, he&amp;rsquo;s complaining about how unclear the details of the enhanced lockdown is. He speaks to a field reporter on Commonwealth who says there are still a few jeeps running but MMDA personnel are flagging them down telling them they can&amp;rsquo;t run their routes. Those with full passenger loads are told to complete one last pass then that&amp;rsquo;s it. There are a lot of commuters on the road trying to get a rare ride. The reporter interviews a security guard for a hospital who says he&amp;rsquo;s been waiting to get a ride for 1.5 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Castro calls up the mayor of Paranaque (Edwin Olivares, also chair of the Metro Manila Mayors group), who tells him the implementation details are mostly dependent on the LGU. As for those who still need to work (like the security guard above) and don&amp;rsquo;t have cars, they have no choice but to walk. (&lt;em&gt;Sakripisyo daw&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mid-day, a friend reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just got back from buying supplies and delivering to my aunt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lots of ppl at the banks that I passed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;line at the grocery was long&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;line at the other grocery on anonas was hella long just to get in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a fair number of people just walking along the streets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;saw one jeepney and a couple tricycles&amp;hellip; maybe friends of brgy officials? who knows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;saw very few cops. they must be at the entry and exit points between cities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a car, it almost feels like holy week back in the 80s, when everything would be closed, but there are still some people going about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News comes out that last night, the President declared a state of calamity for the entire country. My understanding of this is that it&amp;rsquo;s mainly to unlock use of calamity funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OVP has set up transportation support for frontliners starting tomorrow. The military will also be deploying army trucks. Social media is full of stories of ordinary citizens volunteering to provide transportation or other support to those who still have to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manny Pacquiao has worked with Jack Ma&amp;rsquo;s foundation to have 50,000 testing kits donated to the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some social media influencer gets shamed for going off on people who are still going to work despite the enhanced lockdown. These trying times really make it easy to identify those who are unable to put themselves in other people&amp;rsquo;s situations and empathize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nograles talks to an early evening news program on TV , saying there will be a press conference later at 8PM discussing more details. The press conference happens past 11PM. It&amp;rsquo;s just Nograles and some other cabinet members, discussing details of who will be allowed to move around, what companies/industries will still be operating, etc. Basically details they should have had from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of new cases today is +45, with 2 additional deaths. Total number of cases: 187, deaths: 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wednesday-march-the-18th&#34;&gt;Wednesday, March the 18th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, Quezon City mayor Joy Belmonte announces &amp;ldquo;Extreme Enhanced Community Quarantine&amp;rdquo; (LOL) for selected barangays in Quezon City, specifically those barangays with 2 or more confirmed cases each. This enhanced lockdown (lets be real) means additional restrictions such as checkpoints and temperature scans in certain areas. Only those with essential travel needs will be allowed to pass. During the press conference, they identified several areas to be affected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a rectangular area around St. Luke&amp;rsquo;s Hospital near E.Rodriguez&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a circular area around the cluster of hospitals along East Avenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quirino Memorial Medical Center (facility quarantine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Barangay Tandang Sora (where we live) is one of the identified areas with multiple cases, but they have yet to finalize which streets/areas to restrict. Reportedly, the cases are somewhere in the Himlayan area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were worried about how the lockdown would affect us so my parents decided to do a grocery run today (our last run was Friday). This gave me quite a bit of anxiety, since they&amp;rsquo;re both vulnerable seniors, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t drive and I&amp;rsquo;m not the best shopper so I can&amp;rsquo;t make decisions in case of stuff being out of stock. They came back without incident, and reportedly the grocery practiced safe social distancing measures, so I assume (and hope) they&amp;rsquo;re fine. For future runs, we may try some online grocery sites such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.metromart.com/welcome/cities&#34;&gt;Metromart&lt;/a&gt;, or I&amp;rsquo;ll do the run myself (and we just live with whatever terrible choices I make LOL.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we are up to 202 confirmed cases (15 new cases) with 3 additional deaths (total 17). Over the past few days we have alternated big jumps and low jumps, so we might have more new cases tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thursday-march-the-19th&#34;&gt;Thursday, March the 19th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No major announcements today. We are up to 217 confirmed cases (+15) and 17 (+0) deaths. Not bad considering I thought we&amp;rsquo;d get a big bump today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;friday-march-the-20th&#34;&gt;Friday, March the 20th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No major announcements today. Well, there was a presscon by the president at 1am where he basically threw shade at the mayor of Pasig for daring to suggest something contrary to what the national government has advised. But nothing of significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got out of the house today, but only to walk a little bit around the subdivision. I thought about walking around my usual route, but that seems like an unnecessary risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are up to 230 cases (+13) and 18 deaths (+1). The growth rate is kind of plateauing, most probably due to lack of testing, but maybe not? We&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;saturday-march-the-21st&#34;&gt;Saturday, March the 21st&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word is going around in various QC barangays that the barangay personnel are issuing quarantine passes to households. AFAIK there has been no announcement from either the national government or the LGU, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s just the barangays being creative in implementation. Feels like unnecessary bureaucracy, and probably prone to abuse? We haven&amp;rsquo;t had anyone give us any yet. Regardless, we are mostly staying cooped up inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumors abound that there is a &amp;ldquo;secret protocol&amp;rdquo; at the RITM to prioritize VIPs in testing, and that the staff is furious but are afraid of violating NDAs. Sucks if true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we are up to 307 cases (+77) and 19 deaths (+1). This is the biggest one day jump in cases so far. Presumably there has been a lag in testing, so we may be in for even more cases in the days ahead. The coming week may very well tell us what our eventual curve is going to look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-march-the-22nd&#34;&gt;Sunday, March the 22nd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been just around one week of this lockdown. I think people are starting to get used to it? A lot of the less fortunate people are still suffering though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning my dad and my tita went out for groceries. I didn&amp;rsquo;t find out about it until I went down around lunch time. I told them later that they should just let me go out if we need to do a grocery run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard mass online again via the Quiapo church facebook page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I was getting a handle on all this covid19 news but I felt frustrated again today at a lot of bad news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOH prioritizing VIP politicians for testing given limited test kits. The current head of the RITM has been removed allegedly due to his refusal to prioritize VIPs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;530 hospital staff in UST quarantined&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The president asking congress for emergency powers (Senate President and the Palace spokesman both say it&amp;rsquo;s not emergency powers, some kind of BS). Basically this incompetent government after all this time assuring that they have the budget needed etc, say we should trust them with even more power and budget. And still no word on plans for mass testing!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, word in our barangay is that they are starting to distribute quarantine passes in our subdivision. We haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten one yet because they ran out or something, but they&amp;rsquo;ll be back tomorrow. We&amp;rsquo;re also told even with the pass, others can still go out as long as you have an ID with an address. Huh, what&amp;rsquo;s the point then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight we have 380 confirmed cases (+73) and 25 deaths (+6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monday-march-the-23rd&#34;&gt;Monday, March the 23rd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re entering the second working week of this lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock market was relatively calm today. The PSE Index dropped by about 0.74%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metro Manila hospitals are at or close to capacity; The Medical City advised that their ER beds are full and the same goes for other Pasig hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sign of how severely out of touch they are, the Speaker of the House and the Executive Secretary posted a picture of themselves with other congressmen at the house (for deliberations on the emergency powers bill), while holding a manila paper banner between them with a message along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Like our doctors and frontliners, we came to work for you, so please stay at home.&amp;rdquo; The internet responded&amp;hellip; appropriately. &amp;ldquo;ANG KAKAPAL&amp;rdquo; trended on PH twitter for a while, and since they conveniently provided an image with a space for text, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/scoutmagph/status/1241981421175975937&#34;&gt;memes started rolling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so frustrated at the government today, I ended up writing a tweetstorm rant that evolved into &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/this-is-not-the-time-for-mediocrity/&#34;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;. I even broke my Facebook isolation to post it there as well. It helped my sanity a little to write it out (and to get positive dopamine hits from the likes and shares.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight we have 462 confirmed cases (+82) and 33 deaths (+8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuesday-march-the-24th&#34;&gt;Tuesday, March the 24th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More hospitals today announced they are at capacity, including St. Luke&amp;rsquo;s and Makati Medical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night in the wee hours, after more than half a day of sessions, emergency powers were granted by Congress to the president. The senate version was adopted, with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/kevinikhe/posts/10219934639812972&#34;&gt;bit more checks and balances&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s fine, but we must remain vigilant. For me, the main issue with the admin being granted emergency powers is that it has not proven competence and indeed has shown a tendency to abuse powers in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president held another address at 10pm (surprisingly on schedule). I did not listen to it, I&amp;rsquo;m told it was mostly thanking frontliners and law enforcement and encouraging the nation. (Sounds good.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight we have 552 confirmed cases (+90) and 35 deaths (+2). The confirmed cases rate is still accelerating, albeit slower than I thought it would. As more people are tested, the curve of the death rate becomes a bigger indicator - it may indicate whether people are already dying due to hospital over capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the world crossed the 400,000 confirmed cases mark, 3 days after crossing 300,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wednesday-march-the-25th&#34;&gt;Wednesday, March the 25th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went out with my dad midday to get groceries. I had volunteered to go do it alone, but the problem was I can&amp;rsquo;t drive, and the 30-40 minute walk back might be problematic with the amount of stuff to buy. And it turned out if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a senior citizen with me, I&amp;rsquo;d have had to wait in a long queue. It&amp;rsquo;s a tradeoff and a risk to be sure, but we tried to manage it. I did the main grocery shopping, he mostly just went to the pharmacy to buy meds. Hopefully that mitigates things. Anytime I go outside, there&amp;rsquo;s an additional bit of anxiety over the next few days to see if we develop any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our drive back, I noted that the nearby McDonald&amp;rsquo;s was the only open restaurant, and it was full of GrabFood drivers. We considered using their drive through, but I don&amp;rsquo;t actually like McDonald&amp;rsquo;s so I passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our &amp;ldquo;honorable&amp;rdquo; senators caused a shitstorm today when he showed up to a major private hospital with his wife for them to have a caesarean birth, knowing full well he should have been under home quarantine while waiting for COVID19 test results. His results came back while they were at the hospital and he had to leave and the whole delivery ward had to be decontaminated and HCWs put into quarantine. The speaker of the house and the mayor of QC must be glad there&amp;rsquo;s a new idiot taking the heat off of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight we have 636 confirmed cases (+84) and 38 deaths (+3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thursday-march-the-26th&#34;&gt;Thursday, March the 26th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, nothing exceptionally stupid from the government today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another senator has announced that he has been diagnosed positive though. And a VP loser, rumored to have been flown to Singapore due to possible severe Covid symptoms, was forced to issue a statement, this time inviting criticism due to him and his family and staff allegedly getting prioritized with tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight we have 707 confirmed cases (+71) and 45 deaths (+7). The world is also a sliver away from 500k cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;friday-march-the-27th&#34;&gt;Friday, March the 27th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumors have been circulating since the day before that a lockdown level up was in the works, perhaps as soon as this weekend. No such announcement came, and some admin people claimed it was fake news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RITM rolls back the positive diagnosis for a congressman, saying they made a clerical error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we have 803 confirmed cases (+96, biggest daily jump so far) and 54 deaths (+9, also biggest jump).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;saturday-march-the-28th&#34;&gt;Saturday, March the 28th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abuzz on the internets yesterday was the exchange between a science-student turned journalist and a infectious disease specialist consulting with the DOH, who sparred over some facts. The journalist was asking why we had tested so few people compared to other nearby countries of similar economic standing, but the doctor insisted the official numbers were much higher - except he was actually talking about number of tests conducted, not number of people tested, which was the comparison being made. This particular doctor had over the past few days established a reputation for being quite arrogant and self-centered, and dismissive of people who aren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;experts&amp;rdquo;. Probably not the best person to be talking for the DOH (but he isn&amp;rsquo;t actually an officially spokesperson - a DOH usec later confirmed the journalist&amp;rsquo;s numbers were the official one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the more science-y folk in my monkeysphere are not very happy with this particular doctor and how he handles himself on social media, and one of my friends (with a background in molecular biology) even got blocked trying to ask him about the technicalities. Regardless, I try to avoid delving into his conversations too much anyway, as he is only a DOH consultant and not an official spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the things he are saying are counterproductive or non sequitur anyway. If I was a media person interviewing a Government or DOH spokesperson, the main question I would want asked would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;between the time of the first confirmed case (January 30) and up to the lockdown of Metro Manila (roughly a 6 week period), what preparations did the DOH undertake to make sure we would have sufficient testing capacity, hospital capacity, and available PPEs for our health workers and other frontliners in case the virus spreads?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize looking into the past may not be the most productive thing at the moment, but if the government and the DOH want us to trust them, I think they need to be able to acknowledge mistakes and lack of preparation. This helps us see that they know what went wrong and can adjust accordingly. Transparency begets trust, and the more trust we can have in our leadership, the easier it will be for the citizenry to bear the harsh burdens that the following weeks and/or months may entail. I want to believe they are capable of handling this situation. Give me hope!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 1075 cases (+272) and 68 deaths (+14), both the biggest daily jumps so far. Presumably the RITM are starting to burn through the testing backlog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, we are past 650k cases. Jumped from 500k-600k in a day and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-march-the-29th&#34;&gt;Sunday, March the 29th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We survived 2 weeks of quarantine/lockdown!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard online mass again via the Quiapo Church facebook page. The priest reminds us that next Sunday is Palm Sunday, and thus next week is Holy Week. He says we just have two more weeks to go, but I am not as hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to keep some of the seniors I live with under check. A couple of them went out for groceries without my knowing. I&amp;rsquo;m sure they&amp;rsquo;re being careful, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I won&amp;rsquo;t be worried and anxious D:.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to shout out some props to the OVP, they&amp;rsquo;ve been able to give support to the frontliners/health care workers even while running on donations and a limited budget. They&amp;rsquo;ve set up free transport routes, dorm rooms for those who want to stay near hospitals, and now they&amp;rsquo;re partnering with fashion designers to make custom PPE clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DOH released a statement saying some of the test kits from China were faulty, but then rolled it back later (presumably not to offend China).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHO and China are increasingly coming under scrutiny for misrepresenting figures and mishandling the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 1418 cases (+343) and 71 deaths (+3). We expect the cases to rise rapidly, given the increase in testing capacity, but we don&amp;rsquo;t yet know where the ceiling is. Today&amp;rsquo;s rate suggests doubling roughly every 3 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monday-march-the-30th&#34;&gt;Monday, March the 30th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A press conference by the president was announced for 4PM today, presumably this is for the report required by the emergency powers law. I will update the time when that actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that not everything is doom and gloom, here are some (presumably good) things the admin is doing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOH expanded testing capabilities to 6 laboratories so far, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/OfficialDOHgov/posts/3188149711196259&#34;&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s a long list of other labs currently being accredited&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOST says &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/256400-philippine-kits-coronavirus-tests-available-april-2020&#34;&gt;120,000 locally-made test kits will be available by Apr 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOH says &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/03/30/1-million-ppe-sets-worth-p1-8b-due-for-delivery-to-doh-for-distribution-to-health-workers/&#34;&gt;1 million PPE sets are due to be delivered and distributed&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully these aren&amp;rsquo;t substandard quality and were not overpriced!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several friends have mentioned that they have viber/messenger chat groups for their local areas so I ask for advice if there&amp;rsquo;s any for our barangay. Someone helpfully adds me to the viber group for QC, though I mute it almost immediately, as I (correctly) expect heavy volume there. I just want to have the channel available in case we need it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally at around 1140pm, the promised presscon finally airs. It&amp;rsquo;s pre-recorded, and rumor is it was already shot earlier and the day, no explanation for the long delay, but I would guess they had to find a decent/usable cut/take that didn&amp;rsquo;t make him look too much like an idiot. I didn&amp;rsquo;t watch, but here&amp;rsquo;s the summary I got from friends (my comments in &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thanks frontliners &lt;em&gt;(finally! he was roundly criticized for not acknowleding them before)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;appeals to the private sector to contribute to this national emergency &lt;em&gt;(Pretty sure they&amp;rsquo;ve been doing that for the past 2 weeks)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We have allotted P200 billion for low income households who are badly affected by this crisis.” &lt;em&gt;(This is good, but still only an allocation, hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s executed well)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thanks those who silently helped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speaking about frontliners who died of COVID-19: Napaka swerte nila namatay sila para sa bayan. It will be an honor to die for the country. &lt;em&gt;(Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just me, but this feels at least a teeny bit insensitive)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;says he will crackdown on corruption in COVID-19 funds &lt;em&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;ll believe it when I see it. Also, what about crackdown on VIPs who ask for priority testing and who violate quarantine?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thanks governments of China and Singapore as well as local businessmen for their contributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 1546 cases (+128) and 78 deaths (+7). Low jump in cases today, have they already completed their backlog? We&amp;rsquo;ll see what tomorrow brings!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuesday-march-the-31st&#34;&gt;Tuesday, March the 31st&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes from a meeting between the IATF and private sector representatives &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mlq3/status/1244827097610084353&#34;&gt;were leaked online today&lt;/a&gt;. Looks like they are recommending a two-week lockdown extension. Private sector people later &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/business/256541-philippine-chamber-commerce-industry-leaked-notes-government-businessmen-video-call-not-policy&#34;&gt;said it was just a brainstorming session&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we got &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/732016/duterte-s-first-report-to-congress-on-covid-19-response/story/&#34;&gt;a copy of the report the palace submitted&lt;/a&gt; to congress as required by the emergency panel law. A lot of details in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former senator and 2016 VP loser Bongbong Marcos has declared he was found positive of COVID19. Same goes for DILG secretary Ano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we are up to 2084 (+538) cases and 88 (+10) deaths. Despite a low bump yesterday, we still managed to double over 3 days. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how the rest of the week goes&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wednesday-april-the-1st&#34;&gt;Wednesday, April the 1st&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;rsquo;s April Fools Day, but there&amp;rsquo;s nothing funny about today&amp;rsquo;s events. I don&amp;rsquo;t normally swear, but what a fucking shitshow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime in the afternoon, a protest broke out at Sitio San Roque in Quezon City (near where my high school was), with the residents going out to the streets to complain about lack of food packs being distributed to them. These are urban poor-type people. Law-enforcement types came in to disperse them for violating quarantine, and violence broke out when people refused and complained. Multiple people were arrested. Arrested for complaining they were dying of hunger! The QC govt later issued a statement denying that relief goods had not been distributed to those areas and blamed instigators for causing trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, the NBI summoned a popular city mayor for questioning about an alleged violation of the Bayanihan Heal As One Act (aka the emergency powers bill aka the BaHO Act), because he violated the natgov order not to allow tricycles to ply the roads. The thing is, that happened way before the BaHO Act was passed, and the mayor appealed to the natgov to let them use tricycles and when that appeal was denied, the mayor complied with the directives. Targeting a very popular local gov official turned out to be a very unpopular move, unsurprisingly, and many just assumed the president was being insecure because this particular mayor was serving his city well and was making him look bad. This is such an idiotic move, not even particularly corrupt or evil or sinister as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really gain them anything; what purpose does it serve other than to make the people angry? An unforced error in a long line of unforced errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people suggested it might be a sleight of hand - to distract us with things they are doing with the emergency funds prescribed by the BaHO act. Supposedly the 1.8B pesos worth of PPE sets being ordered by the DOH are overpriced, but they of course denied that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there was this directive that all donations to the DOH and to govt hospitals need to be coursed through the OCD, and hospitals have to make their requests in writing. Many questioned this added layer of centralized bureaucracy and some openly speculated that this was so that the donations could be &amp;ldquo;repackaged&amp;rdquo; and distribution controlled by a particularly influential senator through his &amp;ldquo;Malasakit centers&amp;rdquo;. If the idea is just to make sure all hospitals get served appropriately, perhaps a more prudent approach would have been for the DOH to continuously publish a priority list of hospitals with the most dire need of donations? The whole reason people are donating directly to the hospitals and hcws is the poor trust in the national government. Some have also suggested that this may be a way to exert some control over the OVP, which has been working hard to solicit donations and get supplies and support to hcws and other frontliners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The icing on the cake: at around 10pm, an unannounced live press conference by the president was aired where he warned the people to just obey, even if relief goods are delayed, promising they will not die of hunger. And for those who would violate quarantine or cause trouble, he implied that the law enforcement types should just shoot to kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTF. Think about that. People are anxious, worried, fearful, and most of all hungry and staving and you think the best move is to threaten them with violence and death?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, pictures came out of donated PPEs and face masks supposedly repackaged and branded as being from a certain senator. Unverified rumors also started to spread that certain private hospitals were raided to get their donations, so that they can be repackaged by the senator. These are yet unverified reports, the only evidence being screenshots of text convos between people who allegedly have first-hand knowledge. If it were true, one would think there would be images or video footage somewhere maybe? Someone I know asked her medical friends and they have no knowledge of such raids on the private hospitals. So maybe let&amp;rsquo;s leave that for now. But I think it&amp;rsquo;s a serious indictment of the trust in the natgov and that senator in particular that many people easily believe he could be behind such acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we are up to 2311 (+227) cases and 96 (+8) deaths. The slope is around the same as the past few days (slightly less), which seems to imply that the limiting factor is how many tests are being conducted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thursday-april-the-2nd&#34;&gt;Thursday, April the 2nd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing this at a bit past 4pm. Ever since Duterte&amp;rsquo;s surprise address last night, #OUSTDUTERTENOW has been trending on Twitter, first locally to the Philippines, then worldwide at #1 (currently at 489k tweets). I took the liberty of taking a look of a few of the profiles using the hashtag, and as far as I can tell the traffic is organic; the accounts don&amp;rsquo;t look like bots, they tweet about a lot of other things (honestly most of it seems to be korean fandom, so maybe they&amp;rsquo;re young people), and aren&amp;rsquo;t recently created egg accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, obviously I don&amp;rsquo;t like Duterte as a president and think he&amp;rsquo;s doing a terrible job. But I wish the Filipino people had chosen a better time to wisen up to his shortcomings than when we&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of a pandemic. Even if somehow there were an orderly transition (not bloody likely), the discontinuity in administration is bound to cause friction and hiccups in our pandemic response. Unfortunately, the administration is pretty bad in their crisis control and have made multiple unforced errors (see yesterday&amp;rsquo;s entry) that only increase the likelihood of social unrest and/or chaos. I would prefer we get past the current crisis first, then we exact accountability, but that may be wishful thinking&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the rest of the day was relatively saner compared to yesterday. As of 7pm, I am slightly more optimistic about the country again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/inquirerdotnet/status/1245614612751331328&#34;&gt;Relief goods were finally distributed to the residents of Sitio San Roque.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jeffcanoy/status/1245616090719195138&#34;&gt;The DILG Sec Ano has some sane words about the NBI&amp;rsquo;s investigation of a popular mayor.&lt;/a&gt; He also says they will crack down on other chief executives not following the IATF guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member of the Presidential Anti-Crime Competition floated the idea that the NBI should also investigate the OVP for &amp;ldquo;competing&amp;rdquo; against other government services. WTF? Later, the head of the PACC issued a statement saying that was not an official recommendation and the member was just expressing a personal opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#OUSTDUTERTE vanished from the twitter trending lists by the time I woke up around lunch time, to be replace by typos like #OUSTDUTERE. Some are speculating it may be counter-ops by troll farms wishing to split the original hashtag. The funny thing is even the typo&amp;rsquo;d hashtag trended for a while!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the lockdown started, we haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten our regular newspaper delivery, so I&amp;rsquo;ve missed the opinion columns of some columnists I like such as Boo Chanco. I recently read a post of his on FB where he shared some thoughts from someone complaining how the government officials in charge had practically no knowledge of supply chain logistics, which made managing the quarantine much more difficult. Unfortunately when I checked his FB profile for the post, it could no longer be found! Either he set it to private due to being bashed by trolls or the person who shared the info asked him to take it down, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 7pm tonight, we are at 2633 (+322) cases and 107 (11) deaths. Still roughly the same curve. It&amp;rsquo;s actually possible we do have this thing under control, given our death count so far hasn&amp;rsquo;t been spiraling out of control like the US (who got their first cases much later than us). But we probably don&amp;rsquo;t have an accurate count - there might be a lot of deaths going unreported as covid19-related due to not being tested, or poor people not even bothering to go to the hospitals, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss being able to go out. Not for hanging out with people, but just being able to take long walks and also to eat outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;friday-april-the-3rd&#34;&gt;Friday, April the 3rd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overnight, the worldwide tally of cases broke past the 1,000,000 mark (doubling in around 5 days) and 50,000 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of good news: Late last night it was announced that mass testing of PUIs and PUMs is planned to start on April 14, so it&amp;rsquo;s a solid step towards the mass testing everyone had been clamoring for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mayor of QC issued a statement apologizing for her past statements on social media and for relief bags bearing her name. She still has a long way to go, but wow the ability to admit mistakes and apologize is super rare among politicians, and improves my trust rating of her and makes me see her more as someone just trying her best in a bad situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had another surprise episode of Late Night with Duterte tonight. Most of it was the usual seemingly drunken rant (a friend of ours showed the stream to a UK colleague and the comment was &amp;ldquo;he looks so wasted!&amp;quot;), including an appeal/threat to obey the police and trying to justify his earlier violent statements, etc. He also spent quite a lot of time picking on former senatorial candidate Chel Diokno, in a manner that made him look like a shallow playground bully, including commentary on appearance. A bit of a plot twist at the end when he castigated the PACC official who suggested to investigate the OVP for helping the people and announced he would be fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 3018 (+385) cases and 136 (29) deaths. Are deaths starting to accelerate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;saturday-april-the-4th&#34;&gt;Saturday, April the 4th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was relatively uneventful, thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 3094 (+76) cases and 144 (+8) deaths. Virus taking a weekend break?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-april-the-5th&#34;&gt;Sunday, April the 5th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have completed three weeks of quarantine/lockdown! The original target end date for the lockdown was Apr 12th, but it seems highly probable that we will have an extension, at least until the end of April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally uneventful, though I would like to note that anecdotally I have been reading more stories about people who criticize the government accused of being communists/leftists rebels (as if complaining is exclusively the domain of the left!). There&amp;rsquo;s even an infamous PCOO undersecretary accusing teachers at my high school alma mater of being CPP-NPA-NDF! I would guess the president&amp;rsquo;s threats against the &amp;ldquo;left&amp;rdquo; has galvanized his base into painting critics with a common brush, giving them an enemy to hate in this crisis; convenient since the true enemy is invisible and cares not about your red-tagging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In better news, a number of politicians, including some mayors and congressmen and even the president himself, have committed to donating part or all of their salaries to the relief operations. It may not be much, but it&amp;rsquo;s something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 3246 (+152) cases and 152 (+8) deaths. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if the relatively lower numbers keep up during the coming week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monday-april-the-6th&#34;&gt;Monday, April the 6th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are officially in week four of quarantine/lockdown!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think by this point, most people are already expecting an extension at least until the end of April. Even Chief Impelementer Galvez (of the  National Task Force Against COVID-19) is implying that&amp;rsquo;s where the task force is leaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the task force, they have &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ntfcovid19ph&#34;&gt;a twitter&lt;/a&gt;! They seem to be communicating better than other govt branches too, and they are &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ntfcovid19ph/status/1247098792848982016&#34;&gt;friends with the OVP apparently&lt;/a&gt;. Galvez is one of the bright spots in the govt fight against the virus, so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This afternoon I went out to the nearby drugstore (around a 10-minute walk) to buy meds for my mom and maybe a tiny bit of groceries (the drugstore has a small grocery section). The drugstore had 3 short queues outside: one for regular transactions, one for senior/PWD transactions (this was the shortest line), and one for groceries (only 3 grocery people allowed inside at the same time). I was transacting for a senior, so I got to use the shortest line. Inside, what used to be the open counter of the pharmacy had a barrier of plastic wrap to separate the customers from the staff, with only a tiny hole to slide prescriptions and money and medicines across. Entire trip (including back and forth walk) took around an hour and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Monday, so we have a new episode of Late Night with Duterte. As usual, I didn&amp;rsquo;t watch, but here&amp;rsquo;s the summary I got from one of my chat groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;says poorest of the poor must receive gov’t assistance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;₱100 billion for one month or the ₱270 billion for two months is not enough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exploring adjustment of budgets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asks for the cooperation of the public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let’s heed the needs of our poor brothers and sisters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on drug addicts: wag subukan ang gobyerno, ang gobyerno desperado na din (to solve the COVID-19 crisis)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encourages everyone to wear masks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nagdadasal ako para sa bayan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kung may pera, d ko hawakan yan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“it’s not my money d ko pwede nakawin, kung ma nakaw ko man, ano gawin ko sa pera na yan”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if money allotted for next month is used now, no more money next month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i want to give the poorest of the poor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;says Elly Pamatong “as president” instructs the military to catch Duterte&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ako, I agree. Kung maaari lang, isali ko sila. (On adding middle class to social amelioration program)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ang solusyon dito is vaccine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;itong problema natin, ang pang kontra nito is stay home, at wag ka mahawaan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sana mapanood niyo yung Japanese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hindi ko alam kung saan ako magkuha ng pera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mas matindi ito sa gera, d mo makita kalaban, pati taliban takot sila&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wag kang mahawa, mag-stay ka sa bahay. “pano pagkain namin?” maghanap ka ng paraan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;panawagan ko: be patient, intindihin niyo ang gobyerno, we’d appreciate it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the resources are all exhausted and the pandemic would claim millions of lives, I hope, really, and I pray that it would not. Pero kung ganun, wala na ako magawa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are inclined to extend the lockdown up to April 30.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like he is striking a softer tone than the last presscon, where it was like he wanted to pick a fight with everyone. A lot of it still seems senseless and incoherent, but I guess there&amp;rsquo;s a slight improvement? I prefer how the ntfcovid19ph is communicating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 3660 (+414) cases and 163 (+11) deaths. For looking at how the trend has been adjusting since the start of the lockdown, my thesis adviser Luis Sison has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/luisgsison/posts/2905346532879075&#34;&gt;posting some graphs regularly on Facebook.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuesday-april-the-7th&#34;&gt;Tuesday, April the 7th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lockdown/ECQ has officially been extended until the end of April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a grocery run today with my dad. He went to the bank while I did the grocery shopping. There&amp;rsquo;s still a decent number of people in the grocery, despite them limiting entry. Proper social distancing is probably impossible. I mean, if implemented properly, each aisle of the grocery is only wide enough for one person, so that means waiting patiently while the lady in front of you slowly goes through the items on the shelves. I tried to minimize getting too close unnecessarily of course, but it&amp;rsquo;s a challenge. For me, that means I&amp;rsquo;ll be anxious for the next week or so in case any symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small Pizza Hut in the grocery building was open and doing takeout, but I only noticed when I was done, and there was a 30-45 minute wait. Should remember next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of interest: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.4442633659095731&amp;amp;type=3%3Fsfnsn%3Dmo&#34;&gt;Duterte&amp;rsquo;s timeline of incompetence post by JGS-UPD&lt;/a&gt;. I was thinking of incorporating something like this into this diary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word is that the defendants being represented by Chel Diokno after they were subpoena&amp;rsquo;ed by the NBI were investigated &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lianbuan/status/1247465754066178049&#34;&gt;because of a social media post asking why the government doesn&amp;rsquo;t have money for healthcare when they have P2B for a gulfstream jet&lt;/a&gt;. Sounds like suppression of freedom of speech to me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 3764 (+104) cases and 177 (+14) deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wednesday-april-the-8th&#34;&gt;Wednesday, April the 8th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time before 9pm, we were told the president had another address tonight. It&amp;rsquo;s now 11:57 and it hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened. Maybe I should just be thankful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 3870 (+106) cases and 182 (+5) deaths. Low numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thursday-april-the-9th&#34;&gt;Thursday, April the 9th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president&amp;rsquo;s address actually aired well past midnight, so let&amp;rsquo;s log it here. The content wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything of relevance, more whining about limitations of budget, imploring people to obey, etc. The address also included remarks from people like DOHsec Duque, BudgetSec Dominguez, Chief Implementer Galvez, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I will note is Duque said that &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cnnphilippines/status/1247925887619567616&#34;&gt;the travel ban from China helped slow the disease&lt;/a&gt;. Now, a lot of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cnnphilippines/status/1247925887619567616&#34;&gt;twitter reactions&lt;/a&gt; indicate people think this was a lie, that we had no such China travel ban, basing it on earlier statements of Duque and other palace officials. Now, I dislike this admin of course, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t meant I can be dishonest about them. Officially, we did have a travel ban from China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did Duterte, Duque and other officials say there was no need for a China travel ban and that China may question it?&lt;/em&gt; Yes, this happened in late January, around the time of the first 3 confirmed cases in the country. Citations: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/250506-coronavirus-scare-travel-ban-mainland-chinese-not-for-now-duque&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/1/29/duterte-on-china-travel-ban.html&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did we did have China travel bans instituted?&lt;/em&gt; Also yes, after the first case was confirmed in the country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first from Hubei province only, as of Jan 31. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/1/31/Philippines-novel-coronavirus-China-travel-ban.html&#34;&gt;Citation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a few days later on Feb 2, on all of China (including HK, Taiwan and Macau. The Taiwan part was later rescinded). &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/02/02/20/ph-imposes-travel-ban-on-china-as-new-coronavirus-infections-rise-globally&#34;&gt;Citation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After these bans were instituted, there were questions as to whether they were really strictly being implemented, and there were screenshots and other evidence circulating that there were still flights coming in from China. That there are flights coming in from China should not in itself be relevant, given (a) flights can contain cargo, not just passengers; and (b) flights can contain Filipino citizens being repatriated from China, as these are still allowed to come in, although they have to undergo quarantine. Whether any foreigners slipped through the cracks of this travel ban is unknown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, not even the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.4442633659095731&amp;amp;type=3%3Fsfnsn%3Dmo&#34;&gt;timeline of incompetence post I referenced the other day&lt;/a&gt; includes this information, which is a disservice. In the interest of fairness, I have highlighted these dates and links at the top of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could the government have done more during January and February?&lt;/em&gt; Less factual, but in my opinion also yes. We basically wasted a lot of time in January and February twiddling our thumbs. As far as I can tell, no additional preparations were done in Feb other than the China travel bans. Total travel ban from other countries only happned when the lockdown/ECQ happened in early March, IIRC. (Feel free to correct me if I&amp;rsquo;m wrong.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Were we the first to lockdown, as Duterte implies?&lt;/em&gt; Obviously not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 4076 (+206) cases and 203 (+21) deaths. Biggest deaths jump so far!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it is the Holy Week long weekend, and updating this everyday is getting tiresome, I might skip a few days and maybe resume on Easter Sunday. Unless something outlandish happens, which is not outside the realm of possibility!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-april-the-12th&#34;&gt;Sunday, April the 12th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is Easter Sunday, and coincidentally marks one month since the lockdown/ECQ was originally announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past couple of days, word came out that a certain QC hospital was having trouble with a lack of body bags for handling cadavers. Insider reports say that bodies are piling up and they&amp;rsquo;re running out of places to put them, and that the hospital got an order to underreport the deaths. The DOH got wind of this and immediately issued a statement denying the rumors. The hospital came out with a statement denying they are running out of body bags, but later admitted that their morgue is over capacity because of an unusually high number of unclaimed body bags. Apparently there was an order to hospitals to report deaths first to the DOH before anyone else, so maybe that order was misinterpreted which led to the underreporting deaths rumor. In any case, if one hospital is struggling with deaths, it&amp;rsquo;s likely other hospitals are too, which is worrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents haven&amp;rsquo;t seen their grandkids all together since February, so today we set up a zoom call with everyone so we can enjoy their company. It was expectedly a lot of chaos, but the kids had a lot of energy and we had fun and the grandparents enjoyed the quality time, so that&amp;rsquo;s something. It&amp;rsquo;s highly unlikely we&amp;rsquo;ll get to see each other until late May at the earliest, so this was the next best thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 4648 (+220 today, +572 since Thursday) cases and 297 (+50 today, +94 since Thursday) deaths. This is now the record for most deaths/day, but it&amp;rsquo;s possible that some death reporting may have been delayed due to the holiday weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, cases are now at 1.8 million and deaths more than 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kind of enjoyed the short break, so I think future updates to this diary will be sparse, instead of the daily it was before. Maybe only when significant things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wednesday-april-the-15th&#34;&gt;Wednesday, April the 15th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three days since the last entry. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone out three times, the most for any week since the quarantine began. Twice was for medicine runs for the parental units (one would think they could just combine them into one request, but apparently extenuating circumstances etc), and another was for a grocery run. I still failed to get pizza at the grocery store though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had thought about having food delivered last Easter Sunday, but apparently we decided on it too late, by 4:30pm most of the open restos were no longer delivering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much to report on the government side. Not that things aren&amp;rsquo;t happening, but it&amp;rsquo;s more of the same, mostly. Although the good news is that some LGUs are adding their own testing programs, so hopefully we get a better idea of where we are in the days to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 5453 (+230 today, +805 since Sunday) cases and 349 (+14 today, +52 since Sunday) deaths. The rate of new cases has more or less held steady over the past few days, with about a thousand being added every 3-4 days. The good news is the recovery count has caught up to the death count, today it&amp;rsquo;s at 353. This is excellent because it was probably only a week or so ago that the there were about twice as many deaths as recoveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;friday-april-the-17th&#34;&gt;Friday, April the 17th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, a resolution by majority of senators asking the health secretary to resign came out. The signatories were mostly pro-admin senators too! Duterte quickly rejected the requested. Today, the socioeconomic planning secretary and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rapplerdotcom/status/1251045773443166208?s=21&#34;&gt;NEDA head offered his resignation&lt;/a&gt;, partly due to personal reasons and partly due to &amp;ldquo;differences in philosophy with a few fellow cabinet members&amp;rdquo;. The timing is weird and makes me think that he resigned due to Duque not resigning, but that&amp;rsquo;s pure speculation lol. The more probable reason is that the other cabinet members don&amp;rsquo;t agree with his recommendation to try to end the lockdown quickly? We can only speculate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1852785&#34;&gt;entire sitio in Cebu is now considered infected&lt;/a&gt; after mass testing found a large number of asymptomatic cases. Out of 53 confirmed positives, 51 were asymptomatic. That&amp;rsquo;s a troubling rate, it may mean our actual number of confirmed cases may be up to 25 times more than previously thought. (Don&amp;rsquo;t quote me on that, this is a single data point.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 5878 (+218 today, +425 since Wednesday) cases, 387 (+25 today, +38 since Wednesday) deaths and 487 (+52) recoveries. Recoveries increasing faster than deaths, so that&amp;rsquo;s promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-april-the-19th&#34;&gt;Sunday, April the 19th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard 6am mass via the TV. ABS-CBN broadcasts one, I think it&amp;rsquo;s held in their studio. The celebrant was Fr. Jerry Orbos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two more weeks of this, at least. Some people are hoping for partial lifting of the ECQ in May, but there&amp;rsquo;s also the possibility of tighter restrictions, as the president has threatened. Rumors and feelers point in either direction being possible. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 6259 (+172 today, +381 since Friday) cases, 409 (+12 today, +22 since Friday) deaths and 572 (+56 today, +85 since Friday) recoveries. Recoveries growing faster than deaths for the past 3 days, and confirmed cases seemingly tapering off? Seems a bit too good to be true? Again, we&amp;rsquo;ll see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;friday-april-the-24th&#34;&gt;Friday, April the 24th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, the government officially extended the ECQ in Metro Manila (and some other areas with high Covid19 incidence) up to May 15th. Not surprising, especially given the rumors and the trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago, there was this altercation at a quezon city checkpoint where cops ended up shooting and killing a mentally unstable ex-military person after a short standoff. Supposedly because he made a motion as if to draw something from his bag. The police claim he had a gun, but the witnesses and relatives say otherwise. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of different videos of the encounter too. The PNP initially cleared the officer in the encounter, but today it was announced that homicide charges would be filed. It&amp;rsquo;s a good step towards accountability, but I&amp;rsquo;m skeptical it would lead anywhere. But more importantly - cops really need to get over this mentality of preferring the use of lethal force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 7192 cases (+211 today, +933 since Sunday), 477 deaths (+15 today, +68 since Sunday), and 762 (+40 today, +190 since Sunday) recoveries. It&amp;rsquo;s great that recoveries are still outpacing deaths, but I&amp;rsquo;m worried about the number of still unresolved active cases. Around two weeks ago, there were a bit 4000 cases, but as of today, we only have around 1200 deaths+recoveries, so there&amp;rsquo;s around 2800 cases that are serious enough to still be unresolved after 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-april-the-26th&#34;&gt;Sunday, April the 26th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three more weeks of this. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I mind staying at home. But I miss being able to go out and walk around and eat outside freely, even alone. Also, I could use a haircut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only went out once this week, for groceries. We tried to buy a bit more than usual, hoping to reduce the number of times we need to go out. We also celebrated a couple of birthdays in the family, through a zoom call, complete with the grandkids blowing on a candle from across the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 7579 cases (+285 today, +487 since Friday), 501 deaths (+7 today, +24 since Friday), and 862 (+70 today, +100 since Friday) recoveries. Worldwide, we are nearing 3M cases and have passed 200,000 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-may-the-3rd&#34;&gt;Sunday, May the 3rd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officially, this is the 3rd calendar month of quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couple of days ago we got a second tranche of relief goods from the LGU, mostly canned fish things and some rice. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been out all week, but word is that they are being a bit more strict and there are more cops policing places like the wet market etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 9223 cases (+295 today, +1644 for the week), 607 deaths (+4 today, +106 for the week), and 1214 (+90 today, +352 for the week) recoveries. Recoveries vastly outpacing deaths is good news, but the number of cases continues to rise linearly without any slowdown in sight, probably due to testing limits I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll see if NCR manages to leave ECQ after the 15th, but even then we&amp;rsquo;re still only going into General Community Quarantine (GCQ) which is definitely not a &amp;ldquo;back to normal&amp;rdquo; scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, there have been an additional 500k cases and 45k deaths over the past week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-may-the-10th&#34;&gt;Sunday, May the 10th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was mostly an experiment in making a single continuous post that would be updated periodically. At this point (well over 10,000 words in this single post), I&amp;rsquo;m ready to admit this has been an unwieldy experiment. I will still continue the covid19 updates and thoughts, but probably as separate notes and posts. You can follow succeeding entries (including one for today) via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/covid19/&#34;&gt;covid19 tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be continued&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to Make Voluntary SSS Payments
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/how-to-make-voluntary-sss-payments/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Since I stopped being a full-time employee at the end of 2015, I&amp;rsquo;ve missed around four years of monthly SSS payments. This isn&amp;rsquo;t really that big a deal, since I&amp;rsquo;ve already paid more than 10 years of premiums, I&amp;rsquo;m already guaranteed to get a pension from SSS when I reach retirement age. However, this past January I decided to resume making SSS premium payments on a voluntary basis. I had to research a bit and ask some friends about the whole process, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d document it here both for my own recollection and in case someone finds it useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SSS pension isn&amp;rsquo;t a lot, which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve never really prioritized making the payments, but making voluntary payments will slightly increase the actual pension I can get from SSS in my old age. The computation for SSS pension amounts is outside the scope of this post (it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;amp;q=sss+pension+computation&#34;&gt;easy to search for&lt;/a&gt;) but AFAIK each additional year of payments I make (with the maximum contribution amount) will increase my monthly pension by around 320 pesos, and this is the maximum possible bracket. A pitiful amount really; whether it&amp;rsquo;s worth it or not depends on how long you intend to live past retirement age. By my computation if you live around 8 years past retirement age, you come out ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First step: Create an account&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want to transition from monthly payments made by your employer to voluntary payments, the first thing you need is an account on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sss.gov.ph/&#34;&gt;SSS online website&lt;/a&gt;. There are several methods to register an account, but all of them will require your SSS No. plus a secondary set of information to verify your identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secondary info can be something a mobile number or savings account number already registered with SSS, or a Payment Reference Number (PRN) previously used (more on PRNs later). If you&amp;rsquo;re like me and you&amp;rsquo;ve had zero interactions with SSS in the past, the easiest way is to get the SSS Employer number for your last employer. (If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a previous employer, I suspect you have to go to the SSS office and ask for advice there.) Hopefully you haven&amp;rsquo;t burned your bridges and can just ask them for this information.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;44f5afa62540b9f947dad54259f2337b-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/how-to-make-voluntary-sss-payments/sss-registration.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;9 Mar 2020 12:00am&#34;&gt;9 Mar 2020 12:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I signed up by providing this information, so now I have an account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next step: Generate a PRN.&lt;/strong&gt; A PRN is a Payment Reference Number, basically a record of the payment you want to make. after you log in to the SSS web application, click the &amp;ldquo;Payment Reference Number (PRN)&amp;rdquo; tab and click &amp;ldquo;Generate PRN&amp;rdquo;. You get the following form:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;c141dba1cf727ae45dfe0ee032325633-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/how-to-make-voluntary-sss-payments/sss-2.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;9 Mar 2020 12:00am&#34;&gt;9 Mar 2020 12:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Input the following fields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Membership Type: Voluntary. By fulfilling this payment for the first time, your membership type will be changed to &amp;ldquo;Voluntary&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applicable Period: You can choose to pay for 1 month at a time or multiple months. I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried paying for multiple months yet, IDK if there is a limit as to how far in advance you can pay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribution: When your SSS premiums are paid automatically by your employer, the actual contribution amount is determined by your salary. But the highest bracket is for salaries of only P16,000 or more a month, so chances are you were in the highest bracket already if you were in IT. This corresponds to the highest possible contribution amount of P2400 per month. You can choose to pay less if you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total Amount: This will be computed automatically when you click &amp;ldquo;Submit Request&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you submit the request, your PRN will be generated in the succeeding page:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own PRN is redacted in the screenshot for privacy reasons, but it&amp;rsquo;s a string of two letters followed by twelve numbers. A payment due date is also provided. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how this is determined, I think it&amp;rsquo;s the end of the month after the current quarter? No idea really. You can also go back to the PRN list or click the PRN tab again to view the list of your outstanding PRNs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next: How to actually pay the premium?&lt;/strong&gt; You can actually do it online directly from the PRN list, there will be a &amp;ldquo;PAY&amp;rdquo; button. This is currently through a service called &lt;a href=&#34;https://moneygment.ph/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Moneygment&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never tried it myself so I have no feedback other than that is a terrible name for an app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SSS website also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sss.gov.ph/sss/appmanager/pages.jsp?page=eservices&#34;&gt;claims that it is possible to pay via BancNet or Unionbank&lt;/a&gt;. When I checked the Unionbank web application, there was no option to pay to SSS as a biller, so I guess that&amp;rsquo;s out. BancNet Online is only available to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bancnetonline.com/BancnetWeb/view/goToUserPreRegistrationPage.do&#34;&gt;accounts in certain banks&lt;/a&gt;, none of which apply to me, so I can&amp;rsquo;t do that either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, what I&amp;rsquo;ve tried is I go and make a payment at the nearest Bayad Center. Yes, I need to go out and interact with people like this was the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you go to the Bayad Center and you ask for a form for SSS member contribution. You fill up the form, including the PRN number you want to pay, and make the payment. It&amp;rsquo;s relatively painless, aside from the having to go to the Bayad Center in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a week after making the payment, I suggested logging in to the SSS website again and checking your account details to see if the payment was recognized, just to make sure everything went fine. IDK how it could go wrong, but this is the government, so better safe than sorry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: I was using the old SSS webapp for this (and the screenshots above). They also have a publicly-accessible beta of their &lt;a href=&#34;https://portal.sss.gov.ph/member/&#34;&gt;new member portal&lt;/a&gt;. It uses the same account as the old webapp, and it looks &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; less dated. However, I could not find a screen in the beta member portal for generating the PRNs, so you might be stuck using the old webapp.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>A Different Kind of Revolution

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I watched a little bit of the Senate hearing yesterday on the ABS-CBN franchise renewal issues. One of the senators, a known lackey of the president claimed that while the president was not vindictive, &amp;ldquo;kung masama ka sa kanya, masama din sya sa yo&amp;rdquo; (I&amp;rsquo;m not sure the senator understood what vindictive means). One of the ABS head honchos later made a statement that they were &amp;ldquo;sorry if they had offended the president&amp;rdquo; even though they were just following all the relevant laws, or something to that effect. I cringed. Why do they need to apologize to an onion-skinned politician if they did nothing wrong? The whole thing had the air of &amp;ldquo;you have displeased your betters, repent and you may be forgiven.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed ironic that all this was being done on the eve of the anniversary of the so-called People Power EDSA Revolution of 1986. Not just the sheer audacity to target the free press for suppression (it&amp;rsquo;s all about sending a message), but to do it with so obvious personal vindictiveness. It reminds me of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/02/edsa/&#34;&gt;failed promise of EDSA&lt;/a&gt;, specifically our failure to remove this culture of patronage that burdens us so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patronage defines this administration, this is obvious from the fact that we have a senator openly proclaiming his allegiance to the president above all things. People unfriendly or critical of this administration are accused of crimes or are removed from office through legal gymnastics. Favored sycophants are elected to prime government positions. Friends who steal from the people or get midnight deals get off scot-free. The administration turns a blind eye to encroachments on our sovereignty when they come from a country that is &amp;ldquo;friendly&amp;rdquo; with the president, but takes it as an insult when a long-time ally tries to get us to respect human rights. A long-standing defense pact is abrogated because a loyal lapdog was denied a visa. And of course, mass media companies are pressured when they refuse to recognize the emperor&amp;rsquo;s new clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This administration has brought patronage to shameless heights, but it&amp;rsquo;s hardly unique to them. It is a general malaise of the Filipino culture for as long as I can remember. People don&amp;rsquo;t respect institutions or processes or merit, they look for patrons or connections to get ahead of others. Arcane and obtuse bureaucratic processes don&amp;rsquo;t help, they encourage the emergence of fixers and facilitators. Even among private industries, there are those where you can&amp;rsquo;t get hired or get promoted unless you know someone higher-up who can support or endorse you. People in power routinely ignore laws. Sometime ago a congressman even had the gall to ask to be exempted from traffic rules because they were &amp;ldquo;doing important work&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a harsh truth, but it can be difficult to blame the Filipino people. This is what they see in their everyday lives: people getting ahead in life through &amp;ldquo;diskarte&amp;rdquo; or connections or patronage. They vote for the politicians who bring them the most personal benefit, without any regard to whether they are good for the system or the collective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This culture of patronage is one of the reasons why there is so much &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_distance&#34;&gt;power distance&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/797-pnoy-and-the-power-distance-index&#34;&gt;this country&lt;/a&gt;. People are beholden to those in power in our feudalistic, patron-driven society. Many would prefer not to speak up or question those in power, knowing that their fortunes may depend on keeping a good relationship with their &amp;ldquo;betters&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: this is one of the reasons why I like working in tech. In tech companies, connections or influence can only get you so far, if you are bad at your job, it is going to show. One of my chat groups had a discussion about moving from a tech company to a nontech company like in the mass media or banking sectors, one of the tips was to be prepared for a lot more &amp;ldquo;politics&amp;rdquo;. A polite term for people getting ahead (or trying to) by using connections or influence. I have better things to do than trying to navigate political relationships or arcane company policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is the anniversary of the EDSA &amp;ldquo;revolution&amp;rdquo;. Except it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a revolution, more of a revolt. We replaced the top leadership but not the culture that brought us down that path. And here we are still electing the same kind of leaders after all this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need a different kind of revolution. The term &amp;ldquo;cultural revolution&amp;rdquo; is heavily loaded because of China, but that&amp;rsquo;s the kind of revolution we need right now - one that changes the culture in our country, one that strengthens institutions and promotes honesty, integrity and transparency, one where people are treated equally regardless of power or position. We need to be a country where the politicians serve the people, not the other way around, that is what &amp;ldquo;people power&amp;rdquo; should really mean.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Thanks for your reply, but I&amp;rsquo;m still not clear on the &amp;ldquo;employer-employee relationship part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a contractual part-time service worker in a fast food chain, he is not considered a regular employee is this correct? Is he required to register as a business? (I assume no.) Is he deduced the 8% withholding tax or the regular income tax?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this different from the scenario where you are a consultant working as a contractor for a local (PH) client (say, as a graphic designer or software developer)? Is the consultant considered an employee? Is he required to register as a business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for a number of clients as a consultant under contract, and they always just withhold the 8% and when I ask if there&amp;rsquo;s anything else I need to do for tax purposes, they never advise me that I need a business permit. Should their accountant been telling them otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;  Recurring like, you expect to engage in that particular kind of transaction for more than 1 time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&amp;gt; does that mean if you are only doing this once, it is not considered recurring? i.e. a client asks me to build an application for them and I receive a one-time payment from them upon delivery and afterwards we no longer have a relationship, in this scenario you do not have to register as a business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for all the follow-ups, I just want to clearly understand the scenarios wherein I would or would not be required to register as a business, because honestly I would like to avoid the bureaucracy as much as possible, hence I prefer not to register as a business if it can be avoided. I understand our duty as citizens to pay the right taxes etc and I would like to make sure I comply with any requirements and I don&amp;rsquo;t mind the withholding tax being deducted from me. But I would prefer to know under what conditions I could structure freelance/consultant work without having to register as a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW, I wanted to say I appreciate your answering these questions. I had been planning to look for an accountant to consult on related matters so this thread really helps.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;1. Should I register as a self-employed /business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Only if you are earning recurring income not earned under an employer-employee relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please explain &amp;ldquo;recurring income&amp;rdquo; here? What if I am earning money not on a full-time basis, with no guarantee of recurring income? For example, a company consults with me and I get paid an hourly fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please also explain &amp;ldquo;employer-employee relationship&amp;rdquo;. I was previously working as a consultant with a company, and they were deducting the withholding tax from me (I think it was 8%). My understanding is I was not an actual employee here since I was a consultant, should I have been registered as a business in this instance? It&amp;rsquo;s just weird since this withholding tax was already reported to the BIR and it seems there was no issue.&lt;/p&gt;
