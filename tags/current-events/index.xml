            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;These weeknotes are coming in late in the day because of reasons. (The reasons being laziness and procrastination.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been kind of phoning in the weeknotes over the past few weeks, they&amp;rsquo;ve mostly been &amp;ldquo;hey, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy, so nothing of significance happened, but here are some things I watched/played.&amp;rdquo; Supposedly one of the side effects of writing regular updates is that you tend to look out for more interesting things to do so you have something to write about, even on an unconscious level. In the past few weeks, that has been problematic because (a) as mentioned, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with some things, so my excess time is devoted to less mentally taxing things like just watching movies/shows or destress with games; and (b) we are still in the middle of a pandemic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the pandemic, I read this piece recently on the Financial Times: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ft.com/content/32d79c87-1ade-4b63-8d14-7af1a553d963&#34;&gt;We won’t remember much of what we did in the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, about how the sameyness of our days in quarantine means our brains compress that data since so little of it is meaningful, affecting our perception of time. When 99% of your activities take place in the same environment, in your room during a zoom call, everything just tends to blur together. And I guess that reflected in the weeknotes too! (For that reason, I&amp;rsquo;m switching up the weeknotes format today to be more freeform prose, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if it sticks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the pandemic part 2, one thing I have been doing since the pandemic started is writing a regular series of notes, first as &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/covid19/&#34;&gt;one long post that I kept updating every couple of days or so&lt;/a&gt; then later I transitioned to regular weekly update notes, on the same day as these weeknotes. The idea was that in the future I could just browse the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/covid19/&#34;&gt;covid19 tag&lt;/a&gt; on the site and I could recall what things were like during the days of quarantine and the quality of the government response. And this was fine during the start, since things happened and unfolded quickly. But these past few months, the updates have fallen in the quagmire of sameyness as well: I only went out once every 1 or 2 weeks, everything was always getting worse, cases were always going up, government response was always terrible, and so on. One thing the last few months has made clear for me is that the government has no clear plan on controlling this thing and so I am highly pessimistic that things will change anytime soon. For that reason, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to pause on doing the covid19 update notes for now, unless some drastic change happens.(I have no expectation of Russia&amp;rsquo;s vaccine having any effect on our status quo anytime soon!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so how was my week? I wrapped up the things causing my busy-ness towards the middle of the week, so I expect to be less busy/stressed during the coming weeks. At the very least, I should be able to write on the blog more, and maybe do some work on some of my other side projects. I actually thought about writing some posts already last week but I was like you know what, I&amp;rsquo;ll just relax and watch things and play things and leave the writing to next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching and playing the past week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marvel&amp;rsquo;s Agents of SHIELD had their series finale last Thursday. I enjoyed the first half of this season, but the second half and the finale were just ok, maybe slightly meh. Still, the series finale was pretty good, wrapping things up nicely with a big bow. This series had a lot of haters, I think mostly because of mismatched expectations, because people wanted it to be more directly tied-in to the MCU movies, but that was never going to happen (maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll get that more with the coming Disney+ series). But I like it, it had a lot of fans, and it had a pretty good run. And it had Ghost Rider!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One things I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a bunch is Amonkhet Remastered, which came out on Magic Arena last Thursday. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing drafts over on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&#34;&gt;the twitch channel&lt;/a&gt;, and archiving them to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsD8jNRlYkw&amp;amp;list=PLmU0vkKslGXg6Pdu3_kaKx5oumTwftUUe&#34;&gt;this playlist on the Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly fun, though I need to play better. Watch me on Twitch/Youtube, or like and subscribe, all that jazz, if you like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oh, I also finally finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/08/1293051269129486337/&#34;&gt;Divinity Original Sin 2&lt;/a&gt;! I really dragged out that last act for a few months, but I finally got there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/08/1294146833359364097/&#34;&gt;tried out Fall Guys on PS4&lt;/a&gt; (free on PS+!). It&amp;rsquo;s fun but kind of frustrating, I guess this is why I don&amp;rsquo;t really play these battle royale kind of things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a little bit Street Fighter x Tekken because of a reddit thread and am once again disappointed that (a) it was such a missed opportunity; and (b) up to now it&amp;rsquo;s still not available on Steam in SEA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so one of the reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing these &amp;ldquo;watching/playing lately&amp;rdquo; posts and segments is because I want to track what I have been watching/playing at any particular point in the past. And maybe I can have like a widget on the site with things like &amp;ldquo;Recently played&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Last movie watched&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;d also want to be able to search/query for things like &amp;ldquo;what year did I watch so-and-so movie?&amp;rdquo; (Helps with trivia quizzes!) I feel like I need to be recording these detail in more of a machine-readable format or a database in order to do those kinds of things. Maybe some kind of Goodreads-like system? It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;d need to figure out how to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, this is already longer than I thought it would be. More things will be posted to the blog (hopefully!) later this week!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Still kind of busy, although there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of things I hope I can finally wrap up this week, so I can move on to the long list of other things I want to be doing. The world continues to be bleak, so I&amp;rsquo;m still hiding from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/08/forty-two/&#34;&gt;Forty-two.&lt;/a&gt; I thought about just merging these into a single post for the day, but nah, this seems better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reworking the old charity side project still ongoing. I was hoping to finish all the changes last week and next week would be testing and deployment, but stuff got in the way (and estimates may have been a bit off), but the spillover is small and we should still be fine for finishing everything next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots more SC2 coop this week, mostly in the wee hours to destress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost impulse-bought a Switch yesterday; a friend&amp;rsquo;s logic and my inexorably large gaming backlog held me back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG Arena: Nothing of significance, but Amonkhet remastered comes out this week so looking forward to that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually did a bit better in 1 of the two quizzes we played this week, but I think we had way more fun playing Codenames online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background watching: Jeopardy on Netflix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binged the new Transformers Netflix series, since it was fairly short (six episodes). A very bleak take on the Autobots&amp;rsquo; struggle against the Decepticons on Cybertron, and also a very obvious tie-in to the current War for Cybertron toy line since most of the main characters have toys in that line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also watched Craig Ferguson&amp;rsquo;s Netflix special Tickle Fight, mainly because I happened to have watch a few of his late night segments on YT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also started watching the last season of Agents of SHIELD, since I&amp;rsquo;m told the season finale is coming up next week. First three episodes seem pretty good for network TV, hopefully I have time for the rest of the (short) season in the next couple of weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links: Nothing of note this week. Even though I have read some interesting stuff, I think my link-capturing workflow really needs improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still in a pandemic!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Pandemic thoughts and updates, Aug 9 edition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So, NCR got sent back into MECQ, a stronger quarantine lockdown. I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually felt the difference, since I&amp;rsquo;m at home most of the time. We went out yesterday for a grocery run, and not much seemed different out there either, still a lot of cars and people out of doors. I don&amp;rsquo;t actually remember what the last MECQ was like, but I kind of assumed things would be closer to how they were at the onset of the lockdowns in March, but this feels still mostly like the GCQ of past weeks. IDK if this 2-week MECQ stretch really serves any purpose except to show the government is trying something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching mass via Facebook again today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 126,885 cases (+4226 from the day before, +28653 from last week, huge jump week-on-week), 2,209 deaths (+41 from the day before, +170 from last week, thankfully not as big a jump as from last week), 67,117 recoveries (+287 from the day before, +1852 from last week, a predictably much smaller jump after last week&amp;rsquo;s miraculous &amp;ldquo;mass recoveries&amp;rdquo;). We hit record high daily deaths again over the first few days of the MECQ. We seem to have settled at a much higher average daily rate since then. Luckily, the death rate hasn&amp;rsquo;t gone up that much. We are now #1 in confirmed cases in SEA, overtaking Indonesia. The govt claims nothing to worry about, it&amp;rsquo;s only because we are testing more, but our relatively large positivity rate (around 8.6% as of this writing) implies transmission is outpacing testing? &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at around 19.8 cases (+1.8M from last week, slope holding steady for maybe 3 weeks now?) and almost 730k deaths. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Kind of a busy week for me again, so the week kind of passed me by quickly. It&amp;rsquo;s August! In one month it will be (PH) Christmas season! It feels like July went by more quickly than other quarantine months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bit of consulting work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reworking the old charity side project still ongoing. I was hoping to finish all the changes last week and next week would be testing and deployment, but stuff got in the way (and estimates may have been a bit off), but the spillover is small and we should still be fine for finishing everything next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starcraft 2 came out with a 10th anniversary patch that had some sweet new features and changes for coop. They added unlockable prestige talents for each of the 18 commanders, each talent alters their gameplay so they play out a bit differently. We had actually been getting a bit bored with SC2 coop and had been playing it less, this patch did a lot to invigorate our enthusiasm for it. We&amp;rsquo;ve been playing it quite a bit to unlock the prestige talents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG Arena: Didn&amp;rsquo;t hit mythic last month, but that&amp;rsquo;s fine. I switched my historic deck to Monored for faster games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only played 1 quiz last week for reasons. Instead, trivia group played some online Codenames (via &lt;a href=&#34;https://codenames.game/&#34;&gt;https://codenames.game/&lt;/a&gt;) on Saturday night, with voice chat over discord. It was a bunch of fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s new episodes of Jeopardy on Netflix, so that quickly replaced Family Guy as my background watching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s actually a bunch of new stuff to watch too: Umbrella Academy S2 is out, there&amp;rsquo;s a new Transformers series on Netflix etc. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get around to all of these things someday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some fixes to the trivia app backend, but I can&amp;rsquo;t really get too much into the (other) side projects until I get past my current busyness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internet seems to be having some DNS issues this past week. Occasionally can&amp;rsquo;t access various URLs, but is fine on refresh. Problem survived multiple router reboots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The right-click button on this gaming mouse I got last year is starting to get less responsive. I only got for $13 in Walmart, but even then it&amp;rsquo;s one of the more expensive mice I&amp;rsquo;ve bought, so I hope it doesn&amp;rsquo;t die too quickly. Maybe I should clean it out?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Couple of somewhat related blog posts resonated with me: &lt;a href=&#34;https://rubenerd.com/why-arent-you-more-serious/&#34;&gt;Why aren’t you more serious?&lt;/a&gt;, asserting the personal blog&amp;rsquo;s right to write about whatever the blogger wants, and not just to focus on specific serious or technical topics; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://om.co/2020/07/30/write-like-a-human/&#34;&gt;Write like a human&lt;/a&gt; is kind of self-explanatory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great follow-up to a previous survey on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pudding.cool/2020/07/song-decay/&#34;&gt;Defining the 90s Music Canon&lt;/a&gt;. Also had an &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/roytang/status/1288899712112717824&#34;&gt;interesting exchange about this with a friend over on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; re:how this might reflect locally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDK, maybe I&amp;rsquo;m getting used to the pandemic. Is this what they mean by &amp;ldquo;new normal&amp;rdquo;? I&amp;rsquo;ll move the pandemic notes to the end of these weekly updates.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Pandemic thoughts and updates, Aug 2 edition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We ended July with around 90k active cases. Despite the threat of sending Metro Manila back to ECQ if we breached the 85k mark, the govt did not push through. Over the weekend, this led to a clamor from doctors and other frontliners to have a &amp;ldquo;time out&amp;rdquo; of 2 weeks for the NCR, a temporary quarantine, to give the healthcare system some breathing room. The knee-jerk response from the palace was to say it wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessary, but they quickly flipped their flops and said the IATF would discuss it. Enraging people and doctors, a certain outspoken-on-social-media doctor tried to shame doctors for not being heroic enough, and a certain senator implied that we can&amp;rsquo;t afford it so frontliners just need to work harder and be more passionate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching mass via Facebook again today. Churches have actually been holding limited physical services, but in solidarity with the call for ECQ, they said they will temporarily suspend such services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went to get some Jollibee takeout last Thursday; apparently they are already allowing limited dine-in customers, that seems unwise, eh. Was anxious the entire time I was waiting for my takeout order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 98232 cases (+4963 from the day before, +19820 from last week, huge jump week-on-week), 2039 deaths (+17 from the day before, +142 from last week, moderate jump), 65265 recoveries (+93 from the day before, +39513 (!) from last week, a miraculous jump). We hit record high daily deaths over the past few days, and the huge spike in recoveries is because the DOH decided to do a &amp;ldquo;mass recovery&amp;rdquo; of mild/asymptomatic cases that are already 14 days or older, supposedly in line with WHO guidelines. I can kind of see some logic behind this, but the communication was not handled very well. &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at around 18M cases (+1.8M from last week) and almost 690k deaths. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hm. I was a bit busy this week, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t paying too much attention, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have too much to rail against today. Well of course, things are still ongoing. There&amp;rsquo;s still the pandemic, fascist police state philosophy continues to rear it&amp;rsquo;s ugly head in the US, PH gov&amp;rsquo;t continues to be dumb, etc., but this week seemed a bit tame comparably.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching mass via Facebook again today. The nearby Church actually holds services, but last I heard it was only 10 people per mass, and need to call ahead of time. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem likely we&amp;rsquo;ll be going anytime soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grocery run yesterday, without incident&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;last Thursday I finally &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/1286105826743091201/&#34;&gt;got a haircut&lt;/a&gt; my last one was around New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day, so this was around six and a half months of hair cut off. I didn&amp;rsquo;t go to a barbershop, this was a home service haircut, care of a lady who works at a neighboring salon, who actually came over to do some home care service for my mom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 78412 cases (+2019 from the day before, +13108 from last week, slight acceleration week-on-week), 1897 deaths (+20 from the day before, +224 from last week, lower jump than last week), 25752 recoveries (+1278 from the day before, +3685 from last week, much less than last week&amp;rsquo;s jump). The admin claims that if we breach 85k cases by end-July, Metro Manila may go back to NCQ. First, that seems likely to happen so we&amp;rsquo;ll see. Second, it seems a bit unfair and illogical to make Metro Manila&amp;rsquo;s quarantine status dependent on national case numbers, but whatever. &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at 16.2M cases (+1.8M from last week, slight acceleration) and almost 650k deaths. The US retains a comfortable lead over second placer Brazil. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        






    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Busy with rebuilding the UI for the old project. I&amp;rsquo;m having fun with it, so that&amp;rsquo;s something. I think this week went by more quickly for me because of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake completed! Review &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/ff7r-review/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I played through a couple of Civ6 games, trying out the new civs and game modes from the New Frontier pass. Fun and challenging. Apocalypse mode: it&amp;rsquo;s an insane feeling the first time you see a comet strike take out a city. I was actually streaming the gameplay to a friend on Discord when this happened and we both went &amp;ldquo;Woah!&amp;rdquo; and he said that pushed him to get the DLC as well. Secret societies: Only tried Voidsingers so far; their cultists are great for culture victory since they&amp;rsquo;re a constant source of relics for tourism, and the Old God Monument gives you GW slots for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG: Still playing a bunch of JumpStart, but also put together Bant Ramp for Historic. Currently at Diamond 4, I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can grind Mythic for constructed before end of month. Related: I watched Maro&amp;rsquo;s Comic-con stream for Zendikar Rising last night, but left kinda underwhelmed. Set boosters are neat, but I kind of wanted more info/spoilers about the set itself. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to be excited about the set boosters when my MTG involvement is primarily through Arena these days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only played 2 online quizzes this week (the third one didn&amp;rsquo;t fire due to not enough participants). There was a fun Scientists/Inventors round which I could have perfected if I had gone with my gut answer (Rutherford) and not listened to my teammates lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a new season of Family Guy on Netflix, so I&amp;rsquo;ve started to watch that in the background while I&amp;rsquo;m working on other things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I watched a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ew.com/events/comic-con/scott-pilgrim-cast-reunion-table-read/&#34;&gt;for-charity cast-reunion live-table-read for Scott Pilgrim vs the World&lt;/a&gt; last week. I enjoyed it so much, I went and rewatched the movie on Netflix as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technically, this old project I&amp;rsquo;m revamping used to be a &amp;ldquo;side project&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing of note.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;My country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are days when I have to consciously temper my rage at the shenanigans of this government. I can&amp;rsquo;t write about them today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/covid19-07-19/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s pandemic notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a busy work week again; at the same time I also picked up an older charity project where the client asked for UI updates. Had issues with running the old code, and it was small enough, so I decided to rewrite it in a new tech stack. Might write about it at some point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am like 98% through the FF7R hard mode run. I&amp;rsquo;m totally making these percentages up, but I do have only one trophy left, and it&amp;rsquo;s this annoying minigame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started trying out some of the new leaders/civs in the Civ6 New Frontier pack. Another drop should be coming this week, so looking forward to that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG JumpStart is out this week! I tried it a couple of times on Arena. Some combinations are much better than others; the sad things is if you picked a miserable pair you have to stick with it longer before you can get your requisite two wins. Here&amp;rsquo;s an (ongoing) &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/1283901490206109698/&#34;&gt;thread of my JumpStart results&lt;/a&gt; will probably update it through the month it&amp;rsquo;s available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t win any online quiz this week, boo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After watching Atomic Blonde last week, I watched the Old Guard for back-to-back Charlize Theron action flicks. Pretty fun, although some plot points might make you go what?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of stuff coming out in July that I might watch: new season of Umbrella Academy, and there&amp;rsquo;s a Transformers anime coming out on NF, and well, there&amp;rsquo;s also a long backlog of things to watch&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing to note, too busy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;My country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday afternoon the House of Representatives voted to deny the franchise application of the nation&amp;rsquo;s biggest broadcaster ABS-CBN. This despite all agencies of the executive testifying that the company had no violations. Justifications cited were mostly personal reasons. The Palace claims they remained neutral on this issue, but no one really believes that. Probably not even then. What now, Philippines?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/covid19-07-12/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s pandemic notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a busy week work-wise. Learning a lot about Vue and Laravel though, so that&amp;rsquo;s fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am like 95% through the FF7R hard mode run. Only a 5% difference from last week, progress is slow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I bought a few games off the Steam Sale: Civ 6&amp;rsquo;s New Frontiers Pass (not actually on sale), Disco Elysium, and Garou Mark of the Wolves. You can watch me struggling in Garou &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yQ6B9IlwHU&amp;amp;t=70s&#34;&gt;on Youtube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We only played one online quiz this week, didn&amp;rsquo;t do too well D:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I watched Atomic Blonde yesterday. I thought it was like a John Wick style action flick. That&amp;rsquo;s true, but it&amp;rsquo;s also a Cold-War era spy thriller with lots of double-crosses and whatnot. Fairly engaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing to note.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I really enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.swiss-miss.com/2020/07/alike-an-animated-short-film.html&#34;&gt;Alike, an Animated Short Film&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of an allegory for modern life.&lt;/li&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;My country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday afternoon the president sighed the controversial &amp;ldquo;Anti-terror law&amp;rdquo; that vastly expands police powers, allows people to be arrested without warrants on mere suspicion of terrorism etc. Interesting timing, right after China applies a new anti-terror low to Hong Kong (and rightly gets castigated for it by countries all over the world) and also right after the PNP (who &lt;em&gt;promise&lt;/em&gt; not to abuse their newfound powers) are under criticism for killing some soldiers in a &lt;em&gt;misencounter&lt;/em&gt; and tampering with the crime scene to cover it up. Many are afraid of the chilling impact on freedom of speech, but I like to think that I will be as complain-y as I used to be. I am privileged to be able to do that, so might as well keep going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Congressmen &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/abscbn-bias-press-freedom/&#34;&gt;tightening the screws on ABS-CBN&lt;/a&gt; during the franchise hearings reminds me that: given how complicated the various laws and statutes are, anyone with an agenda who wants to harass you can always find some obscure laws or regulations that you allegedly violated. That is not to say we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t follow such regulations, but given when one randomly keeps digging up new issues, it becomes obvious that there is a vendetta at work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I often ruminate about what I can do to help the state of my country today. Or maybe even the state of the world? I used to think being a good citizen and making good voting choices was enough, but it&amp;rsquo;s not. The systems are rigged to perpetuate inequality, exploitation, and bad people in power. I read somewhere recently that one should imagine the path towards the future he wishes to claim and take the steps to make it happen, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think my imagination is up to the task at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/covid19-07-05/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s pandemic notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fair bit of consulting work for this coming week, might be busy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have already &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/quitting-facebook/&#34;&gt;deactivated Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. If I would be honest, I still find myself sometimes instinctively thinking about checking the Facebook feed. Hopefully, it&amp;rsquo;s an instinct that gets weaned away with time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am like 90% through the FF7R hard mode run, but I&amp;rsquo;m currently stuck at a certain point trying to beat the so-called &amp;ldquo;hardest fight in the game&amp;rdquo;. Hopefully I can finish it this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinity OS2 inched along slightly as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday gaming group picked up a new board game on Steam, it&amp;rsquo;s Blood Rage, about vikings trying to earn glory for Ragnarok. A bit more violent than Scythe, lots more fighting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG: I did six twitch streams/yt episodes of M21 drafting, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXZO7Ukg5Xk&amp;amp;list=PLmU0vkKslGXiz0shcCJgV1YTP5emzWgr4&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s a playlist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Able to play a couple more online quiz nights this week, but still didn&amp;rsquo;t do well lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some new movies on Netflix lately. Decided to watch Mission Impossible Fallout. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I ever watched Rogue Nation though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to plan out the next set of updates for the trivia thing, but I might be too busy in the coming weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I changed the fonts on this blog. Again. Someday I&amp;rsquo;ll probably try Comic Sans just for the heck of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again: I should probably write more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This list of &lt;a href=&#34;https://whimsical.club/&#34;&gt;websites that spark joy&lt;/a&gt; is great, have some new sites to browse!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A walk back through the history of web trends and standards: &lt;a href=&#34;https://pavellaptev.github.io/web-dark-ages/&#34;&gt;dark ages of the web&lt;/a&gt;. As someone &lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.technology/@schwartz/104450459330476402&#34;&gt;commented on Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; though: &amp;ldquo;dark ages for development, golden age for content.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/covid19-06-28/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s pandemic notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easily the most annoying thing this week: our broadband modem conked out Wednesday night. Customer support isn&amp;rsquo;t super responsive for local telcos: I called their support line the next day (support line is not even available 24/7!), got put on hold for 45 minutes TWICE before they agreed to send a repair crew over the next day (Friday). Friday morning I got a text that the technician visit was actually scheduled for SATURDAY morning. They arrive Saturday AFTERNOON, due to traffic apparently. And unluckily, they are out of spare modems for the replacement. They promise to come back first thing in the morning SUNDAY. They come back Sunday LUNCHTIME. And I finally have internet back. An annoying experience, and I&amp;rsquo;m also worried that my mobile plan might be charged for the two one-hour calls I had to do to their support line (hopefully I can clear that up), and I&amp;rsquo;m told I can also call them up to ask for a rebate for their days we had no service, but eh, I&amp;rsquo;d have to sit through another long on-hold period!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One would think that being offline for half a week would lead to some kind of gigantic productivity boost, but no such luck. I still had my mobile internet for my doomscrolling after all. I did manage to read/write/watch a few more things than usual I guess?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finished Final Fantasy VII Remake (before the internet outage)! So I spent a lot of the outage (including my time on hold with tech support) playing through hard mode, already about half-way through. Still not sure I&amp;rsquo;m going to do achievement completion, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see. Hard mode is actually an enjoyable challenge, nothing too insane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinity OS2 inched along slightly as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;won my &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/1274581114628108289/&#34;&gt;first Trivia Royale&lt;/a&gt;, I can quit now lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the internet outage coincided with the start of this week&amp;rsquo;s Steam Summer Sale. There&amp;rsquo;s some games/DLC I&amp;rsquo;m considering buying, but realistically in terms of backlog I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t lol. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if willpower holds out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the new MTG core set also came out on Magic Arena during the outage. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get back into regular streaming for M21 limited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still tried to join the Zoom and voice chats for the online quizzes with only my tethered mobile internet, but that was kind of a miserable experience. Still, I was able to contribute a bit, though we didn&amp;rsquo;t actually do too well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finished watching season 2 of Harley Quinn. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve written about the show before. The whole Harley/Poison Ivy dynamic isn&amp;rsquo;t really for me, but I like the show&amp;rsquo;s take on Gotham and the wider DC universe and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of fun characters like King Shark and Clayface. Also, Riddler was recognizably voiced by Dean Pelton from Community, and that was fun lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also did a rewatch of Spider-Man Far From Home on Netflix, before the internet problems and all. Still a pretty good movie, and watching it made me eager to get back to the MCU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also watched the Sonic the Hedgehog movie while things were offline. The best thing about this is Sonic being recognizably voiced by Ben Schwartz, who apparently &lt;a href=&#34;https://thesuperheroesnetwork.tumblr.com/post/622121477003739136/supernova-swirls-gothammite-he-really&#34;&gt;voices everyone blue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As soon as my internet came back, I started watching Ghost Fighter/Yu Yu Hakusho, which came out on Netflix (as you guessed it, during the outage)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also tried reading a book. It was a Discworld book. &amp;ldquo;Tried&amp;rdquo; being the operative word. I&amp;rsquo;ll write about it if I manage to get to the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uh, proceeding apace I guess?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again: I should probably write more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/22/nyt-is-threatening-my-safety-by-revealing-my-real-name-so-i-am-deleting-the-blog/&#34;&gt;NYT threatened to doxx Scott Alexander of Slate Star Codex&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t really follow SSC too strictly, but that seemed like a bad thing. I also read up some more on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Scott_Alexander&#34;&gt;Scott Alexander / SSC&lt;/a&gt; because of this, and it looks like he had a lot of problematic views, so I don&amp;rsquo;t really think I want to support him lol.&lt;/li&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/covid19-06-21/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s pandemic notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some days still hot, but weather beginning to turn for the better. Sleep kind of better and a bit more regular too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did my quarterly medical checkup this past week (slightly delayed). No issues, but I need to do an FBS test for next time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep schedule kind of settling back into my usual biphasic sleep. Although the second phase seems to move around a lot&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not much work-wise the past week, and a bit more family-related expenses. Medical and government stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;still playing a lot of Final Fantasy VII Remake. I think I&amp;rsquo;m already in the final chapter. I am quite happy with the adaptiation, bit I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;m going to bother with achievement completion for this one; it requires hard mode completion, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the issue. The problem is the abundance of these dexterity-based minigames! I thought everything was fine when I did the squats thing, but then later there&amp;rsquo;s a harder pull-ups thing! And I haven&amp;rsquo;t even cracked the bottom of that darts leaderboard&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinity OS2 inching along slightly. But probably will be finished after FF7R at this rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s a new trivia app by the makers of the QuizUp, which we used to play a lot back in the day. The name is Trivia Royale, it&amp;rsquo;s currently iOS only and it&amp;rsquo;s basically battle royale quizup: you join a game with 1000 players, and you play 10 head-to-head matches until you get a winner. Took me most of the wook to actually win my first one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;did poorly in the AboutQuiz and PopQuiz games this week. Actually, we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing poorly for a while now lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing to log. Maybe a good thing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://triviastorm.net/&#34;&gt;triviastorm&lt;/a&gt; stuff this week. Most of it are some backend fixes to make later planned new features easier to build. Planning to clear/reset leaderboards at the end of the month. Some roadmap things:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allowing users to submit their own questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make the discord bot usable for public usage, i.e. let other people add it to their discord&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I should probably write more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot of posts off &lt;a href=&#34;https://lobste.rs&#34;&gt;lobste.rs&lt;/a&gt; lately, so I finally pulled the trigger and asked around for an invite to the site. A &lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@ignaloidas&#34;&gt;helpful person&lt;/a&gt; provided me one via Mastodon. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting site, basically an invite-only reddit-like site, mostly focused on tech stuff, so in theory the discussion quality should be fairly high. The chain of invites is public too, each user&amp;rsquo;s profile shows you who invited him, so in that way it&amp;rsquo;s kind of similar to a certificate chain of trust? We&amp;rsquo;ll see if this scales up well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this &lt;a href=&#34;https://mxb.dev/blog/the-return-of-the-90s-web/&#34;&gt;recent article about the 90s web&lt;/a&gt;. I will easily admit that I am an easy sucker for any post that appeals to my nostalgia for how the web was better &amp;ldquo;back in the doy&amp;rdquo;, rose-tinted glasses or no.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed the song Fast Car, so it was interesting to read about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/tracy-chapman-fast-car-revival-luke-combs-khalid-1014843/&#34;&gt;its origins and its surprising popularity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The founders of BaseCamp recently released &lt;a href=&#34;https://hey.com&#34;&gt;Hey&lt;/a&gt;, a new email service that has &lt;a href=&#34;https://hey.com/features/&#34;&gt;some interesting ideas about new features&lt;/a&gt; to support the typical email workflow. I don&amp;rsquo;t nearly use email enough on a personal basis to pay for it (though I do have an invite!), but I&amp;rsquo;m glad someone is innovating in this space, although they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be using open standards. They promptly &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation&#34;&gt;got into a fight with Apple over App Store policies&lt;/a&gt; which has sparked some debate in the tech community on the value of curated app stores. So maybe they&amp;rsquo;re actually going to push for innovation in two different areas?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, no new crises have emerged during the past week. I think. More of the same crises, carrying on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Friday was the PH independence day holiday. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like celebrating. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like we are free. In any case, a protest rally against the yet-to-be-signed terror bill took place at the university that morning, inspite of threats from the authorities that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t allowed. The protestors spaced themselves out and everything. Some friends reported trouble getting into the university though. Apparently a heavy police/military presence was manning many of the entrances for some reason. &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/DailyGuardianPH/posts/3416858255000782&#34;&gt;Basta&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/move-ph/263710-police-blocks-entry-protesters-rally-independence-day-2020&#34;&gt;News report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/covid19-06-14/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s quarantine notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much better weather this week, some nights were comfortably rainy and chilly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep schedule kind of settling back into my usual biphasic sleep. Although the second phase seems to move around a lot&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disappointed in the PS5 reveal. None of the shown games are must buys from me, and I was hoping for a price and release date. Highly unlikely I&amp;rsquo;d get a PS5 on launch though. Historically I&amp;rsquo;ve waited at least a year to get consoles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinity OS2 run stalled this week because&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip; most of my gaming this week spent on Final Fantasy VII Remake. I&amp;rsquo;m only around 12ish hours in. Game is pretty great, and not just for the nostalgia bit. There is a large amount of added content, and some plot details play out differently. Looking forward to how this all ends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also purchased the &lt;a href=&#34;https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality&#34;&gt;itch.io BLM bundle&lt;/a&gt; this week. Wow that&amp;rsquo;s a ton of value. Over 1600+ games, assets, etc for minimum $5? I was originally hesitant since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have an itch.io account and really I don&amp;rsquo;t need more backlog, but it&amp;rsquo;s for a good cause, and did I mention also a ton of value? Better than Humble Bundles ever were.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somehow managed to win Geekfight this week, and it&amp;rsquo;s the last one until July. We got third place in PopQuiz and as usual did poorly in AboutQuiz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team Camote Pop Culture Trivia Challenge S01E01 is out: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQytLl61PCQ&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQytLl61PCQ&lt;/a&gt;. We had a lot of fun, and we recorded this around a month ago I think, editing took a while. We have a few more episodes in the queue, feel free to like and subscribe!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My dad has been watching a lot of Two and A Half Men, which means a lot of incidental watching from me whenever I&amp;rsquo;m in that same room. The Charlie Sheen firing came really abruptly since he was binging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Huh, I guess not much TV/movies for me last week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worked a bit more on &lt;a href=&#34;https://triviastorm.net/&#34;&gt;triviastorm&lt;/a&gt; stuff this week. Cleaning up the old questions, prepping new question sets, etc. Will probably load new question sets and reset both the twitter bot and discord leaderboards around the end of the month, and hopefully can expand upon the app after that, and prepare it for more general use and other cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My urge to completely revamp the site has passed&amp;hellip; for now. Other plans proceed apace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/&#34;&gt;Sort By Controversial&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s two years old, but it&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic read, a fictional (or maybe not so fictional?) take on how society can easily be cleaved apart by the right discussions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;The world isn&amp;rsquo;t letting up. The virus is still around, but both the US and my own country have gotten distracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US is in its second week of police brutality/black lives matters protests. Meanwhile, our government took on a sidequest of trying to enact a wide-ranging and easily abusable anti-terror bill, triggering some smaller (by comparison to the US).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t written about the terror bill, mainly because I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the opportunity to dig into it too deeply. But my general impression leaves me two points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the justification for asking for increased police/anti-terrorism powers? We don&amp;rsquo;t actually get that many terror attacks pulled off, the last big one was Marawi (which I heard some Congressmen citing, tbf), which was back in 2017. And that was mostly a problem with Islamic militants. I don&amp;rsquo;t hear any of the bill proponents talking about how specifically the limits on govt powers holds them back. How would these added powers prevent another Marawi? Did they actually have intel leading up to the Marawi siege that they couldn&amp;rsquo;t act on due to limited powers? I find this difficult to believe because&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what about the authorities&amp;rsquo; history of impunity? It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that they are being restricted by the law in anti-terror activities when they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to let the law get in the way for much lesser things. I guess this is the crux of the issue for most people, one of trust. Even if you say there are safeguards in the law, they are still easily abusable. The bill extends the detention period for terror suspects to I think is it 30 days, extendable? But given the speed (or lack thereof) of local courts, even if you challenge any violation of the safeguards, the challenge may take longer to resolve than the detention period. Maybe we should consider cleaning up our justice system first? People wouldn&amp;rsquo;t object if our systems were trustworthy&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, also China banned mocking their national anthem in HK, or something to that effect. China being China. Better not to lose track of what is probably the greatest threat to democracy in the coming century&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/covid19-06-07/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s quarantine notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was hoping the weather would get much cooler than this. Where&amp;rsquo;s our &lt;em&gt;hanging amihan&lt;/em&gt;?!?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tiny bit of consulting work again this week, mostly integration work. And it&amp;rsquo;s in PHP, which means I&amp;rsquo;m once again tempted to write a &amp;ldquo;bad things about PHP&amp;rdquo; post lol. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll collect a few more gripes before I do that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep schedule slightly better and more regular, but my eyes seem to be heavy a lot more often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;m like in the final act for Divinity OS2. Need to finish it soonish because&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip; my PS4 is back! My brother finally passed by the house to pick up some stuff and returned my console. I already hooked it up and did the installation things for FF7R. Will probably start it this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Humble choice is up, but it&amp;rsquo;s meh again. Will probably pass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was looking forward to the PS5 reveal this week, but it got rescheduled due to everything happening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least previews for the next Magic set have already started. Some cool stuff. Instant planeswalker abilities! Phasing! Prowess! &lt;a href=&#34;http://mythicspoiler.com/m21/cards/peerintotheabyss.html&#34;&gt;Really creepy art&lt;/a&gt;! We also got some bans and an actual rule change to address companions, both of which are sure to shake up the formats. I finally caved and paid gems for the Ikoria mythic pass on Arena (I&amp;rsquo;ve saved up a bunch anyway. Still totally F2P!). Hopefully I can max out the levels/rewards before the mastery rotation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt; Geekfight was fun this week (theme was Marvel comics, right up my alley), although I didn&amp;rsquo;t win. We did poorly in the other two online quizzes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legends of Tomorrow season finale was weak and didn&amp;rsquo;t really make sense, but still somehow the best of the Arrowverse finales this season. Oh well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By contrast, I really liked the Rick and Morty season finale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also started watching Space Force; only 3 episodes in, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit meh. Not super funny or anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worked a bit on &lt;a href=&#34;https://triviastorm.net/&#34;&gt;triviastorm&lt;/a&gt; stuff this week. I&amp;rsquo;m preparing new questions and cleaning up the old ones, and also some work on a tighter checking algorithm. There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of features I want to add to this side project, let&amp;rsquo;s see if I manage to get around to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also spent a couple of hours fantasizing about rewriting the site again, maybe back to a dynamic backend, or some kind of hybrid, mostly to address the issues scaling with so many posts. Lol, will probably not do this yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s in the back of my mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No recent links for now. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll be more diligent about this next week.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>ABS-CBN, Bias, and Press Freedom

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A bit of brouhaha a couple of weeks ago after the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.manilatimes.net/2020/05/05/news/headlines/ntc-orders-abs-cbn-to-shut-down-operations/722798/&#34;&gt;National Telecommunications Commission ordered the country&amp;rsquo;s biggest broadcaster ABS-CBN to cease operations because Congress had been remiss in renewing their franchise.&lt;/a&gt;. This despite the NTC earlier promising they can operate provisionally while the franchise renewal is being processed, a change of heart apparently due to a legal opinion by the SolGen. Some thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bias&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bias&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker of the house &lt;a href=&#34;https://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2020/05/15/cayetano-slams-bias-at-abs-cbn/&#34;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you are one of the reasons why there are issues with your network. In the eyes of some, there is clear bias and meddling in the elections, which is against the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, IDK what this supposed election meddling is that he&amp;rsquo;s talking about (If they have really done such a thing that is illegal, they can be charged in court, but AFAIK there are no such cases?), but speaking on the issue of &amp;ldquo;bias&amp;rdquo;: we cannot require that a news entity be unbiased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeating for emphasis: &lt;strong&gt;we cannot require that a news entity be unbiased&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, you say? It comes back to the nature of bias, and the nature of humans. Every individual human is biased towards certain things, as a result of their experiences growing up. No matter how well-read or well-traveled or well-learned you are, your individual human experience is but a fraction of a fraction of an infinitessimal fraction of the collective human experience. Therefore, you will exhibit bias naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations are pretty much the same, since they are composed of biased humans. Any given organization can strive to be less biased by having members with diverse points of view and opinion. And in fact it would be better if our news entities were as unbiased as possible, this would be ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we (through the state) cannot require that such entities be unbiased, for the simple reason that determination of bias will itself be tainted by bias. There can be no absolute, objective standard for being unbiased, because who would make that judgement? Who would make the rules? Humans, who are also biased? Imposing such a vague restriction on news entities (&amp;ldquo;you must be unbiased&amp;rdquo;) is tantamount to imposing someone else&amp;rsquo;s will (and bias) upon the entity, and that encroaches upon the freedom of expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can impose specific restrictions on freedoms of expression and the press through law; examples are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disallowing knowingly publishing falsehoods through libel laws (although this too is problematic, since truth is also not always measurable nor absolute)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disallowing child pornography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;false fire alarms in a crowded theater&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing is that specific, measurable things can be disallowed, since presumably these can be evaluated fairly (or as fairly as possible). More dangerous are restrictions that depend upon the whims of those in power, such as commonly found in authoritarian countries like China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get into the nitty-gritty legalities of it, since I am not a lawyer. But my main point is that like it or not, we can&amp;rsquo;t require news entities to be unbiased. We want them to be as close to that as possible ideally, but we can&amp;rsquo;t require it, because that is not enforceable fairly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About ABS-CBN specifically, I don&amp;rsquo;t even see any bias; I mean, if anything, many of their news anchors and celebrities seem to be supportive of the administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(You might disagree with me, but that&amp;rsquo;s just your bias, and that&amp;rsquo;s fine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;press-freedom-access-to-information-and-other-concerns&#34;&gt;Press Freedom, Access to Information, and other concerns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people have commented that press freedom still exists in the Philippines despite the ABS-CBN shutdown, citing reasons such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;existence of other networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ABS-CBN still being able to broadcast over digital channels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people still being able to criticize the government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is true, that the Philippines does still enjoy some press freedom, undoubtedly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any reduction in the diversity of news sources is harmful to democratic society since it reduces access to information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not everyone has access to cable or internet channels through which ABS-CBN programs can still be accessed, thus depriving many people of a source of information (and in some cases the only source of information they had available)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the mere fact that the government, on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/168137-duterte-block-abs-cbn-franchise-renewal&#34;&gt;president&amp;rsquo;s whim and vindictiveness&lt;/a&gt; (no one really believes the NTC and the SolGen and even the House are acting independently), has taken the biggest network off the air leads to what is called a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect&#34;&gt;chilling effect&lt;/a&gt;, basically sending a message to everybody else. If even the biggest network in the country can be taken down, what chance do smaller outfits or independent journalists have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have cited other reasons why ABS-CBN should have not been taken down, like the fact that X number of workers would lose their jobs. For me, that&amp;rsquo;s extraneous. Of course we don&amp;rsquo;t want anyone to lose their livelihoods, but that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t even be necessary to contemplate: on the basis of the harms to democracy and press freedom alone this should not have happened. And especially not during a pandemic, when getting information out to people can be crucial!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand the requirement for Congress to approve broadcast franchises, since broadcast frequencies are a limited resource. But if it were me: the grant of provisional franchise upon expiry would be automatic unless explicitly revoked by Congress with clear violations specified as the cause of revokation. And the grant of franchise should probably explicity specify the conditions upon which the franchise may not be renewed. The grant or renewal of broadcast franchises should be as free of politics as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-police-bad-news-entities&#34;&gt;How to police &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; news entities?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can&amp;rsquo;t impose unbiasedness, and shutting them down violates press freedom, how do we control wayward news entities? Since humans are biased, we have no universal definition of &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo;, but there are still some controls that society can impose, not necssarily through law:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;through law, specific restrictions as described above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally, it should be the market and news consumers themselves who are able to control the biases of the news entities, by not patronizing news entities that tend to be editorialized. (Although this probably requires a more educated populace, see: Fox News). ABS-CBN itself is still super popular, in spite of everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;etc&#34;&gt;Etc&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chilling effect on free expression has a slippery slope. Already the government has started going after critics allegedly for social media posts. If we are not careful, we might be on the road to becoming like China. (Which might be what Duterte and his cult following want, but certainly won&amp;rsquo;t be good for a democratic Philippines).&lt;/p&gt;

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/nobody-knows-for-sure-whats-going-to-happen/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I mean, that&amp;rsquo;s true in general of course. But it certainly seems much more true in these &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/covid19/&#34;&gt;pandemic times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before all of this &lt;em&gt;waves hands arounds frantically&lt;/em&gt;, people had a general sense of routine and predictability about their daily lives. It varied person by person of course, but many people had regular things like a steady job that kept them occupied for most of the week, a school where their kids could go off to most days, maybe a favorite bar or restaurant they visit every week or so, church on Sundays, friends you saw every other weekend or so, malls or stores they would pass by regularly, and so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I had a generally looser schedule than most, I was still often able to plot out my coming days with relative accuracy. Oh, I have a client meeting on this day. Then the next day I have to run these errands. Then meeting up with friends (maybe for a quiz night) the evening after. On the weekend a visit with my brothers and the nieces. That kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I would have had some fairly safe medium-term predictions too. If you had asked me at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/01/new-years-checklist/&#34;&gt;start of the year&lt;/a&gt;, I would have thought I&amp;rsquo;d have seen the Black Widow movies by now, played Final Fantasy VII Remake, and got together with the family in April to celebrate birthdays. But none of those came to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, that kind of reasonable prediction seems like a distant memory. Weeks come and go and all the days seem to blend in together, each one indistinguishable from the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about writing something about what to expect down the road, or the &amp;ldquo;new normal&amp;rdquo; or what not, but (a) so many people (many of whom I&amp;rsquo;m sure are better qualified) are already writing things like that; and (b) I think a lot of it is largely pointless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have all these models and graphs and projections coming out, with varying degrees of reliability. They tell us things like, there will be M cases and N deaths by so-and-so date unless we do this or that. Each model is slightly different, depending on many factors like the country being studied or the data being analyzed and such. And maybe they&amp;rsquo;re right. Surely at least some of them are, right? But all of these are, to make a software development analogy, estimates. Some are certainly more accurate than others - it falls to our individual discernment whether we choose to believe experts and scientists or populist politicians or whatever - but in the end, all of them are still just estimates. Trend-spotting based on data that is probably largely incomplete (certainly so in the case of my own country). And just like estimates, there&amp;rsquo;s no way to know for certain which will turn out to be correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of all the models and trends and predictions, the future remains incredibly hazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many cases will we end up with? How many deaths? All as of yet unknown, but almost certainly far too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will we have a vaccine this year? Next year? In 2022? No one knows for sure. There are many vaccines and treatments in development, but we won&amp;rsquo;t know for a while which ones will turn out effective, if any. There may never be a permanent vaccine, the same way we don&amp;rsquo;t have one for the common cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will there be a second wave? Seems likely. Will it be under control? Who knows. Even countries we previously thought to be doing well are in danger of a possible resurgence, so what then? How much more countries like us that have done far worse in controlling the spread?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will the ECQ in Metro Manila be lifted after the 15th? Nobody knows, even up to now, a mere 5 days before the deadline. And if it is lifted, what happens then? There are people counting down to the ECQ lifting as if it would be &amp;ldquo;back to normal&amp;rdquo;, I can&amp;rsquo;t say it will be, but it almost certainly shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be. Maybe there will be an explosion of people, tired of being cooped up in their houses, and a corresponding explosion of cases, and we are forced to go back to a stricter lockdown. That&amp;rsquo;s my guess, but again, nothing is certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When will people be able to go back to work? When will your favorite restaurant be open again? When will you get to meet up with friends again? When can I travel to other countries again? All of these, nobody knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joke with my parents and brothers that the next time we&amp;rsquo;ll be seeing each other in person again would probably be in August during my birthday month, but something that far off might not come to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And people are talking about what the &amp;ldquo;new normal&amp;rdquo; is going to be like. That we might have to live with social distancing precautions in the medium-to-long term moving forward. We may be looking at months or maybe even years of social distancing measures. Or cycles of lockdown and loosening, until there is a widespread vaccine, or maybe forever? All distinct possibilities, but again, there&amp;rsquo;s no certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are people that say humanity is going to learn our lesson from this crisis and realize that so many things we previously accepted in our daily life are BS that we can do without. Short list: overpopulation, inequality, low pay for essential workers, work commutes, dress codes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies will see that work from home is effective, so it will be more common moving forward! The anecdotal reports of companies implementing draconian surveillance schemes to monitor their remote workers makes me doubt that one actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t buy that this crisis will change society for the better (though I am more than willing to be surprised). Many humans are too set in their ways and can&amp;rsquo;t even be bothered to endure minor inconveniences like wearing a mask to costco or whatever. And there are many who can&amp;rsquo;t wait to be right back there sucking at the fresh teat of capitalism, instead of maybe looking for alternatives that promote and protect the commons instead of exploiting the vulnerable. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong - there are many positive and hopeful stories coming out of this pandemic, of people helping other people get by - that heighten my faith in humanity. My faith in humanity&amp;rsquo;s leadership and elite, however, is probably at an all-time low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the models and projections and predictions for the new normal, these things are useful at the policymaking levels. But for those of us just living our every day lives, it is difficult to look so far ahead. Right now, we are roiling about in a sea of uncertainty, unsure of what the future brings. All we can worry about will be what the next day looks like. Maybe the best we can do right now is just to take it one step at a time, and hope that we are making the right decisions to build towards a new normal that will actually be better than the last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post turned out more ranty than I thought it would be.&lt;/p&gt;

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/04/privacy-and-nothing-to-hide/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I was reading this post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2020/04/nothing-to-hide/&#34;&gt;how to respond to the &amp;ldquo;Nothing to Hide&amp;rdquo; argument&lt;/a&gt; against the concept of privacy. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://spreadprivacy.com/three-reasons-why-the-nothing-to-hide-argument-is-flawed/&#34;&gt;quoted DuckDuckGo blog post&lt;/a&gt; lists some pretty good reasons, but I thought I&amp;rsquo;d expound on some thoughts as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of the &amp;ldquo;Nothing to Hide&amp;rdquo; argument is that if you, personally, have nothing incriminating or illegal to hide, then you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about privacy intrusions. The argument is used mainly to justify things like state-sponsored surveillance, but might also be applicable to data collection activities by large corporations such as Facebook or Google. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument&#34;&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; for reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to understand is that even if you personally have nothing to hide, there are people who do have legitimate reasons for having to hide something, especially from the government, and that society is better off with them having that ability. The primary example of this would be anyone who helps keep the powerful in check: whistleblowers, activists, journalists, and so on. More minor examples (much lower impact) would be people planning surprise parties, people in abusive relationships, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are of course also negative elements who have a lot to hide (criminal activities), but that is neither here nor there. There is no question that governments should be empowered to surveil the criminal elements, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they should have blanket power to surveil everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quoted post from jlelse mentions the argument in the context of the contact tracing apps being developed to fight the Covid19 pandemic, and this is a prime example. If the data were handled by a centralized entity such as a government or a private company, then presumably someone with that information could use the location data to do something like identify who has been meeting with a journlist, in order to unmask his sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I trust the government&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I trust corporation X&amp;rdquo; are not good responses either. Even if these entities were purely benevolent (not likely), the mere existence of such a data store is a possible threat, since there is always the possibility of data leaking or systems being compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may ask why should you personally be concerned? Why should you bother using privacy-protecting tools or avoiding privacy-collecting platforms such as Facebook, etc. Since you personally have nothing to hide, why worry about it? I personally have nothing to hide, and in fact even write a lot about the things going on in my life in this very website, I should have nothing to fear right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very individualistic mentality. Even if you personally have nothing to hide, there are people in society who have legitimate reasons to hide something, and if we get used to or start accepting the lack of privacy or mass surveillance, then we are moving society in a direction that makes it much harder for those people to operate. The less people that are privacy-conscious, then the more that those who use privacy-protecting tools or software stand out and it becomes easier to track them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though we as individual persons may not have anything to hide, privacy protections are a necessary element for society as whole to function and to keep the powerful in check. Just like public health in a pandemic, privacy is a societal concern, and we all need to do our part even if we aren&amp;rsquo;t the ones most at risk. We need to push back against mass surveillance and normalize or promote the use of privacy-conscious tools and software.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I originally had this as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/roytang/statuses/1241993156696010753/&#34;&gt;tweetstorm/rant&lt;/a&gt;, but it ended up quite long, so I&amp;rsquo;m posting it to the blog too. It is mostly frustration at how poorly the people in charge are handling things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of asking for more budget, the govt should be telling us first how they are planning to spend the money they are already allocated, which they claimed was sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of saying we can&amp;rsquo;t do mass testing because of limited kits, they should be telling us about their plans for getting more testing kits, ppes, hospital capacity, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of telling off the LGUs for being creative, they should tell us how they plan to support the LGUs in keeping the quarantine under control and in feeding the poor people who are most affected. It&amp;rsquo;s the difference between &amp;ldquo;Sumunod ka na lang!&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Ok, we can see you&amp;rsquo;re having trouble, ano pwede namin matulong?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Sige, eto itutulong namin para hindi nyo yan kelangan gawin.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of sending just confirmed cases home due to lack of hospital capacity, tell us what measures you are doing to set up new isolation units etc. Maybe seek out private enterprises that have now unused buildings that can be used?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of complaining about the haters, tell us what you are doing to address their concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be ok to admit to mistakes. &amp;ldquo;We tried this, it didn&amp;rsquo;t work, these are the other things we want to try now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of increasing fear, uncertainty and doubt with poor messaging, lay out your plans and principles and tell us clearly what we should expect. Messaging should aim to reassure people, not to threaten or confuse or to make excuses for past mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of asking for emergency powers, maybe use your existing powers better! Not everything can be solved by throwing more authoritarianism at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private sector is stepping up to do what it can. Ordinary citizens are stepping up to donate and support and help where they can. Now is not the time for the government to be mediocre. Be better!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This post will largely be about the effects of the COVID-19 virus on my country, the Philippines, including government and society&amp;rsquo;s response, largely from a personal POV. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a bit difficult to write about, but I figure it&amp;rsquo;s something I would like to be able to look back on in the future, so let&amp;rsquo;s give it a shot. The reason it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to write about is that events are unfolding and changing rapidly, and a lot of things are still unclear. On top of that, there is anxiety to contend with, and all the news can make it difficult to think. And so we write, both as a record of events and to help clear my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was originally going to write about the recent COVID-19 virus happenings during this week&amp;rsquo;s weeknotes, but I ended up writing so many words about it, so I decided to make a separate type of post. And its a new type of post, one that I tagged under &amp;ldquo;diaries&amp;rdquo;. The post is being published early on the 15th, but the intent is I will be updating this post as events unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;january-the-29th-govt-says-no-travel-ban-needed&#34;&gt;January the 29th: Govt says no travel ban needed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/250506-coronavirus-scare-travel-ban-mainland-chinese-not-for-now-duque&#34;&gt;Even with coronavirus scare, no mainland Chinese travel ban for now – Duque&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/1/29/duterte-on-china-travel-ban.html&#34;&gt;Duterte not keen on banning travel to China amid coronavirus scare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/1/30/Philippines-coronavirus-case.html&#34;&gt;Philippines confirms first case of novel coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;february-the-2nd-travel-ban-from-china&#34;&gt;February the 2nd: Travel ban from China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;march-the-7th-first-confirmed-local-case&#34;&gt;March the 7th: First confirmed local case&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2020/03/07/1998804/philippines-has-first-local-case-covid-19&#34;&gt;Philippines has first local case of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;march-the-9th-president-declares-public-health-emergency&#34;&gt;March the 9th: President declares public health emergency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;march-9th-march-11th&#34;&gt;March 9th-March 11th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locally, our country had a very small number of confirmed cases coming into the last week, I think it was at around 20 or less before Sunday the 8th. And only 1 confirmed death. The president had previously addressed the country in some kind of incoherent drunken rant that didn&amp;rsquo;t say much but was easily repurposed by internet memers into some kind of spoken word poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a shortage of face masks. People are reminded to wash their hands regularly and practice social distancing when possible. The DOH claimed we had everything under control. &lt;em&gt;Eat Bulaga&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Showtime&lt;/em&gt; have been running shows without a live studio audience. Life was still mostly normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But during this week, more and more cases were reported, in ever-increasing quantities. As of Saturday (the 14th) night, we were up to 111 confirmed cases and I think 8 deaths, with 40+ reported during that day alone. That fatality rate of around 7%, is way higher than the global 1-3%, which is a good indicator of how many unreported cases we probably have locally, due to the severe lack of testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thursday-march-the-12th-lockdown-announced&#34;&gt;Thursday, March the 12th: Lockdown announced&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explosive growth in cases finally made the government take drastic action; around Thursday lunchtime, rumors started circulating in online circles that the authorities were planning a lockdown of the National Capital Region. This included a leaked memo listing the recommendations that the president would have to decide on. Many details were not known, like what exactly would happen in such a lockdown. What we did know was that the lockdown would start reportedly start on Sunday, the 15th and would last for 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markets did not take the rumors well. Shortly before closing, the Philippine Stock Exchange circuit breaker was triggered after the index had dropped more than 10% on the day. The index recovered slightly before closing at around -9.x%. It was a bloodbath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my late afternoon walk I decided to pass by the nearby grocery because there had already been reports of large crowds. Sure enough there were way more people than usual. I really only wanted to get Tostitos dip, but they were out of stock of that. Why were people hoarding it? Alcohol and hand sanitizer were out of stock as well, as expected. From the chatter I overheard, people were well aware of the rumored announcement later that day. My parents weren&amp;rsquo;t planning to do our weekly grocery run until Friday night, but I decided to pick up a few essentials (bread, eggs, canned goods, etc) early since I was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A press conference was announced for around 6-630pm. True to form, the conference only started around a couple of hours late. Most of it consisted of the president telling the people to listen to the health authorities, reading out the details of the memo (exactly the one that was leaked, leaving many questions), in his usual annoying rambling style. (To his benefit, he seemed way more lucid than his last public speech.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lockdown covered Metro Manila, banning domestic travel over land, sea, and air. International travel was still around. The press conference did not provide any details of how the lockdown would be enforced or any plan for increased testing or support for health care front-liners or new health care supplies. No details of how people who live outside the NCR but work there during the day would be handled. No word on support programs for people who will lose paying work because of the arrangements. The president did not acknowledge the efforts of public health care workers, but instead for some reason, decided to thank China for supposedly supporting us. (Even though the virus came from them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of my group chats are abuzz, discussing the turn of events and the lack of details, with the general consensus being: &lt;em&gt;ANG LABO!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A doctor friend reports that she has been in quarantine and is awaiting results of the COVID19 test because she was in contact with possible carriers. We wish her good luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people I knew had flown out of the NCR to the provinces for some R&amp;amp;R and their flight back would be from Saturday night to Sunday early morning, so they would be caught by the lockdown. I jokingly said that since international flights weren&amp;rsquo;t banned, they could just fly out to Malaysia or such, then fly back in to NAIA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I note that on this day, 16 new confirmed cases were reported, while 9 and 4 cases were reported the two days prior. This implies to me that we&amp;rsquo;re looking at 25 cases the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My opinion: I general accept that the lockdown is probably necessary, but not with the implied threat of police/military action. Focus should be on improving testing and healthcare resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;friday-march-the-13th&#34;&gt;Friday, March the 13th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Friday the 13th! This morning, the PSE circuit breaker triggers again, mere minutes after trade opens. The markets did not like last night&amp;rsquo;s announcements either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/1238286699706200064/&#34;&gt;Twitter tells us&lt;/a&gt; that the MRT officials have started applying social distancing rules, only letting a limited number of people on the trains per station. This results in very long lines outside the stations, kind of negating the social distancing anyway. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I&amp;rsquo;m no longer a regular commuter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend to my parents to do the regular grocery run earlier, and as a result I have to accompany my mom on the trip, just after lunch. Even then, the nearby grocery was packed, with maybe 200% more people than the usual peak. Sanitation items like hand sanitizer and alcohol were out of stock. Eggs were too for some reason (luckily I had already bought some the day before). Common canned goods were still on shelves, but the more popular ones were in short supply. The &amp;ldquo;panic buying&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t as much as we see reported in other countries where many shelves are bare. Friends who go to larger groceries like SNR report 2-hr wait times at the checkout line. Ours takes around 30 mins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokespersons for different government agencies have begun issuing statements clarifying how things will actually work during the lockdown &amp;ndash; excuse me, &amp;ldquo;community quarantine&amp;rdquo;. The air and sea restrictions are pretty clear, but the land restrictions seem impossible to implement without massive traffic. The intent is to have checkpoints at roads in and out of the metro, and to inspect passengers one by one to make sure their trips are essential. There is still no plan on how to support people who cannot work due to the lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local churches announce suspension of mass services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group chats are abuzz all day with discussions such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how their companies are preparing for WFH. Some of my friends work at a company with over 200 people and they had been preparing a business continuity plan during the week, but last night&amp;rsquo;s announcements have accelerated plans. They need to purchase laptops and pocket wifis for those who don&amp;rsquo;t have hardware or internet at home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disinfectant alternatives due to lack of supply of alcohol and hand sanitizer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;word is a doctor at the Philippine Heart Center has been intubated because a patient lied about her travel history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My doctor friend happily reports that she has tested negative, but that she still has to stay quarantined for 14 days. Our healthcare system will not survive any uptick in cases which causes large swathes of our medical professionals to be taken out of play for 2 weeks at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I note the strong parallels between Trump and Duterte&amp;rsquo;s approaches: both held disastrous press conferences that resulted in markets crashing!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell everyone that since things are unclear, just stay home as much as possible. I am privileged enough that I can largely follow this advice, and many of my friends work in industries where WFH is viable. The ones who will be disproportionally affected are the poor - the ones who can&amp;rsquo;t afford not to work or have no way to work remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mayor of Quezon City has declared a state of calamity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the trading day, the PSE has managed to recover a bit, closing at +1.x% up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only 3 new confirmed cases are reported today, defying my pattern recognition skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;saturday-march-the-14th&#34;&gt;Saturday, March the 14th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Pi day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a small extended family lunch gathering today, mostly as a send-off to some &lt;em&gt;balikbayan&lt;/em&gt; relatives who are flying back to the US in a couple of weeks. The gathering was originally scheduled for Sunday, but because of the announcement we rescheduled to Saturday to avoid complications. Fewer people are able to attend, and we just have takeout instead of going to a restaurant as originally planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, there is a presscon where the MMDA/PNP/some mayors are talking about a one month curfew from 8PM-5AM. The interior secretary threatens arrest for those who refuse to go home during the curfew. This causes a mix of reactions on social media and in the group chats. During the time I was still a regular commuter, by 8PM I would not have been able to get on a bus yet. The authorities are also requesting that malls close except for essential services such as supermarkets, banks and pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strain in the healthcare system is starting to show. Multiple reports of healthcare personnel lacking alcohol, hand sanitizer, gloves, and other personal protective equipment (PPE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local media giant ABS-CBN announces their hit primetime dramas are going off the air starting next week, to be replaced by reruns. Finally, a villain that &lt;em&gt;Ang Probinsyano&lt;/em&gt; is unable to defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All day there are reports of massive crowds at the bus stations of people planning to leave the metro before the lockdown. The exodus is worse than Christmas or Holy Week holidays. Airline ticketing offices are also swamped with people looking for refunds and rebookings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the evening, they start rolling back the curfew announcement, saying it was just recommendations, and that the MMDA has no authority to impose a curfew, unless the LGUs pass ordinances to enable such. PCOO&amp;rsquo;s Andanar calls such reports &amp;ldquo;fake news&amp;rdquo;. (Never mind that the government people were live on TV talking about it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the day, 47 new confirmed cases had been reported, for a total of 111. (If my pattern recognition had held, today would have seen 36 new cases. Not too far off.) Some posts from healthcare workers suggest that some of the new cases are from the poorer Payatas and BASECO areas. An outbreak in those areas would be really bad, as the spread would be very difficult to control. And the tests are delayed by about two days - by now many people may have been infected in those areas. The DOH is yet to release details of the new cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late in the evening, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ANCALERTS/status/1238843668485685248&#34;&gt;NCRPO announces&lt;/a&gt; that instead of checkpoints, they will just implement increased police visibility at the metro exit points. Thread says they had meetings late into the night, I suspected they realized how ridiculous the original plan was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we near the start of the lockdown, only the LGU of Muntinlupa has confirmed a curfew, starting Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes increasingly clear how poor the planning and coordination for this event was, that they are just ironing out details and making plans up more or less on the fly. We had weeks where they were saying not to worry and things were under control, that time should have been spent preparing for contingencies such as this. This does not inspire confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minor annoyance: social media people who say we should just obey without question. We don&amp;rsquo;t have to obey dumbass rules!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, my intent is just to stay at home as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-march-the-15th&#34;&gt;Sunday, March the 15th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard mass online through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/quiapochurch/&#34;&gt;facebook page of the Quiapo Church&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayala and Robinson&amp;rsquo;s malls have announced that their Metro Manila malls will be closing indefinitely starting tomorrow. SM malls announced a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TheSMStore/status/1239123144851390464&#34;&gt;similar closure except limited to a few cities and areas&lt;/a&gt;, Quezon City not included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayor Belmonte has &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/notes/quezon-city-government/mayor-joy-belmonte-on-declaration-of-public-safety-hours-in-quezon-city/226925012028597/&#34;&gt;declared a curfew in Quezon City&lt;/a&gt; starting Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A family friend has been suffering from a fever for a couple of days but refuses to go to the hospital for checkups. His two daughters, both doctors, are reportedly very exasperated at his stubbornness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently the US has &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/amanbatheja/status/1239175709823819776&#34;&gt;attempted to acquire exclusive rights to a possible vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. Capitalism ho!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lockdown is generally going smoothly. I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone was questioning the need of course. The real challenge in implementation will be tomorrow when people start going to work. My earlier expectation of general chaos, confusion and traffic has been tempered by the fact that the NCRPO supposedly reduced it to just police visibility instead of hard checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Sunday evening, we are at 140 cases (+29) and 12 fatalities, around 8.5% fatality rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of my friends however are quite worried about whether the police are sanitizing themselves after every check. If not, they might well become another vector for spreading the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t left the house since the grocery run on Friday. I&amp;rsquo;m considering resuming my afternoon walks starting tomorrow. I mean, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably be fine right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some handy trackers: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ncovtracker.doh.gov.ph/&#34;&gt;https://ncovtracker.doh.gov.ph/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;https://covid19ph.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monday-march-the-16th-enhanced-community-quarantine-announced&#34;&gt;Monday, March the 16th: Enhanced community quarantine announced&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, throngs of people out in the streets trying to commute to work. So much for social distancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go out for a quick medicine run (to ensure I have one month&amp;rsquo;s worth). The nearby drugstore is less crowded than the last time I passed by, although still well above expectations for the early afternoon hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        






    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the people in my group chats are starting to get overwhelmed by anxiety at the mishandling of the situation. I send them the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not saying we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take things seriously and/or prepare for the worst, I&amp;rsquo;m saying be mindful of your mental health by exposing yourself to too much anxiety and worry. i&amp;rsquo;m sure each of us here is already doing as much as possible to avoid risk/exposure for us and our families, it&amp;rsquo;s ok to step back from all the updates every so often&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word starts to spread that the government is meeting to plan a heightened lockdown. A press conference is announced for this afternoon. It seems like they announced the presscon even before the meeting starts, which means they have a presumption that an announcement will be needed. I expect that meeting to run long, most likely it will be this early to mid evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/gmanews/posts/10158510980196977&#34;&gt;breaking news post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUST IN: Presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo says President Duterte has ordered an enhanced community quarantine of entire Luzon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under enhanced community quarantine, the government says strict home quarantine will be implemented in all households, transportation will be suspended and provision for food and essential health services will be regulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of uniformed personnel to enforce quarantine procedures will be heightened under enhanced community quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kind of slept through the actual announcements. Tighter lockdown as expected. No more going to work, only essential travel. No public transpo. Outbound international travellers have 3 days to get to their flights (luckily my &lt;em&gt;balikbayan&lt;/em&gt; relative had previously decided to panic-rebook to this Thursday, just inside the window). Luzon-wide travel ban. Food distribution etc. Looks like a lot of the implementation problems are being left to the LGUs to decide. Government asking landlords, etc to defer rents, business to advance 13th month pay if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of edge cases seem unhandled, mostly for poor people without cars: how do they get to groceries, hospitals? How do healthcare workers without cars get to the hospitals? Etc. Some of the people in my chat groups are very pessimistic and are worried about the implementation of food distribution and other support for the poor. If not implemented properly, could lead to social unrest. I suspect we&amp;rsquo;re going to see another major announcement within 1-2 days to iron out some details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading at the PSE is suspended until further notice. Just as well - otherwise we might be in for daily bloodbaths. Stocks were down 7.9% today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news is only 2 confirmed cases today, and no additional deaths. One of the new cases is Senator Zubiri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increased lockdown is harsh, but might be necessary for containment at this point, given the earlier mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuesday-march-the-17th&#34;&gt;Tuesday, March the 17th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I caught part of the morning DZMM program with Noli de Castro, he&amp;rsquo;s complaining about how unclear the details of the enhanced lockdown is. He speaks to a field reporter on Commonwealth who says there are still a few jeeps running but MMDA personnel are flagging them down telling them they can&amp;rsquo;t run their routes. Those with full passenger loads are told to complete one last pass then that&amp;rsquo;s it. There are a lot of commuters on the road trying to get a rare ride. The reporter interviews a security guard for a hospital who says he&amp;rsquo;s been waiting to get a ride for 1.5 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Castro calls up the mayor of Paranaque (Edwin Olivares, also chair of the Metro Manila Mayors group), who tells him the implementation details are mostly dependent on the LGU. As for those who still need to work (like the security guard above) and don&amp;rsquo;t have cars, they have no choice but to walk. (&lt;em&gt;Sakripisyo daw&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mid-day, a friend reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just got back from buying supplies and delivering to my aunt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lots of ppl at the banks that I passed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;line at the grocery was long&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;line at the other grocery on anonas was hella long just to get in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a fair number of people just walking along the streets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;saw one jeepney and a couple tricycles&amp;hellip; maybe friends of brgy officials? who knows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;saw very few cops. they must be at the entry and exit points between cities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a car, it almost feels like holy week back in the 80s, when everything would be closed, but there are still some people going about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News comes out that last night, the President declared a state of calamity for the entire country. My understanding of this is that it&amp;rsquo;s mainly to unlock use of calamity funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OVP has set up transportation support for frontliners starting tomorrow. The military will also be deploying army trucks. Social media is full of stories of ordinary citizens volunteering to provide transportation or other support to those who still have to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manny Pacquiao has worked with Jack Ma&amp;rsquo;s foundation to have 50,000 testing kits donated to the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some social media influencer gets shamed for going off on people who are still going to work despite the enhanced lockdown. These trying times really make it easy to identify those who are unable to put themselves in other people&amp;rsquo;s situations and empathize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nograles talks to an early evening news program on TV , saying there will be a press conference later at 8PM discussing more details. The press conference happens past 11PM. It&amp;rsquo;s just Nograles and some other cabinet members, discussing details of who will be allowed to move around, what companies/industries will still be operating, etc. Basically details they should have had from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of new cases today is +45, with 2 additional deaths. Total number of cases: 187, deaths: 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wednesday-march-the-18th&#34;&gt;Wednesday, March the 18th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, Quezon City mayor Joy Belmonte announces &amp;ldquo;Extreme Enhanced Community Quarantine&amp;rdquo; (LOL) for selected barangays in Quezon City, specifically those barangays with 2 or more confirmed cases each. This enhanced lockdown (lets be real) means additional restrictions such as checkpoints and temperature scans in certain areas. Only those with essential travel needs will be allowed to pass. During the press conference, they identified several areas to be affected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a rectangular area around St. Luke&amp;rsquo;s Hospital near E.Rodriguez&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a circular area around the cluster of hospitals along East Avenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quirino Memorial Medical Center (facility quarantine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Barangay Tandang Sora (where we live) is one of the identified areas with multiple cases, but they have yet to finalize which streets/areas to restrict. Reportedly, the cases are somewhere in the Himlayan area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were worried about how the lockdown would affect us so my parents decided to do a grocery run today (our last run was Friday). This gave me quite a bit of anxiety, since they&amp;rsquo;re both vulnerable seniors, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t drive and I&amp;rsquo;m not the best shopper so I can&amp;rsquo;t make decisions in case of stuff being out of stock. They came back without incident, and reportedly the grocery practiced safe social distancing measures, so I assume (and hope) they&amp;rsquo;re fine. For future runs, we may try some online grocery sites such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.metromart.com/welcome/cities&#34;&gt;Metromart&lt;/a&gt;, or I&amp;rsquo;ll do the run myself (and we just live with whatever terrible choices I make LOL.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we are up to 202 confirmed cases (15 new cases) with 3 additional deaths (total 17). Over the past few days we have alternated big jumps and low jumps, so we might have more new cases tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thursday-march-the-19th&#34;&gt;Thursday, March the 19th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No major announcements today. We are up to 217 confirmed cases (+15) and 17 (+0) deaths. Not bad considering I thought we&amp;rsquo;d get a big bump today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;friday-march-the-20th&#34;&gt;Friday, March the 20th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No major announcements today. Well, there was a presscon by the president at 1am where he basically threw shade at the mayor of Pasig for daring to suggest something contrary to what the national government has advised. But nothing of significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got out of the house today, but only to walk a little bit around the subdivision. I thought about walking around my usual route, but that seems like an unnecessary risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are up to 230 cases (+13) and 18 deaths (+1). The growth rate is kind of plateauing, most probably due to lack of testing, but maybe not? We&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;saturday-march-the-21st&#34;&gt;Saturday, March the 21st&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word is going around in various QC barangays that the barangay personnel are issuing quarantine passes to households. AFAIK there has been no announcement from either the national government or the LGU, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s just the barangays being creative in implementation. Feels like unnecessary bureaucracy, and probably prone to abuse? We haven&amp;rsquo;t had anyone give us any yet. Regardless, we are mostly staying cooped up inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumors abound that there is a &amp;ldquo;secret protocol&amp;rdquo; at the RITM to prioritize VIPs in testing, and that the staff is furious but are afraid of violating NDAs. Sucks if true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we are up to 307 cases (+77) and 19 deaths (+1). This is the biggest one day jump in cases so far. Presumably there has been a lag in testing, so we may be in for even more cases in the days ahead. The coming week may very well tell us what our eventual curve is going to look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-march-the-22nd&#34;&gt;Sunday, March the 22nd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been just around one week of this lockdown. I think people are starting to get used to it? A lot of the less fortunate people are still suffering though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning my dad and my tita went out for groceries. I didn&amp;rsquo;t find out about it until I went down around lunch time. I told them later that they should just let me go out if we need to do a grocery run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard mass online again via the Quiapo church facebook page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I was getting a handle on all this covid19 news but I felt frustrated again today at a lot of bad news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOH prioritizing VIP politicians for testing given limited test kits. The current head of the RITM has been removed allegedly due to his refusal to prioritize VIPs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;530 hospital staff in UST quarantined&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The president asking congress for emergency powers (Senate President and the Palace spokesman both say it&amp;rsquo;s not emergency powers, some kind of BS). Basically this incompetent government after all this time assuring that they have the budget needed etc, say we should trust them with even more power and budget. And still no word on plans for mass testing!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, word in our barangay is that they are starting to distribute quarantine passes in our subdivision. We haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten one yet because they ran out or something, but they&amp;rsquo;ll be back tomorrow. We&amp;rsquo;re also told even with the pass, others can still go out as long as you have an ID with an address. Huh, what&amp;rsquo;s the point then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight we have 380 confirmed cases (+73) and 25 deaths (+6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monday-march-the-23rd&#34;&gt;Monday, March the 23rd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re entering the second working week of this lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock market was relatively calm today. The PSE Index dropped by about 0.74%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metro Manila hospitals are at or close to capacity; The Medical City advised that their ER beds are full and the same goes for other Pasig hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sign of how severely out of touch they are, the Speaker of the House and the Executive Secretary posted a picture of themselves with other congressmen at the house (for deliberations on the emergency powers bill), while holding a manila paper banner between them with a message along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Like our doctors and frontliners, we came to work for you, so please stay at home.&amp;rdquo; The internet responded&amp;hellip; appropriately. &amp;ldquo;ANG KAKAPAL&amp;rdquo; trended on PH twitter for a while, and since they conveniently provided an image with a space for text, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/scoutmagph/status/1241981421175975937&#34;&gt;memes started rolling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so frustrated at the government today, I ended up writing a tweetstorm rant that evolved into &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/this-is-not-the-time-for-mediocrity/&#34;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;. I even broke my Facebook isolation to post it there as well. It helped my sanity a little to write it out (and to get positive dopamine hits from the likes and shares.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight we have 462 confirmed cases (+82) and 33 deaths (+8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuesday-march-the-24th&#34;&gt;Tuesday, March the 24th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More hospitals today announced they are at capacity, including St. Luke&amp;rsquo;s and Makati Medical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night in the wee hours, after more than half a day of sessions, emergency powers were granted by Congress to the president. The senate version was adopted, with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/kevinikhe/posts/10219934639812972&#34;&gt;bit more checks and balances&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s fine, but we must remain vigilant. For me, the main issue with the admin being granted emergency powers is that it has not proven competence and indeed has shown a tendency to abuse powers in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president held another address at 10pm (surprisingly on schedule). I did not listen to it, I&amp;rsquo;m told it was mostly thanking frontliners and law enforcement and encouraging the nation. (Sounds good.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight we have 552 confirmed cases (+90) and 35 deaths (+2). The confirmed cases rate is still accelerating, albeit slower than I thought it would. As more people are tested, the curve of the death rate becomes a bigger indicator - it may indicate whether people are already dying due to hospital over capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the world crossed the 400,000 confirmed cases mark, 3 days after crossing 300,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wednesday-march-the-25th&#34;&gt;Wednesday, March the 25th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went out with my dad midday to get groceries. I had volunteered to go do it alone, but the problem was I can&amp;rsquo;t drive, and the 30-40 minute walk back might be problematic with the amount of stuff to buy. And it turned out if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a senior citizen with me, I&amp;rsquo;d have had to wait in a long queue. It&amp;rsquo;s a tradeoff and a risk to be sure, but we tried to manage it. I did the main grocery shopping, he mostly just went to the pharmacy to buy meds. Hopefully that mitigates things. Anytime I go outside, there&amp;rsquo;s an additional bit of anxiety over the next few days to see if we develop any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our drive back, I noted that the nearby McDonald&amp;rsquo;s was the only open restaurant, and it was full of GrabFood drivers. We considered using their drive through, but I don&amp;rsquo;t actually like McDonald&amp;rsquo;s so I passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our &amp;ldquo;honorable&amp;rdquo; senators caused a shitstorm today when he showed up to a major private hospital with his wife for them to have a caesarean birth, knowing full well he should have been under home quarantine while waiting for COVID19 test results. His results came back while they were at the hospital and he had to leave and the whole delivery ward had to be decontaminated and HCWs put into quarantine. The speaker of the house and the mayor of QC must be glad there&amp;rsquo;s a new idiot taking the heat off of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight we have 636 confirmed cases (+84) and 38 deaths (+3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thursday-march-the-26th&#34;&gt;Thursday, March the 26th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, nothing exceptionally stupid from the government today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another senator has announced that he has been diagnosed positive though. And a VP loser, rumored to have been flown to Singapore due to possible severe Covid symptoms, was forced to issue a statement, this time inviting criticism due to him and his family and staff allegedly getting prioritized with tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight we have 707 confirmed cases (+71) and 45 deaths (+7). The world is also a sliver away from 500k cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;friday-march-the-27th&#34;&gt;Friday, March the 27th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumors have been circulating since the day before that a lockdown level up was in the works, perhaps as soon as this weekend. No such announcement came, and some admin people claimed it was fake news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RITM rolls back the positive diagnosis for a congressman, saying they made a clerical error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we have 803 confirmed cases (+96, biggest daily jump so far) and 54 deaths (+9, also biggest jump).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;saturday-march-the-28th&#34;&gt;Saturday, March the 28th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abuzz on the internets yesterday was the exchange between a science-student turned journalist and a infectious disease specialist consulting with the DOH, who sparred over some facts. The journalist was asking why we had tested so few people compared to other nearby countries of similar economic standing, but the doctor insisted the official numbers were much higher - except he was actually talking about number of tests conducted, not number of people tested, which was the comparison being made. This particular doctor had over the past few days established a reputation for being quite arrogant and self-centered, and dismissive of people who aren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;experts&amp;rdquo;. Probably not the best person to be talking for the DOH (but he isn&amp;rsquo;t actually an officially spokesperson - a DOH usec later confirmed the journalist&amp;rsquo;s numbers were the official one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the more science-y folk in my monkeysphere are not very happy with this particular doctor and how he handles himself on social media, and one of my friends (with a background in molecular biology) even got blocked trying to ask him about the technicalities. Regardless, I try to avoid delving into his conversations too much anyway, as he is only a DOH consultant and not an official spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the things he are saying are counterproductive or non sequitur anyway. If I was a media person interviewing a Government or DOH spokesperson, the main question I would want asked would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;between the time of the first confirmed case (January 30) and up to the lockdown of Metro Manila (roughly a 6 week period), what preparations did the DOH undertake to make sure we would have sufficient testing capacity, hospital capacity, and available PPEs for our health workers and other frontliners in case the virus spreads?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize looking into the past may not be the most productive thing at the moment, but if the government and the DOH want us to trust them, I think they need to be able to acknowledge mistakes and lack of preparation. This helps us see that they know what went wrong and can adjust accordingly. Transparency begets trust, and the more trust we can have in our leadership, the easier it will be for the citizenry to bear the harsh burdens that the following weeks and/or months may entail. I want to believe they are capable of handling this situation. Give me hope!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 1075 cases (+272) and 68 deaths (+14), both the biggest daily jumps so far. Presumably the RITM are starting to burn through the testing backlog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, we are past 650k cases. Jumped from 500k-600k in a day and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-march-the-29th&#34;&gt;Sunday, March the 29th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We survived 2 weeks of quarantine/lockdown!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard online mass again via the Quiapo Church facebook page. The priest reminds us that next Sunday is Palm Sunday, and thus next week is Holy Week. He says we just have two more weeks to go, but I am not as hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to keep some of the seniors I live with under check. A couple of them went out for groceries without my knowing. I&amp;rsquo;m sure they&amp;rsquo;re being careful, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I won&amp;rsquo;t be worried and anxious D:.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to shout out some props to the OVP, they&amp;rsquo;ve been able to give support to the frontliners/health care workers even while running on donations and a limited budget. They&amp;rsquo;ve set up free transport routes, dorm rooms for those who want to stay near hospitals, and now they&amp;rsquo;re partnering with fashion designers to make custom PPE clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DOH released a statement saying some of the test kits from China were faulty, but then rolled it back later (presumably not to offend China).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHO and China are increasingly coming under scrutiny for misrepresenting figures and mishandling the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 1418 cases (+343) and 71 deaths (+3). We expect the cases to rise rapidly, given the increase in testing capacity, but we don&amp;rsquo;t yet know where the ceiling is. Today&amp;rsquo;s rate suggests doubling roughly every 3 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monday-march-the-30th&#34;&gt;Monday, March the 30th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A press conference by the president was announced for 4PM today, presumably this is for the report required by the emergency powers law. I will update the time when that actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that not everything is doom and gloom, here are some (presumably good) things the admin is doing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOH expanded testing capabilities to 6 laboratories so far, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/OfficialDOHgov/posts/3188149711196259&#34;&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s a long list of other labs currently being accredited&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOST says &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/256400-philippine-kits-coronavirus-tests-available-april-2020&#34;&gt;120,000 locally-made test kits will be available by Apr 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOH says &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.mb.com.ph/2020/03/30/1-million-ppe-sets-worth-p1-8b-due-for-delivery-to-doh-for-distribution-to-health-workers/&#34;&gt;1 million PPE sets are due to be delivered and distributed&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully these aren&amp;rsquo;t substandard quality and were not overpriced!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several friends have mentioned that they have viber/messenger chat groups for their local areas so I ask for advice if there&amp;rsquo;s any for our barangay. Someone helpfully adds me to the viber group for QC, though I mute it almost immediately, as I (correctly) expect heavy volume there. I just want to have the channel available in case we need it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally at around 1140pm, the promised presscon finally airs. It&amp;rsquo;s pre-recorded, and rumor is it was already shot earlier and the day, no explanation for the long delay, but I would guess they had to find a decent/usable cut/take that didn&amp;rsquo;t make him look too much like an idiot. I didn&amp;rsquo;t watch, but here&amp;rsquo;s the summary I got from friends (my comments in &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thanks frontliners &lt;em&gt;(finally! he was roundly criticized for not acknowleding them before)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;appeals to the private sector to contribute to this national emergency &lt;em&gt;(Pretty sure they&amp;rsquo;ve been doing that for the past 2 weeks)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We have allotted P200 billion for low income households who are badly affected by this crisis.” &lt;em&gt;(This is good, but still only an allocation, hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s executed well)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thanks those who silently helped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speaking about frontliners who died of COVID-19: Napaka swerte nila namatay sila para sa bayan. It will be an honor to die for the country. &lt;em&gt;(Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just me, but this feels at least a teeny bit insensitive)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;says he will crackdown on corruption in COVID-19 funds &lt;em&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;ll believe it when I see it. Also, what about crackdown on VIPs who ask for priority testing and who violate quarantine?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thanks governments of China and Singapore as well as local businessmen for their contributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 1546 cases (+128) and 78 deaths (+7). Low jump in cases today, have they already completed their backlog? We&amp;rsquo;ll see what tomorrow brings!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuesday-march-the-31st&#34;&gt;Tuesday, March the 31st&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes from a meeting between the IATF and private sector representatives &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mlq3/status/1244827097610084353&#34;&gt;were leaked online today&lt;/a&gt;. Looks like they are recommending a two-week lockdown extension. Private sector people later &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/business/256541-philippine-chamber-commerce-industry-leaked-notes-government-businessmen-video-call-not-policy&#34;&gt;said it was just a brainstorming session&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we got &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/732016/duterte-s-first-report-to-congress-on-covid-19-response/story/&#34;&gt;a copy of the report the palace submitted&lt;/a&gt; to congress as required by the emergency panel law. A lot of details in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former senator and 2016 VP loser Bongbong Marcos has declared he was found positive of COVID19. Same goes for DILG secretary Ano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we are up to 2084 (+538) cases and 88 (+10) deaths. Despite a low bump yesterday, we still managed to double over 3 days. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how the rest of the week goes&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wednesday-april-the-1st&#34;&gt;Wednesday, April the 1st&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;rsquo;s April Fools Day, but there&amp;rsquo;s nothing funny about today&amp;rsquo;s events. I don&amp;rsquo;t normally swear, but what a fucking shitshow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime in the afternoon, a protest broke out at Sitio San Roque in Quezon City (near where my high school was), with the residents going out to the streets to complain about lack of food packs being distributed to them. These are urban poor-type people. Law-enforcement types came in to disperse them for violating quarantine, and violence broke out when people refused and complained. Multiple people were arrested. Arrested for complaining they were dying of hunger! The QC govt later issued a statement denying that relief goods had not been distributed to those areas and blamed instigators for causing trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, the NBI summoned a popular city mayor for questioning about an alleged violation of the Bayanihan Heal As One Act (aka the emergency powers bill aka the BaHO Act), because he violated the natgov order not to allow tricycles to ply the roads. The thing is, that happened way before the BaHO Act was passed, and the mayor appealed to the natgov to let them use tricycles and when that appeal was denied, the mayor complied with the directives. Targeting a very popular local gov official turned out to be a very unpopular move, unsurprisingly, and many just assumed the president was being insecure because this particular mayor was serving his city well and was making him look bad. This is such an idiotic move, not even particularly corrupt or evil or sinister as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really gain them anything; what purpose does it serve other than to make the people angry? An unforced error in a long line of unforced errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people suggested it might be a sleight of hand - to distract us with things they are doing with the emergency funds prescribed by the BaHO act. Supposedly the 1.8B pesos worth of PPE sets being ordered by the DOH are overpriced, but they of course denied that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there was this directive that all donations to the DOH and to govt hospitals need to be coursed through the OCD, and hospitals have to make their requests in writing. Many questioned this added layer of centralized bureaucracy and some openly speculated that this was so that the donations could be &amp;ldquo;repackaged&amp;rdquo; and distribution controlled by a particularly influential senator through his &amp;ldquo;Malasakit centers&amp;rdquo;. If the idea is just to make sure all hospitals get served appropriately, perhaps a more prudent approach would have been for the DOH to continuously publish a priority list of hospitals with the most dire need of donations? The whole reason people are donating directly to the hospitals and hcws is the poor trust in the national government. Some have also suggested that this may be a way to exert some control over the OVP, which has been working hard to solicit donations and get supplies and support to hcws and other frontliners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The icing on the cake: at around 10pm, an unannounced live press conference by the president was aired where he warned the people to just obey, even if relief goods are delayed, promising they will not die of hunger. And for those who would violate quarantine or cause trouble, he implied that the law enforcement types should just shoot to kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTF. Think about that. People are anxious, worried, fearful, and most of all hungry and staving and you think the best move is to threaten them with violence and death?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, pictures came out of donated PPEs and face masks supposedly repackaged and branded as being from a certain senator. Unverified rumors also started to spread that certain private hospitals were raided to get their donations, so that they can be repackaged by the senator. These are yet unverified reports, the only evidence being screenshots of text convos between people who allegedly have first-hand knowledge. If it were true, one would think there would be images or video footage somewhere maybe? Someone I know asked her medical friends and they have no knowledge of such raids on the private hospitals. So maybe let&amp;rsquo;s leave that for now. But I think it&amp;rsquo;s a serious indictment of the trust in the natgov and that senator in particular that many people easily believe he could be behind such acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we are up to 2311 (+227) cases and 96 (+8) deaths. The slope is around the same as the past few days (slightly less), which seems to imply that the limiting factor is how many tests are being conducted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thursday-april-the-2nd&#34;&gt;Thursday, April the 2nd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing this at a bit past 4pm. Ever since Duterte&amp;rsquo;s surprise address last night, #OUSTDUTERTENOW has been trending on Twitter, first locally to the Philippines, then worldwide at #1 (currently at 489k tweets). I took the liberty of taking a look of a few of the profiles using the hashtag, and as far as I can tell the traffic is organic; the accounts don&amp;rsquo;t look like bots, they tweet about a lot of other things (honestly most of it seems to be korean fandom, so maybe they&amp;rsquo;re young people), and aren&amp;rsquo;t recently created egg accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, obviously I don&amp;rsquo;t like Duterte as a president and think he&amp;rsquo;s doing a terrible job. But I wish the Filipino people had chosen a better time to wisen up to his shortcomings than when we&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of a pandemic. Even if somehow there were an orderly transition (not bloody likely), the discontinuity in administration is bound to cause friction and hiccups in our pandemic response. Unfortunately, the administration is pretty bad in their crisis control and have made multiple unforced errors (see yesterday&amp;rsquo;s entry) that only increase the likelihood of social unrest and/or chaos. I would prefer we get past the current crisis first, then we exact accountability, but that may be wishful thinking&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the rest of the day was relatively saner compared to yesterday. As of 7pm, I am slightly more optimistic about the country again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/inquirerdotnet/status/1245614612751331328&#34;&gt;Relief goods were finally distributed to the residents of Sitio San Roque.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jeffcanoy/status/1245616090719195138&#34;&gt;The DILG Sec Ano has some sane words about the NBI&amp;rsquo;s investigation of a popular mayor.&lt;/a&gt; He also says they will crack down on other chief executives not following the IATF guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member of the Presidential Anti-Crime Competition floated the idea that the NBI should also investigate the OVP for &amp;ldquo;competing&amp;rdquo; against other government services. WTF? Later, the head of the PACC issued a statement saying that was not an official recommendation and the member was just expressing a personal opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#OUSTDUTERTE vanished from the twitter trending lists by the time I woke up around lunch time, to be replace by typos like #OUSTDUTERE. Some are speculating it may be counter-ops by troll farms wishing to split the original hashtag. The funny thing is even the typo&amp;rsquo;d hashtag trended for a while!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the lockdown started, we haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten our regular newspaper delivery, so I&amp;rsquo;ve missed the opinion columns of some columnists I like such as Boo Chanco. I recently read a post of his on FB where he shared some thoughts from someone complaining how the government officials in charge had practically no knowledge of supply chain logistics, which made managing the quarantine much more difficult. Unfortunately when I checked his FB profile for the post, it could no longer be found! Either he set it to private due to being bashed by trolls or the person who shared the info asked him to take it down, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 7pm tonight, we are at 2633 (+322) cases and 107 (11) deaths. Still roughly the same curve. It&amp;rsquo;s actually possible we do have this thing under control, given our death count so far hasn&amp;rsquo;t been spiraling out of control like the US (who got their first cases much later than us). But we probably don&amp;rsquo;t have an accurate count - there might be a lot of deaths going unreported as covid19-related due to not being tested, or poor people not even bothering to go to the hospitals, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss being able to go out. Not for hanging out with people, but just being able to take long walks and also to eat outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;friday-april-the-3rd&#34;&gt;Friday, April the 3rd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overnight, the worldwide tally of cases broke past the 1,000,000 mark (doubling in around 5 days) and 50,000 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of good news: Late last night it was announced that mass testing of PUIs and PUMs is planned to start on April 14, so it&amp;rsquo;s a solid step towards the mass testing everyone had been clamoring for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mayor of QC issued a statement apologizing for her past statements on social media and for relief bags bearing her name. She still has a long way to go, but wow the ability to admit mistakes and apologize is super rare among politicians, and improves my trust rating of her and makes me see her more as someone just trying her best in a bad situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had another surprise episode of Late Night with Duterte tonight. Most of it was the usual seemingly drunken rant (a friend of ours showed the stream to a UK colleague and the comment was &amp;ldquo;he looks so wasted!&amp;quot;), including an appeal/threat to obey the police and trying to justify his earlier violent statements, etc. He also spent quite a lot of time picking on former senatorial candidate Chel Diokno, in a manner that made him look like a shallow playground bully, including commentary on appearance. A bit of a plot twist at the end when he castigated the PACC official who suggested to investigate the OVP for helping the people and announced he would be fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 3018 (+385) cases and 136 (29) deaths. Are deaths starting to accelerate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;saturday-april-the-4th&#34;&gt;Saturday, April the 4th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was relatively uneventful, thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 3094 (+76) cases and 144 (+8) deaths. Virus taking a weekend break?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-april-the-5th&#34;&gt;Sunday, April the 5th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have completed three weeks of quarantine/lockdown! The original target end date for the lockdown was Apr 12th, but it seems highly probable that we will have an extension, at least until the end of April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally uneventful, though I would like to note that anecdotally I have been reading more stories about people who criticize the government accused of being communists/leftists rebels (as if complaining is exclusively the domain of the left!). There&amp;rsquo;s even an infamous PCOO undersecretary accusing teachers at my high school alma mater of being CPP-NPA-NDF! I would guess the president&amp;rsquo;s threats against the &amp;ldquo;left&amp;rdquo; has galvanized his base into painting critics with a common brush, giving them an enemy to hate in this crisis; convenient since the true enemy is invisible and cares not about your red-tagging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In better news, a number of politicians, including some mayors and congressmen and even the president himself, have committed to donating part or all of their salaries to the relief operations. It may not be much, but it&amp;rsquo;s something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 3246 (+152) cases and 152 (+8) deaths. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if the relatively lower numbers keep up during the coming week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monday-april-the-6th&#34;&gt;Monday, April the 6th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are officially in week four of quarantine/lockdown!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think by this point, most people are already expecting an extension at least until the end of April. Even Chief Impelementer Galvez (of the  National Task Force Against COVID-19) is implying that&amp;rsquo;s where the task force is leaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the task force, they have &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ntfcovid19ph&#34;&gt;a twitter&lt;/a&gt;! They seem to be communicating better than other govt branches too, and they are &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ntfcovid19ph/status/1247098792848982016&#34;&gt;friends with the OVP apparently&lt;/a&gt;. Galvez is one of the bright spots in the govt fight against the virus, so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This afternoon I went out to the nearby drugstore (around a 10-minute walk) to buy meds for my mom and maybe a tiny bit of groceries (the drugstore has a small grocery section). The drugstore had 3 short queues outside: one for regular transactions, one for senior/PWD transactions (this was the shortest line), and one for groceries (only 3 grocery people allowed inside at the same time). I was transacting for a senior, so I got to use the shortest line. Inside, what used to be the open counter of the pharmacy had a barrier of plastic wrap to separate the customers from the staff, with only a tiny hole to slide prescriptions and money and medicines across. Entire trip (including back and forth walk) took around an hour and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Monday, so we have a new episode of Late Night with Duterte. As usual, I didn&amp;rsquo;t watch, but here&amp;rsquo;s the summary I got from one of my chat groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;says poorest of the poor must receive gov’t assistance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;₱100 billion for one month or the ₱270 billion for two months is not enough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exploring adjustment of budgets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asks for the cooperation of the public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let’s heed the needs of our poor brothers and sisters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on drug addicts: wag subukan ang gobyerno, ang gobyerno desperado na din (to solve the COVID-19 crisis)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encourages everyone to wear masks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nagdadasal ako para sa bayan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kung may pera, d ko hawakan yan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“it’s not my money d ko pwede nakawin, kung ma nakaw ko man, ano gawin ko sa pera na yan”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if money allotted for next month is used now, no more money next month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i want to give the poorest of the poor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;says Elly Pamatong “as president” instructs the military to catch Duterte&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ako, I agree. Kung maaari lang, isali ko sila. (On adding middle class to social amelioration program)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ang solusyon dito is vaccine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;itong problema natin, ang pang kontra nito is stay home, at wag ka mahawaan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sana mapanood niyo yung Japanese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hindi ko alam kung saan ako magkuha ng pera&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Wag kang mahawa, mag-stay ka sa bahay. “pano pagkain namin?” maghanap ka ng paraan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;panawagan ko: be patient, intindihin niyo ang gobyerno, we’d appreciate it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the resources are all exhausted and the pandemic would claim millions of lives, I hope, really, and I pray that it would not. Pero kung ganun, wala na ako magawa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are inclined to extend the lockdown up to April 30.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like he is striking a softer tone than the last presscon, where it was like he wanted to pick a fight with everyone. A lot of it still seems senseless and incoherent, but I guess there&amp;rsquo;s a slight improvement? I prefer how the ntfcovid19ph is communicating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 3660 (+414) cases and 163 (+11) deaths. For looking at how the trend has been adjusting since the start of the lockdown, my thesis adviser Luis Sison has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/luisgsison/posts/2905346532879075&#34;&gt;posting some graphs regularly on Facebook.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuesday-april-the-7th&#34;&gt;Tuesday, April the 7th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lockdown/ECQ has officially been extended until the end of April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a grocery run today with my dad. He went to the bank while I did the grocery shopping. There&amp;rsquo;s still a decent number of people in the grocery, despite them limiting entry. Proper social distancing is probably impossible. I mean, if implemented properly, each aisle of the grocery is only wide enough for one person, so that means waiting patiently while the lady in front of you slowly goes through the items on the shelves. I tried to minimize getting too close unnecessarily of course, but it&amp;rsquo;s a challenge. For me, that means I&amp;rsquo;ll be anxious for the next week or so in case any symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small Pizza Hut in the grocery building was open and doing takeout, but I only noticed when I was done, and there was a 30-45 minute wait. Should remember next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of interest: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.4442633659095731&amp;amp;type=3%3Fsfnsn%3Dmo&#34;&gt;Duterte&amp;rsquo;s timeline of incompetence post by JGS-UPD&lt;/a&gt;. I was thinking of incorporating something like this into this diary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word is that the defendants being represented by Chel Diokno after they were subpoena&amp;rsquo;ed by the NBI were investigated &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lianbuan/status/1247465754066178049&#34;&gt;because of a social media post asking why the government doesn&amp;rsquo;t have money for healthcare when they have P2B for a gulfstream jet&lt;/a&gt;. Sounds like suppression of freedom of speech to me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 3764 (+104) cases and 177 (+14) deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wednesday-april-the-8th&#34;&gt;Wednesday, April the 8th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time before 9pm, we were told the president had another address tonight. It&amp;rsquo;s now 11:57 and it hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened. Maybe I should just be thankful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 3870 (+106) cases and 182 (+5) deaths. Low numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;thursday-april-the-9th&#34;&gt;Thursday, April the 9th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president&amp;rsquo;s address actually aired well past midnight, so let&amp;rsquo;s log it here. The content wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything of relevance, more whining about limitations of budget, imploring people to obey, etc. The address also included remarks from people like DOHsec Duque, BudgetSec Dominguez, Chief Implementer Galvez, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I will note is Duque said that &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cnnphilippines/status/1247925887619567616&#34;&gt;the travel ban from China helped slow the disease&lt;/a&gt;. Now, a lot of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cnnphilippines/status/1247925887619567616&#34;&gt;twitter reactions&lt;/a&gt; indicate people think this was a lie, that we had no such China travel ban, basing it on earlier statements of Duque and other palace officials. Now, I dislike this admin of course, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t meant I can be dishonest about them. Officially, we did have a travel ban from China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did Duterte, Duque and other officials say there was no need for a China travel ban and that China may question it?&lt;/em&gt; Yes, this happened in late January, around the time of the first 3 confirmed cases in the country. Citations: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/250506-coronavirus-scare-travel-ban-mainland-chinese-not-for-now-duque&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/1/29/duterte-on-china-travel-ban.html&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did we did have China travel bans instituted?&lt;/em&gt; Also yes, after the first case was confirmed in the country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first from Hubei province only, as of Jan 31. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/1/31/Philippines-novel-coronavirus-China-travel-ban.html&#34;&gt;Citation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a few days later on Feb 2, on all of China (including HK, Taiwan and Macau. The Taiwan part was later rescinded). &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/02/02/20/ph-imposes-travel-ban-on-china-as-new-coronavirus-infections-rise-globally&#34;&gt;Citation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After these bans were instituted, there were questions as to whether they were really strictly being implemented, and there were screenshots and other evidence circulating that there were still flights coming in from China. That there are flights coming in from China should not in itself be relevant, given (a) flights can contain cargo, not just passengers; and (b) flights can contain Filipino citizens being repatriated from China, as these are still allowed to come in, although they have to undergo quarantine. Whether any foreigners slipped through the cracks of this travel ban is unknown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, not even the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.4442633659095731&amp;amp;type=3%3Fsfnsn%3Dmo&#34;&gt;timeline of incompetence post I referenced the other day&lt;/a&gt; includes this information, which is a disservice. In the interest of fairness, I have highlighted these dates and links at the top of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could the government have done more during January and February?&lt;/em&gt; Less factual, but in my opinion also yes. We basically wasted a lot of time in January and February twiddling our thumbs. As far as I can tell, no additional preparations were done in Feb other than the China travel bans. Total travel ban from other countries only happned when the lockdown/ECQ happened in early March, IIRC. (Feel free to correct me if I&amp;rsquo;m wrong.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Were we the first to lockdown, as Duterte implies?&lt;/em&gt; Obviously not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 4076 (+206) cases and 203 (+21) deaths. Biggest deaths jump so far!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it is the Holy Week long weekend, and updating this everyday is getting tiresome, I might skip a few days and maybe resume on Easter Sunday. Unless something outlandish happens, which is not outside the realm of possibility!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-april-the-12th&#34;&gt;Sunday, April the 12th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is Easter Sunday, and coincidentally marks one month since the lockdown/ECQ was originally announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past couple of days, word came out that a certain QC hospital was having trouble with a lack of body bags for handling cadavers. Insider reports say that bodies are piling up and they&amp;rsquo;re running out of places to put them, and that the hospital got an order to underreport the deaths. The DOH got wind of this and immediately issued a statement denying the rumors. The hospital came out with a statement denying they are running out of body bags, but later admitted that their morgue is over capacity because of an unusually high number of unclaimed body bags. Apparently there was an order to hospitals to report deaths first to the DOH before anyone else, so maybe that order was misinterpreted which led to the underreporting deaths rumor. In any case, if one hospital is struggling with deaths, it&amp;rsquo;s likely other hospitals are too, which is worrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents haven&amp;rsquo;t seen their grandkids all together since February, so today we set up a zoom call with everyone so we can enjoy their company. It was expectedly a lot of chaos, but the kids had a lot of energy and we had fun and the grandparents enjoyed the quality time, so that&amp;rsquo;s something. It&amp;rsquo;s highly unlikely we&amp;rsquo;ll get to see each other until late May at the earliest, so this was the next best thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 4648 (+220 today, +572 since Thursday) cases and 297 (+50 today, +94 since Thursday) deaths. This is now the record for most deaths/day, but it&amp;rsquo;s possible that some death reporting may have been delayed due to the holiday weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, cases are now at 1.8 million and deaths more than 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kind of enjoyed the short break, so I think future updates to this diary will be sparse, instead of the daily it was before. Maybe only when significant things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wednesday-april-the-15th&#34;&gt;Wednesday, April the 15th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three days since the last entry. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone out three times, the most for any week since the quarantine began. Twice was for medicine runs for the parental units (one would think they could just combine them into one request, but apparently extenuating circumstances etc), and another was for a grocery run. I still failed to get pizza at the grocery store though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had thought about having food delivered last Easter Sunday, but apparently we decided on it too late, by 4:30pm most of the open restos were no longer delivering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much to report on the government side. Not that things aren&amp;rsquo;t happening, but it&amp;rsquo;s more of the same, mostly. Although the good news is that some LGUs are adding their own testing programs, so hopefully we get a better idea of where we are in the days to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 5453 (+230 today, +805 since Sunday) cases and 349 (+14 today, +52 since Sunday) deaths. The rate of new cases has more or less held steady over the past few days, with about a thousand being added every 3-4 days. The good news is the recovery count has caught up to the death count, today it&amp;rsquo;s at 353. This is excellent because it was probably only a week or so ago that the there were about twice as many deaths as recoveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;friday-april-the-17th&#34;&gt;Friday, April the 17th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, a resolution by majority of senators asking the health secretary to resign came out. The signatories were mostly pro-admin senators too! Duterte quickly rejected the requested. Today, the socioeconomic planning secretary and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rapplerdotcom/status/1251045773443166208?s=21&#34;&gt;NEDA head offered his resignation&lt;/a&gt;, partly due to personal reasons and partly due to &amp;ldquo;differences in philosophy with a few fellow cabinet members&amp;rdquo;. The timing is weird and makes me think that he resigned due to Duque not resigning, but that&amp;rsquo;s pure speculation lol. The more probable reason is that the other cabinet members don&amp;rsquo;t agree with his recommendation to try to end the lockdown quickly? We can only speculate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1852785&#34;&gt;entire sitio in Cebu is now considered infected&lt;/a&gt; after mass testing found a large number of asymptomatic cases. Out of 53 confirmed positives, 51 were asymptomatic. That&amp;rsquo;s a troubling rate, it may mean our actual number of confirmed cases may be up to 25 times more than previously thought. (Don&amp;rsquo;t quote me on that, this is a single data point.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 5878 (+218 today, +425 since Wednesday) cases, 387 (+25 today, +38 since Wednesday) deaths and 487 (+52) recoveries. Recoveries increasing faster than deaths, so that&amp;rsquo;s promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-april-the-19th&#34;&gt;Sunday, April the 19th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard 6am mass via the TV. ABS-CBN broadcasts one, I think it&amp;rsquo;s held in their studio. The celebrant was Fr. Jerry Orbos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two more weeks of this, at least. Some people are hoping for partial lifting of the ECQ in May, but there&amp;rsquo;s also the possibility of tighter restrictions, as the president has threatened. Rumors and feelers point in either direction being possible. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 6259 (+172 today, +381 since Friday) cases, 409 (+12 today, +22 since Friday) deaths and 572 (+56 today, +85 since Friday) recoveries. Recoveries growing faster than deaths for the past 3 days, and confirmed cases seemingly tapering off? Seems a bit too good to be true? Again, we&amp;rsquo;ll see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;friday-april-the-24th&#34;&gt;Friday, April the 24th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, the government officially extended the ECQ in Metro Manila (and some other areas with high Covid19 incidence) up to May 15th. Not surprising, especially given the rumors and the trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago, there was this altercation at a quezon city checkpoint where cops ended up shooting and killing a mentally unstable ex-military person after a short standoff. Supposedly because he made a motion as if to draw something from his bag. The police claim he had a gun, but the witnesses and relatives say otherwise. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of different videos of the encounter too. The PNP initially cleared the officer in the encounter, but today it was announced that homicide charges would be filed. It&amp;rsquo;s a good step towards accountability, but I&amp;rsquo;m skeptical it would lead anywhere. But more importantly - cops really need to get over this mentality of preferring the use of lethal force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 7192 cases (+211 today, +933 since Sunday), 477 deaths (+15 today, +68 since Sunday), and 762 (+40 today, +190 since Sunday) recoveries. It&amp;rsquo;s great that recoveries are still outpacing deaths, but I&amp;rsquo;m worried about the number of still unresolved active cases. Around two weeks ago, there were a bit 4000 cases, but as of today, we only have around 1200 deaths+recoveries, so there&amp;rsquo;s around 2800 cases that are serious enough to still be unresolved after 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-april-the-26th&#34;&gt;Sunday, April the 26th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three more weeks of this. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I mind staying at home. But I miss being able to go out and walk around and eat outside freely, even alone. Also, I could use a haircut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only went out once this week, for groceries. We tried to buy a bit more than usual, hoping to reduce the number of times we need to go out. We also celebrated a couple of birthdays in the family, through a zoom call, complete with the grandkids blowing on a candle from across the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 7579 cases (+285 today, +487 since Friday), 501 deaths (+7 today, +24 since Friday), and 862 (+70 today, +100 since Friday) recoveries. Worldwide, we are nearing 3M cases and have passed 200,000 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-may-the-3rd&#34;&gt;Sunday, May the 3rd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officially, this is the 3rd calendar month of quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couple of days ago we got a second tranche of relief goods from the LGU, mostly canned fish things and some rice. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been out all week, but word is that they are being a bit more strict and there are more cops policing places like the wet market etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of tonight, we are at 9223 cases (+295 today, +1644 for the week), 607 deaths (+4 today, +106 for the week), and 1214 (+90 today, +352 for the week) recoveries. Recoveries vastly outpacing deaths is good news, but the number of cases continues to rise linearly without any slowdown in sight, probably due to testing limits I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll see if NCR manages to leave ECQ after the 15th, but even then we&amp;rsquo;re still only going into General Community Quarantine (GCQ) which is definitely not a &amp;ldquo;back to normal&amp;rdquo; scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, there have been an additional 500k cases and 45k deaths over the past week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sunday-may-the-10th&#34;&gt;Sunday, May the 10th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was mostly an experiment in making a single continuous post that would be updated periodically. At this point (well over 10,000 words in this single post), I&amp;rsquo;m ready to admit this has been an unwieldy experiment. I will still continue the covid19 updates and thoughts, but probably as separate notes and posts. You can follow succeeding entries (including one for today) via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/covid19/&#34;&gt;covid19 tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be continued&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The Costs of Corruption
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/11/costs-of-corruption/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/11/costs-of-corruption/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A quick follow-up to something I mentioned in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/11/laws-not-men/&#34;&gt;yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a cultural problem too. Even we the citizens have little respect for rules and laws and try to skip around them when we can. This is why we have fixers, and connections, and patronage. We trade on favors to get us out of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if needed to be said, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t saying that literally every single person participates in fixing and patronage to get around the rules. Most probably only a minority ever do so. The majority try to just keep their heads down and live their lives, and in doing so, they tolerate those who do participate in such corruption of the rules. This is what I meant, that we as a culture, are too tolerant of such activities, even sometimes praising those who manage to circumvent rules or laws as &amp;ldquo;madiskarte&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tangential story time: Some time ago, I was visiting with people in another area, and the conversation turned to one of the people present who had run for public office (councilor) some years ago, and he was asked why he didn&amp;rsquo;t win. His answer: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wala e, mas malakas maglagay yung kalaban.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;  (The opponent was better at bribing voters.) The response elicited laughter from those around. Whether the response was based on fact or merely a speculative joke, the way it is discussed so casually and even among people they barely knew (me) is reflective of how we have normalized corruption in our society. There is no shame associated with it, it is talked about openly as a fact of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to say, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to make a scene, I&amp;rsquo;ll just keep quiet and live my life, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be a good citizen and I won&amp;rsquo;t participate in corruption myself,&amp;rdquo; but even if you do so, systemic corruption still affects you. Even if you&amp;rsquo;re an informal worker who doesn&amp;rsquo;t pay taxes; the cost of corruption isn&amp;rsquo;t only in lost taxes, it&amp;rsquo;s in lost public services and opportunities lost to connections and patronage. Normalized corruption also means more rules need to be introduced to rein it in, and more rules means more people want to try to break those rules, leading to some kind of vicious cycle. The increased red tape brought about by corruption even feeds the beast and inconveniences the rest of us who just want to be good citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given our current leadership, I had been thinking recently about what an actual good administration would look like. In my view, the point of presidency shouldn&amp;rsquo;t just be to execute the laws, but to provide an example of leadership for the people, in that he/she inspires the people to be better. I don&amp;rsquo;t yet know how it can be done, but for any one president to be able to turn this country around, he needs to be able to inspire the citizenry to not just be good citizens, but to be better than that. A great president will need to understand that the success of his term doesn&amp;rsquo;t depend solely on him and his appointees, but rather on each citizen taking a stand against the normalized corruption in our culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be a bit difficult for a president limited to a six year term, certainly a lot of political will is needed. And not the kind that you &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/11/10155101341788912/&#34;&gt;squander on political favors&lt;/a&gt;. A tall order, but we as a country should be better for the trying. Again, maybe someday.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Laws Not Men
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/11/laws-not-men/</link>
            <pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2019 02:47:57 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/11/laws-not-men/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;In yet another example of what is wrong with this country, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/11/21/1970619/pnp-begins-enforcing-vape-ban-duterte-warns-courts&#34;&gt;PNP are planning to arrest vape users&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=&#34;https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2019/11/19/Rodrigo-Duterte-vape-ban.html&#34;&gt;Duterte&amp;rsquo;s directive&lt;/a&gt;, despite there actually being yet no law or executive order banning vaping. Thus, the arrests are meaningless and merely another form of harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PNP spokesman Brig. Gen. Bernard Banac explained that while violators would be apprehended, they would be released immediately after the incident is recorded in the police blotter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody knows that the rules for this so-called ban are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferdinand Rodrigo, president of Vapers Alliance Philippines, told “The Chiefs” last night on Cignal TV’s One News that they wanted to seek clarification from Malacañang on the basis for the ban and its parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodrigo said their members across the country reported having police teams entering vape shops yesterday and telling them to shut down, which was not how they understood Duterte’s order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t vape, and I don&amp;rsquo;t actually know people who vape, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether or not vaping is bad for people (though it seems like a terrible idea), but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I can agree with what is basically a &amp;ldquo;rule by whim&amp;rdquo;, with unknown basis and parameters. The police are following along with this basically because the president said so, and to defy him is to incur his wrath. And the president even threatened the judiciary not to interfere with his whims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some analogy here to how the brutal war on drugs is conducted. The president threatens to kill drug users, and the police silently take that as an implicit order. There is no actual paperwork ordering killings, but wink wink nudge nudge, the police get to infer what the president want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shows how much weight we as a nation give to laws - barely any at all. Laws are treated as little more than suggestions, and law enforcers can implement whatever they damn want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authoritarians love ruling in this manner, and their supporters like to claim it&amp;rsquo;s because they &amp;ldquo;get things done&amp;rdquo; without all the bureaucratic runaround that legislation requires. Getting rid of due process in order to get good things done quickly seems like a reasonable idea on the surface, but due process is there for a reason, and if you can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to uphold it when you&amp;rsquo;re doing good, how will you be bothered to uphold it when you&amp;rsquo;re abusing power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a cultural problem too. Even we the citizens have little respect for rules and laws and try to skip around them when we can. This is why we have fixers, and connections, and patronage. We trade on favors to get us out of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, we don&amp;rsquo;t always have the best laws, and enforcement is always hard, and justice is often elusive especially to the poor. But that should be used as a reason to improve the laws and to improve enforcement and to improve the justice system, not as a reason to skip past the law altogether and just do whatever the men in power so decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe someday we&amp;rsquo;ll get there, but right now we are decidedly governed not by laws, but by men.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Grab Overpricing

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;So the Philippine Competition Commission recently &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philstar.com/business/2019/11/19/1969865/grab-fined-p23-million-overcharging&#34;&gt;fined rideshare provider Grab P23M for overcharging their customers&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently only P5M of that is meant to go back to the affected riders, which seems like a piddly amount considering the number of riders in the Philippines. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how of that I actually get credited back, if any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab pricing has been steadily increasing since Uber exited the market early last year. The other day Grab wanted to charge me a bit over P400 for a 13km ride to a commercial area, which seemed insane. I ended up just going out and taking a taxi back and forth, and that cost me a total of P500 both ways. So Grab was pricing the ride at around 60% higher than the equivalent taxi ride. This was on a Sunday afternoon (typically the lightest traffic day of the week), and the ride took only around 30 mins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pricing was never this bad with Uber; looking at my records, my most expensive Uber ride was for P412 pesos to Taguig, and that was a 21km ride that took an hour and a half!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel that Grab&amp;rsquo;s really pushing the pricing due to their monopoly. We were promised that there would be new entrants coming in to compete with Grab, but other than motorcycle service Angkas, none have actually come out. And so for now, we suffer their predatory pricing. Hopefully the PCC is more able to keep them in check in the days to come.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Hong Kong is on fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months now, protests and unrests, led mainly by university students, have &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hong_Kong_protests&#34;&gt;wracked the city.&lt;/a&gt; Initially in response to a controversial China-backed extradition bill, it is also believed to be fueled by political and social inequality and interference by the Chinese government. As the months went on, the stakes have escalated in the wake of widespread anger at the way the police are brutally cracking down on protests. Many incidents of violence have been reported, mainly from the police, but some from the protestors as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not from Hong Kong, but I admit some fondness for the British territory - I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/hong-kong&#34;&gt;travelled there a few times&lt;/a&gt; and I worked for a Hong-Kong based company for more than a decade, so I know quite a number of people working there even now. I was hesitant to write down my thoughts on the current crisis, as things were moving and escalating quickly, and there was a good chance that whatever I write might be overtaken by events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stand in support of the protestors, and I am hopeful that they succeed, although I am not optimistic. They are standing against China, the fascist juggernaut of the modern world, and the odds of victory are low. This week, the police have laid siege to university campuses, and recently the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/hong-kong-university-campus-like-a-warzone-as-night-time-battle-breaks-out-20191113-p53a1f.html&#34;&gt;police have evacuated mainland students&lt;/a&gt; from HK, which seems to me as an indication that we are nearing some kind of tipping point, something akin to 1989&amp;rsquo;s Tiananmen massacre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The international response has been tepid at best, although both houses of the US legislature have passed or are preparing resolutions condemning the police brutality. Private companies have been embroiled in controversy for censoring efforts to voice support for the protestors, in a blatant example of how capitalism will not stand in support of freedom if it contradicts the bottom line. The gamer-relevant example is of course Blizzard, who suspended and censored Hearthstone pro Blitzchung for delivering this post&amp;rsquo;s title during a livestream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong protests are perhaps a microcosm of many of the problems faced by modern society: inequality, authoritarianism, state surveillance, police brutality, the indifference of capitalism, and even China itself. As the decade winds to a close, perhaps the HK revolution and its eventual outcome (whether that be the successful repression of the protests by China or a full-blown rebellion) provide a stark preview of what to expect in the decade to come. Indeed, Hong Kong is the revolution of our time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, the online gaming community has been more supportive, appropriating Mei from Overwatch as a symbol of the protests. (Image source: reddit)&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The Climate Strikes Back
</title>

            <pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;This past weekend was supposedly some global climate strike, led by young activists. I don&amp;rsquo;t actually know if there was a local counterpart to these activities, as obviously I did not participate. Good for the young though. Between the climate activists and HK protesters, the modern youth still give me some hope for humanity. Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna step into the melee here and start rambling about things I may or may not be fully informed about, feel free to correct me or tell me I&amp;rsquo;m being an idiot or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to be able to resolve climate change? Not so much. The science is irrefutable, and all signs indicate to us being well past the point of &amp;ldquo;can we stop it?&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;can we mitigate its effects?&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I&amp;rsquo;m pessimistic, but the way the world works lately, it is difficult to be optimistic all of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did read a couple of interesting twitter threads about it over the weekend. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rcolvile/status/1174957970431496192&#34;&gt;first thread&lt;/a&gt; discusses how the current climate activist movement, epitomized by 16-year old Greta Thunberg, is too extremist in their views. I was unable to verify, but one of the examples was that many of the activists reject technological solutions such as carbon recapture and economics/market incentive-based approaches. The perception of some commenters in the thread is even that the movement is a thinly-veiled cover to promote socialistic ideals. And indeed, some &lt;a href=&#34;https://globalclimateconvergence.org/climate-strike/&#34;&gt;climate strike demands&lt;/a&gt; include universal healthcare and education, things largely perceived as socialist policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thread discusses why one might be against market-based approaches: there is a sentiment that the current crisis is brought about by markets and industries&amp;rsquo; overreach, so it feels weird to be relying on those very same markets and industries to bail us from our situation, because in a way that would make them &amp;ldquo;heroes&amp;rdquo; and let them &amp;ldquo;get away with&amp;rdquo; the vast damage they have done in the first place. (I wish I could find the link for this second thread, though it is an admittedly lesser point, I am surely not giving it justice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously not every group has the same demands, and citation needed, etc etc, but the perception of these movements including demands that are ideologically extreme contribute to making it difficult to save the planet. The truth is that everybody, everywhere should be doing anything and everything they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am largely in agreement that the current climate crisis is brought about by human excess, and can even partly be blamed on runaway capitalism and consumerism. In my head the analogy for this is something like a person who pushes and abuses his body to do all this fun stuff and then the doctor tells him he&amp;rsquo;s dying and he needs to change his lifestyle in order to become healthier, but he&amp;rsquo;s really set in his ways so that&amp;rsquo;s something really hard for him to do, so instead he grasps at straws and follows miracle cures or looks for technological solutions to avoid the lifestlye change.. And that&amp;rsquo;s where we are now, we pretty much abused and extracted as much as we can from the planet to feed our runaway growth and now we&amp;rsquo;re hitting the limits of the ecosystem and the ecosystem is starting to fight back against us like the parasites we are. And while the real solution requires a severe lifestyle change - we have to give up things like meat and airplanes and all that - that&amp;rsquo;s not something we are willing to do. So we grasp at straws and hope that somehow science or economics can save us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a self-proclaimed man of science, I still do think that our best hope of salvation lies in some sort of as-yet-foreseen innovation. But in the meantime, we can&amp;rsquo;t just twiddle our thumbs, we need that lifestyle change anyway, in light of our ever increasing population, if we are to continue to survive in this world. Something about our way of life has to give, in order for it to be sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say this, though many of the prescribed changes are quite difficult for me as well. I suspect my personal carbon footprint is below average, mainly because I don&amp;rsquo;t travel as much especially compared to the average Metro Manila denizen. I don&amp;rsquo;t drive, and I don&amp;rsquo;t take vehicles except maybe 2 or 3 times a week at most, and I use public transpo when I can and will often opt to walk whenever it&amp;rsquo;s feasible. (I do take plane rides like 2-4 times a year, but I also know people who fly a lot more often than me.) Where I fall short would be giving up meat (or even reducing intake). Since my diet is largely meat, this is mostly a nonstarter for me, so I implore people to eat less meat on my behalf lol. Or at least cows, cows are the worst, or so I heard. I&amp;rsquo;m also pretty bad at conserving power, given that I often leave my computing machines online and idle just for the convenience of not having to boot again. Such is life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it can feel like my personal effort doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter, because people like me living in third-world countries aren&amp;rsquo;t the most egregious offenders in terms of damage to the climate. We can all do our small parts, but the larger effects can only come from the leading countries of the world, and is here that my doubts about their capability to bring about meaningful change come into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, we can&amp;rsquo;t fight the planet. If we are living in excess, the planet will find a way to humble us for our excesses. The question is moving forward, how much of our modern lifestyle can survive this crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I remember when playing the original version of Civilization &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/12/ancient-pc-gaming/&#34;&gt;back in the day&lt;/a&gt;, the &amp;ldquo;most advanced&amp;rdquo; form of government was Democracy, with the only downside of it being you can&amp;rsquo;t declare war (because you had a senate that would stop you.) The other available forms of government were typically not very useful, but Democracy massively increased your trade output, so most often I would build the Pyramids (a wonder which allowed switching to any government immediately and without penalty), and spend the rest of the game toggling between Democracy and Despotism (for when I wanted to go to war).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made the game heavily slanted in favor of Western-style democracies, which was understandable for that time period. Around that era, the Soviet Union had just fallen, and the liberal democracy practiced by the United States, the one remaining superpower, became the shining example of a successful government that brought propserity to its citizens. I think that having grown up in this era and having been exposed to a lot of American culture (via TV and games and so forth) has led to my general bias in favor of liberal democracy and the values associated with it - freedom, equality, civil liberties, human rights, due process, checks and balances, separation of powers, and so on. (I cannot say the same is true for other people in my generation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, the modern versions of Civilization have matured in terms of how they handle governments, recognizing that modern governments have different approaches that are not necessarily represented by &amp;ldquo;democracy&amp;rdquo;. Civ 6 presents three choices for modern governments: Democracy, Communism, and Fascism; Civ 5 lets you choose between ideologies: Freedom, Order, or Autocracy. Perhaps this is a reflection of modern geopolitics, where not only is the United States teetering on the brink of authoritarianism, despite being the lone superpower, but those daring to challenge its hegemony are leaning more towards authoritarian governments as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from America&amp;rsquo;s traditional enemies like Russia and Iran, the starkest challenge comes from China, the juggernaut of Asia. Perhaps the ultimate counterexample to the idea that liberal democracy is the key to prosperity, China has been able to bring an economic boom to its citizens, leveraging the weight of a billion-person size market, all while retaining the trappings of power centralized in the state instead of the people. Censorship, propaganda, and adherence to the party are the norm, and those who dare speak out against the party are punished viciously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about all of this after a recent discussion with some Duterte supporters over at &lt;a href=&#34;https://reddit.com/r/philippines&#34;&gt;r/PH on reddit&lt;/a&gt;. The arguments in favor of the Duterte administration seem to stem around seeing him as a leader that &amp;ldquo;gets things done&amp;rdquo; (in quotes because I&amp;rsquo;m not sure quantifiably that he is getting things done more than other presidents), without regard for the damage to liberal values such as human rights, due process, checks and balances, and so on. Indeed even during the 2016 elections you could see some internet commentary stating that the problem with the country was that we had &amp;ldquo;too much freedom&amp;rdquo;, as if freedom were not an ideal to be aspired to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this light, the tendency of this admin to capitulate to China has an ideological angle as well, because China is the epitome of getting things done despite the cost to civil liberties, and of the state accumulating all power onto itself. It is disturbingly a trend not only in the Philippines, but even in a number of Western nations, where far-right parties with tendencies towards extreme nationalism and authoritarianism are gaining steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been of the opinion that the world mostly exists in a state of trying to find balance; most trends wax and wane, trying to find the optimal equilibrium in which to settle. I worry that perhaps liberal democracy&amp;rsquo;s peak days have come and gone, and we are now on the brink on an era where authoritarianism gains ground. I had always hoped that our future was somehow leading to something like a Star Trek-like utopia, but there are plenty of other potential sci-fi future scenarios, not all of them pleasant. We can only hope that things get better before they get worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;m not a political science expert or anything, so probably I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly using some of these terms accurately, feel free to educate me in the comments if you like.)&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;The results are disappointing, but that&amp;rsquo;s only because we expected better. Historically, those who have made it into the Senate did so mostly on name recognition. What does it matter if Diokno had the best resume of all the candidates, if many of the voters did not know who he was? How could he compete against someone who appeared on a hit primetime TV series right up until the start of the campaign period?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I think, things were simpler before we were woke. For me, at least. When I was younger I didn&amp;rsquo;t care much about politics. Oh of course like everybody, I got riled up about Estrada&amp;rsquo;s impeachment trial and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2005/07/gloriagate-now-is-not-the-time/&#34;&gt;Gloria&amp;rsquo;s election scandals&lt;/a&gt;, but back then I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much awareness on who the senators were, what party they were aligned with, who were the senate president or the speaker of the house, etc. Not in-depth as I&amp;rsquo;ve done during the more recent elections. Even back then there was a general sense of how dirty the elections and our politicians were, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much outrage in me then. Not yet at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I started &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2004/05/halalan-2004/&#34;&gt;casting my vote in 2004&lt;/a&gt;, I certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t legal for the prior elections in &amp;lsquo;98 and I don&amp;rsquo;t remember voting in the midterms in &amp;lsquo;01. At first I was like &amp;ldquo;Okay, I cast my vote, that&amp;rsquo;s my civic duty, yay&amp;rdquo; and was done with it, but as time went by awareness started to grow. As the PH internet has matured, information about the candidates became more easily available, and with that came the eventual and repeated disappointment with who our electorate actually gave the victories to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cut to today, and the vicious cycle repeats. Disheartening results that make no rational sense whatsoever. As if elections were ever decided rationally. And so it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many are being down on those who express an intention to migrate because of their disappointment. I can&amp;rsquo;t blame those who feel this way. It would be better to stay and fight the good fight of course, but it&amp;rsquo;s never that easy. People can get tired of politics, and I know that&amp;rsquo;s what certain parties would want - to beat us into submission by bludgeoning us with these terrible politicians and their dirty ways - but let people be tired and let people express their frustrations, it&amp;rsquo;s healthier that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m envious of those who chose to stay &amp;ldquo;unwoke&amp;rdquo;, that is, unconcerned with modern-day political issues, and just stick to living their daily lives. Like I said, times were simpler then. You only worried about your own problems. You shook your fist at the taxman and the shitty government service but at the end of the day did nothing about it. It&amp;rsquo;s selfish, but it can be understandable. Life is not always easy, and not all are accorded the privilege of worrying about things greater than themselves. All the more reason for us who have that privilege to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am tempted to just step back from it all, back to those simpler times. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent too much energy worrying about this country, let others take over now. I won&amp;rsquo;t be personally affected too much - I&amp;rsquo;m not likely to be killed in a drug bust, I&amp;rsquo;m not one of the poor that his cronies can bully around, I don&amp;rsquo;t lose anything if they let China take our islands, I can survive any economic fallout (probably), I have enough sources of real information even if they choke the press, I have the option of migrating if things get too bad, etc. There is a part of me that is just like &amp;ldquo;bahala na kayo diyan, just let me watch my movies and play my video games in peace!&amp;rdquo; But who am I kidding? The odds that I can stay out of it for long are low, but perhaps a short respite is in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things were simpler before we were woke. Unfortunately, that&amp;rsquo;s a genie we can&amp;rsquo;t put back in the bottle. Being woke is exhausting. Rest, regroup, recover, and hopefully have the energy to come back and fight again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rants were brought to you by the letters disappointment and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;The PH senatorial and local elections are on Monday. I almost didn&amp;rsquo;t want to write the usual election post, mostly because I was annoyed with and tired of the electorate and the politicians and the system and all that. But we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t give in to despair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often when choosing who to vote, it will be difficult to find candidates who align perfectly with your values. You make compromises to prioritize those issues you think are more important. You settle on lesser evils to try to stave off the worse ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be scary sometimes to make a judgment that &amp;ldquo;this candidate is great&amp;rdquo;, because you can&amp;rsquo;t really know a person right? And these candidates, you only see a sliver of their lives, what they project publicly, so it can be difficult to judge. But at least you should be openly rejecting those who are already projecting poor values: supporting murders, blind support for the administration, plunderers, criminals, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the most important issue facing the country right now is the need to provide a decent check and balance in the legislative branch, so for this reason, I will vote all of the Otso Diretso senatorial slate. Some of them aren&amp;rsquo;t the best choices, but the administration candidates are far worse. Even if you are not inclined to support the opposition, I strongly suggest you consider Chel Diokno. He&amp;rsquo;s the best candidate I&amp;rsquo;ve seen since the late Raul Roco. Gutoc, Alejano, and Aquino are the next best ones. Hilbay has had some flaky opinions, but he&amp;rsquo;s smart without a doubt, and a bar topnotcher. Roxas had a poor stint sa executive branch, but he was ok sa legislative. Macalintal and Tanada are the ones I have the least info about, but again, opposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am considering leaving the remaining 4 slots open, will probably decide on election day. The pickings are slim. If only we had an option for downvotes instead, I could vote down the really bad choices like Marcos, Go, Revilla, dela Rosa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local elections: The Quezon City mayoral choices aren&amp;rsquo;t very good. Belmonte has an air of incompetence. But her opponent Crisologo is as a friend described &amp;ldquo;an evil Ilocano warlord stuck in the 70s&amp;rdquo;, so in the choice between incompetent and evil, we have no choice but to choose incompetence. (There is a third candidate, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think he has a chance.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I will skip voting for the vice mayor and councilor slots. I have no info on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the QC sixth district, I&amp;rsquo;m lucky that our district has a liberal party incumbent who has made some house votes I agree with, so for me it&amp;rsquo;s still Kit Belmonte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Party list: Eh, IDK anymore. Maybe Akbayan or Magdalo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I don&amp;rsquo;t have very strong opinions this time around, especially on the local level. I am not super optimistic about this election, as I suspect the electorate may very well disappoint me yet again. But still, duty is duty. And so we hope for the best while fearing the worst.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;via &lt;a href=&#34;https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/b87waa/the_supreme_courts_conservatives_just_legalized/ejwf8j5/&#34;&gt;/u/haveanicedayreddit on reddit&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very fact that our nation&amp;rsquo;s highest court is weighing in on the amount of cruelty we can inflict upon those we put to death suggests we&amp;rsquo;ve taken a wrong turn. And yet the very subject invites some to ask why we should even care about the feelings of rapists or murderers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s why we need to care. We need to care because our justice system demands it. Regardless of where we stand on the appropriateness of a death penalty, we must agree that the administration of any punishment must be done in the absence of passion or cruelty. Whether we&amp;rsquo;re putting someone to death, locking them up for shoplifting, interrogating them in a criminal case or holding them while we determine their legal residency status, we must be adamant in our commitment to do so in a way that&amp;rsquo;s free from resentment or rage… or amusement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this so important? It is important because when we allow anger and apathy to seep into our justice system we begin to do unjust things. We keep prisoners in tents whose temperatures reach 114 degrees. We lock them in solitary confinement and laugh as we watch them die of a seizure. We surround them at a traffic stop and kick them in the stomach and face while they lay handcuffed and helpless. We end up with a Supreme Court justice who erupts in a blind rage when his fitness is questioned. We end up with a president who admonishes police not to &amp;ldquo;go so easy&amp;rdquo; on suspects when apprehending them, a president who leads cheers of &amp;ldquo;lock them up&amp;rdquo; whenever he brings up a political opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We lose our way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very existence of a criminal justice system is an agreement where the public allows its government to suspend – or even eliminate – some of the rights outlined in our constitution. In doing so we expect our government to exercise this power with the utmost care and respect, even for those accused or convicted of the most serious offenses. Because to do otherwise invites vengeance into our system. Vengeance and justice cannot coexist; one will always replace the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of how in our country, there are politicians advocating for the death penalty in response to the supposed drug menace, when there has generally been &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/04/30/theres-still-no-evidence-that-executions-deter-criminals/?utm_term=.55ee4ef75738&#34;&gt;no evidence to show the death penalty deters crime&lt;/a&gt;. The last time we had the death penalty, only one convict was ever executed, the country did not have the stomach for it. I imagine (based only on the perceived behavior of our politicos) that those advocating for the death penalty do not really have deterrence in mind, but rather punishment - they wish to cruelly punish the offender to satisfy the bloodlust of the populace. i.e. Vengeance, not justice.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Daily news reading is a habit I inherited from my father, who tends to read the morning newspaper at the dining table during breakfast every morning and most other meals as well, even to this day. Some would say a bad habit, especially when among company. These days my morning newspaper consists mostly of Flipboard articles, then the local newspaper during lunch and dinner if I am at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from mealtime readings, I also regularly take breaks to check what is going on in social media and my RSS reader. I am, to invent a word, hyperinformed. As soon as something happens, I like to know about it. A bus exploded on EDSA the other day and I told my parents about it before it came up on local news TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be a bit of information overflow. And some even say that for the sake of our own mental health, we should avoid consuming the news too regularly. Especially these days, when the news is full of negativity: natural disasters, politicians being stupid or corrupt, crimes and atrocities, invasions of privacy, hatred, racism, war, poverty, and so on. The world can be dark, and news tends to highlight the negative, and consuming it too regularly may begin to affect our worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a desire to stay informed of course, I still consider that a duty as a responsible citizen. To know what issues are being faced by people in our country and in the world, so that we may help craft the decisions to solve those issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps regular consumption is not so necessary. It might be a good idea to shift to some kind of weekly or monthly schedule of news consumption, instead of daily. The problem would be finding sources that can sum up the past week or month&amp;rsquo;s news, distill it into those things important to know. This might be challenging, especially for local news. But maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll start looking around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then what would I read during breakfast?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The EDSA revolution was a promise. &amp;ldquo;Never again.&amp;rdquo; They cried. But the scope was never clear. Never again to a dictator? Okay, but if not that, then what? What of corruption, of patronage, of poverty, of oligarchy, of ignorance? We thought the job finished and patted ourselves on the back and assumed everything would go back to normal, without regard to what &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; needed to be. The same evils took different guises, and today the forces of darkness and dictatorship are almost close to fulfilling their return. EDSA was a promise, but only half-fulfilled, and the half left unfulfilled came back to haunt us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not super optimistic about the upcoming senatorial elections locally, the Filipino public has disappointed me far too often perhaps. I&amp;rsquo;ll still vote (if I can - I may be out of country at the time), but I no longer feel as strongly compelled to try to talk other people into making good decisions, not as I did back in 2016. Perhaps this time we would be pleasantly surprised? Hope springs eternal.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaking_truth_to_power&#34;&gt;Speaking truth to power&lt;/a&gt; is a non-violent political tactic, employed by dissidents against the received wisdom or propaganda of governments they regard as oppressive, authoritarian or an ideocracy. I always had the general sense of it before, but not that it was specifically for use against oppressive or authoritarian governments. It is believed the phrase has origins in a Quaker pamphlet published in 1955.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of this phrase today and looked it up because it seems relevant again recently, at least in the Philippines. Recently Maria Ressa, the head of the online news site Rappler, was arrested at dusk (so no bail could be set), on charges of cyberlibel, for an online article published before cyberlibel became a crime. Ostensibly, the state&amp;rsquo;s rationale is that there was a minor edit to the article after the cyberlibel law was passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m struggling to think of any instance where a state authority arrested journalists without the intent to silence criticism. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying there aren&amp;rsquo;t any - there probably are - but probably such instances don&amp;rsquo;t get much publicity precisely because they are normal functions of the state. For this instance, it feels very much as just the next step in targetted harassment against those who, as they say, speak truth to power. I remember one of the pork barrel senators saying during the launch of his senatorial campaign that he was the victim of &amp;ldquo;selective justice&amp;rdquo; (which is weird because it still implies he was guilty, just that other people were guilty too). I&amp;rsquo;m hoping in some interview someone has the balls to ask the senatorial candidates whether they think Trillianes or Ressa have been victims of &amp;ldquo;selective justice&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro-admin partisans of course will just say &amp;ldquo;rule of law&amp;rdquo; etc, which they like to do when someone they dislike is being targetted, but not when say, suspected criminals are killed by vigilantes or under suspicious circumstances by the police. Most probably in their heart of hearts they know exactly what is going on here, and they either approve of it wholeheartedly or view it as a necessary compromise in their pursuit of what they believe to be good for the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to avoid being too political in this blog, maybe sticking with the occasional rant or election-related personal leanings post. But with the climate these days, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that&amp;rsquo;s resposible. Those of us who are able to speak out on our platforms, no matter how small, don&amp;rsquo;t we have a responsibility to speak truth to power?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Companies banned because of their governments

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/02/companies-banned-because-of-their-governments/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;In late 2017, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-USA-cyber-kaspersky/trump-signs-into-law-u-s-government-ban-on-kaspersky-lab-software-idUSKBN1E62V4&#34;&gt;US moved to ban Kaspersky antivirus from use by federal agencies&lt;/a&gt;, because of suspected influence from the Russian government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2018, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/countries-banning-huawei-181206130850129.html&#34;&gt;the US and other countries have either banned or are considering banning the Chinese tech giant Huawei and its telecoms products&lt;/a&gt;, for security reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both companies are under scrutiny for their perceived ties to their governments, both of which happen to have authoritarian leanings. From a certain POV, the bannings may be unfair, as they are &amp;ldquo;preventive&amp;rdquo; in nature, i.e. punishment is given preemptively before any offence is discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to me because it shows that being under the sway of an authoritarian leadership can be considered a competitive disadvantage in the international marketplace. Trust in the Russian and Chinese governments is low (internationally), which affects the corporations working out of those states. While they may not be doing anything nefarious now, the fact that these states &lt;em&gt;can possibly&lt;/em&gt; influence these companies is already a considerable risk, especially for government&amp;rsquo;s mission-critical systems given the geopolitical history and past behavior of those states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even here in the Philippines, there is some level of mistrust against the entry of the supposed third telco, which is a consortium of which China Telecom is a part, mainly for security concerns as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, this distrust should not be limited to Russia and China. For example, the US also has a history of requesting information from tech companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter, and so on. So in theory these US-based companies should not be trusted with communication platforms, etc. The difference is that the US-based companies have a stronger history of independence from the US government. They also regularly release &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/18/facebooks-government-data-requests-continue-to-rise/&#34;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; about how the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnet.com/news/google-reports-all-time-high-of-government-data-requests/&#34;&gt;US and other governments request data&lt;/a&gt; from them. These are exercises to build trust from the consumer base, to emphasize their independence from any one state authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kaspersky ban was a relatively small deal, I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure if it affected Kaspersky at all. But the Huawei (and potentially ZTE as well) ban would be more important as Huawei is a very large telecoms company currently. It will be interesting to see how they move forward - will they take actions to assert their independence from the Chinese state and improve international trust? Or will they double down and have China resort to diplomatic pressure?&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;In a recent episode of &lt;em&gt;The Orville&lt;/em&gt;, captain Ed Mercer of the Union is stuck debating with a member of the Krill, a fanatic and xenophobic race in conflict with Earth&amp;rsquo;s multi-species Planetary Union. He says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Look, from what we&amp;rsquo;ve seen, when planets first achieve space travel and they venture out into the galaxy and discover that they&amp;rsquo;re just one single species among a vast diversity of lifeforms, they usually react in one of two ways: they embrace and adapt to the fact that they&amp;rsquo;re no longer the center of the universe, or they ratchet up their xenophobia. &amp;hellip; I know fear when I see it. You&amp;rsquo;re afraid to face the fact that your superiority may just be a comforting myth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shows like &lt;em&gt;The Orville&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; (from which the first show is inspired) paint the future of humanity with an optimistic brush, a future where we react in the first way mentioned above, we meet up with other spacefaring species and learn to coexist and even form federaions with them. And the intolerant xenophobic aliens are cast as the aggressive antagonists, a problem to be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the current state of affairs, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit hard to be this optimistic about humanity&amp;rsquo;s future. Imagine if first contact with an alien species happened today, with the dominant (yet spiraling) superpower presided over by an openly racist president, and a wave of far-right nationalism across the world facing migrants everywhere. How welcoming would we be towards an entirely alien species, when we can&amp;rsquo;t even be welcoming to our own kind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s been fiction that covered this angle (&lt;em&gt;District 9&lt;/em&gt; comes to mind), but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure there&amp;rsquo;s been any that covered the entire transition - from first contact to xenophobic hate groups to somehow leading to planetary unification and eventually to a Star Trek-like future. It would at least be an interesting story, and if we can speculate about how to bring that future about, it might even help us with our present problems too.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Facebook is in hot water again, over controversial deals it made in the past that compromised user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been considering for a long time to leave Facebook. These are the challenges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For many people, Facebook is the only way I have to contact them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a better place to share family pictures (again most of the family is on Facebook)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;certain follows/groups relevant to my interest are Facebook only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically the network effect. If more people use off-Facebook services, the easier it will be to leave Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, some steps to slowly wean you off Facebook, especially if you find yourself compuslively checking it (basically just make it totally inconvenient to check Facebook regularly):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;uninstall the app from your phone. It&amp;rsquo;s a battery hog anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only access Facebook via web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;never let the site remember your password, forcing you to input it every time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;always log out when you are done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;change your language to some other language (mine is set to Spanish)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some random things I noted about Facebook recently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you open the browser&amp;rsquo;s developer console, Facebook outputs warning messages to the console, to protect against &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/help/246962205475854&#34;&gt;Self-XSS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/12/notes-on-facebook/fb-console-warning-spanish_hu156d61aae50678cd00b02827b4bc72bd_18453_300x0_resize_box_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;2403f481c7ca2e94aeaba1cb012780aa-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/12/notes-on-facebook/fb-console-warning-spanish.png&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect was that if you set your Facebook&amp;rsquo;s language to something other than English, the console message changes too!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#2403f481c7ca2e94aeaba1cb012780aa-lightbox&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you log out of Facebook, your profile picture remains on the login page so you can more easily re-login (I should probably remove that though). There&amp;rsquo;s a small red number above your profile picture, supposedly indicating pending notifications that are waiting for you when you login. This number is a lie meant only to entice you to login and has no correlation to the actual pending notifictations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scripting.com/&#34;&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt; makes a point that Facebook, despite all its flaws, did bring something good to humanity, even if only for a little while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Facebook offers ordinary people something they&amp;#39;ve never had before. A place to publish their ideas for anyone to read. For all its flaws they have done something remarkable, something the news industry could have but did not do.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dave (@davewiner) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1075254515149008896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;December 19, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what happens next. Maybe Facebook will clean up its act and gets to stay around. Maybe it gets replaced by the next big thing. Or maybe it gets replaced by many small things. Whatever comes next, hopefully society will be more careful in how we handle the implications of the convenience that tech and social media bring us.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump and Mark Zuckerberg are different people in vastly different positions, but I find it interesting the uncanny parallels their stories have taken them through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many non-Americans, I&amp;rsquo;m acutely aware of the shenanigans of Donald Trump, the current US president. It would be a fascinating story, if only it weren&amp;rsquo;t so bad for the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His character arc is of someone who rose to the level of this own incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before becoming president, he was basically the worst kind of businessman - a sleazy con man/grifter always looking out for ways to scam other people to further his own interests. A snake oil salesman who somehow stumbled into becoming president of the most powerful country on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows why he ran for president? Maybe the Russians goaded him into it. Maybe he thought it was good for his businesses. Maybe he thought he could profit off campaign contributions. The most unlikely reason seems to be that he believes he could do good for his country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now he finds himself in a very challenging position, the pressures and problems which could be understand by very few other people in the world. His position is now subject to increased legal scrutiny that could threaten him, his family, and even his con man businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many tech guys, I&amp;rsquo;m also acutely aware of the problems besetting Mark Zuckerberg and his super-dominant social network Facebook, mostly problems of his own making. Again, it would be a fascinating story, if it weren&amp;rsquo;t so bad for the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like Trump, he seems to have risen to the level of his own incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He started this software company when he was still in college and somehow it grew and snowballed until he was in charge of the most powerful communication platform on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t start out with noble intentions, calling his users &amp;ldquo;dumbfucks&amp;rdquo; and everything, so it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise he and his company made a lot of stumbles along the way, many of them only coming out just now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He surely had no idea that his proposed advertising business model and his mission of connecting the world would lead to fake news, Russian collusion, and numerous privacy problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His position as head of Facebook leads to pressures and problems which could be understand by very few other people in the world. And now he finds himself under increased legal scrutiny that could threaten his business model, his company, and even his legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someday (perhaps soon), Trump and Zuckerberg will be held to account for their failings. Until then, the world is being moved by men who were completely unprepared for their positions and are basically making it up as they go along. (Of course, many, many people are making it up as they go along&amp;hellip;). I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if there any lessons to be learned from these observations, but maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just a stark reminder that a man&amp;rsquo;s reach cannot exceed his grasp.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Social Credit System

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;China is setting up some kind of large-scale &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/china-social-credit-system-punishments-and-rewards-explained-2018-4&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;social credit system&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; to rank and monitor the behavior of their citizens. Citizens with low scores can get penalized in various ways like being denied travel or access to top-tier schools and so on. It&amp;rsquo;s quite creepy, and the mere idea evokes &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosedive_(Black_Mirror)&#34;&gt;the dystopian Black Mirror episode &amp;ldquo;Nosedive&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; where people use an app to rate other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&amp;rsquo;s social credit system might be even worse than the Black Mirror one because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s instigated by the state, instead of a (presumably) commercial app like in Black Mirror. Instead of people you interact with regularly rating you, it&amp;rsquo;s now some faceless bureaucrat who might have an agenda. At least if it&amp;rsquo;s people, you might be able to cozy up enough to other people to get your rating back up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how would you opt out? In the Black Mirror episode, the protagonist&amp;rsquo;s brother was the type of person who didn&amp;rsquo;t care about social status so the ratings didn&amp;rsquo;t affect him. In a system administered by the state and applied universally, you have no choice. Well, I guess you can still be all &amp;ldquo;meh, I don&amp;rsquo;t care&amp;rdquo; and just don&amp;rsquo;t avail of the benefits unlocked by higher ratings, but since it&amp;rsquo;s the state promoting this, it&amp;rsquo;s likely the scope where the ratings matter will only become larger with time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the idea of a rating system inherently creepy? People judge other people all the time. We judge other people by how they look, the clothes they wear, how they behave, where they went to school, what job they have, what kind of car they drive, and so on. And people often do change their own behavior to influence how others judge them. In certain countries, they already have financial rating systems that allow companies to judge you based on your credit history. It&amp;rsquo;s simply a factor in how human societies work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think having a numeric rating system for social behavior feels so off because it attempts to quantify something that we understand to be inherently subjective, and attempts to impose that standard rating system indiscriminately. And a rating attached to each person universally feels like it would be very difficult to shake off. If someone judges you based on your looks or your clothes you can always change them. If all the people in your neighborhood dislike you, you can always move to a new area. But if there&amp;rsquo;s a quantitative rating attached to you in some centralized database somewhere? People who don&amp;rsquo;t know you can judge you instantly, even if they&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of your past indiscretions. The rating would follow you around where ever you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least financial credit systems are there to promote good financial decisions (since they are used to judge your credit risk). China&amp;rsquo;s social credit system looks like it&amp;rsquo;s designed to promote obedience to the state or adherence to state-preferred behavior, which means reduced freedoms. One can only hope such an experiment fails and does not propagate to other more democratic-leaning countries, but given the recent worldwide trends, I am not too hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 23, 2010&lt;/strong&gt;: A disgruntled and decorated police officer who had been dismissed on charges of extortion took hostage a bus full of tourists from Hong Kong. The hostage drama unfolded in front of the Quirino Grandstand in Manila with the expected media circus, confused cops and SWAT who didn’t know what to do and a tragic ending that involved dead hostages and a bullet to the head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20100824-288458/Bloodbath-at-Rizal-Park&#34;&gt;Read the full story on Inquirer.net.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t there of course. In fact when the topic first started trending on twitter I dismissed it and went about whatever I was doing at the time and later took a nap. By the time I woke up, hostages had died and the situation had escalated, negotiations had apparently failed and the SWAT team was ready to assault the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, like everyone else I was appalled at the incompetence of the law enforcement units handling the matter, especially with the rumors circulating that they had actually had training on this type of bus assault scenario before/recently. But when I think about it, our cops are poor and underpaid and working with substandard equipment and procedures and still they have to risk assaulting that bus and getting shot. I wouldn’t excuse them for the outcome of the event, but things can always end badly and in our case there are so many things contributing to that grisly end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about Captain Mendoza, the hostage taker, who claims he was unjustly dismissed from the force? It is easy to blame him as well. Of course we all agree that taking a bus full of tourists hostage is not the best way to air his grievances. But he is just another underpaid cop and was now even denied his measly pension. He could air his concerns to the media but would anyone listen? He could take it up with the courts but how long would that take? Instead of suffering through a long, arduous process of reclaiming his allegedly stolen honor, he chose to take a radical approach to get attention to his cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course it worked. The media lapped it up. The major TV stations, in their relentless quest for even more ratings kept trying to outdo each other in their coverage and in airing his side and the details of his case. It’s easy to say the media exacerbated the situation what with their broadcasting details of the police operations and of the arrest of the hostage taker’s brother. But the fact is that we the viewing public, we love this stuff, this drama. We stay glued to our TVs and radios and twitter streams, hoping to see how this unsightly assault on our country’s tourism industry would conclude. Can we blame the media for giving us what we want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to criticize, but it’s not like we were the ones there on the scene having to deal with the chaos and the media and the rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to lay blame, but we can’t go back and change what happened. Hopefully the people in charge, and that law enforcement and media outlets and even we the people to whom these entities should be held accountable study the failures and learn the lessons and do what needs to be done to avoid another such incident staining our not-so-good-in-the-first-place international reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
