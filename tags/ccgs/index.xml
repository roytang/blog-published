            &lt;p&gt;I am aware of the existence of Pauper as a format in MTG, but I never paid too much attention to it before. A couple of weeks ago, a friend pointed out that I might enjoy playing the recent Jeskai Nuneca decks that had become popular recently. I checked out a sample decklist, and you bet I jumped at the chance to play Mulldrifters again lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set about to gather the cards. Since we almost never sell cards, even draft chaff, we had most of the cards available already. The only exception was red elemental blasts/pyroblasts for the sideboard and some extra Archaemancers which we ended up getting from a shop. We also didn&amp;rsquo;t have Ash Barrens (apparently a pauper staple), and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to bother looking, so I made do with extra common fetches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the pauper deck to my first event today, completely blind to what the meta was lol. I figured I&amp;rsquo;d just enjoy the event and see how the deck plays and what the meta is like. Here&amp;rsquo;s the deck I ran:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;mtgdecklist&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Jeskai Pauper&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what to expect, since it was pauper I expected it to play a bit more like a limited format compared to Standard or Modern. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The format is diverse with a lot of different decks and most of the matchups are highly interactive. I wish I could say I placed well too, but after a couple of good matches, I folded to some misplays. Here&amp;rsquo;s the match record:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R1 2-0 vs MonoU Faeries/Delver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R2 2-0 vs RG Madness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R3 1-2 vs U/B&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R4 0-2 vs Boros&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R5 0-2 vs MonoU Faeries/Delver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made one misplay in R3 when I agreed with my opponent&amp;rsquo;s assessment that both my spellstutters would die after he disfigured them both. We later agreed that one of them should have survived and two of this spells should have been countered. I also made a mistake when I allowed my R5 opponent to Snap his own Spellstutter to counter my Preordain when I had a Standard Bearer on the board. This is a result of not playing this card since Apocalypse! Lol. A few other minor mistakes in sequencing in the other games, but nothing too major. And I needed better sideboard plans, since I almost never knew what to pull out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, I might play a bit more of this format, at least it provides a fun and cheap alternative to Modern for paper Magic!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>MTG Arena: Thoughts on Historic

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Magic Arena&amp;rsquo;s community was in an uproar this past weekend over the latest &lt;a href=&#34;https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-beta-august-29-2019&#34;&gt;state of the beta&lt;/a&gt;, mostly over the announced plans for Arena&amp;rsquo;s eternal Historic format that will become relevant with the coming rotation. It&amp;rsquo;s likely that Wizards will backpedal in some way in response to the community, but here are my thoughts for now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;historic-cards-to-cost-double-wildcards-to-craft&#34;&gt;Historic cards to cost double wildcards to craft&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the universally-reviled bit and has been the target of much outrage, accursing Wizards of being greedy etc. On this point I am in agreement with the community that yes, this sucks. On the other hand, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned not to be outraged by ridiculous DLC/microstransaction pricing. If something is too unaffordable, I simply won&amp;rsquo;t indulge it. If I can&amp;rsquo;t afford to craft a historic deck, I won&amp;rsquo;t play the format, until I can. More on this later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WotC&amp;rsquo;s plans for Historic looks to me like they are trying to replicate the &amp;ldquo;scarcity&amp;rdquo; inherent to paper eternal formats like Modern and Legacy. Arena is actually a bit more generous that either MTGO or HS, since both of those don&amp;rsquo;t sell boosters from older sets in their stores. WotC still plans to have Historic sets available, though only in 45-pack bundles (I don&amp;rsquo;t care about this either, as I rarely purchase packs anyway, but some people also dislike this change). The 2-for-1 crafting cost is still uniquely Arena and thus their own bad decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, digital games have to have slightly different business models than IRL counterparts. Arena is unique in this regard since it&amp;rsquo;s the only modern digital CCG that has a strong paper analogue. Trying to replicate the scarcity of paper Magic may have made sense for MTGO, since that platform allows trading and thus cashing out, but for Arena it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most likely the goal is to ensure that Standard is the main gameplay mode especially for newer players, as Standard generall drives sales. But increasing the crafting cost is unnecessary. The barrier to entry for Historic will already be pretty high for a new player anyway, even if the crafting cost was 1-to-1, since a new player will have more sets to catch up with. There is no sensible reason for doing this, as it is only setting Historic up for failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;curated-cards-to-be-periodically-added-to-historic&#34;&gt;Curated cards to be periodically added to Historic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this one, the community is more split. There are those like me who consider this a good idea, as long as they are conservative with the power level of the curated cards added to historic. My personal preference is that they release cards that were pretty good in standard during their time, but haven&amp;rsquo;t really found a good place in Modern, so that they have a chance to shine. Clouding the issue is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MTG_Arena/status/1167184191215165440&#34;&gt;recent tweet by the official twitter&lt;/a&gt; where they suggest that examples of curated cards could be Brainstorm, Firebolt, Wurmcoil Engine, and Dark Confidant, all of which are at least Modern power level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who dislike this change seem to be mainly because they don&amp;rsquo;t want Historic to be Modern or Legacy. I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, I would love it if I could play Modern on Arena. But technically, it&amp;rsquo;s not likely that the historic format will ever be the same as Modern (or Legacy), unless WotC goes crazy. It&amp;rsquo;s highly unlikely that they would add the Tron lands or Storm cards or Dredge cards into Historic for example. It would take a lot of cards for historic to even come close to Modern. But I understand the concern &amp;ndash; there are a lot of broken cards in Modern and Legacy, and WotC is made up of humans, so there is a nontrivial risk that they will screw up and add something ridiculous into Historic, breaking the format. The Brainstorm inclusion in the tweet linked above certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand the appeal of having an eternal format that is Arena sets only, moving forward. Some also want the previous Arena-implemented sets (Shadows over Innistrad, Kaladesh, and Amonkhet) to be included as well. Some prefer that Arena start adding sets one by one working backwards and stopping at Magic Origins. In general, these are all in the same vein. The idea generally is that more recent sets are more &amp;ldquo;balanced&amp;rdquo; in terms of power level, especially since Play Design is now a thing, thus the format will probably be healthier in generally than Modern which is a turn 4 format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also a secondary concern that adding curated cards so often (the initial plan is quarterly) will shake up the metagame more often and make Historic even more expensive as a format to get into, as you need to be getting new cards every so often. The assumption is that the curated cards will be high power level staples which would be necessary to participate in the format. Again, such concern could be mitigated by careful curation. If the curation is done well, each batch of new cards could introduce new strategies and make small changes to the metagame without necessarily invalidating entire decks. And again, there is a nontrivial risk of screw-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assuage these concerns in general, what I would do if were WotC would be to introduce two eternal formats instead. One is just Arena eternal - all Arena sets (maybe including Amonkhet, but people don&amp;rsquo;t seem to like Kaladesh very much &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=417766&#34;&gt;for some reason&lt;/a&gt;), and a second one which is basically just what they&amp;rsquo;re already planning for Historic. More options is always better (although it might &amp;ldquo;confuse the new players&amp;rdquo;, whatever that means).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;managing-your-own-expectations&#34;&gt;Managing your own expectations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circling back to my point earlier. If Historic is too cost prohibitive, I won&amp;rsquo;t play it, until I can. In many ways, it&amp;rsquo;s a case of managing your own expectations for an online game. I like playing Magic, and Arena lets me do that at a manageable cost (i.e. free and conveniently). The addition of the Historic format doesn&amp;rsquo;t change that. I can still play Standard regardless of whether I can afford Historic or not. Until this state of the beta, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even thinking about what happens to my cards that are rotating out, whether I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to use them again or not. For most of those cards, I drafted them, I played with them, I used them with standard decks and I generally enjoyed my time playing Arena (Nexus of Fate notwithstanding). It helps that I am a f2p player, as all I invested was my time, and since I enjoyed my time, it was not wasted time for me no matter what happens to those cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it&amp;rsquo;s a different matter if you&amp;rsquo;ve been paying for the cards? IDK, I have a friend who&amp;rsquo;s bought at least a bundle every time a new set comes in, I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard any complaints from him. If you&amp;rsquo;ve invested more into this game, I get that it&amp;rsquo;s a feel bad if you can&amp;rsquo;t make the most of the game by participating in all the available modes because of cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like Wild in Hearthstone. I played Hearthstone for a while before rotation became a thing, so I had a lot of cards that are now only playable in Wild. I don&amp;rsquo;t really play HS anymore, but in the short time when I was active and Wild was available, I probably played only a handful of games. And I never disenchanted all those cards, even if I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to play them much. I don&amp;rsquo;t care that they&amp;rsquo;re just sitting there not doing anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-conclusion&#34;&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to how WotC responds to the outrage.&lt;/p&gt;

            <guid>https://roytang.net/2018/12/mtg-arena/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena&#34;&gt;MTG Arena&lt;/a&gt; for a good while now, a little bit during the closed beta, and now I think we&amp;rsquo;re still in open beta (?) because things still keep changing around. But I figured I could put in a little commentary about how this thing is going so far. I&amp;rsquo;m coming off the POV of a long-time &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/categories/magic-the-gathering/&#34;&gt;Magic the Gathering&lt;/a&gt; player of course, with a little bit of comparison to &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/&#34;&gt;Eternal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2016/05/hearthstone-vs-mtg/&#34;&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;, the two digital CCGs I&amp;rsquo;m most familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;client-ruleset-and-gameplay&#34;&gt;Client, Ruleset, and Gameplay&lt;/h3&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#4d1a0d3c016a8a5d9177b905a1567ba5-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://roytang.net/2018/12/mtg-arena/mtgarena_hu9905f0ec2fd0deb709c648f888e934cc_2068021_300x0_resize_box_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;4d1a0d3c016a8a5d9177b905a1567ba5-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;

  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;18 Dec 2018 1:56am&#34;&gt;18 Dec 2018 1:56am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the earlier Duels of the Planeswalkers game, it looks MTG Arena is a complete implementation of the paper MTG ruleset, but with a more limited card base. At the moment, only the cards from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://whatsinstandard.com/&#34;&gt;current standard&lt;/a&gt; are currently available (sets from the previous rotation were available during the closed beta.) Granted, the MTG ruleset is a complicated beast, so they probably have a few bugs hidden away there somewhere but for the most part it is a faithful conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client looks and feels great, a much more modern platform compared to the ugly rustbucket that is MTGO, they really built upon what they started with Duels. Some of the QoL improvements from both Duels and MTGO carry over (mostly Duels). Autotapping of lands and autopass of priority when you have nothing to play are enabled by default. I&amp;rsquo;m always worried that the autotapper will screw something up and leave me in a bad position, but so far that hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened. You can add stops to opponent&amp;rsquo;s upkeep, draw, first and second mains, and end step, same as MTGO. &amp;ldquo;Attack All&amp;rdquo; is available, though I wish it worked better with planeswalkers. When cards from your opponent&amp;rsquo;s hand are revealed, they stay revealed (you can hover over the opponent&amp;rsquo;s hand to zoom in) until they leave that zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a few issues with the presentation though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;triggered abilities could have more options to better handle when they trigger multiple times. One of the worst offenders is &lt;a class=&#34;cardname&#34; href=&#34;http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;type=card&amp;name=Ajani%27s%20Pridemate&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;Ajani&#39;s Pridemate&lt;/a&gt;, which is in one of the better starter decks. The triggered ability requires a player confirmation every time, which can be annoying when the Pridemate triggers multiple times on complicated boards. There should be an option like &amp;ldquo;Always take this action&amp;rdquo;, similar to MTGO&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Always yield&amp;rdquo; for triggered abilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;timeouts need a lot of work. The main issue is that the timers still count down while the client is animating effects and you can&amp;rsquo;t do anything. That time really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t count against you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;damage dealt to creatures and toughness penalties are presented the same way, as lowered red toughness numbers on the creature itself, even though rules-wise they are actually different - the main difference being indestructible doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent death due to 0 toughness or less. I&amp;rsquo;ve already seen at least one confused newbie on reddit trying to figure out how indestructibility works and being confused because of this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-player-experience-and-economy&#34;&gt;New Player Experience and Economy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NPE is okay. You get a bunch of starter decks, one for each color and color pair. Same as Eternal actually. The starter decks also provide some decent cards to start out your collection, with some mythics even. Some useful cards they provide include &lt;a class=&#34;cardname&#34; href=&#34;http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;type=card&amp;name=History%20of%20Benalia&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;History of Benalia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;cardname&#34; href=&#34;http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;type=card&amp;name=Rekindling%20Phoenix&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;Rekindling Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;cardname&#34; href=&#34;http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;type=card&amp;name=Settle%20the%20Wreckage&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;Settle the Wreckage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;cardname&#34; href=&#34;http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;type=card&amp;name=Vraska%27s%20Contempt&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;Vraska&#39;s Contempt&lt;/a&gt; IDK what they&amp;rsquo;re going to do when there&amp;rsquo;s a rotation and the starter decks don&amp;rsquo;t work anymore. Well actually, I guess I don&amp;rsquo;t know what they plan to do for rotation at all, so we&amp;rsquo;ll just see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same as Hearthstone and Eternal, there&amp;rsquo;s daily quests to help you earn gold, and you can win gems from some events, so there&amp;rsquo;s that. You also get a free pack every five wins, with a cap of three such packs per week. I haven&amp;rsquo;t done the math but I&amp;rsquo;d say the rewards system is slightly more generous than Hearthstone, but way less generous than Eternal. You also get some rewards for each win for the day, but this drops off quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weird thing is they didn&amp;rsquo;t go with a &amp;ldquo;dusting&amp;rdquo; system for extra cards, which is how other CCGs usually do it. Crafting is instead done using rarity-specific &amp;ldquo;wildcards&amp;rdquo; which you can open from booster packs. This leads to the so-called &amp;ldquo;fifth card problem&amp;rdquo;, where whenever you open the fifth copy of a card from a booster pack, it literally has no use for you. They have scheduled a &amp;ldquo;duplicate protection&amp;rdquo; update to fix this sometime around 1Q2019, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if that&amp;rsquo;ll work out. I hope they also think about some mechanism for &amp;ldquo;cashing out&amp;rdquo; your rotating cards since they need to implement rotations less than a year from now, but I&amp;rsquo;m even less hopeful about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;limited-play&#34;&gt;Limited Play&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s draft and sealed options available, with formats (the sets being opened) rotating every two weeks. When I started out I played mostly drafts (as soon as I had the gold, I would draft), since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough of a collection yet to make a decent constructed deck. The draft experience isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly the same as paper though. For one thing, you&amp;rsquo;re drafting against bots, not actual humans. Eternal is able to make draft work vs actual humans, so Arena should be able to do it too. IDK how Eternal does it actually, one would presume the first few people to draft a format won&amp;rsquo;t have other draft pools yet to be passed to them. Regardless, Arena should be passing you packs from real humans whenever possible and bots only when no such packs are available. Still, the draft experience is passable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;constructed-play&#34;&gt;Constructed Play&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a ranked ladder which you can play for free, both Best of 1 (BO1) and Best of 3 (BO3) options are available. You can also play in Constructed Events, which have an entry fee and offer more prizes, and there&amp;rsquo;s also BO1 and BO3 options there. They also often have &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; events in different formats like Singleton or some strange format with custom rules. Kind of like Hearthstone&amp;rsquo;s Tavern Brawl I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limiter for constructed play is your available wildcards. Getting rare wildcards is reasonable enough - you are guaranteed to get one every six packs you open. Mythics are another matter, you are only guaranteed to get one every thirty-six packs. So for a F2P player (that&amp;rsquo;s me!) you will be likely constrained to decks with lower mythic counts, at least early on. For now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/standard-mono-blue-tempo-60563#paper&#34;&gt;Monoblue Tempo&lt;/a&gt;, a tier 2 deck (really has trouble against a resolved ) that has no mythics and has decent play value. I do love me some aggro control, so this is a fine choice for me for now. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing it in BO3 Competitive Constructed Events (recently renamed to &amp;ldquo;Traditional Constructed&amp;rdquo;), and have a decent enough winrate that it has always made me profit. Standard is in a pretty good place right now actually - there&amp;rsquo;s a ton of viable decks and quite a few other decks that are relatively easy to put together, like monored or Izzet Drakes, so it&amp;rsquo;s a good time to be playing standard in Arena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s great to have an option for BO3 play. The complexity of competitive Magic shines through in BO3 play, although it takes much longer to play them out. Actually, Magic games in general, even BO1, take longer to play than Eternal (which is weird because Eternal has higher deck size and starting life), which means grinding out wins as a F2P player would be more exhausting. There was a recent outcry when they announced a tweak to constructed rewards that would have made BO3 events much less appealing, basically giving them the same rewards structure as BO1 events, which is ridiclous since BO3 games take so much more time. They walked back on that change though, but haven&amp;rsquo;t announced a replacement yet, let&amp;rsquo;s see if they do better next time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have this not-so-competitive BG midrange deck that I was building towards before I netdecked the MonoBlue one. I had already spent a few mythic wildcards towards it, kind of a bad choice really, because the ranked ladder does this weird matchmaking thing where you&amp;rsquo;re more likely to fight against decks that have similar rare/mythic counts. So what usually happens is my unoptimized BG monstrosity gets roflstomped by tuned netdecks and such. After discovering this, I now mostly only play either the starter decks on ranked (to fulfill my daily quests) or Competitive Constructed with the Monoblue (in order to build up gold/cards). I still occasionally do break out the BG deck for fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote most of the above paragraphs in a draft a week or two ago, and they just recently released a new patch that overhauled the rank system and matchmaking. I haven&amp;rsquo;t explored it too much yet, I hope it&amp;rsquo;s better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;f2p-esports-and-competitive-play&#34;&gt;F2P, ESports, and Competitive Play&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wizards announced recently that &lt;a href=&#34;https://magic.wizards.com/en/competitive-magic&#34;&gt;Arena will join the Pro Tour as part of their competitive play offerings and there will be a combined $10M prize pool for both paper Magic and Arena in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. This is exciting for me because it offers a more convenient avenue for competitive play. I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit older now and I&amp;rsquo;m not too fond of playing in big paper MTG tournaments anymore. You have to travel somewhere, and it&amp;rsquo;s often hot and crowded and I have to shufffle with my sweat hands and you have to make sure your opponent&amp;rsquo;s not cheating and so on. But if I&amp;rsquo;m playing from the comfort of my home computer, well that&amp;rsquo;s a lot better for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was initially planning to play Arena same way I play other online CCGs - grinding it out as a F2P player. But I might be willing to change that depending on how the competitive landscape looks moving forward. It will probably be cheaper for me in the long run anyway - both paper Magic and MTGO are expensive options. So I&amp;rsquo;m hoping WOTC doesn&amp;rsquo;t screw this up and provides a decent tournament experience for Arena. It&amp;rsquo;s especially timely as there&amp;rsquo;s no convenient Grand Prixs near me next year so I was planning to kind of lay low with paper Magic anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTG Arena is still in open beta, and I assume the formal release will be around late 2019, when the next rotation comes in. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably make a follow-up post at that time. I&amp;rsquo;m optimistic and hoping for the best and hopefully all the issues will be ironed out. Arena has the potential to trounce the online CCG scene, especially since Valve&amp;rsquo;s Artifact hasn&amp;rsquo;t been able to live up to its hype (though I might still try it). All Wizards has to do is to not screw things up!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I said in my previous &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2017/02/review-duelyst/&#34;&gt;Duelyst review&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.direwolfdigital.com/eternal/&#34;&gt;Eternal&lt;/a&gt; didn&amp;rsquo;t really hook me. That was in Feb 2017. I stopped playing Duelyst after around six months. I started playing Eternal regularly July of that year, and have been playing regularly ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What changed my mind? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure, but once I got around to playing Eternal regularly, I found myself enjoying it. I think one of the main factors is that out of all &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/tags/ccgs/&#34;&gt;the online ccgs&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve tried, Eternal is the one that&amp;rsquo;s closest to &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/categories/magic-the-gathering/&#34;&gt;Magic the Gathering&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s not really surprising, since a number of Eternal&amp;rsquo;s lead designers are MTG Pros and Hall of Famers. As such, my review will tend to compare Eternal to MTG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eternal games play out almost exactly like MTG games. Each player plays mana sources (called Power in eternal), then uses his pool to play creatures and spells to interact with the enemy. You send in creatures to attack and deal damage to the enemy until the enemy&amp;rsquo;s life total is at 0 (Eternal starts at 25 life vs MTG&amp;rsquo;s 20.), the enemy can send his units to block your attackers, and so on. Eternal feels like a smoother, more streamlined MTG. I&amp;rsquo;m also playing MTG Arena regularly these days, so I know that by comparison Eternal&amp;rsquo;s games feel like they flow quicker and finish faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the relevant changes that I believe make it feel like a faster MTG:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;limited fast effect windows. This is the main one. MTG Arena has to stop and ask you what you want to do every time there&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to play fast effects, and there&amp;rsquo;s tons. In Eternal, there are only three windows: during combat, at the end of the enemy&amp;rsquo;s turn, and whenever the enemy plays a spell. And you can only play fast spells (basically MTG instants), there are no creature abilities to activate at instant speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the game will automatically pass priority whenever you don&amp;rsquo;t have any relevant plays. MTG Arena does this automatically as well. You can turn it off, since it has a bit of disadvantage (it conveys information to the opponent)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;similar to HS, Eternal limits the number of creatures you can have on the board. Eternal allows twelve on each side vs Heathstone&amp;rsquo;s seven. This is more due to technical constraints than anything else. MTG Arena has to play the same on paper, so you can crash the game by generating some large number of creatures somehow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://roytang.net/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/eternal_board_limit.jpg&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;25 Nov 2018 2:00am&#34;&gt;25 Nov 2018 2:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eternal&amp;rsquo;s power system is similar to MTG&amp;rsquo;s mana system - you have to draw cards that provide power the same way that you have to draw lands in MTG. This means one of MTG&amp;rsquo;s inherent &amp;ldquo;problems&amp;rdquo; - mana screw - still happens in Eternal. In fact, on the forums mana screw is one of the complaints that often comes out (I suspect from former HearthStone players). Coming from MTG, I understand that building your deck to avoid mana screw is one of the skills needed in games like Magic and Eternal. Eternal eases the problem a little bit with its mulligan mechanic: Eternal gives you one free mulligan, and the 2nd hand is guaranteed to have 2-4 power. As I write this, they are also experimenting with allowing a 2nd mulligan that drops your starting hand size by one, still with the guarantee of 2-4 power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color screw can still be a problem in Eternal, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough of the correct influence (Eternal&amp;rsquo;s analogue to color), you can&amp;rsquo;t play cards that require that influence. They improved on this a bit because in Eternal, power and influence aren&amp;rsquo;t tied together the way mana and color are, they are independent. The influence requirements are &lt;em&gt;minimums&lt;/em&gt; that aren&amp;rsquo;t used up like mana of a given color. That is, if you have one Fire influence, you can play any number of cards that require one Fire influence. In MTG, if you only have one source of red mana, that red mana can only be spent for one card at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of color/influence, Eternal has five factions like MTG&amp;rsquo;s color pie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Faction&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Symbol color&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Closest analogous MTG color&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fire&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Red&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Red&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Shadow&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Purple&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Black&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Primal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Blue&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Blue&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Justice&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Green&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;White&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yellow&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Green&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, they don&amp;rsquo;t map cleanly. Often in my own head I still refer to the factions by their MTG analogue (and I call Justice Green and Time White), but I&amp;rsquo;ve been improving on this lately. The play styles largely map correctly though. Fire decks are often aggressive with small quick creatures and burn for reach. Primal decks have card draw and counter magic. Shadow decks have a lot of removal and life draining. Time decks have mana acceleration and big creatures. Justice decks have Wrath of God lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, many of Eternal keywords are similar or analogous to MTG keywords. And they added some fun, unique keywords of their own. Eternal already has a number of expansions out, so there are quite a number of keywords already. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Keyword&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;MTG Analogue&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Notes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Aegis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hexproof&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Unlike hexproof, Aegis only works once (it resets if the unit enters play again). Also, Aegis will protect against Wrath-style effects whereas Hexproof does not. I think this is a neat hexproof variant that could also work in MTG, maybe.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Berserk&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;None&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This is a fun, unique risk-reward mechanic that has no equivalent in MTG. Basically you can choose to attack twice if a unit has Berserk, one time only. After activating berserk, the unit becomes Reckless.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Charge&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Haste&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deadly&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deathtouch&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deadly + Overwhelm/Quick Draw work exactly the same as MTG&amp;rsquo;s Deathtouch + Trample/First Strike&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Double Damage&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Double Strike&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Well, the damage is just doubled, there&amp;rsquo;s no second damage step.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Endurance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Vigilance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In addition to not tapping to attack, units with Endurance can&amp;rsquo;t be tapped (exhausted) or stunned by enemy effects&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Flying&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Flying&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Big surprise!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Killer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fight&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fight is a close analogue, but there are major differences. A unit with Killer can attack one enemy unit at any time (even with summoning sickness), and the fight is treated as a combat (effects that trigger on attack or block will take place)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lifesteal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lifelink&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Overwhelm&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Trample&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Quickdraw&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;First strike&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;But only when attacking. No defensive first strike!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Reckless&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Attacks each turn if able&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Revenge&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The first time this unit dies, it gains Destiny (automatically played when drawn) and is shuffled back the top ten cards of your deck&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Unblockable&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Unblockable&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Warcry&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Warcry&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This was my favorite when first starting out. Whenever a unit with Warcry attacks, the next unit or weapon in your deck gains an attack/defense buff. Value! This is one of those abilities that can&amp;rsquo;t happen in a paper game like MTG.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Scout&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Scry&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just the battle skills! Eternal also has a set of trigger keywords that define when an effect will happen. There&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Summon&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Entomb&lt;/strong&gt;, analogous to HS&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Battlecry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Deathrattle&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Empower&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Spark&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tribute&lt;/strong&gt;, are analogous to MTG&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Landfall&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Bloodthirst&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Morbid&lt;/strong&gt;; and so on. There&amp;rsquo;s far too many to cover here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re: other mechanics, the main one to note is that Eternal takes full advantage of the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s a computer game and doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to deal with player memory issues. This means that buffs and debuffs stay on cards, even when they leave zones. Unlike Hearthstone, the graveyard/void zone exists and thus reanimator strategies are viable. There is some amount of RNG, such as &amp;ldquo;units gain a random battle skill&amp;rdquo;, but not as much as HS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice mechanic they have is the &amp;ldquo;Market&amp;rdquo;. Basically each deck can have a set of five cards set aside as a &amp;ldquo;Market&amp;rdquo;/sideboard, and there are a set of cards (one for each faction) that allow you to fetch a card of that faction from the market. Basically similar to the way the Wishes worked in Magic. It&amp;rsquo;s a clever approach that allows for some form of &amp;ldquo;sideboarding&amp;rdquo; even for best of one matches&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skill Level, Competitive Play and F2P&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Eternal is inherently more skill-based than HS because of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;manabase decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;much less RNG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attacking and blocking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meta for competitive play is rather healthy, there are a number of viable decks in different archetypes that can you to Master ranking on the ladder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eternal provides several modes for Limited play as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s Forge, which is similar to Hearthstone&amp;rsquo;s Arena&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s monthly sealed leagues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s 4-pack draft available at any time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of F2P, Eternal is the most generous among CCGs I&amp;rsquo;ve tried in terms of how much it gives players for free, as far as I can tell. Aside from the standard three daily quests, your first ranked win of each day gets you a free pack. There&amp;rsquo;s a free Gauntlet mode where you fight against AIs, and just grinding Gauntlet can get you enough gold to purchase the campaigns, which give you more cards to work with. When you start out, you quickly earn starter decks for five factions and five color pairs. These decks are decent enough for ranked play; I remember I took the Rakano and Stonescar starter decks up to Gold rank during my first month. They recently nerfed gold rewards from chests (that you earn from quests) by 10% for balance reasons, but I think the rewards are still pretty generous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hit Master rank in constructed on my third month of play (same rate as with Duelyst I believe) and have regularly hit it ever since. By comparison, I&amp;rsquo;ve never hit legend rank in HS. It really helps that Eternal games are quick and a lot more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a while longer to hit Master rank in draft - more than one year in fact, I only hit it last week. This was the last achievement I needed for Steam completion too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lore and Aesthetics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eternal&amp;rsquo;s world is described as &amp;ldquo;Six Guns and Sorcery Combined&amp;rdquo;, which means there&amp;rsquo;s Gunslingers alongside magic users and shamans and such. There&amp;rsquo;s a little bit of steampunk in there too, along with valkyries, yetis, centaurs, wisps, dinosaurs, radiants (basically magical aliens), grenadin (basically goblins), sentinels (basically giant robots), and a bunch of other stuff too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s pretty fun, and the story is continuously being updated. Each monthly league and the occasional campaign or new card set represents a change in the story. Major characters are represented by powerful cards and often have multiple versions representing their stages of growth. A prime example is Icaria, the young Valkyrie captain who later becomes a rebellious keyword-souped Akroma-like avenger after witnessing her superior&amp;rsquo;s misdeeds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/eternalcardgame/images/6/6d/Icaria%2C_Valkyrie_Captain.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/318?cb=20180307222958&#34; alt=&#34;Icaria, Valkyrie Captain&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/eternalcardgame/images/e/eb/Icaria%2C_the_Liberator.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/318?cb=20181012184436&#34; alt=&#34;Icaria, the Liberator&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the lore, I like the game&amp;rsquo;s overall aesthetic. Many game actions have smooth and quick animations that keep the game alive. Units with Aegis are wrapped with an animated bluish glow. Legendary units crash onto the field with force, attacking units dive towards their blockers, and so on. I think the animations and aesthetic are comparable with HS in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is now: will I keep playing Eternal now that I&amp;rsquo;ve hit my usual target of all the Steam achievements? Or should I focus on MTG Arena for the foreseeable future? (MTG Arena blog post sometime in the next month maybe)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is still pretty fun to play Eternal, and they just came out of Early Access and launched on XBoxOne, so there might be an upsurge in community activity. I think I will play it for a while, the designers seem to know what they&amp;rsquo;re doing, and a new set comes out next month too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few other online CCGs I have accounts for that I haven&amp;rsquo;t really gotten into for some reason or another, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll try giving them another chance next year. There&amp;rsquo;s Spellweaver (very slow games and kinda boring), Shadowverse (not a fan of the aesthetic and ugh the UI is so messy/cluttered), and Gwent (uh, it&amp;rsquo;s weird). There&amp;rsquo;s Valve&amp;rsquo;s Artifact coming out too, I might try that if reviews are good. So many card games to play!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2016/05/hearthstone-vs-mtg/&#34;&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;, I tried out a couple of other digital CCGs: &lt;a href=&#34;http://store.steampowered.com/app/429680/&#34;&gt;Spellweaver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://store.steampowered.com/app/531640/&#34;&gt;Eternal&lt;/a&gt;, but neither one hooked me. The one I enjoyed the most and did pick up to play regularly was &lt;a href=&#34;https://duelyst.com/&#34;&gt;Duelyst&lt;/a&gt;. So this review is written from the perspective of someone who has played both Magic the Gathering (MTG) and Hearthstone (HS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearthstone, Spellweaver and Eternal played like digital MTG with some advantages, as I outlined in the HS post linked above. Duelyst keeps many of the same elements and advantages, but adds an extra dimension. Besides being a card game, Duelyst is also a board game.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Board game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a game of Duelyst your General (the analogue to Hearthstone&amp;rsquo;s hero) and his minions are played into a 9×5 board. Minions can only be summoned on empty spaces adjacent to one of your units. During your turn, each unit can either: attack an adjacent enemy; or move up to two spaces, then attack an adjacent enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a board and unit movement greatly enhances the &amp;ldquo;positioning matters&amp;rdquo; mechanic as compared to Hearthstone. In HS, it only mattered whether minions were adjacent, to the left or to the right. In Duelyst, you can position minions to prevent enemies from reaching your General, or to restrict enemies from moving completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means a number of spells and abilities care about positioning too. Each of the available Generals has a Bloodborn spell (BBS), the equivalent of Hearthstone&amp;rsquo;s Hero Power. One of the Generals has a BBS which allows her to deal damage to all enemy units in the same column as the opposing General. This means you have to be careful where you place your minions whenever her BBS is active! There are spells that affect a small area (2×2 or 3×3 and so on). There are spells that care about adjacency (&amp;ldquo;Destroy target minion that is not nearby any general&amp;rdquo;). And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factions and Generals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearthstone has different heroes, and each hero has a different card pool available. By contrast, Duelyst has factions and Generals. Each faction has its own card pool, and of course there is a global or &amp;ldquo;neutral&amp;rdquo; card pool as well. Each faction also has two Generals, each of which has a different BBS. The factions and Generals encourage a lot of different playstyles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some factions like the Songhai are more focused on spell-based damage and backstabs. The Lyonar focus on cheap, efficient creatures. Vetruvian has obelisks that can generate temporary minions. Abyssian focuses on swarm tactics and shadow creep. The Vanar rely on placement and trickery. My favorite General, the Magmar Vaath, likes to go toe-to-toe with the enemy General and &lt;strong&gt;punch him in the face!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, many of Duelyst keywords care about positioning, and thus have no meaningful equivalent in either MTG or HS. Namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Airdrop&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; minions with Airdrop can be summoned anywhere on the board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backstab&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; this unit deals extra damage when attacking from behind (yes, even facing matters!) and doesn&amp;rsquo;t receive a counterattack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blast&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; attack hits all enemies in the same row or column&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flying&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; may move anywhere on the battlefield&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frenzy&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; normal attacks hit ALL adjacent enemies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infiltrate&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; gains bonus effect if its on the enemy&amp;rsquo;s starting side of the board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Provoke **&amp;ndash; somewhat like HS&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Taunt. A&lt;/strong&gt;djacent enemies cannot move and &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; attack a Provoke unit if there is one nearby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ranged&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; can attack from anywhere on the board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shadow Creep&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; this is a modifier that can be added to board tiles. An enemy standing on Shadow Creep takes 1 damage at the end of the Shadow Creep owner&amp;rsquo;s turn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Zeal **&amp;ndash; gains bonus effect as long as it&amp;rsquo;s next to the General&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duelyst also has a number of keywords that are analogous to abilities in MTG and HS. &lt;strong&gt;Rush&lt;/strong&gt; is the same as MTG&amp;rsquo;s **Haste **and HS&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Charge&lt;/strong&gt;. **Opening Gambit **and &lt;strong&gt;Dying Wish&lt;/strong&gt; are the same as HS&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Battlecry&lt;/strong&gt; and **Deathrattle. **(I worry that at some point new cardgames will run out of names for &amp;ldquo;enters the field&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;leaves the field&amp;rdquo;.) And so on &amp;ndash; no need to cover everything here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skill Level, Competitive Play and F2P&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The added dimension of positioning means that Duelyst is strictly more skill-based than HS. This is obvious if you note that there are a lot more choices for where to place minions. Hearthstone is also more reliant on RNG than Duelyst is, although I can&amp;rsquo;t say that will hold for the future. I enjoy some level of RNG as it creates variance, but the randomness means a higher chance of losing due to bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find competitive play on the ranked ladders for both Duelyst and Hearthstone to be about the same. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying either meta is healthy, but as I see it there are more viable decks in Duelyst ladder as compared to HS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;ve already spent a bunch of money in MTG, I don&amp;rsquo;t like spending money on digital card games. So for both HS and Duelyst, I am strictly free-to-play (F2P). Both games offer similar monetization models (pay money for booster packs/cosmetics) but I was able to get further up the ladder in competitive Duelyst.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;18 Feb 2017 1:30am&#34;&gt;18 Feb 2017 1:30am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my first full month (December), I was already able to get to Duelyst&amp;rsquo;s Gold Division. This should be similar to around rank 10 in HS. After a lot (and I mean &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt;) of grinding from Diamond rank, I managed to hit the S-Rank Division last month. This is the equivalent of HS&amp;rsquo;s Legend rank. The highest rank I ever got in HS was around rank 6 or 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I think Duelyst is more skill-based than HS, why did I find it easier to get to S-Rank than HS&amp;rsquo;s Legend rank? Two reasons come to mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I found Duelyst games more fun&lt;/strong&gt;. This means I was playing Duelyst on a daily basis since it started. At the start, I played regularly because I wanted to get Steam Achievement completion. But I found myself enjoying the game and continuing to play even after that. There are also a lot more variance in decks being played on the Duelyst ladder. By comparison, HS ladder seemed to be almost 50% the one best deck (used to be Midrange Shaman, nowadays Pirate Aggro&amp;hellip; ) while the other 50% are trying to beat it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was easier to get the powerful cards and build the tier one decks in Duelyst&lt;/strong&gt;. The pricing of packs is about the same (100 gold), but on average I could earn around 100-150 gold per day from Duelyst&amp;rsquo;s quests, compared to 40-60 for HS. The drop rates for Legendaries (highest rarity in both games) is higher in Duelyst as well. Unlike HS, Legendaries in Duelyst are not restricted to one per deck, you can play as many as three. This meant you need more of them, which annoyed me at first. But I think that&amp;rsquo;s counterbalanced by the higher drop rate. For comparison, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing HS for more than a year and have only gotten two premium (golden) Legendaries. Three months into Duelyst and I&amp;rsquo;ve opened the same amount of premium (prismatic) Legendaries. (Well, this comparison may be skewed since I open more Duelyst packs due to the increased gold rate.) Another factor was the Bloodborn expansion, which you could complete by playing enough to grind 3900 gold. That expansion came out in December, and I completed the set early in January. This set gave me access to many useful cards that were important in the meta. This allowed me to build a tier one deck and reach S-Rank in January. Even after that deck was nerfed, I was also easily able to shift to another tier one deck from another faction. In HS, I still haven&amp;rsquo;t found a new competitive deck after Midrange Shaman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I told myself I would stop playing Duelyst after I completed the Steam Achievements. Then I said I would stop playing after I got to S-Rank. But I&amp;rsquo;m still playing it now. By comparison, I now launch HS once or twice a week, and I don&amp;rsquo;t clear the quests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duelyst is still a young game &amp;ndash; the second expansion just came out last December. So in the future it may yet be plagued with the problems Hearthstone currently has. The developers have shown themselves to be responsive in nerfing problematic cards and shaking up the meta though. Whether they are able to keep this up remains to be seen. In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;m willing to keep playing as long as the game is still enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am of course a long-time &lt;a href=&#34;http://dailymtg.com&#34;&gt;Magic the Gathering&lt;/a&gt; player. Over the past year or so I&amp;rsquo;ve also been playing Blizzard&amp;rsquo;s digital CCG &lt;a href=&#34;http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/?-&#34;&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; (limiting myself to free to play since who has money to spend on two CCGs?) and I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about the design parallels and differences between the two. If you&amp;rsquo;re a Hearthstone player, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably read a lot of these things before, since many well-known pros play both MTG and HS. This is written more towards the Magic player in mind to get to know Hearthstone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mana system and Mulligans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most modern successors to MTG, HS does away with the concept of &amp;ldquo;mana screw&amp;rdquo; by automatically providing one generic mana to each player per turn. It&amp;rsquo;s really MTG&amp;rsquo;s big weakness and what turns off many players. MTG Head Designer MaRo tries to justify the existence of mana screw &lt;a href=&#34;http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mana-action-2011-05-23&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. HS&amp;rsquo;s mana system is much simpler, and has no concept of colors or mana screw or color screw. One disadvantage of this is that all costs are the same, and they have to restrict deck access to cards via another method &amp;ndash; class-specific cards. This makes it impossible to have the equivalent of a &amp;ldquo;multicolor deck&amp;rdquo; like in Magic, which means there are theoretically fewer possible deck archetypes in HS for a comparable set of cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of Hearthstone&amp;rsquo;s mulligan system &amp;ndash; selectively sending back particular cards from your opening hand &amp;ndash; as opposed to Magic&amp;rsquo;s sending back the entire hand. Unfortunately, Magic is already balanced around the current mulligan system, and it will probably have issues if you only have one chance to mulligan and still draw no lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hearthstone Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearthstone is definitely a more limited game than Magic because it follows one important rule: you can&amp;rsquo;t interact during your opponent&amp;rsquo;s turn. This has the benefit of streamlining matches and making them go faster (no need for concepts like the stack and priority from MTG) , which is important for a game played online. The disadvantage is a greatly reduced design space which HS has to compensate with in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some other limitations to streamline/simplify gameplay:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No graveyard (well, HS has a concept of &amp;ldquo;minions that died this turn&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;minions that died this game&amp;rdquo;, but there is no visible graveyard zone). This means Magic&amp;rsquo;s graveyard-based mechanics such as &lt;strong&gt;Flashback&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Unearth&lt;/strong&gt; can&amp;rsquo;t be translated to Hearthstone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No manual searching through the deck. When an effect pulls something out of the deck, it&amp;rsquo;s always random&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At most 7 minions (creatures) on the board on each side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengths of the Digital Format&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the above limitation, HS does earn some additional design space since it takes advantage of the exclusively digital format in a number of ways not available to Magic, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damage to minions not healed at EOT&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; in Magic, this would not have been practical since it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of effort for players to track the damage to individual creatures. For a digital game it&amp;rsquo;s easy since it can be done automatically. This also provides some mechanics that can&amp;rsquo;t usefully translate to MTG: the &lt;strong&gt;Enrage&lt;/strong&gt; mechanic and effects like &amp;ldquo;Draw a card for each damanged minion&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effects can generate new cards&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; both spells and minions. Magic can do this too, through the use of &amp;ldquo;tokens&amp;rdquo; (but only for permanents, not spells). Magic&amp;rsquo;s tokens however are &amp;ldquo;second-class&amp;rdquo; permanents since they are not real cards. In HS, the generated cards are real cards that can be returned to hand, shuffled into your deck, etc. Furthermore, the generated cards can be either existing cards (whether you have them in your deck or not &amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;Discover&lt;/strong&gt; mechanic or effects like Piloted Shredder) or cards that are not even available for deckbuilding such as the Spare Parts generated by some mechs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More randomly generated elements&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Magic has some RNG too, but not nearly as much as HS. I believe that in both games, serious competitive players don&amp;rsquo;t like too much RNG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effects can permanently boost cards not in play&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; this includes effects like &amp;ldquo;all cards in your deck get +1/+1&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;reduce the cost of this card for each turn it is in your hand&amp;rdquo;. This is possible since we can trust the game engine to correctly process and track hidden information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Board position matters **&amp;ndash; minions can grant bonuses to adjacent minions, or effects can target the leftmost minion, etc. Actually, Magic can do this too, but given that they&amp;rsquo;ve moved away from &amp;ldquo;graveyard order matters&amp;rdquo; because it places too much effort on the player, I suspect they are not likely to do this for similar reasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Easily balance existing cards **&amp;ndash; Blizzard hasn&amp;rsquo;t done it too often, but they do issue nerfs to cards that are too powerful. Before the introduction of the Standard format they even nerfed some core cards to free up future design space. In Magic they try to avoid functional errata because they have no way of ensuring the ifnromation is propagated to all owners of previous printings of the same card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hearthstone Mechanics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Hero Power &amp;ndash; **each hero has a power that costs 2 mana. The great thing about this it reduces the effect of &amp;ldquo;cost screw&amp;rdquo;, i.e. drawing high cost cards early, since your hero will always have a low-cost play available no matter what. There&amp;rsquo;s also some design space there they started using in earnest with The Grand Tournament expansion, such as the &lt;strong&gt;Inspire&lt;/strong&gt; mechanic or effects that modify hero powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secrets&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; to compensate for not being able to interact during the opponent&amp;rsquo;s turn, some classes have access to secrets &amp;ndash; these are spells that generate effects during your opponent&amp;rsquo;s turn, based on particular triggers. The opposing player wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Taunt **&amp;ndash; the equivalent of Taunt in MTG is &amp;ldquo;Blocking&amp;rdquo;. Since you cannot do anything on your opponent&amp;rsquo;s turns, blocking the same way as MTG is impossible, so they have this mechanic to replace it. Currently, HS has no way for minions to bypass Taunt without removing the Taunt minion itself &amp;ndash; there are no evasion mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Charge **&amp;ndash; the equivalent of MTG&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Haste&lt;/strong&gt;. However, it is stronger here in HS since your opponent cannot interact during your turn. This means Charge creatures essentially get a free attack unopposed and can throw off your opponent&amp;rsquo;s combat math. This makes effects that grant Charge particularly strong. An example was the infamous &lt;a href=&#34;http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/forum/topic/19288409377&#34;&gt;nerf to Warsong Commander&lt;/a&gt; because granting Charge to other creatures enabled one-turn kills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; no equivalent in MTG, but I think something can be worked out if needed. Something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divine Shield (This creature enters the battlefield with a divinity counter on it. Whenever it takes damage and has a divinity counter instead remove a divinity counter.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m actually a big fan of Divine Shield as a mechanic, it&amp;rsquo;s more interesting and a lot simpler than Magic&amp;rsquo;s defensive mechanics &lt;strong&gt;Protection&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Regeneration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Windfury **&amp;ndash; this is basically the same as Magic&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Double Strike&lt;/strong&gt;, except Magic is limited by the rules to two strikes, while HS has one card that has &lt;strong&gt;Mega-Windfury&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing four strikes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Overload **&amp;ndash; this is HS putting its&amp;rsquo; simpler mana system to good use. Overload allows you to &amp;ldquo;borrow&amp;rdquo; mana from the future to reduce the costs of your cards. The downside is you have less mana available next turn. The closest equivalent is probably Magic&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Echo&lt;/strong&gt; mechanic or the &amp;ldquo;Pact&amp;rdquo; mechanic from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=130701&#34;&gt;Pact of Negation&lt;/a&gt; cycle, although neither are exactly the same&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Combo **&amp;ndash; this is the Rogue mechanic in HS, it grants an additional effect if at least one other card has been played in the same turn. This is easily implementable in Magic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eviscerate 1R Sorcery Eviscerate deals 2 damage to target creature or player. Combo &amp;ndash; Eviscerate deals 4 damage instead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no different than Magic&amp;rsquo;s other &amp;ldquo;enhancing&amp;rdquo; ability words like &lt;strong&gt;Morbid&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Kicker&lt;/strong&gt; which grant additional effects depending on certain conditions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stealth&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; this is the same as Magic&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Hexproof&lt;/strong&gt;, except Stealth wears off once the minion attacks, and stealthed minions can&amp;rsquo;t be attacked. The usage is generally the same &amp;ndash; to protect your minion until it can actually gain you some value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Battlecry and Deathrattle **&amp;ndash; in Magic, these are simply triggered abilities &amp;ldquo;when the creature enters the battlefield&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;when the creature dies&amp;rdquo;. If these were named keywords in MTG, it would open up some additional design space that HS already uses. MTG does use this design space sometimes, but the templating is difficult, see &lt;a href=&#34;http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233069&#34;&gt;Torpor Orb&lt;/a&gt;. More complicated abilities like &amp;ldquo;Battlecry: Trigger another minion&amp;rsquo;s Deathrattle effect&amp;rdquo; would not be worth the effort to implement in MTG unless similar keywords are defined to make templating easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spell Damage&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; this mechanic increases the damage dealt by burn spells. In Magic, such spells are almost exclusively red spells, so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how likely it would be to keyworded in Magic. This design space has been used in MTG on occasion, but it&amp;rsquo;s mostly damage doubling instead of incrementing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Choose One **&amp;ndash; I actually wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware this was a named mechanic until they took advantage of it with &lt;a href=&#34;http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Fandral_Staghelm&#34;&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;. Magic&amp;rsquo;s modal mechanic has never been used in such a way, but imagine an effect like &amp;ldquo;Whenever you make a choice for a modal ability, you may choose one additional mode&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; makes your Cryptic Commands way more awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silence&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; this is basically &amp;ldquo;remove all abilities&amp;rdquo; in Magic. To be truly equivalent, it should also remove power/toughness boosts and auras attached to the creature. Seems perfectly doable in Magic, although it might have memory issues, unless it&amp;rsquo;s as an aura.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freeze&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; frozen minions can&amp;rsquo;t attack the next turn. It&amp;rsquo;s mechanically and thematically similar to tapping effects often found in blue and white cards. Freeze effects in HS can easily be replicated in Magic. The main difference is that frozen Taunts in HS can still &amp;ldquo;block&amp;rdquo; so Freeze can&amp;rsquo;t be used offensively to get rid of the &amp;ldquo;blockers&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearthstone is a pretty young game compared to Magic, but as far as I can tell it&amp;rsquo;s doing pretty well. It provides a fun, streamlined experience and takes advantage of the strengths of the digital format to overcome the weaknesses brought about by the streamlining. The monetization model is friendly enough that even cheap f2p players like me can appreciate it. So far Magic hasn&amp;rsquo;t had a real competitor in the paper space, but HS is a serious competitor in the digital space since it makes MTG&amp;rsquo;s digital offerings look terrible by comparison. Hopefully both games can learn more from each other and grow more in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Totally different yo&lt;/p&gt;
