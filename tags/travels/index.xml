            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Something I haven&amp;rsquo;t done in a while: travel with my parents to Bicol to pay respects to our ancestors during the &lt;em&gt;undas&lt;/em&gt; long weekend. In fact, the last time I made this trip was &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2004/10/getting-away-from-it-all/&#34;&gt;back in 2004&lt;/a&gt;, 15 years ago! (I technically also visited Bicol about 11ish years ago, but that was via a flight to Legaspi, Albay, and not to my dad&amp;rsquo;s hometown.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Dad&amp;rsquo;s hometown is in Daet, Camarines Norte, and that&amp;rsquo;s also where my grandparents are buried. But instead of heading there directly, we went first to Naga City in Camarines Sur, where we had relatives and family friends to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;10-hour-bus&#34;&gt;10 Hour Bus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overnight bus ride from Manila to Naga is longer than the one to Daet, at an estimated 10 hours. We booked a &amp;ldquo;lazyboy&amp;rdquo; Amihan bus, which meant we would be getting a ride at the Cubao Busport that was newly-opened a couple of years ago. My parents were super-impressed with the busport when it first opened, comparing it to an airport terminal. It was my first time using the busport, and I was mostly underwhelmed. I will say it&amp;rsquo;s nicer than other bus terminals in the country, but that&amp;rsquo;s a low standard and nowhere near an airport.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;

              &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Araneta center busport&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;4 Nov 2019 12:00am&#34;&gt;4 Nov 2019 12:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/&#34;&gt;View post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;The 10-hour bus ride was expectedly miserable; I probably got little more than 2-3 hours of shallow sleep (Fitbit didn&amp;rsquo;t even register any sleep at all, although as if to compensate, it gave me an extra 4000 steps for the next day&amp;hellip;). Comparing it to plane rides (which are also generally miserable), the bus ride had more legroom (yay!) but was way more turbulent (impossible for me to read anything). Level of discomfort with the seat back and difficulty sleeping was about the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: I am generally pessimistic about bus rides, because growing up, these trips to Bicol were a lot more common, and I was lot more prone to motion-sickness while on the bus, especially as some of these Bicol roads are exceptionally curve-y. My mom often had to provide me with a barf bag, because me puking due to motion-sickness on these rides was the rule rather than the exception. Thankfully, I&amp;rsquo;m better able to handle it these days. That, and I have bonamine now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;naga-city&#34;&gt;Naga City&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My uncle picks us up at the Bicol Central Terminal in Naga, and we have a quick breakfast at the local McDonald&amp;rsquo;s. We drop our bags at his house and rest for a while, after which he takes on a few quick stops around the town. It&amp;rsquo;s my first time in Naga (or at least, the first time in adult memory), so everything is new to me. Apparently, the town is well-known for the Penafrancia festival, something akin to Quiapo&amp;rsquo;s Nazareno festival, a religious festival involving pilgrimage from one religious site to another. Except this one uses a water route somehow (?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First stop is the Jesse Robredo Museum. Disclaimer: I&amp;rsquo;ve never met the former Naga City Mayor/DILG secretary or his wife, the current VP, but we are indirectly related through in-law-ness. My uncle here in Naga is married to Jesse Robredo&amp;rsquo;s sister, making him the Vice-President&amp;rsquo;s brother-in-law, I think? Is that how it works? Anyway, for this reason, the current VP is highly regarded on the father&amp;rsquo;s side of the family, despite the country&amp;rsquo;s divisive politics. The museum itself was ok, highlighting J.Robredo&amp;rsquo;s career highlights and accomplishments. It&amp;rsquo;s not super large (I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine that a museum dedicated to a single politician can be), and a visit is probably 30-45 minutes long (including a short AV presentation).&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;My uncle drove us around town a bit, pointing out this or that. One thing that struck me was that small-town feel of &amp;ldquo;everybody knows everyone&amp;rdquo;, since he would often point to a building/business as we drove past and say it was owned by the son of so-and-so and my dad would be like, &amp;ldquo;ah, the one who went to X school?&amp;rdquo; and so on and other stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch-time we visited this restaurant my dad liked, Jimmy and Tang&amp;rsquo;s (no relation, though jokingly they claim to be cousins). Given my peculiar dietary tastes, I&amp;rsquo;m not much for Bicolano food, but my dad loves it of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afternoon was some free time, so I decided to wander around SM City Naga. Having a mall in Naga is not a new thing, I&amp;rsquo;m told SM City Naga has been there since the late 90s. Still, the mall was quite small, and there&amp;rsquo;s the distinct lack of dedicated stores that I like to visit: Comic book stores, gaming stores, bookstores (National doesn&amp;rsquo;t count!). I imagine it must be difficult to have geeky interests in the provinces. In the evening we had dinner at Robinson&amp;rsquo;s Place Naga, which was the newer mall in the area, and quite a bit bigger than the SM. After that we visited the house of my dad&amp;rsquo;s childhood friend and spent the night there. I pretty much just turned it early due to being tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second day in Naga was more restful than anything else. Lunch time we visited the house of some of my folks&amp;rsquo; CFC friends. They served some beef salpicao (among other things I wasn&amp;rsquo;t inclined to eat) that turned out to be quite good but also quite spicy. That&amp;rsquo;s Bicol for you I guess. After we got back we checked in at the CBD Plaza Hotel opposite the bus terminal where we&amp;rsquo;d be leaving for Daet the next morning. The hotel room was a bit cramped, but it was fine for sleeping (and also had wifi so that&amp;rsquo;s good enough for me.) We rested up at the hotel for a bit before I decided to go around and walk the early evening streets for a bit. Dinner was at the SM City Naga food court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;daet&#34;&gt;Daet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning we had the free non-buffet hotel breakfast, then checked out of the hotel and got on a bus for Daet. It was a mostly uneventful two-hour ride, though I did see an &amp;ldquo;IPOT FOR SALE&amp;rdquo; roadside sign that I wish I had taken a picture of. My aunt who lived in Daet met us at the terminal and brought us to the Canimog Hotel where we&amp;rsquo;d be staying for the night. The owners of the hotel were friends of the family, which is why my folks chose this place to stay at, but we were the only guests for some reason. Apparently the hotel had seen better days, there was a bit of a creepy vibe lol. But also there was fiber internet (Converge), so all good I guess? During all of my other prior trips to Daet, we had stayed at my grandmother&amp;rsquo;s old house, but that was sold off a few years ago, so now we have to stay in a hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Canimog Hotel (Daet)&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;After leaving our stuff at hotel, we immediately went out for lunch at a nearby place called KSarap (I had some yummy chicken cordon bleu), then headed straight for the cemetery afterwards, as it was already the first of November. My grandparents were buried at the Camarines Norte Chinese Cemetery, where each family had like a small mausoleum type thing to house their dead.  Ours housed my grandparents, and also an uncle and aunt who had also lived in Daet. We paid our respects by doing the Chinese thing with the incense sticks and the bowing and the putting them into the bowl. My mom and I left earlier because it was blistering hot and wanted to rest. My dad and aunt and cousin stayed behind to man the mausoleum and greet any visitors and such. Because of that small-town &amp;ldquo;everybody knows everybody else&amp;rdquo; thing, there&amp;rsquo;d often be random people who knew the family coming in to visit and pay respects.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day was uneventful. We met up with my dad later in the afternoon and then went and had dinner at the nearby SM Hypermart. (They don&amp;rsquo;t yet have a full-fledged SM mall in Daet, though I&amp;rsquo;m told one is underway.) Then rest and sleep at Canimog. The hotel room at Canimog was nice and a lot roomier than the previous one (though I wish they had more outlets for charging).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-eyeglasses-stayed-away-from-the-sea&#34;&gt;My eyeglasses stayed away from the sea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning, we had breakfast at Jollibee before heading out to Bagasbas beach. Visiting the beach was often the highlight of my childhood visits to Daet, but during my last visit in 2004, I famously &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2004/11/my-eyeglasses-belong-to-the-sea/&#34;&gt;lost my eyeglasses to it&lt;/a&gt;. I still decided to take a dip this time, but wisely took off my eyeglasses before doing so. Nothing quite like the taste of saltwater and how it assaults even your nose. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve been in contact with the ocean since maybe 2016, so this was a good time to commune with the sea and maybe demand it give back my eyeglasses. (Spoiler: they were not returned.)&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;4 Nov 2019 12:00am&#34;&gt;4 Nov 2019 12:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/11/bicol-trip-photo-dump/&#34;&gt;View post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;There were quite a few people on the beach, presumably because of the holidays. I&amp;rsquo;ve visited a few other beaches in my lifetime, but none with waves as strong as the ones on Bagasbas. It&amp;rsquo;s actually gotten famous as a surfing destination during the past couple of decades. A lot has changed on the beach and the boulevard, which now claims to be the &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/regions/05/13/15/how-long-philippines-longest-boulevard&#34;&gt;longest boulevard in the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; after they added some bridges to extend it to nearby municipalities. There&amp;rsquo;s also a lot more shops and restaurants along the boulevard than I remember, though most of them were closed in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;distant-relatives&#34;&gt;Distant relatives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the beach, we went back to the hotel to clean up then headed out for lunch with some distant relatives, most of whom I&amp;rsquo;ve never met or don&amp;rsquo;t remember. I believe the house belonged to my dad&amp;rsquo;s aunt, which meant her siblings were my second cousins (?) is that how it works lol. Pretty big family too. Anyway, many of them remembered me from when I was little, but I had little recollection of them, though I tried to get along of course. I did enjoy their stories of Daet and how things have changed along the years, and there was more of that &amp;ldquo;everybody knows everybody else&amp;rdquo; feeling when they were talking about old neighbors or friends who had passed away, or what happened to old buildings or businesses in town, and so on. My dad also enjoyed the food quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;anticipated-mass-and-more-thoughts-on-daet&#34;&gt;Anticipated mass, and more thoughts on Daet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch we mostly rested up at the hotel and then went out for anticipated mass (it was Saturday the 2nd) in the early afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I had visited Daet many times during my childhood, I find that I don&amp;rsquo;t really have a good &amp;ldquo;mental model&amp;rdquo; of the town, unlike places that I&amp;rsquo;ve visited as an adult. When I was young, we were mostly limited to my grandmother&amp;rsquo;s old house, and the beach, and maybe went out a few times to some other places, but never really enough for me to grasp the size or layout of the town. The big difference now is that internet is ubiquitous, which means I have Google Maps as a reference. The Globe signal can be spotty in some places, but still generally workable. This is a huge contrast to my 2004 visit where I had to go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2004/10/posting-from-the-boondocks/&#34;&gt;an internet shop to do internet things&lt;/a&gt;. Even my aunt and cousin have fiber internet here. So now during this visit I at least know the major road names and have some idea of where places are relative to other places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything feels a bit more modern now too. In my last visit, I complained about having to flush the toilet manually with a bucket. Not only is that a thing of the past now, but all of the places we stayed at now had bidets! Ah, bidets, the symbol of modern living. In general, Naga and Daet feel like they could be suburbs of Metro Manila; there aren&amp;rsquo;t any tall skyscrapers like in Makati or Ortigas, but looking at the streets and the shops and so on, it would be hard to differentiate from some of the more far-flung residential QC areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found it interesting whenever my dad would converse with other people in Bicolano. I don&amp;rsquo;t speak the dialect, but it&amp;rsquo;s close enough to Tagalog that I can often get the gist of what&amp;rsquo;s being discussed. (Closer than something like Cebuano at least.) It&amp;rsquo;s a weird feeling listening to a language that&amp;rsquo;s almost familiar but not. Maybe this is how Spanish people feel when hearing Catalan, or such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;going-home&#34;&gt;Going Home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the mass, we had a fast-food dinner at Greenwich, then went back to our hotel to checkout and then on to the bus terminal. We would be taking a DLTB &amp;ldquo;lazyboy&amp;rdquo; bus from Daet to Cubao, a trip estimated at around 8 hours. The DLTB bus had a bit more legroom than the Amihan bus, but the seats were a bit slippery and any attempt to sleep led to me slipping down into an uncomfortable position. So again, miserable bus trip with little sleep, as expected. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t get motion sickness again this time, so that&amp;rsquo;s something. The bus trip was fairly quick as well - we arrived an hour earlier than I expected. When we got off the bus, we took a grab home and I was glad to be back in my own bed again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole trip was worthwhile, it&amp;rsquo;s always good to connect with your roots, no matter how distant they may have gotten. And stepping away from Metro Manila and all its problems was a welcome thing as well (though I did miss my desktop PC). Given my parents&amp;rsquo; age, there is a nontrivial chance that I never get to visit Bicol again; I certainly wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go by myself after all. So it was better to take this opportunity while it was there. Well, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll go again next year? We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Why Travel?
</title>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;People travel for different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents travel mostly for shopping purposes. Which meant when I flew back home with them during the recent trip, we came back with an additional 3 fully-packed pieces of luggage full of shoes and clothes and such. As someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t really indulge in shopping, I can&amp;rsquo;t relate to this, and in fact it runs anathema to my philosophy of always packing as little as necessary when travelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are people I know (mostly younger people) who seem to be travelling every weekend or every other weekend and they&amp;rsquo;re always at the beach or some tourist spot or exotic location. I find this difficult to relate to as well, not only because that seems like an unnecessarily expensive lifestyle, but if you&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;getting away&amp;rdquo; every weekend, won&amp;rsquo;t that sort of thing become routine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, I don&amp;rsquo;t view travelling as a vacation or as a rest period. Travelling is expensive and stressful and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/07/travel-anxiety-part-2/&#34;&gt;can be anxiety-inducing&lt;/a&gt;. Not my idea of vacation or rest. For me travel is either purposeful (usually for me that means either work trips or playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/grand-prix/&#34;&gt;Magic Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt;), or as a tourist (something I&amp;rsquo;ve only started doing as recently as the last 5 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the real value of travel is in getting a chance to step away from your daily routines. Stepping out from your usual environments and the familiar culture around you and immersing in something different. Experiencing something different lets you challenge your own culture and world view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when we come back from our travel, when we reacquaint ourselves with what we had before, we get to see our old rhythms and comfort zones with fresh eyes. What used to be routine may look different in light of recent experiences. When resuming old habits we get to ask a fresh set of &amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Do I really need this?&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;Could this be done better?&amp;rdquo;. We gain a newfound appreciation of things we missed. And hopefully, we are changed for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;rsquo;s where the value is. We travel so we can be forever changed.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Travel Anxiety, Part 2
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/07/travel-anxiety-part-2/</link>
            <pubDate>Sat, 13 Jul 2019 05:56:56 +0000</pubDate>

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/07/travel-anxiety-part-2/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I had written about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/11/travel-anxiety/&#34;&gt;travel anxiety&lt;/a&gt; before, but I&amp;rsquo;m revisiting the topic because the recent US trip reminded me how much of a problem it is for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US trip was a new experience because I would be abroad for 40 days with multiple travel legs, it involved 4 international flights (back and forth) plus three domestic flights within the US, and on one leg and several flights I would be travelling alone. I had travelled abroad before for a longer period (3 months for London in 2015), but for those 3 months I was based in the same place and didn&amp;rsquo;t need anybody&amp;rsquo;s help to move around the city, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can get a bit crazy in planning for possible problems. Loss of passport is probably the worst-case scenario, followed by getting sick/injured while abroad (especially since I&amp;rsquo;m wary of the expensiveness of US health care), and of course there&amp;rsquo;s the possibility all your other stuff getting lost or stolen. In case of catastophe, I set up an online URL (known only to me) where I can access emergency info such as my passport details, contact number for relatives, and so on. Of course I also have paper printouts of needed info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By my own count, I had ridden on an airplane 23 times now in my lifetime (19 international, 1 domestic PH, 3 domestic US), but I still worry a lot about any given flight. There are multiple possible points of failure for any one flight, some of them unique to the US, specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;need to arrive at the airport on time, without forgetting your travel documents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;need to pass security/immigration/customs. Added feature this time was the stricter TSA screening. And the customs form I needed to fill up as I entered the US gave me some worry as well, because I was carrying some foodstuffs meant to be given to relatives and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if I had to declare them or not (apparently the default answer is just don&amp;rsquo;t declare them? IDK). I had a similar issue on the way back into the PH, but even though I was given a customs form to fill up, no one actually asked for it?!? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;need to pray that your checked luggage doesn&amp;rsquo;t get lost or stolen from. Additionally, in the US, the TSA may open your checked luggage outside of your presence, and if you&amp;rsquo;re using a non-TSA approved luggage lock, they will break your lock to do so. I had the misfortune of getting &lt;a href=&#34;https://photos.app.goo.gl/BMYFgcLnrtpwiEd66&#34;&gt;this souvenir from the TSA&lt;/a&gt; because of this (I have since purchased TSA-approved locks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;need to make sure no one else claims your checked baggage at the carousel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;will I even be able to sleep during the long haul flight? Undoubtably yes, but only in very short bursts that I presume are not healthy. Airplane economy seats are often very uncomfortable for me and and have very little leg room, and the seat backs are not conducive to me sleeping. I am so uncomfortable on airplanes that I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize that me preparing movies/books/comics/games to entertain me during the flight is a waste of time, as I typically won&amp;rsquo;t indulge in those activities when I&amp;rsquo;m not very comfortable. Typically, a long haul flight goes like this for me:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wake up after 2-8 minutes due to some noise or due to my neck hurting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the flight status/time to see how much longer I have to tolerate this nonsense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stare for a while into the void, doing nothing, hoping I can somehow make this flight go by faster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Optional) Get up and go to the 0.5 square meter lavatory so I can stretch my legs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make tiny adjustment in neck or butt or leg position(s) and hope that helps me sleep better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start of my trip gave me some anxiety as well, when I went to the check-in counter at NAIA, the Asiana lady could not scan my machine-readable passport, presumably due to a fold on the relevant page. She said she would process me manually but warned me that there was a possibility that they would reject my passport at my US entry point since a machine-readable passport was a requirement. I even had to sign a waiver absolving Asiana of any liability in case I was not allowed to enter the US! Basically they gave me reason to be worried during the entire length of the 18-hour trip to SFO. Spoilers: there was no issue at the US border, and there was never any further issue scanning my passport at any point including at the e-Gate as I was re-entering the PH. (Props to NAIA for having e-Gates now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue I encountered was because this was my first time actually visiting relatives during a trip, so I was not prepared for the Filipino culture thing of having your relatives give you stuff to bring back home. I always pack as lightly as possible and have a small luggage unit specifically because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to worry about lugging around a lot of weight. Because of this, on my way back to Seattle from Houston, and from Seattle to Sacramento, I had to handcarry a large paper back with stuff for my folks and siblings. I did not have a spare bag to carry the items, and on the trip to Sacramento, the bag was even slightly ripped, I did not have a contingency plan for if it fell apart. Luckily, things worked out lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned in the previous post that I don&amp;rsquo;t really do much shopping, but my parents did, and we ended up having 3 additional checked luggage pieces ((all of them near the 50lbs limit), which meant I had to carry one myself during my flight. (We were flying back on the same day, but had separate flights). This added to bit about my anxiety, as what if some customs official asked me what I had in the large luggage and I had no idea? Luckily again, things worked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the flights, I also had to arrange for lodging, as not all the places we were going to had friends or relatives we could crash at. I ended up using 3 different AirBNBs, one each in Anaheim, Los Angeles and Seattle. AirBNBs come with their own set of anxieties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;will I be able to find the place?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;will there be an issue with the check in process?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can I trust the host not to steal my stuff or spy on my with a hidden camera or something? The thing about AirBNBs is you basically have to trust strangers; one of my issues this time is I was travelling with a laptop, so I was worried that it might not be secure to leave the laptop at the AirBNB when I went out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is the AirBNB area secure? Can I walk around the area at night?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happily, I encountered no issues with the AirBNBs I rented and had pleasant stays all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Luckily, things worked out&amp;rdquo; is generally the outcome to be expected for most of these overthinking-type anxieties I guess. I know it&amp;rsquo;s not rational to worry about all of these things a lot, and I understand the odds are low for any particular risk, but sometimes I can&amp;rsquo;t help myself. Often I can manage the happy-go-lucky &amp;ldquo;eh, I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;ll be fine&amp;rdquo; attitude for any single problem, but in this instance the fact that I had to worry about so many different flights (not to mention iteneraries like theme parks, meetups, etc) made it extra challenging. I guess I just need to remind myself not to worry too much. While there are certainly a lot of possible &amp;ldquo;things that can go wrong&amp;rdquo;, most of them are easily recoverable from, and the odds are very low anyway. I&amp;rsquo;ve survived this long in a harsh environment like Metro Manila, so I can probably survive something going wrong in more &amp;ldquo;civilized&amp;rdquo; (?) countries like the US anyway!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>US 2019 - San Francisco area and Trip Summary
</title>

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/07/us-2019-san-francisco-area-and-trip-summary/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;After the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/07/us-2019-seattle/&#34;&gt;Seattle part of the trip&lt;/a&gt;, I reunited with family for the final leg of the trip where we all be hanging around the San Francisco bay area. We were based in my uncle&amp;rsquo;s place in Vacaville, which one of my friends kindly described as &amp;ldquo;in the sticks&amp;rdquo;, i.e. basically far away from everything. Like Houston, we had to rely on the kindness of relatives who were willing and available to drive us around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the laziest part of the trip by far: not much walking, most of it either just driving to places and taking pictures; or going to outlets for shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent a few days near Monterey, staying at a cousin&amp;rsquo;s house. This let us visit some nearby stuff like cannery row, the 17-mile drive and pebble beach. Climbed some rocks, saw some squirrels, walked by the wharf, that kind of stuff. After that, we also visited San Jose for a day to meet some other relatives, then the next day we drove over to San Francisco and visited the Golden Gate Bridge area, the Palace of Fine Arts (sadly closed on that day, but the exteriors were nice), and drove around the SF roads for a bit too. I was a bit underwhelmed by the Golden Gate bridge, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as long nor as wide as I imagined it would be, but from the exhibits there I can imagine what a big deal of an engineering feat it was at that time. The streets of SF were even steeper than Seattle&amp;rsquo;s were! I&amp;rsquo;m glad I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to walk them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day was just hanging out the Vacaville area and visiting (and revisiting) the outlets for shopping. Apparently Vacaville is known for the outlets. I&amp;rsquo;m not much of a shopper myself - I don&amp;rsquo;t have the patience to sift through rows of clothes or shoes looking for bargains - it&amp;rsquo;s mostly my parents who bought a bunch of stuff. I just walked around mostly looking at things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did make a couple of electronics purchases, one was a cheap gaming mouse (not as cheap as the ones in the PH, but not like a $60 razer either), and the bigger purchase was a 2018 iPad from Best Buy. I wanted to get a new tablet because my current iPad Pro was falling apart (I literally had some tape at the seams to hold it together), and the battery was in horrible shape. I was hesitating because the iPad Pro was actually still perfectly usable - as long as it was plugged in and the tape held. At first I wanted to get a new iPad Pro, since I wanted the pencil support, but those were wildly expensive, and even the refurbished 9.7-inch ones would have cost as much as a new 2018 iPad. Luckily, I found out that the 2018 iPad did in fact support the Apple Pencil, so I ended up getting a new one of those instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a fourth of July barbecue at my uncle&amp;rsquo;s house, and I stayed the night at a friend&amp;rsquo;s house in Hercules, then more lazy days of shopping to wind down our US trip. Some overall impressions of the US and random stories follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;everything is so far apart. During our Houston and Vacaville legs we basically had to be driven everywhere. Probably basically impossible to live without a car (as I prefer) unless you&amp;rsquo;re willing to pay the higher rents in the downtown areas. There&amp;rsquo;s also so much idle land everywhere. Basically the opposite of congested Metro Manila. I have a better understanding now of why Americans are so obsessed with cars (and pickup trucks apparently) (Slight tangent: interesting article I read on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/car-crashes-arent-always-unavoidable/592447/&#34;&gt;why Americans are basically forced into car dependency by laws, infrastructure and big oil&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no bidets! This is why Japan is superior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s only logical given how far apart things are, but this is the first country I&amp;rsquo;ve visited with wildly different climates in different zones. SF and LA were manageable hot - cool in the shade, but close to PH temps if you&amp;rsquo;re in the sun in the afternoons. Vegas and Houston were very, very hot. Seattle was cold in the mornings and never got too hot during the day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Americans are very chatty, even with strangers. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect them to be as chatty as Filipinos since we allegedly have a reputation for being &amp;ldquo;warm and hospitable&amp;rdquo;, but Filipinos don&amp;rsquo;t randomly ask how my day is going the way random people on the street do in the US. In Las Vegas, a large black woman was trying to chat up me and my brother while we were on a food run and we were ignoring her and she asked us why we were being so antisocial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently Filipino expats in the US watch a lot of TFC and Telenovelas and Pinoy movies. Reminds them of home I guess. I actually sat through a couple of Pinoy movies myself, I&amp;rsquo;ll write about them in the next &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/watching-lately/&#34;&gt;watching lately&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are so many, um, shall we say, &amp;ldquo;large&amp;rdquo; Americans. Not in terms of height, but in terms of width! Not that I&amp;rsquo;m fat shaming or anything like that - I mean, I&amp;rsquo;m a huge guy myself, but seeing so many larger folk around made me feel a bit more comfortable with myself. Some of the stores we went to had shirt sizes that went as high as 6x! I think the larger Americans I saw were mostly in the theme parks and the city areas, not so much in the suburbs, not sure if that&amp;rsquo;s indicative of anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used Southwest for all the domestic flights. SW is interesting because they don&amp;rsquo;t have reserved seatings for their flights - you&amp;rsquo;re assigned a boarding priority and when you board you just pick from whatever seat is available. Also apparently they let me bring free checked baggage whereas other airlines don&amp;rsquo;t so I guess I randomly made a good decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US airports don&amp;rsquo;t seem very interesting, or maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just spoiled by airports like Singapore&amp;rsquo;s Changi or HKIA where I don&amp;rsquo;t mind spending a lot of time there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t spend as much as I thought I would (mostly due to the hospitality of our hosts), but still the fact that food is so expensive here really tells me a lot about how Americans view things financially. A decent meal is typically $10-$15, maybe more. Compare that to the cost of things that would be considered luxuries in the Philippines: a new video game is $60, basically 4 or 5 meals worth; a month&amp;rsquo;s Netflix sub or a comic book are less than the cost of a meal; and so on. It basically makes it so easy to impulse buy say, a $1 chocolate bar or a $4 bag of chips since these are so inexpensive compared to normal meals, but over here I&amp;rsquo;d balk at P35 chocolate bars or P150 bag of chips. I guess I&amp;rsquo;m worried that having spent time in the US, I&amp;rsquo;d be more spendy when I get back lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in summary, I was able to visit 4 states: California, Nevada, Texas, and Washington. (Arizona for a layover). Not bad! I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to visit the East Coast during this trip, so maybe that&amp;rsquo;s something to look forward to in the future. I am not yet sure if I even want to go back; maybe one trip is already plently, just enough to experience what life is like over there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Seattle was the riskiest part of my trip, relatively speaking, because it was my solo leg - I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any friends or relatives in the city I could turn to in case of an emergency. I had also read online that while Seattle was very much a walkable city, there was a nontrivial homeless population, and some areas may be a bit sketchy after dark. As a friend of mine said though, &amp;ldquo;sketchy&amp;rdquo; in the US is probably a lot safer than &amp;ldquo;sketchy&amp;rdquo; in Metro Manila. I still worried a little bit, but given where I from, it didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My primary purpose for this leg of the trip was of course &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/07/grand-prix-seattle-2019/&#34;&gt;GP Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, but I also looked forward to being able to walk and explore the city by myself. Not that I don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy hanging out and travelling with my family, but I enjoy being able to wander around freely by myself with no real agenda, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2009/03/sometimes-you-just-go-where-your-feet-take-you/&#34;&gt;letting my feet take me wherever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That meant instead of theme parks and tourist attractions and shopping outlets, I found myself walking around looking into small bookstores, vintage shops, collectibles stores, hobby shops, gaming arcades, and so on. My poor performance at the GP main event gave me some extra time to wander the streets as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did hit a few tourist spots:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I took some pictures at the Space Needle. Didn&amp;rsquo;t bother going up, I felt like I&amp;rsquo;ve already climbed enough tall structures in my lifetime and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really worth the cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did take half a day to go through the Museum of Pop Culture near the Space Needle, which I enjoyed. They had exhibits on Washington state bands like Pearl Jam and Nirvana, fantasy and sci-fi exhibits, and even an independent gaming exhibit sponsored by Nintendo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supposedly, Seattle&amp;rsquo;s number one tourist attraction is Pike Place Market, which I found weird, because well, it&amp;rsquo;s a market. I did visit the market and wander the shop and had some of Beecher&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;World&amp;rsquo;s Best Mac and Cheese&amp;rdquo; (tastes great, but the cheese is very sharp, some people might not like it). There were some nice market shops - I enjoyed browsing a couple of the used bookstores there and there was a comic book store as well (was able to resist adding more to my reading backlog though). I think there was supposed to be some performance by the fishmongers in the market proper, and I did see some crowd gathered around one of the stalls and clapping, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t push through quick enough to see what was going on, and didn&amp;rsquo;t bother waiting for something to happen again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I did not enjoy was how steeply inclined Seattle&amp;rsquo;s streets were. Going from my Airbnb near Capitol Hill to the downtown area was easy enough as it was mostly downhill, but going back home at the end of the day was always a bit of a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like Seattle as a city, especially the Capitol Hill district - it feels like it has a lot of character, compared to say, Los Angeles (although that might be an unfair comparison as I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get to wander LA much). The city has more of a west coast-artistic vibe going on, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of posters for events everywhere, art murals on a lot of walls, there&amp;rsquo;s more music shops and book shops, a lot of random small parks, and a lot of place are very LGBTQ-friendly, even some of the crosswalks are rainbow-colored. The bookstores I browsed were great, a couple had the staff leaving small notes on the shelves about various titles they recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my last day in Seattle, due to some combination of poor planning and cheapness, I had to spend an inordinate amount of time at SEATAC airport, pre-security. I was basically at the airport 8 hours before my flight, a personal record. I thought Southwest would at least let me check my bags and go through security maybe 3-4 hours before the 5am flight, but their counter only opened an hour and a half before the flight. So I have no real opinions on whether SEATAC is a good airport or not lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with some pictures!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Not much to say about Anaheim, it felt like the town was all about Disneyland and not much else. But then again we did spend our three days there just going to Disneyland, so what can you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In LA we stayed in the Koreatown district, so everything felt weirdly Asian. Not Asian like living in Asia, but like Chinatown in any other city I guess? The city felt a bit dirty, I&amp;rsquo;m told the metro elevators smelled bad, and there was grafitti everywhere and a high incidence of homeless people. One time we took an elevator to get to the Metro and there was a homeless person smoking in the elevator. When he saw the kids, he promptly killed the cigarette and muttered apologetically &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t smoke near kids.&amp;rdquo; Hollywood was all ritz and glitter and tourist traps though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only spent a couple of nights and one full day in Las Vegas, but the heat was insufferable. And considering I&amp;rsquo;m from Manila, that&amp;rsquo;s saying something. It was hot too in LA and Anaheim, but LV had a weird sort of desert heat that seemed to linger on your skin. On our full day, we opted to spend most of daylight just hanging out in the hotel room, with the occasional outside forays for food. We spent the night on a short walking tour among the nearby hotels and the free shows like the Atlantis show at the forum or the fountain at Bellagio. Our LV-native cousin was our guide, and we (or they at least) took a lot of pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent a few days in Houston, enough to bring the kids to attractions like the Space Center, Kemah Boardwalk, the Aquarium, and the Natural Science Museum. The kids enjoyed some of the rides; I tried one of the tamer ones at the Boardwalk, but still came away dizzy. I&amp;rsquo;m too old for these things. Science geek that I am, I most enjoyed the Space Center and the Natural Science Museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houston felt like a large expanse where everything was so far away from each other. We were lucky to be visiting a cousin who could drive us around; it would have been impossible to live here without a car. There&amp;rsquo;s always so much room everywhere, even downtown Houston never felt congested or anything remotely like Metro Manila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip is only halfway done, but I think the most exhausting days should be behind me. Famous last words?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>US 2019 - Theme parks

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a big fan of theme parks. I think for the most part they are overpriced and not worth the time, effort or money. And I&amp;rsquo;d probably never go to one by myself or without one of my nieces/nephews. I understand the impetus of bringing kids to a theme park of course, they really enjoy it. Prior to this trip, I&amp;rsquo;ve only ever been to a theme park once, and that was in Unversal Studios Singapore with my brothers back in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we went to Disneyland in Anaheim and Universal Studios Hollywood. The kids with us were the nieces, 9yo and 3yo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the kids loved Disneyland. We got a 3 day pass and spent the first day in Disneyland Park and the next 2 days in California Adventure. The kids had been to the Asian Disneylands before, so there was more new stuff for them in the California Adventure side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visiting Disneyland reminded me of what a cultural tour de force Disney is in general. Kids from all the over the world come visit Disneyland and they instantly recognize and respond to all of these characters. When the nieces spot one of the mascots walking around they just shout out in glee and run up and wave to them. Yes, even the older niece. It&amp;rsquo;s not just the major Disney characters like Mickey and Minnie and Donald either. Kids respond well even to the minor characters or the obscure ones from random Disney channel shows. Disneyland really is for kids. (On a less Disney-branded note, I was also amused by how kids everywhere react the same way to bubbles being blown their way.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some highlights of the 3 days at Disneyland:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a short play re-telling &lt;em&gt;Tangled&lt;/em&gt;. Well, I only note this because I haven&amp;rsquo;t watched Tangled before and only now found out its story&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Disneyland parade that happen at the main central area. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty long, and the music can get repetitive and earwormy, but I liked how they highlighted a bunch of their properties like Aladdin, Little Mermaid, etc., though there were some weird choices there too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the California Adventure side, the best thing was the live action &lt;em&gt;Frozen&lt;/em&gt; play at the Hyperion theatre. It&amp;rsquo;s a one hour re-telling of the movie (with a few liberties taken), with all the songs and everything. The performances were great, and the entire show in general was a masterful use of the stage, props, lighting, projectors, holograms, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s not the sort of show they could stage at just any theatre either. Having two nieces I have of course seen the movie a few dozen times so one would think I&amp;rsquo;d be tired of it by now, but I was very entertained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there was also this nice Toy Story-themed game/ride where you used a virtual gun to shoot at targets like in a carnival, it was fun. If you only had time for one ride in California Adventure, this is the one I&amp;rsquo;d recommend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did quite a number of other simpler rides (just the ones where you&amp;rsquo;re sitting and there&amp;rsquo;s a show going on around you), and picture taking with various characters. I don&amp;rsquo;t have many pictures handy to show here, but here&amp;rsquo;s me with Captain America:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;9 Jun 2019 5:56am&#34;&gt;9 Jun 2019 5:56am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything like roller coasters or that new Guardians of the Galaxy which goes up and down and stuff. The kids don&amp;rsquo;t like it, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I could either, tbh. There was also a lot of wandering around the mechandise shops of course, I&amp;rsquo;m sure they make a lot of money off all the toys. I ended up buying something my brother requested for my nephew, only to find it available again at another place for a cheaper price. Lol, I should learn never to buy stuff at theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Anaheim, we took a short train over to LA, and we went to Universal Studios Hollywood. This theme park is not as kid-focused as Disneyland was, so the 3yo didn&amp;rsquo;t have as much of a good time, though she did enjoy seeing characters like the Simpsons, Harry Potter, and so on. The rides are also for bigger kids mostly - they&amp;rsquo;re the sort of rides that are full of high-speed movement, jumping and jerking around, some falling and so on. I only did the Transformers ride (which was the same as the one in Singapore) and the Minions ride, I already got a bit dizzy just from those two. I suspect the Harry Potter one was more intense (just based on the warnings), but there was like an 80 minute wait for that so we didn&amp;rsquo;t bother. I did enjoy walking around the Simpsons area and seeing all the references and the characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also did the Studio Tour, which is really for movie geeks than anyone else, so again the kids didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy it as much. The first part was a bit boring, just showing us the exteriors of the sound stages (basically just looking at warehouses). Things got a bit more interesting when they showed us some exterior locations, and there were a few parts where we got to experience a bit of a show . The &amp;ldquo;shows&amp;rdquo; were basically projected into a tunnel while our trams moved around. One was a Skull Island themed scene where King Kong was fighting a t-rex or such, and another was Fast and Furious themed which involved a high speed chase and jumping off bridges and such. There was also a special effects part where we were in a subway tunnel when an earthquake strikes, and there&amp;rsquo;s fire and suddenly the tunnel is flooded. I think the studio tour was the highlight for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also attended the special effects show, a 30-minute show demoing various special effects. Again, the 3yo didn&amp;rsquo;t like it so much, especially in the parts where they pretended to saw off a volunteer&amp;rsquo;s hand or send the volunteer flying through space. It was fun for me though, and a bit informative as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had also been planning to go to Legoland near San Diego, but it turns out the trip would&amp;rsquo;ve cost a bit more than we&amp;rsquo;d like, and online reviews said we might be disappointed especially coming from Disneyland, so we ended up not going. Instead we wandered around Hollywood boulevard and went to a few exhibits there - namely Ripley&amp;rsquo;s Believe it or Not, Guinness Book of World Records, and the Hollywood Wax Museum. The Guinness one was the best of the three, as there were a bunch of interactive games and exhibits that we enjoyed. The 3yo didn&amp;rsquo;t like being in the Ripley&amp;rsquo;s or the Wax Museum as she was a bit scared of some of the exhibits. Ripley&amp;rsquo;s had some creepy and weird stuff, including a couple that made the 9yo scream and run in surprise. I did like some of the displays, like the model of Minas Tirith made entirely of matchsticks, or the Darth Vader made out of car parts. The Wax Museum was nice, but didn&amp;rsquo;t have much and was over too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the theme park experience was fun. Still not changing my view that they are overpriced, and since I don&amp;rsquo;t have kids, I may never go to a Disneyland ever again, but it&amp;rsquo;s probably good that I got to experience it at least once so I know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2019/04/i-got-a-us-visa/&#34;&gt;US trip&lt;/a&gt; started on the first of the month. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write more regularly about it, but one thing I had forgotten was how exhausting it would be to be a tourist, walking everywhere all of the time. Here&amp;rsquo;s how many steps my Fitbit recorded during that first week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#140de2aae4f2bd4af2c3b96f67e4e8e3-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/06/us-2019-tourist-mode-exercise/tourist-walk_hubb6c862ea0b30f21225525a73c2d37c5_46266_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;140de2aae4f2bd4af2c3b96f67e4e8e3-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/06/us-2019-tourist-mode-exercise/tourist-walk.jpg&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;8 Jun 2019 5:56am&#34;&gt;8 Jun 2019 5:56am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished this week with a bit more than 105k steps, which I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure is a lifetime record (though I dont have the data anymore from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2015/03/europe-trip-2015/&#34;&gt;Europe trip in 2015&lt;/a&gt; - I suspect that it&amp;rsquo;s comparable in scale.) Compunding the tiredness was that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting much sleep, especially during that first day when we spent more than 13 hours on a plane:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#071561184d14b0f0885313488fa27619-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/06/us-2019-tourist-mode-exercise/tourist-sleep_huec9f4a7d48df0d9a1cf1534e36be2e84_62542_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;071561184d14b0f0885313488fa27619-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/06/us-2019-tourist-mode-exercise/tourist-sleep.jpg&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;8 Jun 2019 5:56am&#34;&gt;8 Jun 2019 5:56am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 0 hours there is probably a bit inaccurate. I always find it difficult to sleep on planes, so long hauls are difficult, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure I managed to get a few short bursts of sleep here and there. I suspect the Fitbit is not very well suited to measuring that sort of sleep especially when seated upright in an airplane seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that is my excuse for not being able to write much. It&amp;rsquo;s likely that this first week will have been the most exhausting part of the trip, this is where we scheduled the California theme parks after all (more on that in the next post). It is of course a net positive that I am walking so much, since this is pretty much the only exercise I get these days. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about whether I would be able to maintain this level of walking (or even half as much!) when I get back home after the trip, as I have been slacking off on the walking the past few months. Hopefully I can find a way.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Family&amp;rsquo;s been planning a US trip this year, and while I wasn&amp;rsquo;t originally planning to join them, they convinced me to go. I was like, why not? My schedule is flexible, I&amp;rsquo;ve never been there, and going to the US meant adding a whole new continent to my experiences. Getting a US Visa was a good idea anyway, in case I ever decided to travel there for some other reason (i.e. I miraculously get a slot in a MTG Mythic Championship or something), and it was a good chance to spend some time with family for a while. It might also be the last time my parents are able to take such a long trip, so might as well take the chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US Visa screening process has a reputation for being a bit difficult, with many stories of being rejected for random reasons, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too worried. In the end, it turned out easier to get the US Visa than to get &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/03/europe-trip-2015/&#34;&gt;the Schengen visa for the Europe trip&lt;/a&gt; a few years back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is actually pretty straightforward. For the Philippines, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ustraveldocs.com/ph/index.html?firstTime=No&#34;&gt;a website to help&lt;/a&gt; guide you, all the instructions are there, you just have to follow it. You can do most of the things except for the personal interview online as well. The steps I did were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill up and submit the online form. This includes uploading a photo to be used in the visa, they have some guidelines to follow. I considered using a webcam photo, but apparently that was a bad idea. Go to a photo studio, they know what kind of picture you need, ask for a digital copy so you can upload it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make an online payment (they have a couple of options, I did BPI Online). The fee is like $160 for a tourist visa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schedule an interview appointment. The first available slot may be weeks out, but sometimes slots open up earlier for some reason. During one of my earlier checks I thought I&amp;rsquo;d have to wait til May to get a slot, but by the time I actually submitted the form and made the payment, there was a March slot freed up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare any supporting documents you want to bring to the personal interview. You are not actually required to bring any documents, but the website above will give you a list of suggested documents to bring, depending on your visa type and purpose of visit. Everyone I asked actually said the documents they brought weren&amp;rsquo;t needed, but better to be sure of course. I ended up preparing bank statements, certificate of employment, payslips, and tax returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On your scheduled date, go to the US Embassy in Manila for your interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview itself was straightforward, but before you get even there, there&amp;rsquo;s at least six different queues you have to go through:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;waiting outside the embassy for applicants in your time slot (there will be around 50 applicants per time slot)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;queueing at the embassy entrance so the staff can inspect your appointment papers and tell you where to go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;queueing in a holding area outside the processing building. There&amp;rsquo;s seats, and they&amp;rsquo;ll let people proceed to the next step one row of seats at a time. There&amp;rsquo;s snacks and water you can buy here, but it felt awkward to buy because you don&amp;rsquo;t know when your row might suddenly be called to go ahead. Also, this is the last time you get to stay seated for the entire process, once you go in you might have to stand in line(s) for about an hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(step 1) pre-screening. A Filipino embassy staff member will review your documents and your photo. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t upload a photo when you submitted the form online, they&amp;rsquo;ll ask you to go to a photo taking area and get a photo taken and come back to their counter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(step 2) biometrics. There&amp;rsquo;s a helpful American at this window who will take your fingerprints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(step 3) interview. An American will be asking you questions and they will pass or fail your visa application on the spot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people take a lot longer than others at step 3, and it can make you a bit anxious when you can see the person in front of you being grilled intensely. One lady in a window in front of me was asked how long she planned to stay, and she said &amp;ldquo;one to five months&amp;rdquo; and the interviewer seemed irritated at the vagueness of the reply. &amp;ldquo;Which is it, one month or five months, those are completely different!&amp;rdquo; Another lady and her son said they wanted to visit a sick relative and they had to present a certification from the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My interview was pretty straightforward, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even need any of the documents I prepared. The guy asked me about my purpose of travel, where I had travelled before, and what kind of work I did. He drilled down a bit into the work question, asking me what kind of software I did, which I suspect was just to make sure I wasn&amp;rsquo;t BSing him about being a dev. Overall my time at the window didn&amp;rsquo;t take more than five minutes I think, and he said &amp;ldquo;Ok, I&amp;rsquo;m approving your application and you&amp;rsquo;ll get your visa in a week.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to worry about as long as you&amp;rsquo;re honest about your reasons for travelling (no intention to deceive) and you&amp;rsquo;re confident (don&amp;rsquo;t look sketchy, which should be easy if you&amp;rsquo;re honest!). I would imagine being able to communicate well in English also helps a lot, that&amp;rsquo;s a bit elitist, but such is life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It worried me a bit that I left without any proof that I had left my passport with them, like a receipt or such. What if they lost it and claim they never had it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&amp;rsquo;s just my unnecessary worrying. My passport came back to me by courier three days after the interview, with the visa approved, ten years multiple entry. I&amp;rsquo;m going to the US!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I had an out of country trip last weekend to Kuala Lumpur to play Magic, but I was a bit tempted to not write about it all. The reason being that inevitably after one of these MTG-related trips the first thing people ask me is &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nanalo ka ba?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; (Did you win?) and this time, the answer was sadly no. (Let&amp;rsquo;s get the spoilers out of the way early shall we.) However, I realized that not all stories have to have happy endings. Sometimes the journey itself is the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, it was my first trip ever to Malaysia, and as I like to use this blog to remember past events, it&amp;rsquo;s probably a good idea to write a little bit about it. If you&amp;rsquo;re here just to get my opinions on Malaysia and want to skip the MTG bits here you go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weather was hot, but nowhere near as hot as manila&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look and feel more like Singapore than Manila. I was expecting it to be closer to Manila, but I guess with the proximity to Singapore the similarity makes more sense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food is more expensive than Manila, again probably due to Singapore being a few hours away by bus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to sample the public transpo, we mostly either walked or took a Grab anywhere. We didn&amp;rsquo;t really have time to do anything touristy anyway as we were either prepping for the RPTQ or tired from doing poorly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did like how the airport was like 50km away from the city proper. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the terrible things about NAIA is that there&amp;rsquo;s no space between the airport and Metro Manila. There&amp;rsquo;s also a fixed grab rate when travelling from the airport, so that was cool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still have 100+ extra ringgit. I&amp;rsquo;m selling, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested LOL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the MTG bits: I was actually not intending to do any foreign travel this year, mostly because I had decided to lay low with MTG for a while after last year&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2017/12/grand-prix-singapore-2017-tournament-report/&#34;&gt;lackluster performances&lt;/a&gt;. I was so decided to skip standard for this year that during that last trip I left my standard deck with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/switchfollows&#34;&gt;@switchfollows&lt;/a&gt; in Singapore so he would have some cards for the GP they have in June. Around February, another friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/aleksfelipe&#34;&gt;@aleksfelipe&lt;/a&gt; tells me that he has a deferred invite to the 25A RPTQ happening in Kuala Lumpur in June. The format for that RPTQ happened to be Team Unified Standard, so Alex would need to bring two more players as his teammates. Among our old playgroup, it was really only him and me and Switch who were still sort of playing regularly and at a kind of competitive level, so we were the chosen team!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the problems of card availability came up. Switch was in Singapore, and he had most of the standard-legal cards with him. Alex and I were in the Philippines, with much less cards available. We had been planning to purchase the &lt;a href=&#34;https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/challenger-decks-lists-2018-02-23&#34;&gt;standard challenger decks&lt;/a&gt; when they came out, so that helped get us a bunch of other cards we needed. The timing was tough too. &lt;a href=&#34;https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/dominaria&#34;&gt;Dominaria&lt;/a&gt; would be coming out around a month before the RPTQ, which meant we didn&amp;rsquo;t know what decks we could play until then. We also didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend too much resources on singles, since the trip was already costing us some money. Between the usual work business and the fact that our card pool was split across two countries, we also did not have time for playtesting. As the date of the RPTQ drew near, it was increasingly likely that we would need to assemble our decks on-site and just do our testing there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did manage to get a bit of support from a local gaming store that let us borrow some cards we were missing, so shout out to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/kcrollplay/&#34;&gt;Roll Play Game Lounge&lt;/a&gt; for their support (although we totally fumbled the ball.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We eventually settled on playing RB midrange, GB constrictor, and UB Improvise (&amp;ldquo;Anguished Affinity&amp;rdquo;). We decided against even trying to assemble a UW control deck because (a) we were missing too many pieces (mainly &lt;a class=&#34;cardname&#34; href=&#34;http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;type=card&amp;name=Disallow&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;Disallow&lt;/a&gt; and the white sideboard mythics &amp;ndash; &lt;a class=&#34;cardname&#34; href=&#34;http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;type=card&amp;name=Lyra%20Dawnbringer&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;Lyra Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;cardname&#34; href=&#34;http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;type=card&amp;name=History%20of%20Benalia&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;History of Benalia&lt;/a&gt;); and (b) we felt that piloting a control deck required a comprehensive understanding of the metagame, which we didn&amp;rsquo;t have with our limited prep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our configuration ended up being Switch in Seat A with RB midrange, me in Seat B with GB constrictor and Alex in Seat C with UB Improvise. Here is the GB list I piloted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;mtgdecklist&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;GB Constrictor&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of how hot it was and how we&amp;rsquo;d been sweating a lot during the trip and how we somehow decided to all play black decks, we jokingly referred to ourselves as Team Black Pawis. This turned out to be an unlucky team name LOL. We managed to practice a few matchups (including with a proxied UW control) on-site Friday and Saturday. Our red matchups didn&amp;rsquo;t feel too good, but it was too late to switch. All we could do was hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the tournament itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The turnout was huge, with 82 teams opting to play. I think as many as ten Philippine teams and probably a bit more Singaporean teams. The organizer actually had to switch to a larger venue to accommodate everyone (which caused not a bit of inconvenience from groups who had chosen to book early). I suppose the team nature of the event and the fact that an invitee could bring his friends along vastly increased interest in the tournament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of the larger venue, it could indeed hold all the teams, but their airconditioning was not up to it, so we ended up sweating a lot throughout the event. Team Black Pawis indeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We did quite poorly. Dropped after four losses and only one win which was a no-show. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even win a match. A lot of it was due to lack of preparation and poor positioning/deck choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losing of course was a feel-bad, as it always is for me. My teammates were not quite as spikey as I was, so they took it a bit better. I mentioned to Alex that his invite might have gone to better use if he had looked for other players who were actively playing standard at the time. He correctly responded that the thought never crossed his mind, that the opportunity to play in a team tournament with friends who he had known for a while was what he wanted. It was a good reminder for me that winning isn&amp;rsquo;t always everything. The trip was not a waste since we did enjoy our prep time and had some fun moments and catching up with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight/afterwards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We sent Switch off back to Singapore with his RB deck. We felt that monored probably would&amp;rsquo;ve been a simpler choice, and far easier to pilot as well, so he might decide to switch that up for his GP next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll probably still try to play the same deck in standard PPTQs before Core 2019 comes out, with minor adjustments. At the very least, will probably add 1-2 &lt;a class=&#34;cardname&#34; href=&#34;http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&amp;type=card&amp;name=Blossoming%20Defense&#34; target=&#34;_new&#34;&gt;Blossoming Defense&lt;/a&gt; somewhere in the 75.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team Unified Standard was a fun puzzle. I think we did get the general solution in the days leading up the tournament, but lack of card availability and flexibility left us unable to execute that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a while I tried to metagame the seating arrangements but I gave up because realistically there&amp;rsquo;s no way to predict what other teams would do. One of our opponents did give us a good insight though: they put the quick monored deck in the middle seat, so that no matter what, his decisions would be quicker and he would have more time to advise the other team members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex and I are also qualified for PH Nationals in July, so that&amp;rsquo;s something to look forward to. Unfortunately, that tournament happens in week 1 of a new meta, so I&amp;rsquo;ll probably be playing the same deck again, with whatever adjustments needed for Core 2019.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just for fun, I also started compiling &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/user/12136350922/playlist/0yXbBinhLNAaSAVNaIl8pd&#34;&gt;a trip playlist.&lt;/a&gt; Then I stopped because I could only remember three relevant songs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call Me Maybe &amp;ndash; was playing on the radio during the Grab trip from the airport, and for some reason it got stuck in my head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All Star &amp;ndash; only because during our late night testing we ended up watching a few of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYmBRsXr995owHHryHYPzFQ&#34;&gt;Jon Sudano&amp;rsquo;s videos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be Prepared &amp;ndash; this was the main takeaway from the defeat! For me personally, the biggest takeaway is that preparation is always important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My new, upgraded set of rules (an improvement over the ones from the GP Singapore post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be prepared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mulligan well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think before scooping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life is unfair&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for &amp;ldquo;laying low&amp;rdquo;. Ah Magic, you are such a hard game to quit.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I took a 5-day trip to Singapore last weekend, mostly to play in &lt;a href=&#34;https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpsin17&#34;&gt;the Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt;, but the opportunity to get away from the country for a while was appreciated. These are some notes and anecdotes from the trip. (Not about the GP itself, that&amp;rsquo;s a separate post on its own.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By my count this would be my 5th visit to Singapore. That means Singapore now ties Hong Kong for my most visited foreign destination. My last HK visit was back in 2009, there was no overlap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normally when flying out I prefer to check luggage so that I&amp;rsquo;m not carrying much on the plane. This time I decided to go the opposite route. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t prepaid for any checked baggage so I tightly packed 5 days worth of clothes into a single backpack for hand carry. It was 0.2kg over the limit, but the lady at the check-in counter didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My flight was 5am from Manila to Singapore, mostly so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t run afoul of the horrible December traffic on the way to the airport. This plan would have worked better had I not also decided to watch The Last Jedi on it&amp;rsquo;s first night, mere hours before the flight. That meant I was quite sleepy while waiting at the airport. I&amp;rsquo;m not one of those people who can sleep alone at the airport &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m worried about people touching my stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The plane I was getting on was one of those smaller ones with six seats to a row and a single aisle in between. I&amp;rsquo;d ridden in one of these before, but this was the first time I managed to take a look at how tiny the plane was from the window at the boarding gate. It was barely bigger than an EDSA city bus. I&amp;rsquo;ve flown many times and I understand the physics, but I&amp;rsquo;m still amazed that basically a big chunk of metal carries us across the skies by momentum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tall people problem no. 37: practically impossible to get a decent sleep on these budget airlines with their little to no legroom and seat backs too short. I managed to get a few  pockets of sleep but nothing continuous as I had to keep adjusting my neck every so often. The flight was three and a half hours, fitbit says I managed to get around 1 hour of sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I met up with a friend at Changi&amp;rsquo;s new terminal 4. This terminal was new enough that my flight itinerary still said terminal 2. I would be crashing at my friend&amp;rsquo;s place for the trip. I think I&amp;rsquo;d stayed at their place twice before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We took a long train ride to Tiong Bahru where we had a Mos Burger for brunch before taking a bus back to their place. When I originally booked the trip, I assumed I would have free time Thursday to wander about a bit, since the MTG event starts Friday. However, due to lack of sleep I ended up just taking an afternoon nap and mostly lazing around for the rest of the day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internet in Singapore is of course much better and faster than in Manila. But it&amp;rsquo;s a bit less tourist-friendly than say, Tokyo, where every Metro station and 7-11 had free wifi the wandering traveller could use. My friend lent me a mifi to use for the stay, but luckily there was free wifi at both our transition point at Tiong Bahru plaza and at the Singapore Expo where the event was being held.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had turned off my mobile data prior to boarding the plane to avoid exorbitant roaming charges. Despite that, I managed to accidentally pocket dial someone back home. I&amp;rsquo;ll find out how much that costs in my next bill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aside from the internet, the other thing I like about visiting foreign cities is the public transit. Buses and trains were pretty much the same as I had noted in &lt;a href=&#34;http://roytang.net/2011/06/singapore/&#34;&gt;previous visits&lt;/a&gt;, except that they had managed to add a new train line since I was last here, giving us a secondary route to the expo. Basically while Manila&amp;rsquo;s MRT had been continuously breaking down over the past three years, Singapore managed to add a new line and there&amp;rsquo;s even another one in construction already. Stark contrast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Singapore doesn&amp;rsquo;t have as many train lines yet as HK or London though, and the place I was staying with was out of reach of the train lines, so I still had to transition to buses often. My friend lent me an EZLink card I could use to pay for buses and trains. A robust public transit infrastructure including buses and trains, with predictable schedules and routes you could track online, and a universal payment scheme &amp;ndash; some of my modest hopes for Metro Manila.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not much of a foodie, so I don&amp;rsquo;t really go to other countries to experience their food, so nothing too special to note in that regard. However, I found out that in Singapore, Burger King doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the 4-cheese whopper (!). Later during the MTG event I spoke with an American dude who works for BK in Singapore and he mentioned that even though the 4CW is a best seller in the Philippines, it didn&amp;rsquo;t do too well in Singapore. Their best seller is the mushroom swiss whopper thing. (Yuck mushrooms!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This my first time in Singapore in December, and I think also the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced rain here. It was a bit heavy while I was at the expo on Friday, I had to wander around Tiong Bahru Plaza a bit on the way back, to give the rain time to settle. Of course I had no umbrella, as I believed I was not allowed to bring one on a plane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were book and IT sales at the expo during the weekend I was there. I thought about buying some Marvel trades. They were selling for 10 for S$50, but I would never have been able to fit those in my backpack for the trip home. The electronics and laptops still seemed expensive, even for a sale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well, Singapore is an expensive city in general. Meals typically cost 2-3 times what they would back home in Manila. When I&amp;rsquo;m in a foreign country, I try to avoid doing the conversion math all the time for meals &amp;ndash; I went here knowing how much it costs to live here after all. I do the conversion when browsing around for stuff to buy for back home. The conversion rate of around 37php to 1SGD wasn&amp;rsquo;t convenient, but luckily my friend was a math major and told me to just divide by 8 and multiply by 300. Intuitively it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem like it would be easier, but it actually was.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another thing that strikes me whenever I&amp;rsquo;m wandering about in Singapore is the diversity. On the train, there&amp;rsquo;s always a smattering of Chinese, Indians, Filipinos, White people, etc. With the recent rise in worldwide news of people expressing hatred towards people who are not of the same descent, it&amp;rsquo;s refreshing to be in such an environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My flight home was just before 7pm on the Monday after the Grand Prix. That meant I had the day to kill, as it were. Packing when quickly (since I didn&amp;rsquo;t bring much). Spent some time wandering around a mall in the Orchard Road area. Malls in Singapore are a lot more&amp;hellip;  high end than malls in the Philippines. More like Podium and less like SM Megamall. Browsed through comics in Kinokinuya for a bit (and decided they were too expensive), then headed back to Tiong Bahru for a late lunch and then back to Changi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sadly, I had forgotten to web check-in for my flight. Because of &lt;a href=&#34;http://roytang.net/2015/11/travel-anxiety/&#34;&gt;travel anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m often well-prepared for flying out, but have no similar best practices for flying back. They didn&amp;rsquo;t have any of those automated check-in kiosks available either, so I had to queue with a whole bunch of OFWs. The annoying thing about OFWs flying back is that they&amp;rsquo;re often a bit older people who have a ton of luggage and hence take forever at the check-in counter. Some will even argue or haggle over how much they&amp;rsquo;re allowed to bring. One lady in front of me said she wasn&amp;rsquo;t even aware there was a limit to check-in baggage. @_@&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When it was my time to check-in, I was done in around a minute. The lady behind the counter asked to weigh my hand carry bag, luckily I had somehow shaved off some weight and it was at a comfortable 0.5kg under the limit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For outgoing immigration at Singapore, if you had your biometrics taken on your way in, you can just do automated immigration. You just scan your passport and boarding pass and your fingerprint and you&amp;rsquo;re good to go. Neat. The last time I was here, outgoing immigration gave me a scolding for losing the small piece of cardboard that was once part of the card I filled up on the way in. I didn&amp;rsquo;t need it this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminal 4 seems much smaller than terminal 2. It&amp;rsquo;s still large and spacious and kind of like a mall though. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time to browse around, other than buying some &lt;em&gt;bakkwa&lt;/em&gt; for people back home. There was an arcade area where I could play Marvel vs Capcom 2, but I was too lazy for that. And of course, there&amp;rsquo;s ample places to charge, which was nice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The plane for the flight home was bigger than the one coming on, one of those with 3 sets of 3 seats per row, with two aisles. Amazingly, I had the same seatmates as I did on the flight coming in. They were a young couple that I guess were on their honeymoon or something (they had wedding rings on). We didn&amp;rsquo;t really talk or anything, just the &amp;ldquo;Oo nga!&amp;rdquo; when I noted the coincidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really sleepy during this flight, so I spent some time drafting this blog post instead. I also managed to win some kind of Cebu Pacific pouch thing off one of those trivia games that they sometimes have. I managed to answer the incredibly challenging question &amp;ldquo;Where did the child see mommy kissing Santa Claus?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flight landed around 10:45 without incident. This schedule I booked had the same rationale as for my outgoing flight: I wanted to avoid Metro Manila traffic. However even this late wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, and I failed many times to get an Uber or a Grab. Reluctantly I queued for a regular taxi. Fighting through Metro Manila traffic, I finally managed to get home a bit past 1am, despite my cab driver being obviously sleepy. Our cab also got sideswiped along the way, with some severe damage on the front headlights and bumper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trip is in the books. Aside from doing poorly at the GP itself, it was pretty good. Good to get away for a bit and see old friends and hang out. It felt a bit weirdly casual too, like I randomly popped in to Singapore for no reason. The weekend went quickly, and so back to the grind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;So last April my friends and I took a second trip to Japan.

                &lt;p&gt;I went to Fuji, but that&amp;#39;s not in Tokyo!&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;I like Tokyo, so I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about Tokyo for now. I&amp;rsquo;ve only been here twice, but I could imagine myself living here for an extended period of time. It solves my top three problems with Metro Manila: overly hot weather, poor transportation options, and poor internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both visits I found the temperatures to be within the generally agreeable range of around 5-25 degrees celsius. The low end is slightly too cold, but manageable. Of course, I haven&amp;rsquo;t experienced actual Japanese winter, so it&amp;rsquo;s probably colder then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transportation is great and easy! There&amp;rsquo;s like twenty lines of trains or such _(OK, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really count, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot!) _and a lot of buses too. The great thing is that the trains and buses run on very exact schedules. At trains stations or bus stops you&amp;rsquo;ll see a list of times &lt;em&gt;to the minute&lt;/em&gt; telling you when the next train or bus will arrive. That kind of thing would be unheard of in Metro Manila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the downsides is that the train lines can get a bit confusing. They&amp;rsquo;re not all interconnected either &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s some lines that are part of the Tokyo Metro, while some are part of JR (Japan Rail), and so on. It can cause some confusion for example some places might have both a Metro station and a JR station, and they might not be connected. The staff are always very helpful in the train stations though, feel free to ask them how to get to a particular station. They will try their best to help even if their English isn&amp;rsquo;t the best. Most stations will also have helpful signage showing maps and routes and stuff, and the trains themselves will have announcers telling you what the next station is.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;For paying your transportation fares, there&amp;rsquo;s a few options, but for me the best one is to use an IC card &amp;ndash; these are reloadable cards that you can use on any train or bus in Tokyo. _(I have no idea what IC means.) _You can get one at the airport when you arrive &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s two providers, it&amp;rsquo;s either Suica or Pasmo and you can reload them at any train station. There&amp;rsquo;s also an option to get a 2-day or 3-day unlimited metro pass, which is a great idea if you plan to travel around Tokyo many times within a short period, but it only works with Metro lines which can be a bit restrictive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet in Tokyo is obviously very good of course. If you&amp;rsquo;re staying at an Airbnb, try to get one that provides you with a mobile wifi unit you can use while wandering about. Being a tourist these days is a lot easier with internet, given google maps and similar apps. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a mobile wifi unit, you can also leech free wifi from any 7-11 or train station!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city is also very friendly to people who like to walk &amp;ndash; during this last trip I managed to walk from Asakusa to Akihabara at one point. While wandering around if you get hungry there are always shops nearby and lots of vending machines to get a quick drink from.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;What to do in Tokyo though? If you&amp;rsquo;re a gamer or an otaku, there&amp;rsquo;s obviously Akihabara &amp;ndash; on each trip I went there more than once just to browse the numerous shops selling comics, toys, figurines, games, and so on. I would spend even more time there if I could read Japanese of course! &lt;em&gt;(Working on it!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, there&amp;rsquo;s a few tourist spots you can visit in the city proper. Some of the places I&amp;rsquo;ve been to include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Senso-ji temple in Asakusa. This is a good place to visit mainly because Asakusa is a good area to stay in, as many of the places to visit are easily accessible from Asakusa station&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Skytree in Asakusa. I only climbed the Skytree during the second trip, it offers a great view of the city.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Tower. It&amp;rsquo;s smaller than the Skytree, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure fans of Rayearth will want to visit it haha. I visited it on this last trip to see &lt;em&gt;One Piece&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; exhibits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shibuya crossing. It&amp;rsquo;s a famous crosswalk for some reason, and there&amp;rsquo;s also a statue here of that dog &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachik%C5%8D&#34;&gt;Hachiko&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;rsquo;s also a lot of shopping places nearby if you like that kind of thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t have much you want to visit in Tokyo proper, it&amp;rsquo;s a great base of operations that you can use to visit nearby areas. That&amp;rsquo;s what we did during this trip. You can leave most of your luggage in storage &amp;ndash; there are coin lockers in the major stations &amp;ndash; and just take an overnight bag to visit nearby tourist spots like Fuji or Edo wonderland in Nikko.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure when I&amp;rsquo;ll visit Japan again &lt;em&gt;(I don&amp;rsquo;t think going there for the Olympics is a good idea)&lt;/em&gt;, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind staying in Tokyo again, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, two friends and I were being tourists in Barcelona. With its wide, spacious streets and strangely uniform city blocks, we walked around a lot. During one of our tourist days, we decided to eat some &lt;em&gt;paella&lt;/em&gt; on the way back to our AirBNB. Who comes to Barcelona and doesn&amp;rsquo;t eat &lt;em&gt;paella&lt;/em&gt; right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up walking for quite a while. Every time we came upon a new restaurant that served &lt;em&gt;paella&lt;/em&gt; we would consider the price and the restaurant and would think, hey maybe we can find somewhere better or cheaper further along the way. At one point a Pinoy working in a nearby restaurant even overheard us talking about it in Tagalog and he called after us as we walked away. &amp;ldquo;Dito, mura lang!&amp;rdquo;, but we paid him no heed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could we know which restaurant was the best one until we walked all the way and saw all the options? But walking all the way back to the AirBNB to see all the options meant we would go for a longer time tired and hungry, so that was obviously no good. Even worse, we may find at the end of the walk that the best choice was too far back and we end up with a suboptimal &lt;em&gt;paella&lt;/em&gt;. At some point, we would have to decide that &amp;ldquo;Okay, the &lt;em&gt;paella&lt;/em&gt; here looks good enough, let&amp;rsquo;s eat here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it was kind of a metaphor for life and choices and such. You can&amp;rsquo;t know ahead of time whether the options presented to you now are the best you&amp;rsquo;ll ever get. But at some point you have to stop browsing and overthinking and decide to settle for something that is &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo;. Sometimes it turns out great, sometimes it ends poorly, but it&amp;rsquo;s almost always a gamble. Life decisions are only hard if we make them hard. But as long as you made the best decision with your limited information, I think you can always choose to live without regret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up eating at this small diner near our AirBNB. It was run by an Asian dude and his family, though it seemed they spoke better Spanish than they did Chinese or whatever. I had the Valencian &lt;em&gt;paella&lt;/em&gt; which had meat instead of seafood or whatever (no surprise for anyone who knows my dietary habits.) I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether it was the best or the cheapest &lt;em&gt;paella&lt;/em&gt; we could have eaten that day, but I could tell you it was pretty damn good anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;As I write this I am at the airport, trying to kill time. As per usual, I am more than an hour early before the check-in time for my flight. It&amp;rsquo;s a thing I do, no matter where I&amp;rsquo;m travelling, that I put in lots of buffer time so I will more often than not arrive way too early and need to wait. It&amp;rsquo;s not just for flights either &amp;ndash; I have a tendency to arrive early for any sort of time sensitive appointment. (Except work of course, where I often take what I call &amp;ldquo;tactical lates&amp;rdquo;, but that&amp;rsquo;s a story for another time)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buffer time and arriving early is a form of risk management I suppose. Since flights are costly to miss, you have to manage the risks involved. It&amp;rsquo;s also a form of anxiety I guess, something I&amp;rsquo;ve been prone to lately &amp;ndash; worrying about all the things that could go wrong. I&amp;rsquo;m especially familiar with travel anxiety given how much I&amp;rsquo;ve travelled this year &amp;ndash; this is now my fourth time flying out of the country for a while. I plan to go easy on the air travel next year, I&amp;rsquo;m kind of burned out a bit by it. Not that I don&amp;rsquo;t like visiting new places, but as I mentioned above there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of anxiety around it. Some sources of anxiety are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traffic. Metro Manila right now is one of the worst (if not outright the worst) city in the world with regards to traffic. On a normal day, you&amp;rsquo;re pretty much rolling the dice on any estimate of travel time as the traffic will randomly grind to a halt unexpectedly. And I just happened to be travelling during the week that we are hosting the APEC summit, which means random road closures and traffic congestion in the southern part of the metro where the city lies. Granted, I&amp;rsquo;m targetting to arrive at the airport a bit after midnight so the risk of a traffic jam is very low, but I&amp;rsquo;d prefer not to roll the dice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flight cancellations; this is pretty much a unique risk during APEC week as a number of flights have been cancelled due to visiting dignitaries and security and whot not. There is supposedly a no-fly zone on the airport until the last day of the conference, and I&amp;rsquo;m flying out on the last day. My flight wasn&amp;rsquo;t on the cancellation list, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get a straight answer from any of the official channels whether the no fly zone would affect me. The airline&amp;rsquo;s helpline just kept me on hold for a while, not enough to hold my patience when I just wanted to confirm my flight eill push throu. Given it&amp;rsquo;s an early morning flight, the risk is again low, but still someing to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scams. Before APEC and the Paris terrorist attacks took over the local news cycle, one of the big causes of worry for travellers was the so-called &amp;ldquo;laglag bala&amp;rdquo; scam where unscrupulous airport staff would plant bullets in your luggage and proceed to extort you when they are detected at the xray machine. I don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be the target audience, but I plan to check in my luggage to minimize the odds of such problems occuring. It&amp;rsquo;s a shameful issue but the good news is that it has brought to light the sheer incompetence of officials in the transport department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgetfulness. There&amp;rsquo;s always a risk that you arrive at the airport and realise you forgot something important and have to go back. My mom likes to tell the story of hpw she once almost left for the airport to travel to Vietnam and had to go back home because she forgot her passport of all things. Or even worse, what if you travel to a foreign country and realise you forgot to pack any socks? Or underwear? (Not a true story). Nowadays I always prepare a checklist ahead of time of what I plan to bring, to minimise the risk of forgetting things. Of course, you need to remember to check the list again on the way back home &amp;ndash; during my last trip home I left my phone charger at the flat we were staying at and had to double back for it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accommodations/getting lost. This is more of a problem when you&amp;rsquo;ve already arrived at your destination and there&amp;rsquo;s some problem with the accommodations you&amp;rsquo;ve planned out. Maybe there was a problem with the booking or you got lost on the way there. For the first night on this particular trip, I&amp;rsquo;m staying alone at an airbnb in a country that isn&amp;rsquo;t primarily English-speaking. It&amp;rsquo;s also my first time using airbnb. So I have a number of things to worry about: will I be able to find the place? Will I be able to communicate well with the owner? Will he murder me in my sleep? (Ok I guess the risk of that last one is probably pretty low)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flight problems. Well, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a fear of flying per se, but I can imagine some people might, especially given how there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more incidents of flight problems, crashes or even disappearances happening latly. I would guess it&amp;rsquo;s pretty much a product of the information age&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, worrying too much about all of these things isn&amp;rsquo;t helpful of course. It&amp;rsquo;s a habit I have to rid myself of &amp;ndash; I need to learn the right amount of worrying that&amp;rsquo;s appropriate enough to manage the risks, but not enough to drive myself crazy. After all, one of the reasons for travelling is a sense of adventure and to anxiety so I should learn to let go of my worries and enjoy being out of my comfort zone for a while&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A stegosaurus from China. It&amp;amp;rsquo;s named after the town where it was found (which I don&amp;amp;rsquo;t remember)&lt;/p&gt;
    



&lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/08/10154052506198912/_hu393f104ec26a82c0dfdf9a1ad230de98_69079_3885140860428bab7071a70132d51d32.jpg&#34; /&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;That&amp;amp;rsquo;s a terrible looking mouse lol&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I had to talk to a stranger so that I&amp;amp;rsquo;d have proof I really went lol&lt;/p&gt;
    



&lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/08/10154052506198912/_hu79b8313c4516f9a9b2f65018d60af3e1_33968_8af16865b6a9a6b8c22df266e0c80e79.jpg&#34; /&gt;

    
    &lt;p&gt;This is supposed to be half of Charles Babbage&amp;amp;rsquo;s brain, from the history of computing exhibit&lt;/p&gt;
    



&lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/08/10154052506198912/_hu490d0ad16014576810ffa1fd70ae8194_68741_57491364f9ca6cc2e3077386617508a1.jpg&#34; /&gt;

    
    &lt;p&gt;T-Rex/Grimlock!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Velociraptor skeletons and animatronic velocity raptors. Sadly I did not have time to do the Chris Pratt/Jurassic World thing&lt;/p&gt;
    



&lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/08/10154052506198912/_huc4ccaf56e48c163099e3687abd63f3e5_53642_1c94a9980a628fe80b210ac00cd89d95.jpg&#34; /&gt;

    
    &lt;p&gt;The content of the Science Museum is more like things of academic interest. Still interesting (if not nerdy), but i was a bit tired so I kinda breezed through the exhibits&lt;/p&gt;
    



&lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/08/10154052506198912/_hu8be92e87904eee567e6bb2f6291b2ae4_40351_376ee9041d33f6dfaf4d5d0f12ed0179.jpg&#34; /&gt;

    
    &lt;p&gt;Animatronic T-Rex. It moves and roars. I was sad that they didn&amp;amp;rsquo;t have a skeleton&lt;/p&gt;
    



&lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/08/10154052506198912/_hu627eaa860f23081f3fe43dc73a004cee_73940_c72a51f1fd27bf02b2e85b6583121dd5.jpg&#34; /&gt;

    
    &lt;p&gt;Sabretooth tiger! Or cat, whatever&lt;/p&gt;
    



&lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/08/10154052506198912/_hue2c90ff35f2b0ecf6e7b98fb43ea6b64_90357_e26e590ff1a7c809c6d9990f82f8f3d0.jpg&#34; /&gt;

    
    &lt;p&gt;Diplodocus/Sludge (okay, Sludge is actually an Apatosaurus, but this was the closest one)&lt;/p&gt;
    



&lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/08/10154052506198912/_hue5d0e50a7d43d8a2db81d559e3e7edd9_83704_93027818e69acaa2c725125c6fedae6c.jpg&#34; /&gt;

    
    &lt;p&gt;Life-size blue whale model. There&amp;amp;rsquo;s a blue whale skeleton suspended above it. The blue whale was smaller than I&amp;amp;rsquo;d have imagined, but still huge&lt;/p&gt;
    



&lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/08/10154052506198912/_hu3ee3421ad33059b97c0468e3f78e6ac9_55722_3e90482308d25e7e268a4a2f6e42b052.jpg&#34; /&gt;

    
    &lt;p&gt;Stegasauros/Snarl&lt;/p&gt;
    



&lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/08/10154052506198912/_hu9ab225223b97db8e01bb292c78d421f4_77118_d531522c7c0feb28ec50547c40767509.jpg&#34; /&gt;

    
    &lt;p&gt;Giraffes are taller than blue whales!&lt;/p&gt;
    



&lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/08/10154052506198912/_hu14448ffecdf8ae8202694cb34857dd3d_35776_e7d465315690c8cec27bc612fef709bc.jpg&#34; /&gt;

    
    &lt;p&gt;T-Rex/Grimlock!&lt;/p&gt;
    



&lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/08/10154052506198912/_hu97bec70aa69a054f63621c6a70c1d535_45841_f4a78c35c4aaac26aad3a8d28ea22273.jpg&#34; /&gt;

    
    &lt;p&gt;I was disappointed to learn that this was a replica and the original was in the Smithsonian. Then I realised that it made sense because this one looked far too easy to steal&lt;/p&gt;
    



&lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/08/10154052506198912/_hu3d2aab84cee232cf63c1d102b1b27d2d_51284_d5cd082453879e4d2c1fc69d082c5772.jpg&#34; /&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;British Museum&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I&amp;amp;rsquo;m disappointed that there wasn&amp;amp;rsquo;t a Philippine exhibit (the Asian exhibits were mostly Japan, China and India). Also no giant dinosaur skeletons. It was nothing like Night at the Museum at all&lt;/p&gt;
    



&lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/08/10154037353488912/_hub484876e7a878fa9eb100af5a9f9fabb_57463_da2146c301635a882b9e00b65d6e0204.jpg&#34; /&gt;

    
    &lt;p&gt;Sculptures from the Parthenon. They should give them back, Greece could use the tourist dollars&lt;/p&gt;
    



&lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/08/10154037353488912/_huf7b6e5ae107474455b7465ce620827fb_84018_995d3f79674f415c41bbfc15ff4ddcf5.jpg&#34; /&gt;

    
    &lt;p&gt;Assyrian Lion Hunt reliefs. Apparently they shot one of the lions out of midair&lt;/p&gt;
    



&lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/08/10154037353488912/_huabe4247a1d59a2c0a93deafa465a2426_50331_490251c6896fa7722cde57b01edf3daa.jpg&#34; /&gt;

    
    &lt;p&gt;The Portland Vase. Made from cameo glass, apparently there&amp;amp;rsquo;s only around 40 samples of cameo glass from olden days (or at least the guide person said)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Oxus treasure, fabulous metalwork from ancient Iran&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Rosetta Stone. I couldn&amp;amp;rsquo;t get a better picture because of all the tourist. I don&amp;amp;rsquo;t think it uses UTF-8&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A pendant-mask made from ivory, from Africa. I find that I wasn&amp;amp;rsquo;t as interested in the African exhibits as compared to the European ones&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Medieval-era samurai armor. Didn&amp;amp;rsquo;t fit me.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Lewis chessmen, supposedly the most well known chess set in the world. Why haven&amp;amp;rsquo;t I heard of it before? And what happened to that missing rook?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Royal Game of Ur, some sort of old-school boardgame with weird button dice&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Some statues recovered from the tomb of a Tang dynasty general. I don&amp;amp;rsquo;t see the resemblance&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;GP Singapore 2015 would be my first Modern GP and maybe only my 3rd or 4th Modern event altogether. Modern is a difficult format to prepare for; there are many decks to prepare for and it&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to master all the matchups. For this reason, I felt much less prepared for this event than for &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/02/grand-prix-manila-2015/&#34;&gt;GP Manila back in January&lt;/a&gt;. I put together Grixis Twin for this event. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit difficult to pilot, but I felt it had a reasonable matchup across the board and there&amp;rsquo;s always a chance of comboing out when you&amp;rsquo;re falling behind. Here&amp;rsquo;s the list I played:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;mtgdecklist&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Grixis Twin&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how my day 1 shook out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R1 2-0 WIN vs grixis twin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R2 2-1 WIN vs coco elves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R3 1-1 DRAW vs abzan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R4 2-0 WIN vs gw coco&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R5 2-0 WIN vs grixis twin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R6 2-1 WIN vs red burn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R7 2-0 WIN vs affinity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R8 1-2 LOSS vs rg tron&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R9 1-2 LOSS vs merfolk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course 6-2-1 doesn&amp;rsquo;t qualify for day 2. Getting eliminated in the last 2 rounds makes me feel a bit salty. The draw vs abzan was because I lost game 1 and boarded into grindy control. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I should have tried to quickly win game 2 first. The loss to RG tron was close; if I had won the die roll I think I would have taken the match, although I did make some sloppy plays in game 3 as well. Merfolk was an uphill battle &amp;ndash; this was one of the matchups I had not prepared for and it seems horribly bad for my side. Game 1 he had the first turn Aether Vial, which seemed to be unbeatable. I managed to eke out a win game 2 after a timely Anger of the Gods and finally running out his Vapor Snags so I could combo off. Cursecatcher + Spell Pierce kept me off Anger of the Gods in game 3 long enough for a 2nd and 3rd lord to push through lethal damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of course with not making day 2 is that one doesn&amp;rsquo;t really plan on it, so you&amp;rsquo;re never sure what to do on Sunday. I skipped out on the Sunday Super Series and instead decided to play some Chaos Sealed on Sunday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the Champions of Kamigawa, Worldwake and Rise of Eldrazi packs of course one would hope for some significant value like Jace the Mindsculptor or maybe even just a Sensei&amp;rsquo;s Divining Top or some such. Instead I got such hits as Terra Eternal, Spearbreaker Behemoth, Spawnsire of Ulamog and Kusari-Gama. At least I got a Jace Architect of Thought and an Ojutai Soul of Winter which were good enough to get me 4 wins in 5 rounds of swiss. I wanted to claim a complete set of DTK with the points I won, but it took too long for my results to come in and someone got the last set before me. So I settled for a booster box and a t-shirt instead.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I didn&amp;rsquo;t too well this trip, but at least there&amp;rsquo;s still some swag and some winnings so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a complete loss. And it&amp;rsquo;s always good to visit with my friends in Singapore so overall it was a good trip. I might be able to hit another GP later this year&amp;hellip; it depends on how work plans shake out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This series of posts has taken longer than I thought it would, and I grow weary on it. We&amp;rsquo;ll cover things a bit faster from here, less of the daily stuff and we&amp;rsquo;ll stick to the highlights. This will be the final entry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday March 15th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Sunday we took a long walk to visit the famous Louvre museum (why go to Paris and not see the Louvre). The French person behind the ticket booth greeted us in Tagalog when we told him we were from the Philippines. I was pleasantly surprised to find out the audioguide offered for the museum used a Nintendo 3DS XL and a custom cartridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The museum had a lot of Greek and Roman pieces and of course French artwork. Some of the things I found most interesting follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tickets we had gotten also let us visit another nearby museum, but we were and had already spent most of the day in the Louvre so we decided to pass on that. We walked around a bit more, passing by one of the Paris bridges with love locks all over it. We ended our walk at the famous Notre Dame church; still tired, we passed on the long queue to get into the cathedral and took a taxi back to our hotel to rest up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday March 16th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a late breakfast of omelettes at a nearby French cafe, we spent the first half of the day travelling to the Eiffel Tower and hanging out at the base of the tower for a while, near a grassy area where there were a lot of other people just lounging around. We held off on going up the tower, saving it for our last day. Nothing of import happened for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday March 17th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had set aside this day to travel to Versailles, which required us to take a longer train ride out of Paris. We took a short walk from the train station to the Chateau, bought our tickets and got audio guides (from which we learned a lot). Some highlights follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we managed to visit most if not all of the rooms of the Chateau, which gave me a new perspective on how ostentatious the life of royalty really was and a better appreciation of French history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Chateau we went prowling around the gardens which were huge. We visited the Grand Trianon and Petit Trianon, smaller complexes which were the residence of Marie Antoinette, and spent some time being lost on our way back to the Chateau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was late in the afternoon by the time we finished our tour of the Chateau and the Gardens, well worth the trip. We took the train back to Paris and decided to have an expensive dinner at a fancy French restaurant (one of the few times we decided to splurge on food). I had a French onion soup and a rather large pork chop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday March 18th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After eating our last breakfast at the old lady&amp;rsquo;s pattiserie near our hotel, we took the Metro to the Montmarte hill overlooking Paris and famous for the white-domed Basilica of the Sacré Cœur (&amp;ldquo;Sacred Heart&amp;rdquo;), though we didn&amp;rsquo;t bother going inside the church. We spent some time here listening to a street performer and taking pictures of pigeons (omitted here for brevity, available upon request)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked back to our hotel, passing by the famous Moulin Rouge. We decided to rest and split up for the remainder of the day and just meet up later in the afternoon for our climb up the Eiffel Tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a leisurely afternoon walk to the Eiffel and waited for my companions at the same grassy spot we hung out at before. As the afternoon grew late, the wind grew bitingly cold and I was thankful when they finally arrived so that we could go up the tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday March 19th to Sunday March 22nd&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We flew back to Barcelona Thursday morning. We had booked a different hotel for our last leg, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://charmsuites.com/&#34;&gt;Charm Suites&lt;/a&gt; along Parallel Ave. It turns out the staff were mostly Filipinos so they were very welcoming to us. The 3-person hotel room was easily the best we had booked for the trip. The room was large and came with a large TV, a fridge, a kitchen area with plates, utensils and a stove for cooking and thankfully free wi-fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent the last leg of the trip in decompression mode, mostly relaxing at the hotel room. I was planning to attend a Dragons of Tarkir (MTG) Prerelease that weekend so I took a 30-minute walk Thursday to find the place I would be playing at, which turned out to be in an area filled with shops relevant to my interests: toy stores, book stores, comic stores, etc. I decided to register for the prerelease at Gigamesh, a large sci-fi/fantasy/comic book store with a back room for the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the weekend we took a leisurely afternoon/evening walk to the Barcelona coast so that we could make contact with the Mediterranean sea and having seaside paella for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent Saturday at Gigamesh having a good time playing with Spanish cards at the DTK prerelease. I had spent some time during the past few days studying up on the card lists in Spanish, worried that I would have a tough time with the local players. Most of them understood English well enough though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Sunday was our flight back to Manila through Singapore, and the end of our trip. And the end of this series of posts, I hope you enjoyed it &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;d be willing to go into such detail again haha. Well, I have a couple more trips planned this year, so let&amp;rsquo;s see what happens there. Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday March 13th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was our last day in Rome and we were planning to visit the Colosseum and the nearby Palatino Hill. It was a long walk and we passed by a few palaces and the usual open plazas, many of the landmarks identified by Egpytian obelisks placed there by the Roman emperors. Rome is chock-full of cobblestone roads and plazas lined with souvenir shops and pizzerias and buildings fronted by 12-foot-high steel doors with large lion-head knockers and churches liberally sprinkled every other block. One of the churches we passed through was the Santa Maria in Cosmedin church which featured the Bocca del Verita/Mouth of Truth, made famous by the 1953 film Roman Holiday. There&amp;rsquo;s a short queue outside the church for tourists wanting to take a picture at the Mouth of Truth.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;The church itself wasn&amp;rsquo;t too large &amp;ndash; it was only a minor basilica, but there was a display of the relics of St. Valentine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also passed by a large elliptical open field on the way to the Colosseum, which we found out later to be the site of the Circus Maximus. It used to be the site of ancient Roman chariot races. For some reason, I decided to pick up a rock from the field and take it back home as a souvenir (hopefully not illegal LOL)&lt;/p&gt;








    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    

&lt;p&gt;After that we arrived at the Colosseum itself. Outside the Colosseum were the usual merchants selling various souvenirs including replica Roman soldier helmets and swords. I asked the merchant how much one of them was an he jokingly told me it was one million euro. There were some people offering guided tours, but we decided to go our own this time. The ticket price was 16 euro for a combination ticket that gave us access to the Colosseum and the nearby Palatino Hill and Roman forum.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;The Colosseum had a few exhibits inside showing artifacts recovered from the site that gave insights as to how the ancient Romans enjoyed the games, including graffiti from the stone seats depicting Roman gladiators and pots and pans indicating the audience cooked meals while watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Colosseum has three levels and a basement level, although our ticket did not allow us access to the basement. It was thankfully a rather warm day although still a bit windy, as we spent some time going around the first and second levels. I had to resist the urge to shout &amp;ldquo;ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just across the street from the Colosseum and up an inclined road was the entrance to the Palatine Hill and Roman Forum. We head up the elevated area first to go around the gardens and building ruins of the former palace. We were already a bit tired by this point and climbing up the hill was exhausting but it did afford us a good elevated view of the Colosseum and the nearby sights.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;We wasted some time trying to figure out the correct path to climb down the hill (we totally weren&amp;rsquo;t lost!) At the base of the hill we visited the ruins of the Roman Forum (disappointingly, it was just a bunch of stones) and we also visited a couple of temples before deciding that we were too tired to look at everything. Tapped out, we tried to figure out where the exit was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked back to our hotel, stopping for a late lunch of sandwiches at a small corner shop and later on at a gelato place along the way where the young woman behind the register somehow managed to figure out we were fellow Filipinos while we perused the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was still early, but since we had a late lunch that day so my companions didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go have dinner any more. But I felt like while I was in Rome I should eat more pasta so I headed out into the chilly night and decided to return to the Montecarlo and I had some gnocchi despite not being too hungry (it was still pretty good!) After dinner, I headed back to hotel and we rested up for the trip to Paris the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday March 14th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a slight scare with a delay in finding our check-in luggage, we took a taxi from the ORLY airport in Paris to our hotel. The taxi turned out more expensive than we had expected, but I think by that time we were at a point in the trip that we were more willing to spend than be tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hotel was the Hotel Camelia International on Rue Darcet. We were greeted at the lobby by a grumpy-looking one-legged Frenchman who reminded me of Ray&amp;rsquo;s father from &lt;em&gt;Everybody Loves Raymond&lt;/em&gt;. He confirmed our reservation and gave us keys for our room on the sixth floor, instructing us to use the lift. The lift turned out to be able to carry only two people at the time, so we had to take two trips. The room itself was mostly just the three beds crammed into a tight space. The bathroom/toilet had no lock and if you were sitting on the bidet, the door would slam right into you when it opened. The room had no wi-fi &amp;ndash; you would need to go sit at the common area in front of the reception to use the wifi. We did not take the breakfast option at this hotel, which turned out to be a good idea, as it turned out later to be only a croissant and coffee. While pleasant enough, the place was easily the worst among the places we stayed at during the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of rest we headed out to find something to eat and ended up ending at a restaurant serving South-Asian style food where I had some sort of shawarma type of thing. As usual while eating we planned out our day: we decided today to visit at least the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs-Elysees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paris wasn&amp;rsquo;t like Rome with all the crowds and tourist spots so close together, it was closer to Barcelona with wide streets and lots of open spaces. Like Rome, there seemed to be no skyscrapers in Paris; we passed by what seemed to be residential neighborhoods lined with trees coming back from winter cut in identical patterns. We arrived at the rotunda surrounding the Arc de Triomphe and we took the tunnel to cross the road to the island where it was. We decided not to pay the fee to climb the Arc since we were planning to climb the Eiffel later on and we would get a better view from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there we made our way to the Champs-Elysees. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what I expected, but it was full of fancy, high-end shops. Lots of tourists too. We only went into a couple of shops (I&amp;rsquo;m not really into shopping). The wind was brisk and cold as we made our way down the avenue; eventually we moved past the area full of shops and arrived at a couple of museums adorned with gilded fences and statues of angelic hosts, I believe one of them was the Grand Palais.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there we walked a bit south until we were at the Seine near the Pont Alexandre, a well-decorated bridge which gave us a good view of the Eiffel Tower in the distance. The bridge was surrounded by pillars on each end with ornate gold statues atop them. Apparently this bridge is a popular location for prenup pics; we counted no less than 6 couples in tuxedos and wedding gowns having their pictures taken on or near the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was almost dusk by then so we started to make our way back to the hotel. We make our way through a maze of streets named after different capital cities, passing near the La Madeleine church. By this time night had rolled around and the buildings and restaurants are illuminated in various shades of neon. We arrive at the hotel late at night, and we turn in early in preparation for more walking around the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We took the train ride to the top of the Eiffel, almost 300m above sea level. It was ridiculously cold at the top too, my hoodie was nowhere near enough&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After enjoying the view from the top of the tower, we descended and enjoyed the tower&amp;amp;rsquo;s light show&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A display atop the tower showed the distance from different capital cities around the world, and the height of the highest building there, for comparison to the Eiffel. I have no idea what this Stratford Residences is though&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Apparently there&amp;amp;rsquo;s always a big crowd around the Mona Lisa. I honestly found it a bit underwhelming, given how famous it is.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Supposedly if you lie with your hand inside the mouth, you will lose your hand. I would have pretended to lose my hand, but the guy ahead of us in the queue already did that gag&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There&amp;amp;rsquo;s a series of rooms with detailed paintings of Greek myths which left me looking up all the time. I think this Apollo one was my favorite&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Hall of Battles was easily my favorite thing in the Chateau, I paid attention to each of the battles/paintings discussed by the audioguide. Typically, I have already forgotten most of the information, but I was well entertained&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There&amp;amp;rsquo;s a series of rooms where normal people could get a glimpse of the king and queen&amp;amp;rsquo;s daily lives, including their bedrooms and this dining room&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Winged Victory of Samothrace. Well, I may have accidentally clicked on the detailed guide for  this piece and thus spent some extra time here&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Previously: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/03/europe-trip-2015/&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/04/europe-2015-barcelona-part-1/&#34;&gt;Barcelona Part 1&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/04/europe-2015-barcelona-part-2/&#34;&gt;Barcelona Part 2&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/album/europe2015&#34;&gt;Europe trip photo album&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday March 11th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s early in the morning when the shuttle picks us up to take us to the airport for our flight to Rome. When we first planned the trip a few months back, only Spain and France were on the itinerary. But due to a last-minute change in circumstances, we decided to add Italy to the trip. We had also acquired a railpass and were planning to travel by train between Spain and France, but given the change of plans we decided to refund the railpass (up to 85% of the cost can be refunded) and we literally booked inter-Europe flights during our layover in Singapore at the start of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had booked all of our inter-Europe flights on Vueling, a Spain-based budget airline. I was a bit apprehensive about it since internet searches led to some stories of people having trouble with lost baggage, but luckily they were able to get us and our luggage to Rome safely and without incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arrival at the Rome airport, we went to a tourist information kiosk to get some maps and whatnot. While we were there, this Italian man kept wanting to talk to us, offering free information about a shuttle service from the airport. We already had instructions on how to get to the hotel by train, so we ignored him at first and tried to figure out ourselves where to go. Eventually we gave up and just took the shuttle service with a few other travelers. We were the last to get off the shuttle, so we got something of a preview of the different places in Rome as the other passengers were dropped off at their hotels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were dropped off on a cobblestone sidewalk in front of a four-or-five-story building with a 12-foot tall metal gate in front. We walked in cautiously and found ourselves in a short hallway with a doorway at the end. The old lady who popped up from behind the doorway told us we needed to go up one floor when we told her we were looking for our hotel called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.agoda.com/migdal-palace/hotel/rome-it.html&#34;&gt;Migdal Palace&lt;/a&gt;. Another large door on the right side of the hallway led to a stairwell. At the bottom of the stairwell was an old-timey open-air elevator made up of rusty metal bars. We only needed to go up one floor, but what the hell. We rode the small elevator up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the reception desk, we were greeted by a pretty Italian lady named Alina who spoke with accented yet clear and understandable English. She was very friendly and told us there was a room ready but we would have to wait a bit for the beds to be set up. We had not yet had breakfast at this point, so we asked her the most relevant question: was there a nearby place where we could eat some good pasta?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She directed us to a small restaurant at a corner a few blocks from the hotel, the Montecarlo, saying that she ate there all the time. We were a bit early for the lunch hour so we had to wait a few minutes for them to be ready. We were seated at an outdoors table; I ordered some carbonara, since Marco from Freehostels had recommended it, while my two companions ordered cacio e pepe, recommended by Alina at Migdal Palace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While waiting for the meals to be served we pored over the maps to plan out our Rome trip. We only had 3 days in Rome, so we allocated today for walking around a bit and seeing nearby things, then the next day we would visit the Vatican, and on the third day the Colosseum.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;div  class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;71d80861d9d5fee7d269c8b28918b928-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;

              &lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Carbonara!&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;25 Apr 2015 5:56am&#34;&gt;25 Apr 2015 5:56am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/04/europe-trip/&#34;&gt;View post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;The carbonara was very good and very cheesy; the sauce was egg-based without cream (as opposed to the cream-based ones I&amp;rsquo;m used to) and luckily no mushrooms (I dislike mushrooms). I also had a few bites of my friends&amp;rsquo; cacio e pepe and it was a strange combination of tastes but also very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After eating we headed back to the hotel where the beds had already been set up. We rested up for a bit before heading out to explore the city a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made our way through the city, passing by a couple of plazas with small fountains surrounded by a maze of irregularly-arranged cobblestone streets. Rome was easily way more crowded than Barcelona and was very much a tourist city, made obvious by the abundance of shops and street stalls peddling magnets, keychains, miniature roman helmets and other random souvenirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visited the Pantheon (an ancient Roman circular domed structure adorned with various exhibits including the remains of the ninja turtle Raphael), the church of Saint Ignatius de Loyola (which would turn out to be the first of many well-decorated churches we would visit) among other places. We made our way to the well-known Trevi Fountain, but unfortunately for us, it was undergoing renovation at this time and was drained of water. We walked around a bit more and late at night we ended up eating at this kinda fancy Italian restaurant which charged us an extra 5 euros for the tablecloth (or at least that what the chef&amp;rsquo;s gestures looked like when we asked him to explain the bill)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too much detail to talk about here, but here are some pictures I shared via Google Plus: &lt;a href=&#34;https://photos.app.goo.gl/DHC1ba4c85S6SAUf7&#34;&gt;Wednesday afternoon in Rome&lt;/a&gt;.  (You might need to be logged in to Google to access, I have no idea how this works)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday March 12th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next day we availed of the free breakfast served by Migdal Palace, which consisted of bread, croissants, eggs, goat cheese and no meat, which ranks it below the breakfast from Free Hostels. Nonetheless we had our fill before heading out for the day&amp;rsquo;s walking around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made our way west towards the Tiber river, then followed it north until we crossed the river at the Angel Bridge towards the Castel Sant&amp;rsquo;Angelo. From there we walked westward along the Via de Conciliazone which would bring us right in front of Vatican City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we approached the Vatican, a blonde lady started walking with us and offering us details about a tour package she was offering. I wanted to ignore her, but my companions started listening to her so we stopped to hear her spiel. The way she told it, the tour involved us paying 46 euro each and included a 26 euro entrance fee for the Vatican Museum and the tour groups would also have access to a special passage from the Sistine Chapel to the Basilica of St. Peter. While there was no entrance fee for the Basilica, going with a tour group would allow us to skip the ridiculously long line of the tourists waiting to enter the Basilica. However, the fee the lady was offering seemed too rich for our blood so we passed on it and carried on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached the border to Vatican City and stood there for a while contemplating how to proceed, and we were approached by another person selling tour packages. This time it was a man of South Asian descent who reminded me of Community&amp;rsquo;s Abed. He got our attention by calling out in Tagalog &amp;ldquo;pinakamura dito!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;25 Apr 2015 5:56am&#34;&gt;25 Apr 2015 5:56am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/04/europe-trip/&#34;&gt;View post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;The tour package he offered us was similar to what the blonde lady had, except he was was offering us a price of 36 euros each, or 10 euros less. While we were contemplating it, we also met with a couple of Filipino expats who were referring people to a nearby souvenir store they were involved with, and they told us the price Abed was offering was already pretty good. After some discussion, we decided to go with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were introduced to our tour guide Angelica and handed phone-sized receivers with earphones that we could use to listen to her while she talked about stuff on the tour. We started in front of the Basilica, joined by some white people, and Angelica described to us the history of Rome and Italty and Vatican City and Pope Francis and all that jazz. Pretty informative stuff, but nothing I need to repeat here. After a bunch of these introductions, we would go over to their tour office to pay the fee before heading off to the Vatican Museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were walking towards their tour office, I saw Abed calling me over away from the group, and I walked over to him and he told me that the white people that were part of our tour group had been given a higher price so that we should avoid mentioning how much we are paying. Felt a bit shady, but I guess we were getting a better deal so we ran with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After paying at the tour office, we headed over to the Vatican Museum. At that point we found out that the Vatican Museum entrance fee was actually only 16 euro, so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why both the blonde lady and Abed said it was 26 euro. Whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vatican Museum was filled with exhibits featuring statues depicting Roman emperors and other events from Roman history, including statues of Roman gods (which I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect from a Catholic institution). There was also a section filled with Catholic-focused murals and ceiling paintings. Angelica would stop at various exhibits to give us a brief background and history. We stopped at a corner of the pinecone courtyard so that Angelica could give us a briefing on the history of the Sistine Chapel &amp;ndash; apparently they were not allowed to give briefings inside the Sistine Chapel itself. Naturally she had to give us the joke about the missing first fifteen chapels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards we went into the Sistine Chapel itself. No photography was allowed inside so we spent most of the time staring upwards at Michaelangelo&amp;rsquo;s masterpieces on the ceiling (being a tourist in Rome apparently meant looking up a lot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Sistine Chapel, Angelica took our group through the secret passage reserved for tour groups. It brought us to the front entrance of St. Peter&amp;rsquo;s Basilica where the tour ended. Angelica gave us some last words and left us to take a look at the Basilica at our own leisure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m finding it difficult to find the words to describe the Basilica itself, I guess the most appropriate word to use is &lt;em&gt;grand&lt;/em&gt;. We spent one hour walking separately around the Basilica just looking at things (although I did spend some time sitting down since we had been walking through the Vatican Museum for around 3 hours before this). There&amp;rsquo;s just a lot of history and statues and paintings and chandeliers and tombs and relics. As a Catholic it was well worth the visit. On our way out we took some pictures with some Swiss Guard standing by one of the side entrances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left the Basilica at around 3pm and had a late lunch at a restaurant along the Via de Conciliazone. After that it was still early so we spent a couple more hours walking around checking a few more sites and running into some weird yet entertaining street art. We wanted to visit the Villa Medici, but it was closed on this day. Eventually we got tired and decided to take a taxi back to the hotel and rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some pictures from this day: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/04/thursday-in-rome/&#34;&gt;Thursday in Rome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To be continued&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hoping to cover all of the Rome leg in one post, but this post is already long enough as it is. It may take at least three more posts to cover everything else, I hope the audience doesn&amp;rsquo;t get tired.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Previously: I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/03/europe-trip-2015/&#34;&gt;went to Europe&lt;/a&gt;, decided I should tell you more about it and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/04/europe-2015-barcelona-part-1/&#34;&gt;started talking about Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday March 9th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For today, we had decided to visit Park Güell, a Barcelona tourist spot created by this old-timey big shot to display the works of well-known Catalanion architect Antoni Gaudi. I say &amp;ldquo;well-known&amp;rdquo; but I&amp;rsquo;ll be the first to admit that my culturally-ignorant self had not heard of him before, but he&amp;rsquo;s kind of a big deal in Barcelona with many souvenir shops sporting some thing reminiscent of his works. My travelling companions seemed to know what they were doing, so I generally deferred to them when we planned out the day during breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park was some 4 to 5 kilometers north of our hostel by foot, though as usual we took a more leisurely pace. One of the interesting things we saw along the way was a park-like area near a major thoroughfare where we found a number of old men (and one young man apparently playing hooky on what should be a school day) playing some sort of game which involved tossing metal balls around in a sand-covered lot.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;

                &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;12 Apr 2015 2:33am&#34;&gt;12 Apr 2015 2:33am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/04/europe-trip/&#34;&gt;View post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;There were benches nearby so we sat there for a while observing the game and trying to figure out the rules. As far as we could tell, first they toss a smaller ball that then acts as a target, and they have to lob the larger metal balls as close as possible to the target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching the games for a while, we decided to continue our trek. From this point on the path we were following (provided by Google Maps) started to tread uphill and I started to get a bit tired. Eventually while my two companions were taking a break and looking at something I vanished for a while as soon as I saw a supermercats so that I could buy a bottle of water and recharge a bit. Supermercats are something like a combination of a small grocery store and a convenience store (they&amp;rsquo;re everywhere, and they don&amp;rsquo;t have 7-11s), and they seem to be often run by people of South Asian or Arabic descent. Whenever I see a supermercat, the name makes me visualize some combination of a cat superman who is also half-fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continued along the uphill route, through winding paths and eventually up three flights of stone steps at a 45 degree incline, by which time I was pretty tired and was complaining a lot. I was told we were close, so we trucked on and eventually we turned a corner and found a series of outdoor escalators that would have saved us a lot of effort with those stone steps. I glared at the person guiding our route before we all laughed out loud. The entrance to the park area lay just ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We climbed up a hilly area that afforded a good view of the city of Barcelona before eventually coming upon a tourist area overlooking a sealed-off area that was actually the roof of the columned area of the park. The park was the first tourist attraction we would pay for, and though my stingy self balked a bit at paying 8 euro for the entrance, it would turn out to be one of the cheapest tourist spots we would enter anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not much to say about the Park itself, given my lack of architectural and artistic vocabulary. There&amp;rsquo;s a large columned area where the roof is lined with what I could describe as shattered plates, an impression which would turn out to be typical of Gaudi&amp;rsquo;s work.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;The columned area is surrounded by a gardens area on one side and on the other side an overhang held up by a series of earthy stone columns one of which is carved in the shape of a washer-woman (which took us a few minutes to find). There&amp;rsquo;s also an actual school inside the park (I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how that works with the entrance fees) so we get to see a playground full of children enjoying themselves as we walk around the side area to get to the actual front of the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front gate of the park features two guardhouses that give me the impression of gingerbread houses (though one of them was undergoing renovation). The gate opens to an intricately decorated walkway leading up back to the columned area. By intricately decorated, I mean there&amp;rsquo;s more of the shattered plates designs everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After touring the park we were kind of beat, and we had not yet had lunch despite it being late afternoon. So we decided to take a taxi back to the hostel and rest a bit before heading out to search for some paella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we were ready to head out, the person at the hostel reception desk recommended to us a nearby fancy restaurant a couple of corners down that had some good paella so we headed over there. However as our first lesson of how European restaurants actually work, we found out that we were too early as the place would only open at 7:30 pm. This would turn out to be typical in Europe &amp;ndash; most restaurant type places would only be open a few hours during lunch time and again a few hours during dinner time, which was bad news for us since we tended to skip some meals and eat at irregular hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undaunted, we walked around a bit for an alternative before settling on a small bar that advertised paella at less than 10 euros each. The proprietor turned out to be a Chinese person affording us the opportunity to miscommunicate with him in two languages as he did not speak English. Paella is a Valencian dish although it&amp;rsquo;s also common in Catalonia, so I went with Paella Valenciana (okay, it&amp;rsquo;s also because I eat meat and not seafood)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;After partaking heartily of the delicious paella which took a while to cook, we also ordered some churros with chocolate dip before heading back to the hostel and crashing for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday March 10th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would be having our fourth breakfast at the hostel by now, so we&amp;rsquo;ve kind of gotten to know some of the other guests. One of them is a Japanese woman who speaks clear English; she often brings in fruits from the nearby supermercats during breakfast time. She&amp;rsquo;s apparently a frequent traveler who would be visiting a few other European countries before heading back to Japan. Another person we got to know was Marco, the owner of the hostel. He&amp;rsquo;s a talkative Italian man and upon finding out where we&amp;rsquo;re from and our travel plans he talks to us about how he plans to visit Boracay soon and gives us some tips for visiting Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed out Tuesday with the intent of visiting the Sagrada Familia and not much else planned. This meant a leisurely walk along the Diagonal road, one of the major thoroughfares running across Barcelona. It&amp;rsquo;s called the Diagonal because it cuts diagonally across what is otherwise Barcelona&amp;rsquo;s orderly-structured regular square street blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sagrada Familia itself is a church designed by Gaudi, a large somewhat out-of-place structure occupying one of these city blocks. One of the hostel people had told us its&amp;rsquo; history, about how it was started back in the 1800s and that construction was still ongoing up to now. There&amp;rsquo;s a fee for going inside the church, with the funds contributing to the construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We opt not to go inside, as the facade of the church already offers a lot to see. There seemed to be three different facades and numerous spires, each lined with decorations and statues of a different theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent some time admiring the structure, and even a few minutes in an FC Barcelona exhibit right across the street. Afterwards, we headed up a slightly-inclined street towards one of the tourist spots highlighted on our map before deciding to have a late lunch in one of the open air restaurant areas in the middle of the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We managed to arrive at the Sant Pau hospital knowing nothing about what it is other than it was a nearby spot on our tourist map. The sign outside tells us it&amp;rsquo;s a UNESCO world heritage site, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look too impressive from the outside. Nonetheless we paid to go inside and we were surprised to find that it&amp;rsquo;s actually a rather large complex with a number of elaborately-designed buildings inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This place was a hospital during wartime. It&amp;rsquo;s no longer a hospital though, the hospital was moved to a modern site. It&amp;rsquo;s currently a museum and cultural center and some of the buildings are being used as UNESCO offices. There are almost a dozen buildings lining a central plaza dotted with orange trees. Each building has a different facade, though all in the same style, designed by the Catalan architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner. There was some sort of media event going on though, and we were only able to visit a few of the buildings. The thing about visiting these types of architectural displays is that we&amp;rsquo;re always walking around with our heads tilted upwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We roamed the grounds for a while before deciding to head back and prep for our flight early the next morning to Rome. Our visit to Barcelona was very relaxed, we weren&amp;rsquo;t too worried about hitting too many tourist spots because we planned to be back here for a few days before flying back to the Southeast Asian side of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next: We travel to Rome! Or do we?!?&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/03/europe-trip-2015/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; only skimmed my trip to Europe. I did not want to write too much, partly because I was uncertain at how many would be interested to hear the sordid details and partly because while I was writing the post, the words did not flow as freely as I would have wanted. Despite this, I have received good feedback and more than one person had asked for more details. So here we are.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday March 7th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My first impression of Barcelona (and hence my first impression of Europe) was that it was a very… brown city. Most of the buildings were shades of red or brown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three of us arrived at the Barcelona airport around ten in the morning and from there took a metro train to the Barcelona Sants station. One of the first things I noticed (aside from the brownness of the buildings as the train rode into the city proper) was the vast amount of colorfully-lettered graffiti that can be seen on many walls as the train passed by. This sort of graffiti would turn out to be common not only here but in Paris and Rome as well (though not as much)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the station our hostel would be a short walk, but first we hunted around the Sants station for a place to eat. We looked at some signs for the McDonald&amp;rsquo;s inside the station before deciding we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be having any American fast food for the duration of our trip. We ate at the adjacent restaurant instead, taking in an assortment of breakfast foods on some sort of combo plates. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have too much language trouble even though the staff spoke no English. Although the local language is Catalan, most of the locals will speak or understand Spanish, and we spoke and understood a bit of Spanish ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stepped out of the station to a crisp windy afternoon, with the temperature a bit under 10 degrees. I was worried that my hoodie might not be able to handle the expected cold Europe weather but I held up fine so far. We walked around a bit a midst crowds of skateboarding, rollerblading and scooter-riding youths before figuring out where we were supposed to go for the fifteen minute walk to our hostel. We walked through what a quaint area with a wide open space in the middle of the road for pedestrians &amp;ndash; such a thing seemed impossible back in crowded Metro Manila. Many of the storefronts were closed, probably for the weekend, with their metal security grills lined with the same style of colorfully-lettered graffiti I saw from the train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this leg we would be staying at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freehostelsbarcelona.com/&#34;&gt;Free Hostels Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;. The lady at the reception was very friendly and her English was quite good. She answered most of our questions and handed us a few tourist friendly maps that highlighted many of the places we could visit in the city before showing us our rooms. It was a dormitory-type room with four beds and storage units, a bathroom and not much else. One of the beds was already occupied, she said, so the three of us would be sharing a room with a stranger that night. (Spoiler: we did not get murdered in our sleep)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After resting up for a bit, we went out to spend the afternoon taking in a bit more of the city. We made our way towards the nearby Plaza España; the friendly hostel reception lady told us the mall there would give us a good view of the city from the top floor. On the way we passed by what one of my companions called out as a &amp;ldquo;giant penis&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We climbed to the top of the Centro Comercial de las Arenas, which I found comparable to a small mall back home with mostly high-end shops. The circular rooftop was an open-air area that gave a good view of the nearby city and some fancy restaurants that we thought of eating at but never managed to get back to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to head towards that large building in the distance (I believe it was some sort of museum) since friendly hostel lady told us there was a nice fountain show there we could see. On the way we got distracted by this street performer doing bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;Since we were a bit too early for the fountain show, we sat there for a while to take a break from all the walking and let ourselves be entertained by the large bubbles and the little kids enjoying them. He was using two short sticks with some rope entwined to catch some of his soap solution and he would let the brisk wind create the large bubbles. &amp;ldquo;I should try this back home, the niece would enjoy it.&amp;rdquo; (Spoiler: I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried it)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly before 7 pm we went to the fountain area where there was already a large number of people gathered around the nearby steps and other seating areas in anticipation of the show. There were street performers entertaining some sections of the crowd with some sort of dance-off, but the fountain show began before they could come over to our side.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;The fountain show was some sort of preprogrammed series of lights and changes in the fountain heights and angles against a backdrop of someone who sounds like Freddie Mercury singing something that starts with &amp;ldquo;Barcelonaaaaaaa~&amp;rdquo; The show was very good, I don&amp;rsquo;t believe I&amp;rsquo;ve seen anything like it locally (but then again I don&amp;rsquo;t see fountain shows too often). Imagine, I said to myself, somewhere out there are people who design these shows for a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We enjoyed the show a bit longer before deciding to head back to the hostel to get an early rest after the long travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday March 8th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up earlier than my travelling companions and headed out to the hostel&amp;rsquo;s common area to check out the free breakfast. Breakfast was cold cuts of ham and sausage, slices of cheese, bread and croissants with various spreads and some juice. Nothing too fancy (i.e. no bacon), but there was lots of food for us to enjoy. The spread would be the same every morning, and it meant we could load up on breakfast so that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to spend too much on lunch and dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Sunday and as a Catholic I was planning to hear English mass. As far as I could tell from the internet, the only place to do that was the Parish of Mary the Queen at 10am. One of my companions wanted to hear mass in Spanish and the other one was planning to attend a football match around noon, so we separated for the first half of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church I wanted to go to was around 3.5 kilometers away, a 40 minute walk according to Google Maps. I allocated an hour and a half to walk there at a more leisurely pace. It turned out to be a good call, as Google Maps didn&amp;rsquo;t tell me I&amp;rsquo;d be walking up a bunch of inclined roads (these wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the only inclines I&amp;rsquo;d have trouble with in Barcelona&amp;hellip; ). I passed by mostly residential areas, with small parks every few blocks letting me take a few minutes break when I needed it.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;I was greeted at the church entrance by some white folks who were waiting for the mass to start. The church itself wasn&amp;rsquo;t too large, it was maybe a third the size of where I usually hear mass back home. There weren&amp;rsquo;t too many attendees, maybe around 50 people at best, which is less than I would have thought given the large Catholic population in Spain, though I guess most of them hear mass in the local languages. Most of the attendees seemed to be locals instead of expats; for some reason I was expecting a larger Asian/Filipino presence, maybe based on when I heard mass in Hong Kong or Singapore. The priest was very friendly and would greet each mass-goer as they left after the service. He even gave me a &amp;ldquo;good job!&amp;rdquo; with thumbs up as I went out, not sure why 😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends know I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2013/03/scenes-from-a-quiz-night/&#34;&gt;enjoy a good quiz night&lt;/a&gt;, and my travelling companions were no different. So for Sunday night, we planned to attend an English pub quiz at the Black Horse Pub, roughly an hour&amp;rsquo;s walk from our hostel. We met up again late into the afternoon and headed out on foot (we liked walking, apparently). Along the way we enjoyed the fancy-looking buildings that lined the major roads. There are apparently no skyscrapers in Barcelona, most of the buildings we saw were maybe five or six stories high at most, with most of them being old-timey buildings lined with fancy ornate facades and some with random minarets or towers at the top. Any time we passed by an obviously modern-style building it looked hilariously out of place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to walk along the Via Laietana, a thoroughfare famous for buildings with different kinds of fancy architecture (I am too ignorant to name them). Aside from the buildings and their architecture which I am surely unqualified to describe, the street itself had a wide middle island for pedestrians, the island lined with trees that looked like they were groomed to look similar in branch structure, recovering from winter. The middle island held a number of outdoor seating areas for the nearby restaurants, a common thing in Barcelona. We debated having some paella right there, since that&amp;rsquo;s the famous dish in the region, but the menus here were a bit pricy so I suggested in Tagalog that we look for some cheaper alternatives later near our hostel. As chance would have it, one of the restaurant staff we passed by overheard us and I heard him say behind us we walked away &amp;ldquo;Mura dito!&amp;rdquo;, leading me to comment about the innate ability of Pinoys to find one another when in a foreign land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was night time by the time we found the pub among a maze of side streets, and the friendly British proprietor welcomed us for their quiz night. The questions were recited out loud in both Spanish and English (leading to one of my companions translating the Spanish instead of paying attention to the English one!). We took an early lead since we used our joker early, but fell behind when it came to the music-related categories (not an uncommon result for our quiz nights!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the pub quiz, we decided to take a cab home since it was late. The cost wasn&amp;rsquo;t too prohibitive since there were three of us to split the bill. I think it came out to just 2-3 euros each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I expected, this post already feels way too long. I was hoping I could cover each leg of the trip in one post, but this feels like a good stopping point. In Barcelona part 2, we visit Park Guell and the Sagrada Familia.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;My friends know how stingy I am with money, and my family knows I&amp;rsquo;m not much of a tourist, so some might have been surprised that I took the better part of two and a half weeks off from work to travel around Europe with a couple of friends. It was my first trip outside of Southeast Asia and the first time I took a long haul flight. Other than my concerns regarding the possibility of my luggage getting lost, the trip was relatively smooth and the Singapore Airlines plane had relatively decent food, service and in-flight entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first leg of our trip was to Barcelona, Spain (aside from the layover in Singapore). My first impression of Barcelona (and hence my first impression of Europe) was that it was a very&amp;hellip;  brown city. Most of the buildings were shades of red or brown. Barcelona felt quiet, maybe even rustic. There were a lot of wide-open spaces making it very friendly for walking, with most of the city center structured in well-organised square blocks that made it easy to navigate. The first few days of the trip were very relaxed, we walked around a lot looking at ornately-decorated buildings and hitting the occasional tourist spot like Sagrada Familia and Park Guell. We even managed to do poorly at a pub quiz somewhere in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second leg of the trip took us to Rome, Italy. As opposed to Barcelona, Rome felt busy, crowded and very much a tourist city, easily evidenced by the numerous souvenir stands and sellers of selfie sticks that littered the seemingly unpredictable maze of cobblestone streets interspersed with ruins and fountains and plazas and museums and churches and ornate sculptures and Egyptian obelisks. The city is pretty much an open museum &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s always something to see around the nearest corner. Unfortunately, the famous Trevi Fountain was undergoing renovation during our visit, but we also managed to visit the Colloseum and the Palatino / Roman Forum (that place is huge).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We allocated one day of the stay in Rome to visit Vatican City. For the first and last time we hired a tour guide (and maybe overpaid) to take us through the Vatican Museum and so we could use the secret tour guide entrance to St. Peter&amp;rsquo;s Basilica. There was a lot of stuff in the museum, but the Sistine Chapel ceiling and the Basilica itself were the highlights of tour. Or maybe that&amp;rsquo;s just because I&amp;rsquo;m a Catholic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next leg took us to Paris, France. Paris was cold, very cold, with biting winds. Easily the coldest city I&amp;rsquo;ve been to. It felt more like a city than either Rome or Barcelona did, with long avenues and high-end shops. Not particularly tourist-friendly, given that there&amp;rsquo;s less English speakers around. Also the most expensive among the cities we&amp;rsquo;ve visited &amp;ndash; with food costing maybe 1.5 or 2 times as much as it did in the prior two cities. The Louvre and the Eiffel Tower (especially the view from the top) were magnificent though, well worth the cost of entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Paris we spent the last few days of the trip back in Barcelona, relaxing and decompressing. We walked around a bit, visited the beach and I even managed to hit a Magic prerelease the day before our flight home. I managed to get back into work immediately after almost an entire day of travelling, with minimal jet lag even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s more to talk about that I won&amp;rsquo;t write about at the moment &amp;ndash; the on-the-fly planning, the food, the hostels, the budget airline flights, etc. I signed up for the trip on a bit of a whim, but it turned out to be a pretty good trip for me. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been a culturally inclined guy, but I still found myself immersed in all the ancient sites and museums we visited. The company was good, it was nice to experience an entirely new continent, and it was a welcome break from the usual routine.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Parroquis de Reina Maria. They apparently had the only English language mass in Barcelona. This photo was &amp;amp;ldquo;enhanced&amp;amp;rdquo; by Google+&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This guy tried to warn the Trojans not to accept the horse. So one of the gods sent a snake to eat him and his sons.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is supposed to be a statue of St. Peter, but the inscription says Pius IX&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This statue was doing the Dr. evil thing with his pinky, but this picture is crappy&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I was in Singapore from June 2 &amp;ndash; June 6, mostly to visit friends who are getting married and compete in the MTG Grand Prix held there last weekend. I like bullet points, so here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of my trip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Props:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;public transportation. One thing Singapore and Hong Kong have in common: well-defined, convenient and tourist-friendly public transportation systems, namely trains and buses. It makes our local buses and trains here pale by comparison. The trains are well-maintained and more or less go everywhere including to and from the airport (there&amp;rsquo;s really no need to take an airport taxi unless you arrive some time after the trains close), and there are maps everywhere and machines that dispense tickets and such. The buses can get crowded but still well-organized. There are numerous bus stops and they identify the bus numbers that pass by that stop and many stops will also have maps and routes shown; buses are tracked via GPS so some stops will tell you how long until the bus arrives. They even have an iPhone app that helps you find your bus. Oh, and of course you can buy one of those reloadable cards that you can use to pay for buses and trains. Okay, I really liked the public transpo system. 😀&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike and Tin (congrats again guys :D) and the rest of the Singapore guys who put up with the visiting team, especially since they let me crash at their place on my last night there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12 mbps internet at Mike and Tin&amp;rsquo;s place, which meant we were able to spend a couple of hours one night just watching stupid youtube videos continuously and letting me get my ass kicked at SSF4 online without any lag. Arr, makes me wish ISPs on our side weren&amp;rsquo;t so terrible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anime. Well, just the fact that I probably watched more anime over the weekend stay than I have over the past year or so. At least I now have some idea who these Fate/Stay Night people are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;air travel. In general, my Cebu Pacific flights went smoothly (I even slept well on the flight back) and I breezed through customs and immigrations both ways without much concern. I&amp;rsquo;m always a bit worried about some unexpected problems like baggage getting lost (so I never check in baggage) or some problem with the bookings or my travel documents or whatever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slops:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very muggy weather, making it very uncomfortable to travel outside (to be fair, now that I&amp;rsquo;m back in Manila it feels almost the same here). It felt good to take a shower back at the hotel everyday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oxford hotel for not having free internet and serving basically the same breakfast everyday. Oh and aircon unit that dripped on the couch; I actually woke up with water all over my iPad&amp;rsquo;s case (luckily not broken)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Grand Prix Singapore venue, for being so far from the train station&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;me for trying to get into the driver&amp;rsquo;s side of the taxi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Somewhere in between:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I guess I&amp;rsquo;m fairly satisfied with how I fared in the Grand Prix, despite my sloppy misplays at some point. At least I broke my curse of going 0-3 all the time in Grand Prix tournaments. I&amp;rsquo;ll write up a tournament report in a couple of days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;getting off at the wrong bus stop in Telok Blangah, causing me to wander amongst the apartment building while carrying my huge bag and there was a slight drizzle. It&amp;rsquo;s not completely a bad thing, as I kind of enjoy wandering around by myself on foot. It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve done in other countries I visited (usually at night), but didn&amp;rsquo;t really get the chance in Singapore because once I got back to the airconditioned room in the hotel, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to go out 😀&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per usual in my travels to other countries, I did not spend much time shopping or sight-seeing or any touristy stuff like that. I&amp;rsquo;m not really a tourist kind of person. Overall the trip was ok it was great to be able to visit and meet up with friends, compete in the Grand Prix and see how daily life is in Singapore (still not inclined to work there though :p)&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 8:30 pm on Friday.&lt;/strong&gt; I step out of Maxim&amp;rsquo;s, a fastfood place near the office in Hong Kong. I flew in to HK the morning of the day before, and had given a presentation over a conference call on Thursday night. This was the only free time I had during the entire trip since I had to fly back the next morning. I decided to take a walk for maybe an hour or 30 minutes, to savor the cool night&amp;rsquo;s weather before going back to hot and humid Manila the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the view from the 22nd floor office that the harbor was nearby. I figured I should get a closeup view of the harbor, something I had not done before. So I walked in the general direction of where I thought the water would be. The chilly wind of fourteen degrees bit against my cheeks as I navigated the North Point side streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I found myself following a road of decommissioned cars and abandoned taxis underneath one of Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s many flyovers. I was certain this road would lead to a view of the bay from the ground. As I approached, I saw that the walls nearby were filled with colorful graffiti, reminding me of gangland streets in old 80&amp;rsquo;s shows. A faint whirring sound could be heard and as I got nearer I saw there were two middle-aged men towards the entrance of a small yet brightly-lit cul-de-sac at the end of the road. One of them was holding something in his hands and seemed to be controlling a nearby device. The source of the whirring sound had been a model helicopter, and he was flying it around at a low altitude. The two men glanced my way as I passed, but otherwise paid me no heed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched their helicopter for a few minutes, fascinated. I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen one of these in action back home, and I wondered why these men participated in their hobby in these abandoned corners. I shrugged and headed to the end of the cul-de-sac. There, near a metal railing bordering the asphalt and the water&amp;rsquo;s edge, another two men lounged lazily on wooden benches. Standing against the railing were two twelve-feet long steel poles. &lt;em&gt;Ah, they&amp;rsquo;re fishing&lt;/em&gt;, I thought to myself. They didn&amp;rsquo;t look like they did this for a living, so I assumed they were hobbyists who only had this time of night and no other nearby source of fish. I watched them for a while, amazed that the harbor actually contains catchable fish. I wonder if Manila Bay has any fishermen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 9:00 pm.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m walking along a sidewalk following a metal railing tracing the water&amp;rsquo;s edge. Above me, the same flyover carries numerous vehicles to and from Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s busy districts. But around me, it&amp;rsquo;s dead quiet. Mostly. The only other people nearby are a young couple walking ahead of me obviously taking an enjoyable moonlit stroll along the otherwise abandoned road. The girl, wearing a vivid red sweater laughingly teases the young man and they rush ahead. I hope I didn&amp;rsquo;t scare me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I follow the coast I begin to see boats. Dozens of them, some no larger than an automobile. Most made of wood and apparently barely floating. Some have people sleeping in them and I wonder whether they live in those boats by choice or maybe it was difficult to find somewhere to live on Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s streets? One of the boats has a lantern and is moving in parallel to where I&amp;rsquo;m walking. I wave to the grizzled old man manning the boat and he waves back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walk some more, and the sounds of busy city life are slowly catching up. In stark contrast to the lonely sidewalk I had been following, the lights of one of the commercial districts had come into view and I could catch the names of several familiar companies atop tall buildings in the distance. I step onto the sidewalk beside a busy coastal road and find myself welcomed by the lights and sounds of fast-moving vehicular traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I crossed the bridge, I passed upon a fenced-off section at the water&amp;rsquo;s edge and inside spied something mounted upon an elevated stone platform. It was covered in a blue tarpaulin but once I was close it was obvious what it was: it was a cannon! A nearby marker told me it was the Jardines Noonday Gun, a relic from the olden days that was still occasionally fired for charity. I wanted to see what it looked like, but the metal gate leading into the area was locked. I tried to push the images of FF7&amp;rsquo;s Mako Cannon out of my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walk past a large dome-shaped building near the coast. The sign at the gate tells me it&amp;rsquo;s the Police Officer&amp;rsquo;s Club; I guess the police are well off in Hong Kong. Beyond that there was a lot filled with ships hulls partially built and mounted on elevated rails. Some sort of shipyard I guess. Perhaps the police officers liked to ride yachts. I walked around to the other side of the fenced-off building and I saw inside a strange thing: there large, parallel beams inside a lowered area perhaps some fifteen feet below, and bright lights were emanating from the cracks in between. I peered though the metal link fence and recognized the sounds of cars whizzing by below and I realized that I was looking down at the Cross Harbour Tunnel. If I jumped down below I could cross into Kowloon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s almost 9:30pm and I&amp;rsquo;ve been walking for an hour&lt;/strong&gt;. I thought I should start looking for a way back, yet I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to merely retrace my steps. I was already near a commercial area that seemed to be quite far from where I started. Eventually I came upon a cemented footbridge that would let me cross to the other side of the busy highway, and I figured that was the way I would go back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I climbed up the steps and found myself crossing a quiet yet well-maintained walkway, well above the busy traffic I had left below. I saw the AIA tower in the distance and figured I could use it as a guidepost to find my way back. I stepped down at the other end of the footbridge and find myself crossing a familiar looking road underneath yet-another flyover. My suspicions were confirmed when I followed some lights and saw that I was in the middle of one of Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s famous commercial districts &amp;ndash; Causeway Bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been here before, but not at this hour. I&amp;rsquo;m walk past the crowds and follow the lights, eventually finding myself in the midst of a street market in front of the Sogo department store. The signage and lights in this area are impossibly bright for the time of day, making you wonder whether they had received the memo that dusk had already come. A lady carrying a microphone and wearing a neon green jacket was glancing around at the crowds, accompanied by a cameraman. Some TV reporter perhaps? In any case I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like giving an interview. I walked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exiting from the World Trade Centre building, I found that I had been walking in the wrong direction, away from AIA tower. No doubt distracted by the bright lights of the commercial district, I resolved to make my way back as I was now getting the urge to take a leak. &amp;gt;.&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 10pm now and I&amp;rsquo;m close to getting back&lt;/strong&gt;. I cross some streets and find myself walking through some sort of large park. I pass by several clusters of teenagers, busily chatting away on park benches and also a number of old people, apparently taking their night-time jogs. A lot of people are also walking dogs (I wonder why they do all these things at night), and I pass by a smallish lady with a gigantic St. Bernard, perhaps larger than me were he not on all fours. I considered petting the beast as I passed, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if I could afford being pounced upon by such a huge canine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stop to watch some kids playing on swings nearby, and beyond the cluster of treetops inside the park I spotted the familiar glow of the AIA tower, now closer than ever. I realized that I must have been walking through Victoria Park, the only large park near North Point, and I was close to getting back to my quarters. Sure enough, crossing a few streets later I found myself raising my hands in triumph. &lt;em&gt;Fortress Hill!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 10:30 pm and my feet are killing me.&lt;/strong&gt; I manage to get back to my room at YesInn, dead tired. Yet slightly amazed that I was able to walk so far in the dead of night; I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I would have dared all those side streets I wandered through had I been in Quezon City. The nights in Hong Kong feel safer somehow, for even the loneliest alleys were brightly-lit. I was also a bit disappointed that nothing more exciting had happened during my walk, perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s the tradeoff for the safety on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was dead tired and prepared for bed. Still, I was glad for the chance to walk and be distracted and not having to think about life&amp;rsquo;s worries. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to be said for aimless wandering that many people would not understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I would return to Manila, back to the grind of everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author&amp;rsquo;s note: I wish I did have something more interesting to write about, but it was really a short, uneventful two-night stay in Hong Kong. Still, I felt I needed to blog about it, so that I have a record that I was in HK at this time. For more small details on my trip, I&amp;rsquo;ve been posting on &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/roytang&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m blogging from an airport; I feel like such a seasoned traveler. Actually I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post just so that I can claim to post on the internet from airports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am of course flying back to Manila after a short 3-day visit to Hong Kong. People always ask me where I plan to go while in HK, even though I always come here to work. It&amp;rsquo;s even worse this time, as I flew in Sunday evening, attending a three-day seminar until Wednesday, working during the evenings then flying back Thursday morning. Not much time to do anything really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to take lunch at the airport because of the excessive price, but the check-in took a bit longer than I expected so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to grab some food outside. The second mistake was ordering a fried noodle dish. It would have been fine if I was sufficiently skilled with chopsticks, but as it is I can only food I can manage relatively well with chopsticks are large pieces of meat. And fried noodles are served all bunched up together and they aren&amp;rsquo;t straightforward to chew through, hence whenever I shove some into my mouth with the chopsticks, I feel like I would be unable to stop until I swallow it all (or choke, whatever). Eventually I just give up with about a third of the noodles still in the bowl. The flight will have some food anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I&amp;rsquo;m bored and traveling I tend to think of random insane scenarios that I act out in my head. Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While watching a 15-year old Chinese kid struggle with a Rubik&amp;rsquo;s Cube on the MTR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me (stands up and walks over to the kid, extending hand): &amp;ldquo;Give me that!&amp;rdquo; (Grabs the cube and solves it in ten seconds flat, and immediately jump off at Central station while the rest of the passengers watch in awe)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While looking for a place to eat at the airport:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me (walks up to a random Chinese woman): Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese woman: Eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me (making hand-to-mouth signs): Hungry! Give me some food!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I never do any of these.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Traveling by land sucks compared to traveling by plane. So for our weekend trip to Albay to visit our new sister-in-law&amp;rsquo;s family, I booked 3 two-way Cebu Pacific tickets for my brothers and myself. Our parents would take the bus since it was slightly cheaper and they didn&amp;rsquo;t mind sleeping on the road. The other reason was that my two brothers had never ridden a plane before &amp;ndash; this would be their first time. First domestic flight for me as well. As expected, they were excited like giddy shoolboys, taking pictures on the way up the plane and leaning towards the window and all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose it was to be expected, but the airport in Legazpi was a far cry from the Manila one. Practically a strip of road labeled as the runway and a small building labeled a terminal. The flight itself was fine but obviously budget. I have been spoiled by PAL. And of course the view of Legazpi City was a lot more green than Metro Manila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there was Mayon, visible as soon as we descended from the clouds. Unfortunately the peak stayed hidden from us for the entire weekend, maybe another time. Still, Sunday morning we climbed Lignon Hill, which is a lot smaller than Mayon. We were hoping that by the time we finish the 30-minute walk to the top the peak would show itself. No such luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk upwards was&amp;hellip; invigorating in a way. I have a newfound respect for slopes. The road we were walking on our way to the peak can&amp;rsquo;t have been more than 30 degrees at its most difficult, yet my leg muscles felt dead tired before we were halfway up. Just shows how out of shape I was. The trip down was much faster of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the stay was mostly eating and shopping for &lt;em&gt;pasalubong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I suck at buying gifts for people so I&amp;rsquo;m glad I had a DS while everyone else was walking around the informal &lt;em&gt;tiangge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our parents dropped us off at the airport in time for the return flight. We checked in and sat down to wait. The rain outside started getting worse, and eventually there was a message that our flight is canceled. Boo! After asking around, I was told I&amp;rsquo;d get a full refund for the round trip flight. (So we got to fly to Albay for free) I called up my parents and asked them to get us bus tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned at the start, traveling by land sucks. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to sleep, and I&amp;rsquo;m prone to motion-sickness on extended bus trips. Still, we made it back to Manila alive and well. I had a bit of a headache and some of the aforementioned nausea and hardly any sleep, as I expected&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Hong Kong Saga, Part Three

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit strange, but somehow Hong Kong is becoming a bit familiar to me by now. This is only my third time here of course, and I&amp;rsquo;ve spent less than five weeks here in total since 2004. Still I find that certain things like ordering at restaurants and riding the MTR have started to become a bit more &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally when I was told that I would be staying in HK for two weeks, I was a bit depressed, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy the prolonged stay last time. Hong Kong is not a particularly exciting place for me as I&amp;rsquo;m not the sort of person who totally enjoys being either a tourist or a shopper, which are the usual reasons why people come to HK. I&amp;rsquo;m not planning to go to Disneyland or Ocean Park so when people ask what I plan to do during the weekend I just tell them the truth: I have no plans. Probably bum around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip is more pleasant this time around, as I&amp;rsquo;m really at the starting end of a project and things are not so busy. Also, the place we are staying at now has free high-speed wi-fi internet connection, and I was able to borrow a laptop for my use during weekends, so I can goof off on the internet whenever I get bored. In times like these I really consider buying a laptop. Although, traveling once a year is not really a good reason to get one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the place we have been working at, there&amp;rsquo;s this guy who speaks English in a way that is so obviously Filipino. Every country has it&amp;rsquo;s own unique accent of English I suppose, so it&amp;rsquo;s immediately obvious when someone is speaking English in a manner that you can easily grok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I type this, mentally I hear myself saying it with a Chinese accent, as is my tendency when hanging around people with strange accents too long. Probably my grasp of good English grammar is suffering a bit as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a random rant, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked if I would be willing to be temporarily posted in another country, halfway across the world, for around half a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, it seems like a good idea &amp;ndash; I don&amp;rsquo;t have any definite plans for the next few months, so there&amp;rsquo;s nothing in the way. It would be new stuff, new places, people, experiences, etc., a most welcome change of pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the first emotion that grips me is fear. Of the unknown I suppose. Of doing something I hadn&amp;rsquo;t done before. But then my focus on courage as a value comes through, and I recognize the fear for what it is: something to be conquered. I strike through the fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will give my answer today. Will any of this come to pass? &lt;em&gt;Abangan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write more about my time in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the many new things I experienced there was the food. People who&amp;rsquo;ve eaten out with me on a regular basis know that I&amp;rsquo;m quite the picky eater. In general, I dislike eating veggies and seafood (yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m an unhealthy carnivore). In Hong Kong, you cannot avoid vegetables and seafood; every meal comes with some form of green stuff or shrimp or whatnot. I&amp;rsquo;m almost always eating out with the HK colleagues, and since I&amp;rsquo;m a guest in their country, they&amp;rsquo;ll always invite me to taste everything. I&amp;rsquo;ve probably eaten more seafood in those three weeks than I have for the previous years of my life. I&amp;rsquo;m probably exaggerating, but there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance of me being correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since most of my days were spent in the Wan Chai area, we often had lunch and dinner at the restaurants there. Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s been to Hong Kong will probably know about Wan Chai: the area is full of bars and nightclubs and such. It seems that the area is frequented by foreigners. In the evening, many of the clubs have some pretty young women outside enticing passing Caucasian guys to have a drink or two. Of course, I didn&amp;rsquo;t go into the bars or nightclubs because that&amp;rsquo;s not the sort of thing I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch was the expensive meal of the day, since we usually had to pay for it ourselves (as opposed to dinner which was company-reimbursed). The HK guys would usually decide where we would all have lunch and we just go along with them. Most meals cost around 40 HK$ &amp;ndash; more than 2.5 times I normally spend for lunch back home. But these meals are usually larger servings and good quality stuff, not fastfood-level or carinderia-type junk. We get soup, plus drinks (I usually order Lemon Iced Tea or Milk Tea) then the meal itself. Usuallyyou have some meat or fish, plus veggies on the side, and you can choose your viand from rice, spaghetti, mashed potato, etc. Many restaurants allow you to choose from a list of set meals, so sometimes I joke that I can just choose randomly, &amp;ldquo;Today I&amp;rsquo;ll have meal B&amp;rdquo; and just order it without asking what it is. But of course I&amp;rsquo;m a picky eater, so I don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since dinner is company-sponsored, it seems the HK guys always choose cheaper places for dinner. We ate once at a McDonald&amp;rsquo;s and once at a Yoshinoya. And several times at this small chinese place that had a TV. I kept trying to follow the plot of the TV show aired during dinner but the inability to understand Chinese makes it hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, of course being unable to speak Chinese makes almost everything hard &amp;ndash; I need to ask for help whenever I&amp;rsquo;m ordering, etc. I also started out quite bad with chopsticks. Despite my years of honing hand-eye coordination using the game controller, my dexterity is terrible, and that leads to being really bad with chopsticks. On my first Sunday there, I had to eat lunch alone at a cafe. I ordered some pork with noodles in soup (I like noodles), but I had trouble eating since I&amp;rsquo;m not used to eating noodles with chopsticks. I tried to ask the counter lady for a fork, but she and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand each other. I wonder if the other cafe patrons noticed me eating the noodles in a terrible manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if my time in Hong Kong would change my eating habits when I got back home, making me less picky in what I eat. Turns out, not by much.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I remember looking for the signs that would tell me where to find the A11 bus that could take me to North Point. My instructions were to find the McDonald&amp;rsquo;s inside the airport and look for the exit nearby. Sure enough, the signs pointed me to the bus terminal. I bought a ticket, and as I arranged my luggage for easier carrying I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice that I had dropped the just-purchased ticket to the floor. A pretty Caucasian girl picked it up and smiled as she handed it back to me. I smiled back and gave her my best &amp;ldquo;Thank you very much.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got on the bus and took a seat near the back, hoping that I would be able to see clearly out the window so as not to miss my stop. Seated on the row of seats in front of me were seven women, some middle-aged, some looking like they had just gotten out of high school. Even if they were speaking English I would have been able to identify them as Filipinas. From their dialogue I could also tell they were domestic helpers. Apparently they&amp;rsquo;ve never met each other before today, and here they were talking amongst themselves as if they were long lost friends. I guess when you&amp;rsquo;re a long way from home any connection is a welcome one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them is the central speaker, she&amp;rsquo;s apparently been in Hong Kong for more than seven years now and had just come back from a vacation in the Philippines. She answers some questions from the others: what can I do on my day off? where do I go? how can I call home? She tells them stories of her life in Hong Kong, how the family she works with has been really good to her and they get along well. If you&amp;rsquo;re lucky, you will be assigned to a family like mine, she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They miss their stop; I guess she&amp;rsquo;s not as familiar with Hong Kong as I assumed. I look out the window and spot Victoria Park, and I know I&amp;rsquo;m getting near my stop. I get off the bus at just the right place, and I look for the staff quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Yeah I know, Hong Kong is technically a part of China, but my feet actually did manage to walk some non-Hong Kong Chinese territory. Too many stories accumulated in three weeks to tell in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2004/05/so-i-went-to-hk/&#34;&gt;one post&lt;/a&gt; though, but to say the least I actually got to experience a bit more of Hong Kong this time, as opposed to the five-day almost-all-work schedule that I had last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I did not get to experience any kung-fu in the streets, although I did manage to get a picture with Jacky Chan.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;So much for my nefarious plan to take it easy until I can get a Christmas break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leave on the first available flight Thursday, and they plan to keep me there for around three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  This is the photo I decided to put on the front page of http://roytang.net while I wasn&#39;t sure yet what to put there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We were at Punta Fuego in Batangas last Jan 30-31 for our coincidentally-coinciding-with-the-HK-Chinese-New Year-weekend annual company outing. Those who know me in person might be aware that I&#39;m not really big on out-of-town trips. In short order, the reasons are: being antisocial, tendency to get tired/dizzy on long trips, and not particularly liking seafood.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I suppose it was okay, although I still had a lot of time being bored out of my wits as expected. Managed to get in the water some, and I have the admit the Batangas air was very refreshing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  You get thirsty fast inside the resort though -- mineral water was an expensive P55 a pop inside the resort, and there was no other free water. Bad news for someone like me who is used to drinking a lot of water.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I had to endure ten hours without a decent meal on the trip home though. It was not a good idea to have an early brunch before embarking on a journey that would eventually end in rush-hour metro manila.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I suppose that it may have been a good change of pace for me... 
&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before, Daet is a small town. When I was there, I was mentally comparing it to the UP Diliman campus. Main reason being, we had a tendency to walk everywhere we went. Just like in UP, everything was literally within &amp;ldquo;walking distance&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; the beach, the church, the cemetary, etc. So in my mind, the UP Diliman campus and Daet, Camarines Norte occupy roughly the same area, even though technically, one is a university campus and the other a full-sized town. (On a tangent, the transportation within Daet is strictly limited to tricycles only, which would imply it being logically smaller than UPD, which has jeepneys.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, anyway, there was a lot of walking going on. We walked everywhere. Ocassionally, I would get to walk with my father. My dad, he&amp;rsquo;s basically a nice guy. It&amp;rsquo;s always nice to see that while we&amp;rsquo;re walking around town, he has to stop and chat with somebody in every other store. Daet has lots of these little stores, side-by-side in the residential areas: hardware stores, bakeries, general merchandise, etc. And my dad seems to know someone and has to exchange tales of how things have been going, hey-have-you-met-my-son-can-you-find-him-a-girlfriend, that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, maybe this sort of thing isn&amp;rsquo;t that irregular, why do I bother talking about it? After all, my father grew up in this town, it&amp;rsquo;s to be expected that he knows people all over the place, right? Not to me. I mean, growing up I knew a small part of Quezon City, but I was never that chummy with that many people. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s just a small town thing that never fails to amaze me: Everybody seems to know everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing about my dad that occasionally surprises me: he&amp;rsquo;s a story-teller. Like I said, whenever he meets one of these everyday people-on-the-street types, he spends a few minutes chatting with them. Those few minutes are invariably filled with some short story (only occasionally mildly exaggerated) about how his sons have jobs now, how things were when he worked overseas, what happened to his long-lost cousins, etc. When I watch him talking like this to long-lost friends and the occasional relative-whose-name-I-should-probably remember, I am quite a bit envious. I want to be like that, I want to be able to spout out interesting anecdotes on demand, I want to be able to grab people&amp;rsquo;s attentions with my words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, unlike my dad, I don&amp;rsquo;t have much life experience to speak about. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been to that many places, haven&amp;rsquo;t done that many interesting things. I guess I really need to get out more&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Well, not really, seeing as how there aren&amp;rsquo;t really any mountains anywhere near here. I&amp;rsquo;m in Daet, Camarines Norte, if that means anything to you. It&amp;rsquo;s great to be back here — apparently the last time I was here was in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things have changed, but mostly things are still the same. There&amp;rsquo;s some sort of minimall now, and a Shakey&amp;rsquo;s, and a Jollibee. 😛 And there&amp;rsquo;s internet! I&amp;rsquo;m posting right now from a dingy internet cafe near my grandmother&amp;rsquo;s house. The mouse is horrible, and I had to put up with using IE for a while. I got fed up quickly though, and just went ahead and downloaded and installed &lt;a href=&#34;http://mozilla.org/firefox&#34;&gt;Firefox &lt;/a&gt;on two of their machines. Hehe, I&amp;rsquo;ll leave them open when I leave, hopefully I can convert someone. 😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m actually here out of necessity &amp;ndash; work necessity that is. I forgot to pass a couple of fspecs before I had to run for the bus yesterday, so I whipped up some quick specs here and sent em over to China. That&amp;rsquo;s the beauty of the internet age, I guess. I can pick up my work whenever I want, and be working with people from 3 different countries while waking up late in some desolate corner of a third-world country. 😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like it here in Daet, despite the lack of some modern conveniences. (The toilet here does not flush&amp;hellip; I have to get a bucket of water and flush stuff myself.) Ironically, I was just lying around sleeping and reading the Cryptonomicon the whole morning. Ironic, because when I was a kid, I seem to recall that I didn&amp;rsquo;t particularly like coming here, ‘coz I&amp;rsquo;d be all bored out of my wits. This time though, I actually did come here to bum around. 😀&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I need to escape from this madness, this constant flow of unfinished tasks. I am leaving for the land of my ancestors, returning to my roots, seeking the tranquility that has eluded me these weeks past. For seven long years have I not ventured there, and yet now I find myself seeking its warm comforts. What will I find when I return to those shores? Will it be the same simple, quite town I once knew? Or has it changed and grown, to become a bustling metropolis? Will this short rest bring me answers, to the questions that plague my heart and mind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;m going to Bicol for a few days. Cheers.)&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>So I Went to HK

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;http://roytang.net/blog/?p=34&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, I was sent to HK a couple of weeks back, for the rollout of a project I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved with for about a year and a half. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s right for me to be talking about the project here, so I won&amp;rsquo;t delve into any specifics. I will however, bore you all with stories from my first trip anywhere remotely far from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the plane trip. Economy class (excuse me, fiesta class) on a PAL Airbus from NAIA2 to HK International on Thursday night. Food was okay, I&amp;rsquo;ve had worse, not really enough to turn me off airline food. The PAL flight attendants, as I later discussed with a male coworker, were quite not-young and, well, not-hot. Heh, probably unfair but you get a certain expectation from media, you know? The flight was short (less than two hours) and uneventful, no dizziness or pukathons for me, thanks, unlike when I take the eight-hour bus ride to Bicol. This may seem boring to seasoned fliers, but I liked that little map that told me at what location we were currently flying over. Neat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an engineering type, I also took notice of the plane itself. Is it normal that airplanes routinely jiggle and vibrate as the plane taxis? I understand that it&amp;rsquo;s unavoidable as things like cars and trains do the same; but shouldn&amp;rsquo;t things be a bit tighter on a plane? Still, didn&amp;rsquo;t really bother me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon landing, I got a glimpse of HK International Airport. I had heard it was huge, but didn&amp;rsquo;t get to look around much as I was greeted at the boarding gate by two of the HK staff. Nice people, one of them bought me dinner at McDonald&amp;rsquo;s although I told them I had already had the airline food. Afterwards, they took mo to The Peak, apparently a famous spot for tourists in Hong Kong. It&amp;rsquo;s a mall-type thing on top of a rather high mountain. From the observation deck, you could see most of Hong Kong. From there I could see that Hong Kong was a very urbanized area, a lot more than Metro Manila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending some time there, they drive me to the Staff Quarters near the HK office, where one of our RP staff has been staying for a month. The RP guy greets me, shows me upstairs, shows me the ropes, and I get some sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The office building is right next to the block where the staff quarters was, barely a five-minute walk. I spent most of my time in HK between the office and the staff quarters. Truth be told, the trip wasn&amp;rsquo;t really very exciting, as there was a lot of work to be done and not much time to goof around. I&amp;rsquo;ll just note some things particularly interesting about being in a foreign country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;People speaking in an unintelligible language all the time&lt;/em&gt;. Probably the biggest hurdle to anything, it took surprisingly little getting used to the fact that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t communicate perfectly with anyone, and with some people, not at all. On some occasions, I had to buy food or drinks through pointing and using hand signs to find out how much stuff was. When walking on the street, I&amp;rsquo;d turn my head whenever I hear someone speaking English, because it was quite unusual. Also, when dining out with the HK staff, I&amp;rsquo;d have to rely on them to order for me, since I can&amp;rsquo;t read the menus. Which brings me to&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foreign food&lt;/em&gt;. Anyone who knows me knows I&amp;rsquo;m quite a picky eater. I don&amp;rsquo;t take to new foods very easily. But it&amp;rsquo;s hard to refuse when you&amp;rsquo;re a guest, so I got to taste more new stuff in my five and a half days in HK than I have for maybe the past three years. It&amp;rsquo;s ok, I don&amp;rsquo;t mind, even the veggies. The biggest problem was the fact that I have no idea how to use chopsticks, and almost every meal needs the use of chopsticks. At one point, I had to badger my co-RP staff to help me get food using the serving chopsticks. While I was there, I had some Taiwanese, Thai food, and of course, Chinese. Lots of Chinese. Oh, and an interesting side note: apparently foreign McDonald&amp;rsquo;s have no McSpaghetti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Religious issues.&lt;/em&gt; I was unable to hear Mass on Sunday. We had to work most of the day, but I got off around 4PM. I asked one of the HK guys for directions to a Church (we were in Kowloon, I believe), but when I explained that I was Catholic, he didn&amp;rsquo;t know what the term meant. (This is of course ridiculous to a Filipino; everbody knows what a &lt;em&gt;Katoliko&lt;/em&gt; is!) After saying that my faith is similar to another RP staff who he had also met before, he gave me some instructions on where to find a Church. I walked around a bit, following his directions. Which eventually lead me to a Mosque. Ooookay. So I walked around some more (quite a bit actually, went up and down the same road couple of times), I found a place called &amp;ldquo;St Andrews Church&amp;rdquo;, I guessed this was the place he was talking about. I walked in and asked around, found out they had a Mass around 6PM. So I waited for a bit. Around 5:45 I picked up a flier and noticed that it was in fact an Anglican Church (Is it a Protestant thing? Or something else? I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure), and I it&amp;rsquo;s not the same so I went out looking again. I saw another Church, this time it was Lutheran. Around 6:30PM, I gave up, bought some dinner at McDonald&amp;rsquo;s and took a taxi home. The next day one of the HK staff who said he was Christian told me there was a Catholic Church beside the Mosque&amp;hellip; apparently it was a small one so I failed to notice it. From our discussion, I think there&amp;rsquo;s quite a distinction here between &amp;ldquo;Christians&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Catholics&amp;rdquo;; which is weird since I&amp;rsquo;m fairly sure Catholics are Christian. Anyway, I was wondering why it was so hard to find a Church in a place where&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are so many Filipinos.&lt;/em&gt; You can see &amp;lsquo;em everywhere, as you walk along the main streets. Mostly tourists and domestic helpers, I believe. I could hear Tagalog being spoken on the street more often than English. Of course, maybe I should&amp;rsquo;ve asked one of them where I could go to Church&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taxis are discplined.&lt;/em&gt; This is of course, shocking to any Filipino! A sticker on the inside of every taxi tells you the rules: They can&amp;rsquo;t turn down fares, they have to issue a receipt when asked, they must follow seatbelt laws, etc. Every taxi is equipped with a receipt machine, and every one of &amp;lsquo;em is bright red so they&amp;rsquo;re easy to spot. Overall, while I still experienced traffic jams over there, their traffic situation is still hella lot better than ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else can I say? As I said, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much free time. They were kind enough to give me half the day off on Tuesday afternoon (my flight home was Tuesday evening), and they recommended some places I could go visit. So I went to Quarry Bay, about 2 MTR stations away from the office. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what I was looking for, though, so I ended up mostly wandering aimlessly, not buying anything ‘cept for some food and drinks. I actually managed to walk all the way back to the office, and just decided to buy some chocolates from a supermarket to bring home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flight home, PAL switched me to a much smaller plane, which sucked. :( I got to see more of HK Airport, and let me say&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s frickin&amp;rsquo; huge. I told the guys who brought me to the airport that NAIA2 is like a fourth of HK airport, but now I think it&amp;rsquo;s more like a sixth. I&amp;rsquo;m told they even have some sort of moving platform thing for people whose gates are so frickin&amp;rsquo; far. It took 30 minutes for our plane to taxi, that should say something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, got home around 11:30, bought some more goodies at the duty-free shop. Took a taxi home, arrived safe and sound. Told stories for an hour or so, then &amp;hellip;  zzzzzz.&lt;/p&gt;
