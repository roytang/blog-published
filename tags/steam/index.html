<p>Like, what games did I play on which dates, etc.</p>
<p>Logically since Steam logs my total hours played, it should be possible to track it on a daily basis based on the delta to the running total. IDK if there&rsquo;s a way to get the historical data though</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Obviously this practice is deplorable. But just curious, where do we draw the line on asset flips. If someone takes these &ldquo;starter kits&rdquo; and reuses the assets but puts in some amount of work: maybe new story or mechanics, but basically still reusing the art and other assets, would that be acceptable?</p>

<p>I have been playing Shadownrun Dragonfall DC on a laptop I borrowed, with Steam cloud synchronization enabled. But now I have to give back the laptop and haven&rsquo;t finished it yet. If I uninstall Steam from this laptop (and all the games of course) then go back to my desktop which doesn&rsquo;t have have Shadowrun Dragonfall DC installed yet and install it there, will it get the saves I had from the laptop?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
