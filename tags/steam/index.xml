            &lt;p&gt;For the daily tasks, can I play the same one for each task for each of the 4 days?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like, what games did I play on which dates, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logically since Steam logs my total hours played, it should be possible to track it on a daily basis based on the delta to the running total. IDK if there&amp;rsquo;s a way to get the historical data though&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Please note that Witcher three-pack on Steam is 63% off, ending up cheaper than getting just Witcher 3&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The Witcher Trilogy pack is cheaper at -63% (at least in my region), FYI&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Obviously this practice is deplorable. But just curious, where do we draw the line on asset flips. If someone takes these &amp;ldquo;starter kits&amp;rdquo; and reuses the assets but puts in some amount of work: maybe new story or mechanics, but basically still reusing the art and other assets, would that be acceptable?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Fallout 4 still too expensive. The sale price is actually still more expensive than the price for a PS4 copy hereabouts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been playing Shadownrun Dragonfall DC on a laptop I borrowed, with Steam cloud synchronization enabled. But now I have to give back the laptop and haven&amp;rsquo;t finished it yet. If I uninstall Steam from this laptop (and all the games of course) then go back to my desktop which doesn&amp;rsquo;t have have Shadowrun Dragonfall DC installed yet and install it there, will it get the saves I had from the laptop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

Will I have any problem with Steam?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume I will be able to play my Steam games. Will I have any trouble with purchases or using the same credit card I&amp;rsquo;ve always used at home?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;There are a bunch of free to play MMOs. Off the top of my head: Neverwinter, DCUO, War Thunder, Marvel Heroes, etc (I&amp;rsquo;m not vouching for which ones are good)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a listing of free-to-play games, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot: &lt;a href=&#34;http://store.steampowered.com/genre/Free%20to%20Play/&#34;&gt;http://store.steampowered.com/genre/Free%20to%20Play/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it, this is what happens to 90% of steam-using redditors  after the steam sales. The other 10% already own all the steam games.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Why do all these phishing attempts come with bad English? That last sentence sounded Yoda-like though.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Steam needs to have an FAQ entry for this, it gets asked on reddit often. Not that people would read the FAQ before asking on reddit, but at least we can just give them the link as an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a guest pass for tf2, but I want to make sure I have enough disk space before I activate it so I don&amp;rsquo;t waste time later.&lt;/p&gt;
