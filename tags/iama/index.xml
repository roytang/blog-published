            &lt;p&gt;The correct answer to tabs vs spaces is &amp;ldquo;whichever the file you&amp;rsquo;re editing is already formatted with&amp;rdquo;. Unfortunately, no text editors have that preference&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Mick, are you an XBox or Playstation kind of guy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During your time as a pro wrestler, how did you explain to your kids what you were doing and how you were getting hurt? Did it give you any trouble raising them that they might try some of the dangerous stuff you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who do you think is the best superstar in the WWE right now?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;What happens when I call for a pizza to be delivered to a friend&amp;rsquo;s house, and when you get there he has no idea why you&amp;rsquo;re there and he&amp;rsquo;s not going to pay for the pizza or anything?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;How high does he think online piracy should rank in terms of America (and the world&amp;rsquo;s) priorities? Aren&amp;rsquo;t there a multitude of more pressing problems regarding poverty, education, unemployment, healthcare that the governments should focus on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does he compare the &amp;ldquo;no due process&amp;rdquo; provisions of SOPA (allowing websites to be shut down without need for evidence or hearing) to the constitutional guarantee of &amp;ldquo;innocent until proven guilty&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the MPAA even considering developing alternative business models that work with the internet instead of trying to destroy it?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I have no idea about microfinance or Kiva or Rwanda (and probably some other people are as ignorant as me), can you give us a lowdown?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much life savings did you set aside before going on your world tour? Do you still earn money while travelling?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always fantasized about going off to travel the world but I feel like it would be terribly difficult to leave behind my roots even for a shortish amount of time. How did you overcome that sort of thing?&lt;/p&gt;
