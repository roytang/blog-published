            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do reviews of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s review is for &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1015930/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage: Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;. This is a Norse mythology themed game based on a IRL boardgame. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those &amp;ldquo;place your guys on the map&amp;rdquo; boardgame where each player vies for control of provinces. The game is divided into three ages, and at the end of each age one of the provinces is destroyed as part of ragnarok. The players place units in each of the provinces, which have limited slots for units. During your turn you can choose to pillage a province, and other players can fight you for it if they have units there as well or can send units from adjacent provinces. A successfully pillage earns you a stat boost, and successfully defeating other players earns you glory, which is used to score for victory at the end of the game. The age ends when all the provinces have been pillaged or all the players no longer have any possible actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of each age the players draft 6 cards that will be available for them to use during the age. These include battle cards (which give you bonuses or abilities when fighting to pillage territories), upgrade cards (which give you either new abilities or new units or monsters to summon, each with special powers), or quests (which give you glory and stat bonuses at the end of the age if you fulfill their conditions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle and upgrade cards are mostly themed around the Norse Gods - Odin, Thor, Loki, Frigga, and Tyr. Each god has a different set of effects, and some can change your strategy so that you can win without having to actually win battles. For example, Tyr&amp;rsquo;s battle cards are all about giving you bonuses to combat, but Loki&amp;rsquo;s cards are all about earning you benefits when you lose combats. In many of our games, one of the player ends up being the &amp;ldquo;Loki player&amp;rdquo; who just joins every battle he can trying to gain those Loki bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battles are encouraged though; many of the upgrades and quests reward you with more glory for fighting and dying in battle, and having your units destroyed in ragnarok gives glory bonuses as well. At the start of each age, all previously destroyed units are again available for placement, so constantly getting into fights and getting sent to Valhalla can be a strategy as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve also gotten and played two of the expansions DLCs: &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1354120/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition__Mystics_of_Midgard/&#34;&gt;Mystics of Midgard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366580/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition__Gods_of_Asgard/&#34;&gt;Gods of Asgard&lt;/a&gt; (recently released). Mystics add a new unit type that can be drafted, including an annoying unit that can&amp;rsquo;t be killed as long as it has a province to retreat to after battle. The mystics usually end of being high draft picks. Gods of Asgard adds two randomly chosen Norse God figures to the board (among the 5 mentioned above), each one applies special properties to the province where they&amp;rsquo;re in, and they move do a different province after every pillage attempt. For example, Tyr makes it so that battles in the province only count battle cards and not the strength of the involved units; while Frigga makes it so that units in the province cannot die in battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was a bit buggy when we first got it in mid 2020, since it was just released, but it has steadily improved since then. We played it again recently after some time away and noted many improvements to the UI and quality of life changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is fun; we&amp;rsquo;ve played a reasonable amount of it (I&amp;rsquo;m at around 47 hours as of this writing.) It&amp;rsquo;s the kind of game where it&amp;rsquo;s easy and fun to mess around with what your opponents are doing, especially if you drafted some of the trickier cards. The only bad side would be that the games tend to go long, especially if someone drafted a good Loki deck or the Mystics are around or other such tricks. In our last session, we played 2 games for around 3 hours total.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A while back, on a whim I purchased this indie game &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/922710/Knightin/&#34;&gt;Knightin&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; on Steam. I forget how I came across it and why I decided to buy, but no regrets. It&amp;rsquo;s a tightly-focused dungeon crawler in the style of original Legend of Zelda/Link to the Past dungeons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each dungeon is a set of rooms you clear one at a time, until you get  to the dungeon boss and beat him. Clearing rooms involves defeating  enemies, solving puzzles, avoiding obstacles and opening chests. It&amp;rsquo;s a  short game, there are only four dungeons to clear each slightly more difficult than the last. There is no plot at all. The game itself openly admits this by painting the thinnest of flavors. You play Sir Lootalot and you want to beat the evil dark lord at the end of the fourth dungeon. For treasure! No princess to save or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I say &amp;ldquo;tightly-focused&amp;rdquo;, I mean that the game is barebones and does only what it says, but it does it very well. I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of how well-designed it is. It&amp;rsquo;s entirely predictable, you know what you&amp;rsquo;re getting into, but each part is executed really well. Each dungeon consists of multiple floors. Each floor has exactly twelve rooms, arranged in the same 3x4 rectangle shape every time. There&amp;rsquo;s a minimap that never changes shape, but maps room paths as you go. The minimap has a nice notation that indicates things like stairs up, stairs down, a merchant, a warp point, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combat is simple and straightforward as well. You don&amp;rsquo;t get a plethora of weapons like Link does in the Zelda series. You start out with a sword (obviously) and later you get access to a wand that lets you shoot fireballs, and those are your only weapons ever. Later you also learn to dash (which hits enemies with the sword), fire dash (which leaves a trail of flames as you dash), and learn a spin attack (a la Link to the Past). You only ever have to remember four buttons: swing sword, shoot wand, dash, and raise shield (and I very rarely use the shield).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obstacles in your way include enemies of course, and the difficulty ramp is great here as well. You start out with enemies that just walk around randomly and they damage you if they bump you. As you progress you meet more complicated foes. Enemies with ranged attacks. Enemies that chase you. Enemies that can move faster. Enemies that can pop out from under your feet. Enemies that can reproduce. And so on. They are always introduced one new enemy at a time so you get to know their shtick before you meet them in more difficult rooms. Rooms can also have obstacles, such as blades that suddenly jut out of the ground, rotating saw blades, pillars that shoot projectiles, and so on, all adding to room difficulty. Some rooms will have a merchant who sells stuff (you get gold from enemy drops), or chests you can open. Everything is pre-placed, no procedural generation here.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some puzzle rooms, which come in two types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;switch rooms, where you need to figure out which switches to turn on to access a chest or unlock a path. These are handled well enough. Although there&amp;rsquo;s no dialog anywhere, hints for the correct switch positions are scattered visually throughout the same floor of the dungeon where they are found. When you encounter a switch room, it&amp;rsquo;s usually just a matter of going back to previous rooms to see what the hints mean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;block rooms, where you need to push blocks around (only push! no pull!) to get them into the correct positions. I enjoyed the block puzzles more. They are relatively well-designed, and some took me a bit more time than I expected (maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just dumb? Lol)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements&lt;/strong&gt;. Completion in this game is largely straightforward as well. Most of the achievements are geared towards acquiring all the upgrades, opening all chests, and beating all the dungeons. The only two I didn&amp;rsquo;t get (and probably won&amp;rsquo;t bother to) are for doing a speedrun under 90 minutes and for doing a no death run. I tried a couple of post-game runs, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure I can do both of those after some number of tries, but I think I&amp;rsquo;m way too lazy for that. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it installed and maybe someday I&amp;rsquo;ll get around to it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall&lt;/strong&gt;: A very tight, focused, well-designed and quick indie game experience (my total play time so far is less than 3 hours). It&amp;rsquo;s relatively cheap on Steam too. It&amp;rsquo;s not super groundbreaking or anything, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth it for a couple of hours of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do reviews of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second review is about &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/718560/Scythe_Digital_Edition/&#34;&gt;Scythe: Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;. Scythe is a competitive game where you play one of seven factions in an alternate history post-war Eastern Europe. Players vie to control territories, hire workers, build mechs, accumulate resources, accomplish secret objectives, and other such goals. Accomplishing secret objectives, winning combats or maximizing one of the several metrics (workers, money, popularity, military power, recruits, structures, mechs, etc) earns you stars, and the game ends when at least one player has six stars. Having six stars doesn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee victory, as points are then tallied up depending on various factors including stars, territories, money, popularity, and so on. Having separate victory and end conditions creates a bit of tension and a balancing act between progressing stars and earning points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players play as one of seven available factions, each with preset locations on the board. The board is preset and consists of hex tiles, each with different movement limitations and resources that can be produced. The board also has &amp;ldquo;encounters&amp;rdquo; on certain tiles, basically roleplaying opportunities where you get the choice of an action to take, typically trading one type of resource for another, usually a good deal, if you can pay the costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board is fixed, but each player is randomly assigned a mat that determines the actions available during their turn. The mat is split into top actions (produce, move, bolster, trade) each paired with one of the available bottom actions (upgrade, deploy mech, recruit, build structure). During your turn, you may play one top action followed by the corresponding bottom action, and you cannot do the same action pair on successive turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weird action structure makes the game challenging. Typically, the top actions generate resources, while the bottom actions consume them to advance your goals. If you get a mat with pairings that are poor for your particular situation, it may take a while for you to get into a regular rhythm of production to actually get anything done. Other players can also interfere with you by sending their character and/or mechs to attack or harass your territory or workers. I usually find that I need to plan ahead 2-3 turns to accomplish a simple goal like building a mech. Beyond the 3-turn window, who knows what the board looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combat is kind of straightforward - you can attack a hex with one or two combat units, and up to two combat units will defend it. Each side can spend up to 7 military power, plus play one combat card per unit on their side, each card adds 2-5 to your total. The attacker wins all ties, favoring aggressors. Due to the way military power and combat cards are accumulated, it&amp;rsquo;s risky to initiate combat unless you have at least 14 military power (this ensures you have a fighting chance against a counterattack). Furthermore, each faction can only gain up to 2 stars from winning combats, so you want to make them count. In our games, we find that typically the winning faction will use two combats to try to earn 2 stars in one turn and end the game, and often those will be the only combats that happen in the entire game. Not sure if we are playing this optimally!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games tend to go at least an hour long, roughly 20 or so turns in our experience. Because of the game&amp;rsquo;s pacing and action structure, you can have games where it feels like I haven&amp;rsquo;t accomplished much by then. Usually this creates a bit of snowball effect as well - the player who gets his act together earlier will tend to pull ahead and be difficult to catch up to. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComebackMechanic&#34;&gt;comeback mechanism&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;rsquo;re missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The display is literally just the actual board, and the camera can be a bit finicky sometimes. In my last game I accidentally rotated the view and took a minute to figure out how to get it back. The UI is also fairly sparse and a lot of information or options can be hidden in the weirdest places. Like, figuring out where your faction is allowed to cross rivers can be challenging for new players. I&amp;rsquo;ve attached some screenshots to this post, but they&amp;rsquo;re nothing special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably just relevant to my playgroup, but because of the slow pace, we tend to play a second metagame on top of the endgame scoring, where we consider the player who has spent the least amount of time on his turns (as seen via the turn clock) as &amp;ldquo;winning by time&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the digital board games we&amp;rsquo;ve played, this is the one where we have the least amount of playtime. Unsurprising given how slow the pace is and how difficult it is. For this reason, I think it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to recommend to any boardgame newbies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do reviews of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/337150/Sentinels_of_the_Multiverse/&#34;&gt;Sentinels of the Multiverse&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ve played the IRL boardgame of it before during one of our sporadic in-person meetups. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, it&amp;rsquo;s a comics-themed coop game where up to 4 people play as a group of heroes to beat a villain (basically comic book shenanigans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a large variety of heroes available to play, each with unique abilities and play styles. Some of them are straightforward and some are super complicated and fiddly to play. The villains you have to beat vary from super simple to really difficult, with advanced variants for even more challenge. The game also provides a &amp;ldquo;weekly one-shot&amp;rdquo; challenge which provides a fixed scenario/villain and set of heroes to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve played a lot of games of Sentinels, and probably only won something like 60-70% of them. Each game takes around an hour or so, maybe more if it was super difficult. Usually we lose when we choose some combination of random heroes just to try them out then get beaten terribly by the villain. Then we go on a revenge run using one of the simpler heroes like Legacy or Tachyon (or we just put in a healer like Dr Medico).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digital version has the advantage that it automates a lot of the ability triggers and checks that the boardgame requires, which would usually be a lot of work. On the other hand, it has a UX disadvantage for those scenarios where an ability triggers multiple times and you want to make the same decision every time. In the real board game, you can just handwave it off by saying &amp;ldquo;Ok, we choose X is every time&amp;rdquo;, but in the digital version you have to click through every confirmation dialog every time.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;9b343c2c14c495c5a8dd6b1afec25ba2-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/digital-boardgames-review-sentinels-of-the-multiverse/sentinels.jpg&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;15 Feb 2021 7:34am&#34;&gt;15 Feb 2021 7:34am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game&amp;rsquo;s aesthetic is very much classic comic books, even multiplayer games are joined by entering a code in the format of a comic book issue like &amp;ldquo;Justice Comics #153&amp;rdquo;. The art isn&amp;rsquo;t the most elaborate and could be better; in fact, they are planning a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/27/22250963/sentinels-of-the-multiverse-definitive-kickstarter-street-date-price&#34;&gt;Definitive Edition of the boardgame&lt;/a&gt; that has even better art that is closer to the old-school comic book aesthetic. It looks like a signficant upgrade, so I expect if they ever release a digital version of the new version it would be a completely new game on Steam. Our group has enjoyed our Sentinels games though, so I fully expect we will be getting the new Steam version when it does come out.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Game Review: Super Mario 3d All-stars
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/mario-3d-all-stars/</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2020 06:03:35 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/mario-3d-all-stars/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;So I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/09/nintendo-switch/&#34;&gt;got a Nintendo Switch last month&lt;/a&gt;. One of the first games I had gotten for the system was the recently released Super Mario 3d All-Stars. I had really been wanting to play Super Mario Odyssey instead, but my brother had a copy of that game that I could borrow later, so I decided to get 3dAS first, as I had never really played the 3 games on the collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly played the 2d Mario games prior to this, with the exception of 3d Land (3DS) and 3d World (WiiU), although both of those games were closer in style to the the 2d mario games than to the games in this collection. The three games here share the same style of having a hub-like world from which you visit other worlds to accomplish missions to get stars/shines. The other worlds have multiple &amp;ldquo;episodes&amp;rdquo; so you have to replay each of them a bunch of times (doing different things each time) to get all the stars/shines available in those worlds. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of a clever world to save on level design resources - each world is essentially multiple stages sharing the same maps and objects and so on. It can also mean the player might get tired of repeating the same worlds over and over, but the hub system means they can visit other worlds for a while if that happens. As you gather stars/shines, you unlock more areas of the hub world and thus more worlds/stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t optimistic about SM64 going in. I played a little bit of it on the DS when it was released there, didn&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy it. Released in 1996, I know it&amp;rsquo;s regarded as a classic and revolutionized 3d platforming in its day, but for me it hasn&amp;rsquo;t really aged very well. My problems with the title are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor camera handling. You don&amp;rsquo;t have smooth right-stick control of the camera (since the N64 did not have a right analog stick), and the camera angles are often limited in how you can rotate them around. There&amp;rsquo;s a button to toggle the camera from Lakitu perspective to Mario perspective, which is annoying for me since I don&amp;rsquo;t find the over-the-shoulder Mario perspective useful, and I accidentally keep hitting the toggle button. There is a setting to disable the Mario perspective altogether (such that the toggle button now fixes the camera to a given position instead), but the setting resets every time you load your game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even when the camera is in Lakitu mode, it will often turn or rotate far too quickly for my taste, and for me this means if I play the game for around an hour or so I start getting dizzy, and this is the main dealbreaker for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find it quite difficult to control Mario in this game as well. His normal movement is to run, not to walk, so a simple flick of the left analog stick moves him farther than I&amp;rsquo;d like, and the same goes for his jumps. I think it&amp;rsquo;s because this was their first 3d game, so they hadn&amp;rsquo;t really calibrated yet what would be a good walk/run speed and jump distance. Adding to that, some actions like turning Mario in a new direction combined with jumping can cause him to jump in a different direction/distance, it&amp;rsquo;s something to get used to. You don&amp;rsquo;t have much jump control once you are in mid-air either. So for difficult platforming segments, I often found it challenging to position Mario for precise jumps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of the worlds/stages are also quite frustrating. You will be dying quite often. This is unsurprising for a Mario game, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that many of the sequences are a bit long so it can be annoying to re-do them. Combined with the finnicky controls and the often weird camera angles, it can cause unnecessary frustration. Even worse, when you die, you are not just kicked back to the start of the stage, but most of the time you are kicked out of the stage altogether and back to the hub world. A minor inconvenience, but it still means additional friction in the try-fail-retry cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of try-fail-retry, a lot of the missions really require you to spend multiple lives dying and trying again. This isn&amp;rsquo;t unexpected, but a lot of them can be extremely challenging. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking in particular of that one mission where you have to race a penguin down a twisty icy slope, where veering off the slope means death. Trying to get to the end of the icy slope is bad enough - it&amp;rsquo;s going to take you a lot of trial and error to do so - but then you have to make sure you get there ahead of the penguin too. I feel like a lot of the more challenging missions carry over some of the &amp;ldquo;Nintendo hard&amp;rdquo; mentality from the NES/SNES generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t managed to even finish SM64 yet, so I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are a lot more challenging stages ahead. As of this writing, my progress stands at a pitiful 17 stars obtained (out of a possible 120). The dizziness due to the camera is the main problem for me. I may try to come back to it later, but for now there are better games to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario Sunshine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released in 2002 for the GameCube, Sunshine is the mainline Mario I&amp;rsquo;ve never even tried before. I later found out that Sunshine is considered one of the most difficult 3d Mario games to date. I will tend to disagree; I think the average SM64 stage is more difficult than Super Mario Sunshine, given that I was actually able to beat Sunshine. I will concede that 120-shine completion is probably very difficult for Sunshine though, but more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunshine provides some improvements over SM64:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most significant upgrade is graphically. It&amp;rsquo;s a huge jump over SM64&amp;rsquo;s blocky polygons, and Mario&amp;rsquo;s appearance here is already pretty close to his latest modern appearances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still find walk/run controls a bit slippery, but there is significant improvement in jump control since this game gives you FLUDD (the water jetstream firing thing), which has hover functionality making it easier to make difficult jumps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsurprisingly, the most challenging parts of the game are the &amp;ldquo;secret&amp;rdquo; platforming stages where Mario is denied the use of FLUDD. These secrets usually have to be accessed at a certain point in the composite worlds. Although these secret stages are difficult, the blow is kind of softened by two things: if you die, you are returned to the start of the secret stage (instead of kicked out to the containing/hub world); and most of the stages will have one or more 1-ups available, with one easily available near the start of the stage. You&amp;rsquo;re still going to need to grind a lot to finish these secret stages, but at least you&amp;rsquo;re not likely to run out of lives doing so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also most of the game&amp;rsquo;s worlds and settings are a lot more fun in terms of ambience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, I did manage &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1314224120490389504/&#34;&gt;to beat Super Mario Sunshine a couple of weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;. I finished with around 77 shines (out of a possible 120). I may eventually come back to it for completion, although that looks challenging. The main challenge would probably be completing the blue coins in each world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario Galaxy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally released in 2007, Galaxy is easily the best game in this collection. I tried playing this back when I first got a WiiU (by borrowing the game and a couple of WiiMotes from a friend). At the time I wasn&amp;rsquo;t thrilled with the WiiMote control scheme, especially with having to use the WiiMote as an imprecise pointer, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t get far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m obviously much happier with the Switch version. In handheld mode, you use touch controls on the screen to do the pointer stuff (like to collect star bits), which is much easier and more precise than using the WiiMote (or pointing the joycon in TV mode), so that&amp;rsquo;s my preferred mode of playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some stages that require motion controls, where I find I need to switch to TV control. Examples are the ones where you have to control a Mario riding a rolling ball, or Mario riding a manta ray surfing along a water track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game itself is very beautiful and significantly easier (or at least, less frustrating) than the first two games. You don&amp;rsquo;t have FLUDD this time, but Mario gets a spin jump that gives him additional jump control. And longer stages now have checkpoints in between so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to start over from the beginning if you die. Many of the stages are fun to play and do a lot of innovative things like playing around with gravity and such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still some challenging stages. Two of them specifically come to mind: The first one is Galaxy&amp;rsquo;s Greatest Wave, which is one of the aforementioned ray-surfing stages. The race course is very twisty and challening, and if you take each turn too fast or don&amp;rsquo;t turn just the right amount, you&amp;rsquo;re going to be falling off. There are a number of 1-ups along the course, and I managed to get to 99 lives in trying to finish the course. My personal estimate is that I probably re-did the course at least a hundred times. The second one that comes to mind is Luigi&amp;rsquo;s Purple Coins, a stage only available after beating the game the first time. It&amp;rsquo;s a stage where you have to be constantly jumping across disappearing platforms while collecting purple coins all within a time limit. It took me a lot less tries than the ray-surfing one, but each try was exhausting since you&amp;rsquo;re jumping all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I wish they would have done for this port was add more button support for the menus, instead of having to use tap/motion control for many of them (such as when retrying a level).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1317023064555548672/&#34;&gt;finished Galaxy for the first time&lt;/a&gt; last week, and completed the bonus Purple coin missions a few days later. That makes it the first game of this trilogy where &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1318238520251621377/&#34;&gt;I hit the goal of 120 stars&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the first two games though, Galaxy has an additional &amp;ldquo;second quest&amp;rdquo;, an additional 120 stars to be earned while playing as Luigi. Again, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably come back to this at another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Switch is a great console for these games, since I can easily pick it up at any time and play a couple of stages in handheld mode. I was worried whether this purchase would be worth it, since to be honest I&amp;rsquo;m getting a bit old and am not as good as the platforming stuff as I used to be. Platforming in 3d only adds an additional level of difficulty for me personally. But overall, it was a good purchase. I somehow managed to beat two of the games, and it was nice to see how the 3d Mario games evolve through the years. It&amp;rsquo;s too bad they didn&amp;rsquo;t include Galaxy 2, which by all accounts is as good as Galaxy was. My fingers and wrists are tired from all the jumping though, so maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll put down the Switch for a few days before I get started with Odyssey.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Late Game Review: Uncharted 4: A Thief&#39;s End

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I finished Uncharted 4: A Thief&amp;rsquo;s End yesterday, and I felt like making a post about it, since I had a bunch of screenshots. Late game review because the game came out in 2016. I think I got it from PS+? Certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first played the original Uncharted trilogy back in 2010-2011, but I found out just now while writing this post that I never finished Uncharted 3 (started yes, apparently), so that explains why some story elements seemed unfamiliar in the 4th game. (I think I may have also gotten the trilogy remaster via PS+, so maybe I should play the 3rd game too? Maybe.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually have to thank the Uncharted series for getting my into this kind of single player adventure game in the first place. After Uncharted, I played some kinda similar games like Infamous, Tomb Raider etc, I was never that into the genre before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main complaint with the series is the sheer suspension of disbelief it requires to imagine a person like Nathan Drake could exist: basically a human at peak physical ability, able to fearlessly leap off high cliffs and cling onto walls with unbelievable grip and upper body strength, barely ever getting tired, while at the same time good enough at gunplay to go up against armies of battle-hardened mercenaries and come out on top. Oh, and he has an intimate knowledge of archaeology and is also able to find ancient lost treasures and cities all the time apparently. And also he&amp;rsquo;s pretty good at sketching. It&amp;rsquo;s fine, after all what are video games but power fantasies right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncharted 4 gives us a deeper look at Nathan Drake&amp;rsquo;s background and how he grew up to be like this, and we find out that not only is he this human at the peak of physical ability, he also has a brother who, despite 15 years rotting away in some backwater prison, is also at peak physical ability and also has all the rest of Nathan&amp;rsquo;s abilities (except the sketching though). (Cue Star Wars prequel meme &amp;ldquo;This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from that minor complaint, the games are pretty great though. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, the games are highly linear and story-driven, consisting of set pieces and sequences that are either platforming/exploratory (figure out how to get from point A to point B) or combat/stealth vs the aforementioned armies of battle-hardened mercenaries. Oh, and there&amp;rsquo;s the occasional puzzle too. Uncharted 4 adds some new elements such as letting you drive a car (4 wheel drive) around in what seems like an open world (it really isn&amp;rsquo;t), but it&amp;rsquo;s still mostly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a big action game player, so I dislike the combat parts and I die a lot there. You can see in one of the screenshots later that my shooting accuracy rate was like 49%. For this reason, I&amp;rsquo;m not inclined to go for achievement completion on this one (or any of the Uncharted games for that matter), since there are many combat-related and difficulty-related trophies, and even one that requires me to finish the game with like a 70% accuracy rate. Good luck with that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dying a lot isn&amp;rsquo;t a problem, as the game is very forgiving. There are a generous number of checkpoints, and there&amp;rsquo;s really no penalty for dying too much. (Again, you can see in the stats screenshot that I failed checkpoints 105 times.) It&amp;rsquo;s kind of unavoidable with on-rails games like these - there are plenty of spots where if you don&amp;rsquo;t climb or run or jump in just the exact way the game wants, you&amp;rsquo;ll die and fail the checkpoint. It&amp;rsquo;s not super frustrating since you never really have to repeat too much, but it&amp;rsquo;s that kind of game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I guess Nathan Drake is famous now, because people know about his discoveries from the first 3 games, but I feel like he should be richer than he is portrayed. Not that he&amp;rsquo;s poor, but surely he got away with a few valuable trinkets here and there during his adventures right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Story-wise it feels like they planned this to be Nathan Drake&amp;rsquo;s final run, given the epilogue, but who knows? I mean in their universe, Sully is pretty old but he still also does ridiculous stunts with the rest of the gang. And they did introduce some new characters, so it&amp;rsquo;s not far-fetched there&amp;rsquo;ll be another Uncharted game later on, possibly with someone else as the lead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, game is pretty good, play it if you can, happy to have ticked it off the backlog! Have some screenshots:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Finally finished Divinity Original Sin 2. Not sure if I should do a review since due to character choices and party comp, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve only scratched the surface of the content, and it might take a couple more runs to alleviate that. But it&amp;rsquo;s a great turn-based RPG!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Review: The Outer Worlds

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/11/outer-worlds/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I bought the Outer Worlds &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/11/b4op_a_h17a/&#34;&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because I had been without both my graphics card and my PS4 for a bit and I kind of wanted to play a relatively new game. I got the PS4 version because I hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet replaced my video card at the time and besides, the game was not available on Steam. I guess minor spoilers follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary: A reasonable Fallout-esque RPG from the makers of Fallout: New Vegas. It&amp;rsquo;s not as expansive or quite as nonlinear as their previous games, but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty serviceable and there&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable amount of stuff to do. A decent purchase, though I chafe at buying games at full $60 price these days lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;setting is a far future corporate dystopia in a remote human colony. Or at least, a caricature of a corporate dystopia. Your main enemies are evil corporations, which appeals to my recent disdain for capitalism. There are no intelligent alien races to interact with, but plently of wild animals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the space map shows something like 6-7 inhabited planets in the cluster, but you really only interact with 3-4 of them so that&amp;rsquo;s disappointing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are some gorgeous environments on those planets though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feels a bit like Fallout, with the general aesthetic hewing closely to Fallout&amp;rsquo;s 40s/50s vibe. Even the loading screens and movie advertisements are throwbacks to monster flicks from that era.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also feels a bit like Mass Effect, mainly with you getting a ship and the shuffling between worlds and the companion system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would say the companions are not as fleshed out as the Mass Effect ones though. Some of them are a lot less fleshed out than others. One of them is basically just a cleaning robot that you stuck a gun to, and he has no further storyline. Also, tbere is no companion romance option, but completing companion questlines unlocks an extra perk for them (though this isn&amp;rsquo;t clearly indicated when it happens, you have to check their status screen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phineas Welles gives a strong Rick Sanchez vibe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It isn&amp;rsquo;t a true open world, more like a forest of smaller open world areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a lot of quests to do, at least at the start, and they do a good job of putting the other quests in your path so that you naturally feel like you&amp;rsquo;re running into them. Towards the last third of the game, new quests seem to taper off though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually, by the last third of the game, everything felt a bit same-y. I was definitely less enthused to play towards the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combat especially doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much variation. Either enemies run at you with melee weapons or shoot at you from afar etc. I wish I used a more sniper-rifle style with scoped hunting rifles, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t. There is a version of VATS (which only you can use so somehow its a superpower), but it&amp;rsquo;s more like a bullet time effect to help you aim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like the voice acting, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty decent, although as always it&amp;rsquo;s noticeable when multiple NPCs have the same VA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load time between areas can be a bit horrendous, sometimes as long as 1-2 minutes, or does it only feel that way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It feels like you earn a lot of money, but there isn&amp;rsquo;t really anything to spend it on. There&amp;rsquo;s no reason to buy anything from shops, you&amp;rsquo;ll get more than you ever need just from looting and picking up stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a respec machine on your ship, which is cool, since it means you can commit skill points without too much fear of screwing up. However, I never really felt the need to respec during my run. I did respec after finishing the game to do some achievements though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Level cap is 30. I did all the quests I could and I got to the cap before the point of no return, so that was annoying. I even went with nonviolent solutions a lot of the time, so if you were one of those guys who like to kill all the enemies instead, you&amp;rsquo;ll hit the level cap even earlier. You won&amp;rsquo;t be able to max a lot of skills. I like to be a &amp;ldquo;jack of all trades&amp;rdquo; kind of guy, so my skill distribution was fairly spread out and I was only able to max one skill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For some reason, the game has a plethora of consumable items. I suspect these are mainly to support the hardest difficulty (supernova), as on normal difficulty there was never any reason to use a consumable other than the standard &amp;ldquo;Heal X HP&amp;rdquo; item.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished the game yesteday, on normal difficulty. I actually started out on hard, but then, surprise, I had a hard time at the start. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be too stressed so I downgraded to medium for the rest of the run. I got the &amp;ldquo;good ending&amp;rdquo;, that is to say, the one where you &amp;ldquo;defeat&amp;rdquo; the corporate master class, such as they are. Normal difficulty is relatively stress-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually want to go for 100% achievement completion, but this game had one that requires finishing on the highest difficulty, so that&amp;rsquo;s another run altogether. Presumably the second run would be much faster since I don&amp;rsquo;t have to do everything any more. I might get around to it someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screenshots follow!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Finally had the time to play &lt;em&gt;Marvel&amp;rsquo;s Spider-Man for PS4&lt;/em&gt;. Took just a little under two weeks from start to Platinum. Maybe mild, unmarked spoilers somewhere in this review, be warned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall: the game was amazing and spectacular and fun, especially for a big comic book fan like me, well worth the buy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanics: Combat felt a bit weird to me at first, mainly because I was expecting it to be closer to Arkham-style combat, and I kept trying to use Spider-Man&amp;rsquo;s Circle Dodge the same way I use Batman&amp;rsquo;s Triangle counter, and that got me clocked by the first boss of the game (Kingpin) a few times. Spider-man&amp;rsquo;s Dodge doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow you to cancel out of existing animations like Batman&amp;rsquo;s counter, so I really needed to unlearn that instinct. Once you get a hang of it, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty good, but feels a lot more chaotic than Arkham style combat. Arkham combat felt a lot more rhythmic where you just tap commands out and point at the baddie you want to hit. Here it feels like you have to be jumping all the time and swinging across the air and moving the camera around to look for objects to throw at enemies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanics: Web-swinging around Manhattan also felt weird at first. Sometimes the command to web swing would be unresponsive, which I would later realize would be because I was at a height that was too high to find surfaces to swing from. Once you get the hang of it, it feels very smooth and fun and you&amp;rsquo;re zipping around Manhattan like a boss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Story: Peter Parker in this universe is reminiscent of old-school Peter Parker who&amp;rsquo;s always late to things and always behind on his rent. The early parts have him getting evicted from his apartment (classic Parker!) and looking for a place to crash. (Although after that point, it&amp;rsquo;s never mentioned where he&amp;rsquo;s sleeping, if he is at all.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Story: Spider-man here is however, a well-known public figure, a veteran of super-heroing who even gets some assistance from law enforcement primarily in the form of Captain Yuri Watanabe. He&amp;rsquo;s been webslinging around long enough to build a stable of villains who are constantly referenced about being held in the Raft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanics: There&amp;rsquo;s actually a lot to do around the city. Not really collectibles, but more like different kinds of challenges and missions. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of crimes to stop that you&amp;rsquo;ll hear on police bands as you&amp;rsquo;re web-swinging around. More difficult crimes and missions unlock as the story progresses, and they all come with optional objectives (such as perform X type of special move, etc) that give you bonus rewards. There&amp;rsquo;s also stealth missions reminiscent of Arkham&amp;rsquo;s predator modes, pigeon chasing, research missions that have you doing all sorts of weird tasks, and so on. Missions typically reward you with some form of tokens, which are used to unlock suits, gadgets and upgrades. This Spider-Man has a lot of gadgets, making him closer to a Batman figure in this universe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Story: In this universe, J. Jonah Jameson is retired from his days at the Daily Bugle and instead hosts an internet radio show where as can be expected, he&amp;rsquo;s always castigating Spider-Man. His broadcasts come in as you&amp;rsquo;re swinging around the city, and Jonah will often comment on things you&amp;rsquo;ve recently done or missions recently accomplished. I especially like it when one of the missions had you doing something ridiculous like intentionally swinging through smog and Jonah makes wild speculations about what the hell you were smoking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanics: The suit selection in the game is fairly good, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of suits available and you unlock more as you level up (you need to purchase them with tokens). You can change costumes at any time, and most cutscenes will show Spider-Man wearing whatever suit you have on at the time, which can be sometimes hilarious. I&amp;rsquo;m severaly disappointed at the lack of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/spiderman/images/6/69/F0ab528486904cef1297397514b73ef9.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120721011355&#34;&gt;Fantastic Four Amazing Bag-Man costume&lt;/a&gt; though. My favorite costume from this game is the classic comic book costume (screenshots below), I really like how well it&amp;rsquo;s animated so smoothly and gives such a cartoony vibe. I would totally play an entire game rendered in this fashion. It&amp;rsquo;s also hilarious when this costume is used in cutscenes!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/KcHOHTc.png&#34; alt=&#34;My favorite costume!&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/4KOBWj0.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Why won&amp;rsquo;t you take me seriously MJ?!?&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imgur.com/XyiqRIW.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Those guns won&amp;rsquo;t work on me, I&amp;rsquo;m a cartoon!&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mystery: I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why, but the distance scaling in this game is super-off. In-game measurements tell me Manhattan island is about 4 km from top to bottom, which feels really small. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan&#34;&gt;Wikipedia entry&lt;/a&gt; says Manhattan is almost 60 sq km, but in-game it can&amp;rsquo;t be more than 10 sq km. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why it would be like this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Story/Mechanics: You don&amp;rsquo;t get to play as Peter Parker/Spider-Man all the time, there&amp;rsquo;s also a few missions you have to play out as one of two side characters. One of them is the lovable spunky red-headed Mary Jane Watson, who in this universe is not a supermodel actress, but rather has a more Lois-Lane like role as an investigative reported for the Daily Bugle. That means she gets herself into all sorts of troublesome situations where she has to sneak around enemies in order to escape. She&amp;rsquo;s no damsel in distress here, I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure if Peter ever rescues her directly. I like this MJ iteration, she has a lot more spunk. The other side character you get to play at is young Miles Morales, who enter&amp;rsquo;s Peter&amp;rsquo;s life somewhere in the 2nd act of the story. Miles parts consist of sneaking around as well, although he has a different toolset than MJ, mainly consisting of a hacking app that lets him create distractions to bypass guards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Story: One of the best things in this game&amp;rsquo;s story is the mentorship relationship between Peter Parker and Otto Octavius, although if you know comics, you have a pretty good idea of where this is headed. Unlike the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2004/07/movies-spiderman-2/&#34;&gt;2nd Tobey movie&lt;/a&gt;, the game gives their relationship sufficient time to develop before you start to see signs of trouble. The fall itself is well-executed and heavily foreshadowed and Peter has only himself to blame when he finds out he helped turn his mentor into an insane mechanical octopus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Story: The overall story had some twists and some surprises in the ending itself. At the heart of all the problems facing Spider-Man this time around is the incumbent Mayor Norman Osborn, but who never actually turns into a green villain himself. The game&amp;rsquo;s ending heavily hints at a 2nd outing, so they&amp;rsquo;re probably saving Norman for later. Wise decision as well, Spider-Man has a deep bench of villains to pull from, and many of the classic ones haven&amp;rsquo;t been hinted at yet in this game. Aside from the Goblin, the 2nd game could very well introduce us to the Lizard, Sandman, Mysterio, and maybe even Venom among others!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After getting the platinum, I was tempted to purchase the &amp;ldquo;City That Never Sleeps&amp;rdquo; DLCs as well for additional content, but I decided to hold off for now. My experience already feels &amp;ldquo;complete&amp;rdquo; and just right anyway, and adding more missions might be too repetitive. Maybe if it goes on sale sometime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stan Lee (RIP) also had a small cameo in this game. For me it&amp;rsquo;s bittersweet that I got the platinum a couple of days after his death; I consider the game to be a fitting tribute to his life&amp;rsquo;s work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is tradition, here&amp;rsquo;s a screendump, awash with in-game spoilers! (Mainly because I chose to include the automatic screenshots that came with each Trophy unlock). You can see during the later parts I was using the comic costume almost exclusively!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Late Game Review -- Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch (2013)

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(&amp;ldquo;Late Game Review&amp;rdquo; because I&amp;rsquo;m trying to play through games on my ridiculously old backlog, so these games are pretty old)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my digital PS3 copy of &lt;em&gt;Ni No Kuni&lt;/em&gt; during some kind of PSN sale a while back for like $10 and seeing as how the sequel came out recently, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d better finish the first game before my rarely-used PS3 decides to die on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the game was great and I enjoyed it enough to go for the platinum (post-game was a bit grindy though):&lt;/p&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#ed40962d3c92d7f644de56616ab1d035-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/10/late-game-review-ni-no-kuni-wrath-of-the-white-witch-2013/DopmwwhUcAMCTak.jpg-large_hu00624a9d56d0f06fdbe8477345c3c7f9_109019_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;ed40962d3c92d7f644de56616ab1d035-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/10/late-game-review-ni-no-kuni-wrath-of-the-white-witch-2013/DopmwwhUcAMCTak.jpg-large.jpg&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;13 Oct 2018 1:00am&#34;&gt;13 Oct 2018 1:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visually, it&amp;rsquo;s a very pretty game, animated Ghibli-style. The combat system is basically Pokemon. So yes, it&amp;rsquo;s Ghibli+Pokemon. Pokemon in this game are called &amp;ldquo;familiars&amp;rdquo; and each party member can have up to 3 familiars ready to fight in battle. The party members can fight directly as well, but most of the time it&amp;rsquo;s a better idea to let your familiars go at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, the grindiest part of the post-game was collecting all the familiars. Ok, not all of them, the achievement only required 250 different species captured, but that&amp;rsquo;s a helluva lot. During the normal main game run, I only captured a bit less than 100 different species. It was made more grindy by the fact that there&amp;rsquo;s no mechanism for trying to capture the familiars (i.e. pokeballs), you basically just have to beat them in battle and whenever you beat one, there&amp;rsquo;s like a 2-8% chance that you will get an opportunity to recruit it. Thankfully, you can shortcut the grind a bit by collecting the lower level ones and using metamorphoses (basically pokemon evolutions) to get the higher level ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story feels like it&amp;rsquo;s targeted towards children, so it has a kind of fairy tale feel, and the world is very bright and cheerful (mostly) and there&amp;rsquo;s things like a kingdom where the king is a giant cat, and so on. Not that the plot is simple mind you &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s quite a bit or parallel worlds, a tiny bit of time travel, and a few plot twists thrown in (although you might have seen them coming).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of the game has to be all the puns. Many of the familiars have some sort of pun involved in their name, like there&amp;rsquo;s a dog familiar called &amp;ldquo;Ruffian&amp;rdquo;; there&amp;rsquo;s an egg-shaped familiar with a pharoah mask called &amp;ldquo;Eggyptian&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s a cat thief familiar called &amp;ldquo;Purrloiner&amp;rdquo;, who evolves into a &amp;ldquo;Cutpurrse&amp;rdquo;, and can then evolve into another form which you can fight on the seas called a &amp;ldquo;Puss in Boats&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s a sheep familiar called &amp;ldquo;Baatender&amp;rdquo; who can evolve into a &amp;ldquo;Baabarian&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s a familiar that wears a turban and he&amp;rsquo;s called a &amp;ldquo;Turbandit&amp;rdquo;, and he has higher forms called &amp;ldquo;Turban Myth&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Turban Legend&amp;rdquo;. Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ll stop before I enumerate them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a few other systems familiar to JRPG players &amp;ndash; crafting, a casino, farming enemies for drops, bounty hunts, errand boards and so on on. Oh and some nonsense about fixing people&amp;rsquo;s hearts by finding people willing to contribute attributes like confidence and kindness and whatnot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all a very fun game and something I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have gotten off my backlog! Not sure if I&amp;rsquo;ll have time to play the second game though, maybe in another five years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Review: Persona 5 (You Never Saw It Coming)
</title>

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2017/06/review-persona-5-you-never-saw-it-coming/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;My first Persona game was Persona 4 Golden on the Vita &amp;ndash; a fantastic game. After that I dived into Persona 3 Portable and eventually the spin-off games Persona 4 Arena (and Ultimax) and Persona Q on 3DS. So it was no surprise that one of the game releases I was most looking forward to this year would be the next numbered game in the series: Persona 5 on the Playstation 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like P4G before it, the focus is on the school life of a young man forced into a new environment, interspersed with some good old JRPG dungeon crawling. You meet a ragtag group of misfits and somehow band together to save all of Japanese society from itself. Or something to that extent. This is just an excuse to dump some screens of P5, so let&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;#resources&#34;&gt;get that out of the way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JRPG side streamlines a lot of the problems from P4G: the main story dungeons are hand-built JRPG style dungeons and there are save points in between to make dying not so much of a pain. Even on normal difficulty, I still managed to die a few times &amp;ndash; notably to those Angel enemies that tend to suicide when low on life. And they brought back Persona negotiation! I didn&amp;rsquo;t appreciate this too much in &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei IV&lt;/em&gt; as it felt a bit obtuse there, but here the Persona&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;personality&amp;rdquo; is shown which makes it easier to figure out the &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be leading a team of thieves there&amp;rsquo;s also a bit of a &amp;ldquo;stealth system&amp;rdquo; while dungeon crawling. It&amp;rsquo;s not a very deep stealth system, basically just hide behind corners and ambush enemies to gain battle advantage. The only problem is that the camera and the controls don&amp;rsquo;t always agree with your stealth plans, and sometimes the wrong button press can lead you to disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Phantom Thieves story is okay, although most of the plot is telegraphed ahead of time. I kind of liked P4G&amp;rsquo;s big murder mystery where you had to figure out who among your confidants was a big ‘ol bad guy. Here in P5, it&amp;rsquo;s painfully obvious who sold you out, even if you hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed his &amp;ldquo;mistake&amp;rdquo; early on. That being said, there is a surprise twist near the end that caught me by surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to P4G, Persona 5 comes out at the height of social media, so while I like the P4G&amp;rsquo;s battle theme a bit better, P5&amp;rsquo;s battle music has managed to become a meme of its own:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WUWQFnC2zqU&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must&amp;rsquo;ve seen this video at least 50 times now due to some of my friends (you know who you are).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I dislike about the Persona series is that because of the time management aspect of the game, a lot of things are missable. Since I tend to play RPGs without any guides or walkthroughs the first time around, it&amp;rsquo;s problematic for me. This means that on my first run through I missed completing the Confidants/Social Links, even though when I started the run I told myself I&amp;rsquo;d prioritize them over other activities. Definitely need a second run for the platinum. (Of course, I have yet to platinum P4G either due to a mistake I made during the second run~)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion: Despite (or maybe because of?) it&amp;rsquo;s ridiculousness, Persona 5 is a great game. Story is tight, and the dungeon crawling has been streamlined a lot. That being said, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely not a game for everyone, mostly because of the style. If you dislike Japanese stuff or anime or anything turn-based, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely not for you. Go play Call of Duty or something. For everyone else, enjoy one of the year&amp;rsquo;s best JRPGs (sorry FF15!)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When dungeon crawling, you can summon mighty persona in battle! They&amp;amp;rsquo;re like Pokemon, only way more phallic.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Dragon Age: Inquisition spoiler-free review: First off, the game is vast. There&amp;rsquo;s a ridiculous amount of quests, collectibles and stuff to do. Exploring feels a bit like Kingdom of Amalur where you can&amp;rsquo;t go far without encountering something to pick up or bad guys to fight. The fighting is a bit more arcade-y than Origins (I did not play DA2 so I cannot compare); I only really switch to Tactical view when fights get tough, the action mode is good enough maybe 60-70% of the time. A real time-sink, this one.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates&lt;/strong&gt; is an action-RPG by Square Enix. The original Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles came out on the NGC. &lt;strong&gt;Ring of Fates&lt;/strong&gt; is a different game for the NDS, though I guess it&amp;rsquo;s sort of a spiritual successor. I finally managed to get some NDS time and finish this game last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FFC: RoF follows the story of the twins Yuri and Chelinka who live a simple life with their father in an isolated cabin. Things are not as they seem however and of course eventually the twins&amp;rsquo; world is turned upside-down and they find themselves having to find dangerous beasts and cast powerful magicks. It&amp;rsquo;s the usual RPG fare, albeit a bit too kiddified at some points. And as you would expect from a Square Enix title, we get an ending that&amp;rsquo;s literally out of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s got the usual action RPG trappings: swinging your sword, jumping around, puzzles that involve really big switches, etc. Gameplay-wise it&amp;rsquo;s pretty decent, with each of the four main characters providing different styles of play (although Yuri is definitely the strongest one&amp;hellip; or that just might be because I always gave him the best stuff). The difficulty level is not that high, though some people may find the platforming bits off-putting. Boss battles are the usual fare &amp;ndash; figure out the enemy&amp;rsquo;s attack patterns and how to beat them, etc. The game does a good job of curving you up to make sure you know how to use the various gameplay mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first complaint is about a particular &amp;ldquo;gate&amp;rdquo; in the final dungeon. Games like RPGs are sometimes referred to as &amp;ldquo;gate-driven&amp;rdquo;, because the player is presented with a sequence of &amp;ldquo;gates&amp;rdquo; or challenges he has to pass in order to complete the game. The &amp;ldquo;gate&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m talking about in the final dungeon is a switch. The switch is visible in plain sight, but when I got there I had no idea how to turn it on. The usual action of just stepping on it didn&amp;rsquo;t work, I tried throwing various stuff or casting spells on it, but no such luck. I actually set aside the game for a few days because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out that switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually needed It turns out I need to perform a particulat air-based attack to hit the switch from a jump. Normally this would be fine, except that the game has never required me to use that particular move anywhere else! It was taught in a short tutorial near the start of the game, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never used it after that so I even forgot it existed. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit disappointing because elsewhere the game does a great job of &amp;ldquo;teaching&amp;rdquo; you how to use the various actions as required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second gripe is a bit related: there are some platforms that require a particular camera angle in order for you to see how to proceed, and it&amp;rsquo;s not always clear how to get there. You end up walking to different positions to try and figure out how to get past the &amp;ldquo;gate&amp;rdquo;. In general in RPG design I think that whenever the player is forced to figure something out by trial and error it&amp;rsquo;s kind of lame and bad design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These problems are mostly confined to the last dungeon of the game though, most of the time I just breezed through. The story mode will take about ten hours to complete, assuming decent platforming skills. THis may seem a bit short to the average RPG player who grew up with Final Fantasy VII, but it&amp;rsquo;s actually a nice bite-sized helping for guys like me who don&amp;rsquo;t have much time to dedicate to gaming and want to get on to the next game as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give FFCC:RoF 3.5 out of 5 stars, decent enough. What? I don&amp;rsquo;t give ratings here? Right.&lt;/p&gt;
