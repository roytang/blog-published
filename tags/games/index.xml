            &lt;p&gt;Dan Fornace, creator of Rivals of Aether &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/danfornace/status/1405406456455733252&#34;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 8 years of working in fighting games, I’ve accepted the fact that no matter how “easy” you make your game, pros will absolutely demolish new players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well-known fighting game Youtuber Maximillian talks about the casual appeal of &lt;strong&gt;Guilty Gear -STRIVE-&lt;/strong&gt; and expands a bit on the above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/G3ChLCW95Mo&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there is definitely a serious learning curve when it comes to fighting games. They&amp;rsquo;re typically difficult for the uncommitted casual gamer to get into. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of stuff that needs to be learned: inputs, commands, matchups, systems, etc. I mean, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing FGs since Street Fighter II came out and I&amp;rsquo;m still pretty bad at them competitively, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I can crush most casuals who pick up a fighting game for the first time simply because I understand the lingua franca a bit - I know how throws work, what overheads and antiairs are etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a casual picking up a fighting game for the first time, all this stuff can get confusing. The simple matter of blocking attacks can be daunting: some attacks need to be blocked high, some blocked low, and how do you know which is which? You don&amp;rsquo;t, you kind of have to learn them along the way, so getting over the learning curve requires getting beat up a lot. There are some visual cues - sweeps look like sweeps so that&amp;rsquo;s easy to figure out, but not all of them do, and definitely not all overheads look like overheads (GGS has a universal overhead via standing dust, but most of the ones I&amp;rsquo;ve seen don&amp;rsquo;t look like overheads at all.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you air block? Maybe, depends on the game. You can dash, unless you&amp;rsquo;re this character. I can just block all the attacks right? No, there&amp;rsquo;s throws and command grabs and unblockables, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all fighting games play the same even. Like, I play mainly motion input games like Street Fighter and Guilty Gear, but whenever I try a game like &lt;strong&gt;Tekken&lt;/strong&gt;, everything feels and plays differently and matches just flow differently so I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s always a whole lot to learn, and the best games have a lot of characters which increases the learning curve significantly. It&amp;rsquo;s like playing an RPG with a lot of character classes and enemies to study, but instead of getting all the abilities one at a time and encountering each enemy according to a difficulty track, everything is available all at once so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed. And all the battles are in real-time and you have to make split-second decisions and react quickly and sometimes you blink and you&amp;rsquo;ve already taken a 100% death combo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I think the items Max enumerated above would be helpful for casual adoption (which is necessary to birth more genre fans) - specifically making it easier to do cool, flashy stuff, and good matchmaking and netcode go a long way towards building an audience. GGS is certainly an example of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually try to review games when I&amp;rsquo;ve finished them, but that&amp;rsquo;s not really a thing with fighting games so I might as well use this space to write a quick review of &lt;strong&gt;Guilty Gear -STRIVE-&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been looking for a replacement for &lt;strong&gt;Street Fighter V&lt;/strong&gt; which I&amp;rsquo;d been playing for a while but never really got very good at, languishing in the bronze ranks for most of its run. It had also gotten more and more difficult to even find matches, and I don&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy doing training/labwork to get better, so that was unacceptable. I happily purchased GGS on Steam when it was released June 11. (I think it&amp;rsquo;s actually been a while since I purchased a game full price on Steam at launch!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strive looks great, everything looks cool and flashy as mentioned above, which is amazing given my PC is 6 years old and I&amp;rsquo;m running on an RX570. It&amp;rsquo;s also easy to get into, and a lot of that is because of the the fantastic &amp;ldquo;tutorial&amp;rdquo; via the Missions Mode, which walks you through simple to advanced concepts so you can learn all the basics and the systems of the game. A friend rightly points out that it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell you when to use most of these tactics in a match, but it&amp;rsquo;s actually still a great improvement compared to other fighting games out there in terms of making it easier for new users to learn the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said (and despite Max claiming in the video above that Strive has been toned down to appeal to casuals), this is still a very complicated game, especially compared to something like Street Fighter V. Typical for the franchise, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of movement options and systems to consider: dashes, back dashes, air dashes, jump cancels, high jumps, double jumps, recovery options, launchers, tension gauge, burst gauge, RISC, positive bonus, Roman cancel (FOUR DIFFERENT KINDS!!) and so on and so forth. I am not sure I would recommend it to casuals though it is VERY flashy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does look like there has been some simplification / standardization in terms of character movesets. Most characters now have a HCB-&amp;gt;F+HS super, the dust button acts a standard button for throw, sweep, overhead and launcher attacks, etc. Combo damage is stronger, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to be able to do super long combo strings to be able to do significant damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I was disappointed with is that the game doesn&amp;rsquo;t have Instant Kills, which have been a staple of the series since the first game. They&amp;rsquo;re not very useful competitively, but when playing casually with friends on a single monitor it&amp;rsquo;s always been fun to try to pull them off (especially when you&amp;rsquo;re losing!) I hope they get added back at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still not particularly good at the game. In the video above, Max says everyone on ranked floor 5 and below is a casual, and I seem to be waffling between floors 5 and 6 constantly, so I&amp;rsquo;d say I&amp;rsquo;m mostly a casual who sometimes glimpses something more lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importang thing of course is that I am having a bunch of fun. It&amp;rsquo;s quite easy to find matches, and the netcode is pretty good. I live in a third-world country still and even with fiber broadband online gaming can get spotty, but my network experience has been relatively good. I&amp;rsquo;ve only been playing Ky and Potemkin online, so I still have a bunch of characters to study and learn and such, but I expect to be playing this game for a good long time to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here&amp;rsquo;s a video of me being Ky:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

            <title>Digital Boardgames Review: Root

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do reviews of them. This is my fourth such review, and this time I&amp;rsquo;m gonna talk about &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/965580/Root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt;. This is a IRL boardgame by Leder Games with the Steam version published by Dire Wolf Digital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Root is a competitive game themed about multiple factions vying for supremacy in a forest area. Each faction vies for control of clearings, draws cards that provide special abilities or items, and generally tries to stop the others from winning the game, which is done via points. The base game has four different factions to choose from (with the Vagabond faction having three different variants) and each faction plays very differently and scores points differently. So there is a bit of a learning curve to familiarize yourself with all the different factions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cats (Marquis) faction are the like the dominant empire in the area, and they gain points primarily by establishing more buildings, but among the factions they get the fewest actions per turn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The birds (Eyrie) represent an old empire trying to make a comeback; they score points primarily by establishing roosts but they follow a strict set of decrees that govern what they must do each turn. If they fail to obey the decrees, their government goes into turmoil, loses some points and has to start over with a new leader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Woodland Alliance represent plucky rebels aiming to establish their own government. They earn points by spreading sympathizers across the map. Whenever other factions attack them or move troops through sympathizer clearings, they earn more supporters, which can be used to establish bases (which let you recruit warriors) and gain even more supporters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the Vagabond is a freelance adventurer, wandering around the land digging up treasure for ruins and trading for items. He gets stronger the more items he has, can score points by crafting new items, completing quests, or fighting other factions. He can lend his support or even ally with one of the factions for a coalition victory. The Vagabond has several variants that start with different item sets and each have a unique special action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recently released (on Steam anyway) Riverfolk expansion adds two more factions and three more Vagabond variants to the game, adding replay value and more variation to an already very varied game. Each game lasts around an hour or so, which is totally reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Root is without question the one my regular gaming group has spent the most time playing among the digital boardgames. Not only because it&amp;rsquo;s fun (and we love interfering with whatever the others are planning), but it mostly because it has a feature none of the other games we&amp;rsquo;ve tried have: asynchronous multiplayer games. That means we can start a game and take our turns even while the others are offline, and people can just come and take their turn as they please (within the limit of minimum one turn every three days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means at the end of our weekly gaming sessions, no matter what we&amp;rsquo;ve played, we usually end with starting a new Root game, that we play throughout the following week. Sometimes we can get two or three games done during the duration of the week, finishing the last game when we start our next weekly gaming session. We&amp;rsquo;ve been playing the game almost continuously since the Steam release in September 2020 and the physical boardgame has at least two other expansions lined up that aren&amp;rsquo;t on Steam yet, so it&amp;rsquo;s very likely that we&amp;rsquo;ll continue to play it for many more months and perhaps years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do reviews of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s review is for &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1015930/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage: Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;. This is a Norse mythology themed game based on a IRL boardgame. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those &amp;ldquo;place your guys on the map&amp;rdquo; boardgame where each player vies for control of provinces. The game is divided into three ages, and at the end of each age one of the provinces is destroyed as part of ragnarok. The players place units in each of the provinces, which have limited slots for units. During your turn you can choose to pillage a province, and other players can fight you for it if they have units there as well or can send units from adjacent provinces. A successfully pillage earns you a stat boost, and successfully defeating other players earns you glory, which is used to score for victory at the end of the game. The age ends when all the provinces have been pillaged or all the players no longer have any possible actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of each age the players draft 6 cards that will be available for them to use during the age. These include battle cards (which give you bonuses or abilities when fighting to pillage territories), upgrade cards (which give you either new abilities or new units or monsters to summon, each with special powers), or quests (which give you glory and stat bonuses at the end of the age if you fulfill their conditions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle and upgrade cards are mostly themed around the Norse Gods - Odin, Thor, Loki, Frigga, and Tyr. Each god has a different set of effects, and some can change your strategy so that you can win without having to actually win battles. For example, Tyr&amp;rsquo;s battle cards are all about giving you bonuses to combat, but Loki&amp;rsquo;s cards are all about earning you benefits when you lose combats. In many of our games, one of the player ends up being the &amp;ldquo;Loki player&amp;rdquo; who just joins every battle he can trying to gain those Loki bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battles are encouraged though; many of the upgrades and quests reward you with more glory for fighting and dying in battle, and having your units destroyed in ragnarok gives glory bonuses as well. At the start of each age, all previously destroyed units are again available for placement, so constantly getting into fights and getting sent to Valhalla can be a strategy as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve also gotten and played two of the expansions DLCs: &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1354120/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition__Mystics_of_Midgard/&#34;&gt;Mystics of Midgard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366580/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition__Gods_of_Asgard/&#34;&gt;Gods of Asgard&lt;/a&gt; (recently released). Mystics add a new unit type that can be drafted, including an annoying unit that can&amp;rsquo;t be killed as long as it has a province to retreat to after battle. The mystics usually end of being high draft picks. Gods of Asgard adds two randomly chosen Norse God figures to the board (among the 5 mentioned above), each one applies special properties to the province where they&amp;rsquo;re in, and they move do a different province after every pillage attempt. For example, Tyr makes it so that battles in the province only count battle cards and not the strength of the involved units; while Frigga makes it so that units in the province cannot die in battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was a bit buggy when we first got it in mid 2020, since it was just released, but it has steadily improved since then. We played it again recently after some time away and noted many improvements to the UI and quality of life changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is fun; we&amp;rsquo;ve played a reasonable amount of it (I&amp;rsquo;m at around 47 hours as of this writing.) It&amp;rsquo;s the kind of game where it&amp;rsquo;s easy and fun to mess around with what your opponents are doing, especially if you drafted some of the trickier cards. The only bad side would be that the games tend to go long, especially if someone drafted a good Loki deck or the Mystics are around or other such tricks. In our last session, we played 2 games for around 3 hours total.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Game Review: Knightin&#39;
</title>

            <pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2021 04:41:32 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;A while back, on a whim I purchased this indie game &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/922710/Knightin/&#34;&gt;Knightin&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; on Steam. I forget how I came across it and why I decided to buy, but no regrets. It&amp;rsquo;s a tightly-focused dungeon crawler in the style of original Legend of Zelda/Link to the Past dungeons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each dungeon is a set of rooms you clear one at a time, until you get  to the dungeon boss and beat him. Clearing rooms involves defeating  enemies, solving puzzles, avoiding obstacles and opening chests. It&amp;rsquo;s a  short game, there are only four dungeons to clear each slightly more difficult than the last. There is no plot at all. The game itself openly admits this by painting the thinnest of flavors. You play Sir Lootalot and you want to beat the evil dark lord at the end of the fourth dungeon. For treasure! No princess to save or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I say &amp;ldquo;tightly-focused&amp;rdquo;, I mean that the game is barebones and does only what it says, but it does it very well. I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of how well-designed it is. It&amp;rsquo;s entirely predictable, you know what you&amp;rsquo;re getting into, but each part is executed really well. Each dungeon consists of multiple floors. Each floor has exactly twelve rooms, arranged in the same 3x4 rectangle shape every time. There&amp;rsquo;s a minimap that never changes shape, but maps room paths as you go. The minimap has a nice notation that indicates things like stairs up, stairs down, a merchant, a warp point, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combat is simple and straightforward as well. You don&amp;rsquo;t get a plethora of weapons like Link does in the Zelda series. You start out with a sword (obviously) and later you get access to a wand that lets you shoot fireballs, and those are your only weapons ever. Later you also learn to dash (which hits enemies with the sword), fire dash (which leaves a trail of flames as you dash), and learn a spin attack (a la Link to the Past). You only ever have to remember four buttons: swing sword, shoot wand, dash, and raise shield (and I very rarely use the shield).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obstacles in your way include enemies of course, and the difficulty ramp is great here as well. You start out with enemies that just walk around randomly and they damage you if they bump you. As you progress you meet more complicated foes. Enemies with ranged attacks. Enemies that chase you. Enemies that can move faster. Enemies that can pop out from under your feet. Enemies that can reproduce. And so on. They are always introduced one new enemy at a time so you get to know their shtick before you meet them in more difficult rooms. Rooms can also have obstacles, such as blades that suddenly jut out of the ground, rotating saw blades, pillars that shoot projectiles, and so on, all adding to room difficulty. Some rooms will have a merchant who sells stuff (you get gold from enemy drops), or chests you can open. Everything is pre-placed, no procedural generation here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some puzzle rooms, which come in two types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;switch rooms, where you need to figure out which switches to turn on to access a chest or unlock a path. These are handled well enough. Although there&amp;rsquo;s no dialog anywhere, hints for the correct switch positions are scattered visually throughout the same floor of the dungeon where they are found. When you encounter a switch room, it&amp;rsquo;s usually just a matter of going back to previous rooms to see what the hints mean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;block rooms, where you need to push blocks around (only push! no pull!) to get them into the correct positions. I enjoyed the block puzzles more. They are relatively well-designed, and some took me a bit more time than I expected (maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just dumb? Lol)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements&lt;/strong&gt;. Completion in this game is largely straightforward as well. Most of the achievements are geared towards acquiring all the upgrades, opening all chests, and beating all the dungeons. The only two I didn&amp;rsquo;t get (and probably won&amp;rsquo;t bother to) are for doing a speedrun under 90 minutes and for doing a no death run. I tried a couple of post-game runs, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure I can do both of those after some number of tries, but I think I&amp;rsquo;m way too lazy for that. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it installed and maybe someday I&amp;rsquo;ll get around to it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall&lt;/strong&gt;: A very tight, focused, well-designed and quick indie game experience (my total play time so far is less than 3 hours). It&amp;rsquo;s relatively cheap on Steam too. It&amp;rsquo;s not super groundbreaking or anything, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth it for a couple of hours of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Digital Boardgames Review: Scythe
</title>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do reviews of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second review is about &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/718560/Scythe_Digital_Edition/&#34;&gt;Scythe: Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;. Scythe is a competitive game where you play one of seven factions in an alternate history post-war Eastern Europe. Players vie to control territories, hire workers, build mechs, accumulate resources, accomplish secret objectives, and other such goals. Accomplishing secret objectives, winning combats or maximizing one of the several metrics (workers, money, popularity, military power, recruits, structures, mechs, etc) earns you stars, and the game ends when at least one player has six stars. Having six stars doesn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee victory, as points are then tallied up depending on various factors including stars, territories, money, popularity, and so on. Having separate victory and end conditions creates a bit of tension and a balancing act between progressing stars and earning points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players play as one of seven available factions, each with preset locations on the board. The board is preset and consists of hex tiles, each with different movement limitations and resources that can be produced. The board also has &amp;ldquo;encounters&amp;rdquo; on certain tiles, basically roleplaying opportunities where you get the choice of an action to take, typically trading one type of resource for another, usually a good deal, if you can pay the costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board is fixed, but each player is randomly assigned a mat that determines the actions available during their turn. The mat is split into top actions (produce, move, bolster, trade) each paired with one of the available bottom actions (upgrade, deploy mech, recruit, build structure). During your turn, you may play one top action followed by the corresponding bottom action, and you cannot do the same action pair on successive turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weird action structure makes the game challenging. Typically, the top actions generate resources, while the bottom actions consume them to advance your goals. If you get a mat with pairings that are poor for your particular situation, it may take a while for you to get into a regular rhythm of production to actually get anything done. Other players can also interfere with you by sending their character and/or mechs to attack or harass your territory or workers. I usually find that I need to plan ahead 2-3 turns to accomplish a simple goal like building a mech. Beyond the 3-turn window, who knows what the board looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combat is kind of straightforward - you can attack a hex with one or two combat units, and up to two combat units will defend it. Each side can spend up to 7 military power, plus play one combat card per unit on their side, each card adds 2-5 to your total. The attacker wins all ties, favoring aggressors. Due to the way military power and combat cards are accumulated, it&amp;rsquo;s risky to initiate combat unless you have at least 14 military power (this ensures you have a fighting chance against a counterattack). Furthermore, each faction can only gain up to 2 stars from winning combats, so you want to make them count. In our games, we find that typically the winning faction will use two combats to try to earn 2 stars in one turn and end the game, and often those will be the only combats that happen in the entire game. Not sure if we are playing this optimally!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games tend to go at least an hour long, roughly 20 or so turns in our experience. Because of the game&amp;rsquo;s pacing and action structure, you can have games where it feels like I haven&amp;rsquo;t accomplished much by then. Usually this creates a bit of snowball effect as well - the player who gets his act together earlier will tend to pull ahead and be difficult to catch up to. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComebackMechanic&#34;&gt;comeback mechanism&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;rsquo;re missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The display is literally just the actual board, and the camera can be a bit finicky sometimes. In my last game I accidentally rotated the view and took a minute to figure out how to get it back. The UI is also fairly sparse and a lot of information or options can be hidden in the weirdest places. Like, figuring out where your faction is allowed to cross rivers can be challenging for new players. I&amp;rsquo;ve attached some screenshots to this post, but they&amp;rsquo;re nothing special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably just relevant to my playgroup, but because of the slow pace, we tend to play a second metagame on top of the endgame scoring, where we consider the player who has spent the least amount of time on his turns (as seen via the turn clock) as &amp;ldquo;winning by time&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the digital board games we&amp;rsquo;ve played, this is the one where we have the least amount of playtime. Unsurprising given how slow the pace is and how difficult it is. For this reason, I think it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to recommend to any boardgame newbies.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Digital Boardgames Review: Sentinels of the Multiverse

            &lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been regularly playing digital boardgames online on Steam with one of my friend groups, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do reviews of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/337150/Sentinels_of_the_Multiverse/&#34;&gt;Sentinels of the Multiverse&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ve played the IRL boardgame of it before during one of our sporadic in-person meetups. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, it&amp;rsquo;s a comics-themed coop game where up to 4 people play as a group of heroes to beat a villain (basically comic book shenanigans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a large variety of heroes available to play, each with unique abilities and play styles. Some of them are straightforward and some are super complicated and fiddly to play. The villains you have to beat vary from super simple to really difficult, with advanced variants for even more challenge. The game also provides a &amp;ldquo;weekly one-shot&amp;rdquo; challenge which provides a fixed scenario/villain and set of heroes to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve played a lot of games of Sentinels, and probably only won something like 60-70% of them. Each game takes around an hour or so, maybe more if it was super difficult. Usually we lose when we choose some combination of random heroes just to try them out then get beaten terribly by the villain. Then we go on a revenge run using one of the simpler heroes like Legacy or Tachyon (or we just put in a healer like Dr Medico).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digital version has the advantage that it automates a lot of the ability triggers and checks that the boardgame requires, which would usually be a lot of work. On the other hand, it has a UX disadvantage for those scenarios where an ability triggers multiple times and you want to make the same decision every time. In the real board game, you can just handwave it off by saying &amp;ldquo;Ok, we choose X is every time&amp;rdquo;, but in the digital version you have to click through every confirmation dialog every time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game&amp;rsquo;s aesthetic is very much classic comic books, even multiplayer games are joined by entering a code in the format of a comic book issue like &amp;ldquo;Justice Comics #153&amp;rdquo;. The art isn&amp;rsquo;t the most elaborate and could be better; in fact, they are planning a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/27/22250963/sentinels-of-the-multiverse-definitive-kickstarter-street-date-price&#34;&gt;Definitive Edition of the boardgame&lt;/a&gt; that has even better art that is closer to the old-school comic book aesthetic. It looks like a signficant upgrade, so I expect if they ever release a digital version of the new version it would be a completely new game on Steam. Our group has enjoyed our Sentinels games though, so I fully expect we will be getting the new Steam version when it does come out.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Finally finished #FireEmblem #ThreeHouses, or one run at least! Doing the other two might take a while!   #NintendoSwitch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, I could have gotten a much better screenshot from the ending I suppose, but I&amp;rsquo;m too lazy to go back and get one lol&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Time passes yet again. I think I have to get used to not having much personal stuff to report in the weeknotes on certain weeks (aside from the watching/gaming parts), especially given the pandemic where I&amp;rsquo;m at home 90% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the pandemic, the UK started vaccinations last week, and the US FDA approved the Pfizer vaccine as well, so hopefully this is where things start to turn around. Sadly, it may be a while before vaccinations get widespread, especially here in the Philippines. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping things clear up by mid next year for us here, but I&amp;rsquo;m not optimistic about it. It would be really sad if the pandemic restrictions reach next year&amp;rsquo;s holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that people here seem to realize there&amp;rsquo;s still a pandemic going on, if pictures coming out of Divisoria are any indication. I get that not everyone has access to online shopping, but are there no other options for holiday gift shopping than walking through such dense crowds? This may be one instance where our generous gift-giving culture is bad for us, since people are still out trying to buy gifts when the pandemic is a perfectly good excuse for scaling back on the shopping. Capitalism ho!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The saddest part of this pandemic for me has that my brothers and their families can&amp;rsquo;t come over to visit, which means my parents don&amp;rsquo;t get to see their grandkids (and I don&amp;rsquo;t get to see the pamangkins). Sometimes we push back a bit on that envelope, but it&amp;rsquo;ll be a while before we all really get to see each other and enjoy company in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I managed to finish &lt;strong&gt;Batman: Arkham Origins&lt;/strong&gt;! The main story at least. Achievement completion seems unlikely, given the multiplayer achievements, and even some of the single-player ones seem a bit too challenging. I was able to enjoy the game despite the graphical issues I encountered early on. Lowering the settings helped a lot I think, though things still weren&amp;rsquo;t 100% good. I really take to these style of games where there&amp;rsquo;s an open world and you have a lot of things to collect and such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ordered &lt;strong&gt;Fire Emblem Three Houses&lt;/strong&gt; for the Switch yesterday! I was also considering Paper Mario Origami King, but that had some mixed reviews, so holding off for now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently doing a binge re-watch of The Big Bang Theory as my background watching, I&amp;rsquo;m up to season 7 at the moment. I think the show holds up better than some of its contemporaries such as How I Met Your Mother. I know the geek portrayals can be a bit exaggerated or patronizing, so a lot of geeks don&amp;rsquo;t like it, but for me it&amp;rsquo;s fine. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of doing a bad comic book movie marathon sometime this month, covering the ones I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother watching, stuff like Ben Affleck Daredevil, Michael B Jordan Fantastic Four, and the recently released New Mutants. We&amp;rsquo;ll see if I get around to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just under two weeks until Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Game Review: Super Mario Odyssey
</title>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;After playing through &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/mario-3d-all-stars/&#34;&gt;Super Mario 3D All Stars in October&lt;/a&gt;, I borrowed a copy of Super Mario Odyssey for the Nintendo Switch from my brother and played through it for most of November. Odyssey was the main reason I actually got a Switch; I played through a few worlds at a friends house during a single session and loved it, so I had been meaning to get the console just for Odyssey alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game deviates a bit from the formula established by Mario 64, Sunshine and Galaxy; Instead of a single hub that leads to small mission worlds, there are a number of different kingdoms, each of which have different residents. The plot is standard Mario fare; Bowser kidnaps Peach because he wants to marry her against her will (and apparently there&amp;rsquo;s nothing she can do about it?! You can say no girl!) You visit each kingdom in turn as you chase Bowser across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each kingdom is a self-contained &amp;ldquo;open world&amp;rdquo; where there are many challenges you can complete to advance the story. Completing challenges earns you Power Moons (the analogue to 64/Galaxy&amp;rsquo;s stars and Sunshine&amp;rsquo;s shines) which ostensibly power your ship, the Odyssey. Examples of the Kingdoms are the Metro Kingdom featuring New Donk City, whose mayor is the girl you rescued from Donkey Kong so long ago; the Woodland Kingdom is populated by flower-growing robots; the residents of the Seaside Kingdom are slugs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually finished the main story after around a week of play. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly straightforward, not especially challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;7ba08eb041f1571ff133f4ee17ae133b-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;

    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;2 Dec 2020 12:00am&#34;&gt;2 Dec 2020 12:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is however, a lot of post-game and completion stuff to do, that took me another couple of weeks and change. Odyssey&amp;rsquo;s completion revolves around collecting a rather large number of Power Moons. A good chunk of them are only available after beating the main story, though I did try to get as many as I could even before beating Bowser. And some worlds like Peach&amp;rsquo;s Mushroom Kingdom and the more challenging Dark Side/Darker Side of the Moon are available only in the post-game.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite parts of the game are these segments where Mario becomes a 2D Mario and you have to play 2d Mario stages in 8-bit style, they appear in the open world as murals, often hidden, and they&amp;rsquo;re really nice throwbacks. They even made 8-bit versions of each Mario costume!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completion is a real challenge. There are much more difficult platforming challenges involved, and some moons like the Koopa racing ones will require you to master advanced moves and jumps to beat them. There&amp;rsquo;s also a whole lot of minigames to complete, moons hidden using art-based clues, and a whole lot of collectibles (including hats and costumes for Mario) that you can purchase from stores using coins and regional currency that you collect. I played most of the game in handheld mode, but there are some moons that are easier to get using motion controls, which requires you detach the joycons, so that&amp;rsquo;s something I sometimes had to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The 7 I missed were 5 for minigames (100 jumps in jump rope, 100 volleys in beach volleyball, and 3 bound bowl races) and 2 stage moons (for Breakdown Road in Dark Side). While none of these seem impossible to do, they all seem like they require much more patience than I am willing to give, so I&amp;rsquo;m satisfied with this completion rate for now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only complaint is that at some point I found going for completion to be super tedious, especially with those last few moons. 880 moons is a ridiculous number, compare that to a paltry 240 stars in Galaxy. This might be a case of there just being too much stuff? I realize this is a weird thing to complain about. Overall it&amp;rsquo;s still a fun and engaging game, though I&amp;rsquo;m waffling over whether this one or Galaxy is the better game. (I probably still like Super Mario 3D World over either though!)&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Game Review: Super Mario 3d All-stars
</title>
            <link>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/mario-3d-all-stars/</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2020 06:03:35 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/mario-3d-all-stars/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;So I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/09/nintendo-switch/&#34;&gt;got a Nintendo Switch last month&lt;/a&gt;. One of the first games I had gotten for the system was the recently released Super Mario 3d All-Stars. I had really been wanting to play Super Mario Odyssey instead, but my brother had a copy of that game that I could borrow later, so I decided to get 3dAS first, as I had never really played the 3 games on the collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly played the 2d Mario games prior to this, with the exception of 3d Land (3DS) and 3d World (WiiU), although both of those games were closer in style to the the 2d mario games than to the games in this collection. The three games here share the same style of having a hub-like world from which you visit other worlds to accomplish missions to get stars/shines. The other worlds have multiple &amp;ldquo;episodes&amp;rdquo; so you have to replay each of them a bunch of times (doing different things each time) to get all the stars/shines available in those worlds. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of a clever world to save on level design resources - each world is essentially multiple stages sharing the same maps and objects and so on. It can also mean the player might get tired of repeating the same worlds over and over, but the hub system means they can visit other worlds for a while if that happens. As you gather stars/shines, you unlock more areas of the hub world and thus more worlds/stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t optimistic about SM64 going in. I played a little bit of it on the DS when it was released there, didn&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy it. Released in 1996, I know it&amp;rsquo;s regarded as a classic and revolutionized 3d platforming in its day, but for me it hasn&amp;rsquo;t really aged very well. My problems with the title are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor camera handling. You don&amp;rsquo;t have smooth right-stick control of the camera (since the N64 did not have a right analog stick), and the camera angles are often limited in how you can rotate them around. There&amp;rsquo;s a button to toggle the camera from Lakitu perspective to Mario perspective, which is annoying for me since I don&amp;rsquo;t find the over-the-shoulder Mario perspective useful, and I accidentally keep hitting the toggle button. There is a setting to disable the Mario perspective altogether (such that the toggle button now fixes the camera to a given position instead), but the setting resets every time you load your game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even when the camera is in Lakitu mode, it will often turn or rotate far too quickly for my taste, and for me this means if I play the game for around an hour or so I start getting dizzy, and this is the main dealbreaker for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find it quite difficult to control Mario in this game as well. His normal movement is to run, not to walk, so a simple flick of the left analog stick moves him farther than I&amp;rsquo;d like, and the same goes for his jumps. I think it&amp;rsquo;s because this was their first 3d game, so they hadn&amp;rsquo;t really calibrated yet what would be a good walk/run speed and jump distance. Adding to that, some actions like turning Mario in a new direction combined with jumping can cause him to jump in a different direction/distance, it&amp;rsquo;s something to get used to. You don&amp;rsquo;t have much jump control once you are in mid-air either. So for difficult platforming segments, I often found it challenging to position Mario for precise jumps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of the worlds/stages are also quite frustrating. You will be dying quite often. This is unsurprising for a Mario game, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that many of the sequences are a bit long so it can be annoying to re-do them. Combined with the finnicky controls and the often weird camera angles, it can cause unnecessary frustration. Even worse, when you die, you are not just kicked back to the start of the stage, but most of the time you are kicked out of the stage altogether and back to the hub world. A minor inconvenience, but it still means additional friction in the try-fail-retry cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of try-fail-retry, a lot of the missions really require you to spend multiple lives dying and trying again. This isn&amp;rsquo;t unexpected, but a lot of them can be extremely challenging. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking in particular of that one mission where you have to race a penguin down a twisty icy slope, where veering off the slope means death. Trying to get to the end of the icy slope is bad enough - it&amp;rsquo;s going to take you a lot of trial and error to do so - but then you have to make sure you get there ahead of the penguin too. I feel like a lot of the more challenging missions carry over some of the &amp;ldquo;Nintendo hard&amp;rdquo; mentality from the NES/SNES generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t managed to even finish SM64 yet, so I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are a lot more challenging stages ahead. As of this writing, my progress stands at a pitiful 17 stars obtained (out of a possible 120). The dizziness due to the camera is the main problem for me. I may try to come back to it later, but for now there are better games to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario Sunshine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released in 2002 for the GameCube, Sunshine is the mainline Mario I&amp;rsquo;ve never even tried before. I later found out that Sunshine is considered one of the most difficult 3d Mario games to date. I will tend to disagree; I think the average SM64 stage is more difficult than Super Mario Sunshine, given that I was actually able to beat Sunshine. I will concede that 120-shine completion is probably very difficult for Sunshine though, but more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunshine provides some improvements over SM64:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most significant upgrade is graphically. It&amp;rsquo;s a huge jump over SM64&amp;rsquo;s blocky polygons, and Mario&amp;rsquo;s appearance here is already pretty close to his latest modern appearances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still find walk/run controls a bit slippery, but there is significant improvement in jump control since this game gives you FLUDD (the water jetstream firing thing), which has hover functionality making it easier to make difficult jumps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsurprisingly, the most challenging parts of the game are the &amp;ldquo;secret&amp;rdquo; platforming stages where Mario is denied the use of FLUDD. These secrets usually have to be accessed at a certain point in the composite worlds. Although these secret stages are difficult, the blow is kind of softened by two things: if you die, you are returned to the start of the secret stage (instead of kicked out to the containing/hub world); and most of the stages will have one or more 1-ups available, with one easily available near the start of the stage. You&amp;rsquo;re still going to need to grind a lot to finish these secret stages, but at least you&amp;rsquo;re not likely to run out of lives doing so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also most of the game&amp;rsquo;s worlds and settings are a lot more fun in terms of ambience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, I did manage &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1314224120490389504/&#34;&gt;to beat Super Mario Sunshine a couple of weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;. I finished with around 77 shines (out of a possible 120). I may eventually come back to it for completion, although that looks challenging. The main challenge would probably be completing the blue coins in each world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super Mario Galaxy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally released in 2007, Galaxy is easily the best game in this collection. I tried playing this back when I first got a WiiU (by borrowing the game and a couple of WiiMotes from a friend). At the time I wasn&amp;rsquo;t thrilled with the WiiMote control scheme, especially with having to use the WiiMote as an imprecise pointer, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t get far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m obviously much happier with the Switch version. In handheld mode, you use touch controls on the screen to do the pointer stuff (like to collect star bits), which is much easier and more precise than using the WiiMote (or pointing the joycon in TV mode), so that&amp;rsquo;s my preferred mode of playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some stages that require motion controls, where I find I need to switch to TV control. Examples are the ones where you have to control a Mario riding a rolling ball, or Mario riding a manta ray surfing along a water track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game itself is very beautiful and significantly easier (or at least, less frustrating) than the first two games. You don&amp;rsquo;t have FLUDD this time, but Mario gets a spin jump that gives him additional jump control. And longer stages now have checkpoints in between so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to start over from the beginning if you die. Many of the stages are fun to play and do a lot of innovative things like playing around with gravity and such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still some challenging stages. Two of them specifically come to mind: The first one is Galaxy&amp;rsquo;s Greatest Wave, which is one of the aforementioned ray-surfing stages. The race course is very twisty and challening, and if you take each turn too fast or don&amp;rsquo;t turn just the right amount, you&amp;rsquo;re going to be falling off. There are a number of 1-ups along the course, and I managed to get to 99 lives in trying to finish the course. My personal estimate is that I probably re-did the course at least a hundred times. The second one that comes to mind is Luigi&amp;rsquo;s Purple Coins, a stage only available after beating the game the first time. It&amp;rsquo;s a stage where you have to be constantly jumping across disappearing platforms while collecting purple coins all within a time limit. It took me a lot less tries than the ray-surfing one, but each try was exhausting since you&amp;rsquo;re jumping all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I wish they would have done for this port was add more button support for the menus, instead of having to use tap/motion control for many of them (such as when retrying a level).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1317023064555548672/&#34;&gt;finished Galaxy for the first time&lt;/a&gt; last week, and completed the bonus Purple coin missions a few days later. That makes it the first game of this trilogy where &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1318238520251621377/&#34;&gt;I hit the goal of 120 stars&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the first two games though, Galaxy has an additional &amp;ldquo;second quest&amp;rdquo;, an additional 120 stars to be earned while playing as Luigi. Again, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably come back to this at another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Switch is a great console for these games, since I can easily pick it up at any time and play a couple of stages in handheld mode. I was worried whether this purchase would be worth it, since to be honest I&amp;rsquo;m getting a bit old and am not as good as the platforming stuff as I used to be. Platforming in 3d only adds an additional level of difficulty for me personally. But overall, it was a good purchase. I somehow managed to beat two of the games, and it was nice to see how the 3d Mario games evolve through the years. It&amp;rsquo;s too bad they didn&amp;rsquo;t include Galaxy 2, which by all accounts is as good as Galaxy was. My fingers and wrists are tired from all the jumping though, so maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll put down the Switch for a few days before I get started with Odyssey.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Late Game Review: Uncharted 4: A Thief&#39;s End

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I finished Uncharted 4: A Thief&amp;rsquo;s End yesterday, and I felt like making a post about it, since I had a bunch of screenshots. Late game review because the game came out in 2016. I think I got it from PS+? Certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first played the original Uncharted trilogy back in 2010-2011, but I found out just now while writing this post that I never finished Uncharted 3 (started yes, apparently), so that explains why some story elements seemed unfamiliar in the 4th game. (I think I may have also gotten the trilogy remaster via PS+, so maybe I should play the 3rd game too? Maybe.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually have to thank the Uncharted series for getting my into this kind of single player adventure game in the first place. After Uncharted, I played some kinda similar games like Infamous, Tomb Raider etc, I was never that into the genre before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main complaint with the series is the sheer suspension of disbelief it requires to imagine a person like Nathan Drake could exist: basically a human at peak physical ability, able to fearlessly leap off high cliffs and cling onto walls with unbelievable grip and upper body strength, barely ever getting tired, while at the same time good enough at gunplay to go up against armies of battle-hardened mercenaries and come out on top. Oh, and he has an intimate knowledge of archaeology and is also able to find ancient lost treasures and cities all the time apparently. And also he&amp;rsquo;s pretty good at sketching. It&amp;rsquo;s fine, after all what are video games but power fantasies right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncharted 4 gives us a deeper look at Nathan Drake&amp;rsquo;s background and how he grew up to be like this, and we find out that not only is he this human at the peak of physical ability, he also has a brother who, despite 15 years rotting away in some backwater prison, is also at peak physical ability and also has all the rest of Nathan&amp;rsquo;s abilities (except the sketching though). (Cue Star Wars prequel meme &amp;ldquo;This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from that minor complaint, the games are pretty great though. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, the games are highly linear and story-driven, consisting of set pieces and sequences that are either platforming/exploratory (figure out how to get from point A to point B) or combat/stealth vs the aforementioned armies of battle-hardened mercenaries. Oh, and there&amp;rsquo;s the occasional puzzle too. Uncharted 4 adds some new elements such as letting you drive a car (4 wheel drive) around in what seems like an open world (it really isn&amp;rsquo;t), but it&amp;rsquo;s still mostly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a big action game player, so I dislike the combat parts and I die a lot there. You can see in one of the screenshots later that my shooting accuracy rate was like 49%. For this reason, I&amp;rsquo;m not inclined to go for achievement completion on this one (or any of the Uncharted games for that matter), since there are many combat-related and difficulty-related trophies, and even one that requires me to finish the game with like a 70% accuracy rate. Good luck with that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dying a lot isn&amp;rsquo;t a problem, as the game is very forgiving. There are a generous number of checkpoints, and there&amp;rsquo;s really no penalty for dying too much. (Again, you can see in the stats screenshot that I failed checkpoints 105 times.) It&amp;rsquo;s kind of unavoidable with on-rails games like these - there are plenty of spots where if you don&amp;rsquo;t climb or run or jump in just the exact way the game wants, you&amp;rsquo;ll die and fail the checkpoint. It&amp;rsquo;s not super frustrating since you never really have to repeat too much, but it&amp;rsquo;s that kind of game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I guess Nathan Drake is famous now, because people know about his discoveries from the first 3 games, but I feel like he should be richer than he is portrayed. Not that he&amp;rsquo;s poor, but surely he got away with a few valuable trinkets here and there during his adventures right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Story-wise it feels like they planned this to be Nathan Drake&amp;rsquo;s final run, given the epilogue, but who knows? I mean in their universe, Sully is pretty old but he still also does ridiculous stunts with the rest of the gang. And they did introduce some new characters, so it&amp;rsquo;s not far-fetched there&amp;rsquo;ll be another Uncharted game later on, possibly with someone else as the lead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, game is pretty good, play it if you can, happy to have ticked it off the backlog! Have some screenshots:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Finally finished Divinity Original Sin 2. Not sure if I should do a review since due to character choices and party comp, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve only scratched the surface of the content, and it might take a couple more runs to alleviate that. But it&amp;rsquo;s a great turn-based RPG!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Just in time for #JRPGJuly, I finally managed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/1285149646650671105/&#34;&gt;complete my platinum run for Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/a&gt;!

            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;h3 id=&#34;spoiler-free-review&#34;&gt;Spoiler-free review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is a fantastic retelling of the original FF7&amp;rsquo;s Midgar section. The plot largely tracks the original, except greatly expounded. More plot details are added to expound on character details and backstories, especially for supporting characters like Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie, and even for Shinra corporation itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game isn&amp;rsquo;t open world like FFXV kind of was; that would have been difficult given the plot they were trying to adapt, but it&amp;rsquo;s not entirely linear either. The story is divided into 18 chapters, and some of them are entirely linear, while some provide an open area littered with sidequests that you can optionally do before advancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t much else to say story-wise without being spoiler-y, especially if you&amp;rsquo;ve played the original. If you&amp;rsquo;re new, then I can say you are in for a treat; the storyline is certainly better and less confusing than, say, FFXIII.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the original, the game is peppered with mini-games that you can indulge in and are sure to annoy completionists like me (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combat system is something like FFXV&amp;rsquo;s real-time combat (with you controlling a single character and the others controlled by AI) mixed with some elements from FFXIII, namely the use of the Active Time Bar in order to spells or items or other special moves, and the additional stagger element around which most of the more difficult fights revolve. Unlike FFXV where you&amp;rsquo;re always controlling Noctis, you can switch controlled characters freely, or you can also issue ATB commands to the AI without shifting control. It all works very fluidly, a fun and satisfying evolution to the real-time version of the FF battle system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My one complaint would be the game limiting you to three playable characters at once, even though there are points where four are available. It&amp;rsquo;s not like their graphics engine can&amp;rsquo;t handle four player character models at once (see: FFXV), maybe it was an issue of balancing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The materia system is back! It was one of my favorite FF equipment systems, and I enjoyed it again this time around. This time however, the game is much more stingier with its special materia. For example, you can only ever get two copies of Elemental Materia (since having too many means you can abuse it against bosses), and only one copy of Magnify (equivalent to All in the original), which means only one character can use Curaga on everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normal difficulty is&amp;hellip; a bit easy. Most of the mob encounters are &amp;ldquo;mash attack, rinse and repeat&amp;rdquo;; most of the bosses are &amp;ldquo;mash attack, target weakness, repeat until staggered, use stronger attacks, repeat until victory&amp;rdquo;. Many of the bosses you can walk into the fight with your default materia settings and you&amp;rsquo;ll be fine. Maybe you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to exploit weaknesses, but the fight will still be manageable. Some of them are a bit more creative, requiring you to make use of space to avoid certain attacks and so on. Only a few boss fights were ever really troublesome. Beating the game once unlocks hard mode, more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beating the game also unlocks chapter select, which makes it easier for completionists, since you can just replay specific chapters if you missed something. There are also additional challenges only available in hard mode post-game. I believe this is the first instance of a &amp;ldquo;mainline&amp;rdquo; (such as it is) FF game providing post-game content and chapter select.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had gotten &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/ff7r/&#34;&gt;the Deluxe Edition&lt;/a&gt;, which was only delivered to me by May 1 due to quarantine shenanigans. The steelbook is gorgeous! A worthy addition to my Final Fantasy steelbook collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My completionist run took just under 90hrs, a bit above the median according to &lt;a href=&#34;https://howlongtobeat.com/game?id=57686&#34;&gt;HowLongToBeat.com&lt;/a&gt;. I started on Jun 8th, so it&amp;rsquo;s just about a month and a half too. (Average of an hour per day!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I enjoyed the game, enough to go for the platinum trophy, despite the annoying minigames. A worthwhile retelling and addition to the FF7 universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(End of spoiler-free section)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;image-gallery&#34;&gt;Image gallery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game looks great, especially when it shifts to cutscene models. Speaking of which, the cutscene transitions are also great, they&amp;rsquo;re hardly noticeable. And your hard mode run goes much faster since there&amp;rsquo;s an option to skip the cutscenes! As always, I took a lot of screenshots along the way! &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/ff7r/&#34;&gt;Image gallery is here&lt;/a&gt;, very spoilery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;expanded-plot-and-content&#34;&gt;Expanded plot and content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who played the original will no doubt remember the major plot points. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of new scenes and story bits that weren&amp;rsquo;t in the original. Some felt a bit filler-y, like the section where you have to figure out how to get to the reactor from the underplate, or the section where you have to make your way out of the sewer. They weren&amp;rsquo;t boring or anything like that, but it did feel they were there mostly to pad the time. I mean, Shinra is about to drop the plate, but first we have to deal with these ghosts?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of dropping the plate, the damage here felt a lot more memorable than in the original. In fact, I only remembered this happened in the OG by the time I got to that part of the story in the remake. The impact here is more severe because you spent a lot more time with the residents of the sector 7 slums, and with Wedge, Biggs, and Jessie. Their supposed deaths weighed more heavily upon me than in the OG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some plot points in this game that I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if they were in the original&amp;hellip; namely Shinra deliberately sabotaging the reactors and using Avalanche as a scapegoat to incite pro-war sentiment against Wutai. Perhaps it was intended in the OG but got lost due to translation issues? Or did they add that new detail for the remake?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I remember to be the more confusing and less-explained plot points of the original was the existence of the numbered clones; they also make an appearance here, but I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed that they weren&amp;rsquo;t really explained very well. While I understand why that is - in the OG the party doesn&amp;rsquo;t find out about Sephiroth/Jenova until near the end of the Midgar section, and the reunion part is never fully explained - I wish they could have added a bit more detail. As it is, people who are new to FF7 or don&amp;rsquo;t otherwise have context will probably be confused about who or what these numbered and hooded people are supposed to be? And why is this Sephiroth guy here, isn&amp;rsquo;t he supposed to be dead? These things are never really explained in-game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I disliked is that we didn&amp;rsquo;t get a playable Red XIII. I was wondering how they would handle this since I knew beforehand that he would be available in Midgar. I guess I can understand the decision, pacing-wise it&amp;rsquo;s weird to have a playable character only available in the last 2 chapters of the game. At least they gave us Red as an AI character and someone who can helpfull wallrun to pull levers, so that&amp;rsquo;s something I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also understand the limited number of summons we get. But we have Shiva and Ifrit but no Ramuh? Instead we get two Chocobos? Shrug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least I got to see the only enemy I really wanted to see in the remake: THE HELL HOUSE! (Now promoted to boss fight!)&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hard-mode&#34;&gt;Hard mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard mode is&amp;hellip; appropriately hard. Even normal encounters can be troublesome if you&amp;rsquo;re not careful. And boss fights are much more dangerous, and it&amp;rsquo;s much more imperative that you prepare before hand with the appropriate materia for eevery fight. The most crippling factor here is the fact that you can&amp;rsquo;t use items and can&amp;rsquo;t recover MP within a chapter. Which is a bit weird since quests and loot boxes still award you items. I understand the mode is balanced around not having items, it&amp;rsquo;s just weird. And I feel like the game could have used an intermediate difficulty step where the enemies are on hard mode difficulty but you can still use items. In fact, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have minded if that was what Normal mode was like, and Easy becomes what the actual Normal mode was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the hard mode fights are frustratingly difficult though, as long as you are sufficiently prepared. I did have to repeat some boss fights a few times, but hard mode didn&amp;rsquo;t really feel too tedious. I guess it helped that I enjoyed the combat system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most difficult fight in the game is a simulator fight available only in Hard Mode, called Top Secrets. This one took me a while, as I kept dying at the Bahamut+Ifrit fight when using conventional strategies. I finally managed to clear this fight using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dYWl2PFPYc&#34;&gt;the methods outlined in this video&lt;/a&gt; (Yes, I had to Youtube), except my materia wasn&amp;rsquo;t as levelled up as his was apparently and I kept running out of MP. It still wasn&amp;rsquo;t as easy as he made it look; it took me a few tries, but once I managed to clear Bahamut+Ifrit, I was able to beat the last fight as well, albeit with only Aerith remaining alive with almost no MP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played hard mode chapters 1-17 before grinding a bit so I could beat the Top Secrets fight, then proceeded to chapter 18 for the hard mode final boss. Having the limit break accessory from the Top Secrets fight doubtless made Sephiroth a bit easier, but it still took me a few tries, mostly because of his tendency to spam Heartless Angel in the last phase. I had Cloud, Tifa and Barret for that final boss fight, and basically configured only with HP UPs and healing abilities. I finally took Sephiroth down when I realized I should be using Magnify+Regen in the final phase and to be careful to not be in an attack animation when he starts Heartless Angel (otherwise you can&amp;rsquo;t avoid it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;platinum-completion&#34;&gt;Platinum completion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combat was great, but the most troublesome part of completion for me were the annoying dexterity-based minigames. There&amp;rsquo;s a reason I play RPGs and not rhythm games or twitch shooters! Anyway, there&amp;rsquo;s two minigames I skipped during my first run (mostly out of frustration): the first was the darts minigame in the Seventh Heaven bar, the second was the pull-ups challenge at the Wall Market gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The darts minigame was easy enough when I got back to it and figured out I needed to finely control the L stick with like three fingers in order to aim the dart. The Pull-ups minigame was much more frustrating, since you basically had to make no mistakes and even then you still might not beat Jules. The Top Secrets and Sephiroth battles probably took more time, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure pull-ups took a lot more attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;p&gt;I realized that the key was focus, and that meant getting rid of distractions like reducing the speech volume so you can&amp;rsquo;t hear the inane cheering (&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s this close!&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; bro, we just started!) and not looking at your count or Jules&amp;rsquo; count during the pullups. You&amp;rsquo;re not really competing against Jules, you&amp;rsquo;re competing against yourself, so he&amp;rsquo;s only a distraction. I ended up focusing on the round timer instead of looking elsewhere to avoid distractions. Even then I was still having trouble. Finally, I took drastic measures to avoid getting distracted by Jules: I covered half the TV with a towel:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to beat Jules on the very first attempt after putting the towel. This was my very last trophy for completion!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;that-ending&#34;&gt;That ending&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the main story tracks the OG&amp;rsquo;s Midgar section, we get an additional boss fight that kind of mirrors the Sephiroth boss fight in the OG. I was actually worried about how they planned to do this, since restricting the story to Midgar meant the final boss would have been&amp;hellip; Rufus? Or that big robot on the highway? Either would have been lame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That ending though&amp;hellip; not going into detail, but it heavily implies that although this is a retelling of the OG FF7, events may or may not unfold as we expect. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to how they do this &amp;ldquo;Unknown Journey&amp;rdquo; moving forward. Some outcomes have already changed, as implied by several scenes in the ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;overall&#34;&gt;Overall&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, very happy with the way this remake turned out, and looking forward to the succeeding installments and how they adjust the plot from here. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping they do a good job of fleshing out the other characters like Red XIII, Cait Sith/Reeve, Cid, Yuffie, and Vincent. (Not looking forward to having to do more dexterity-based minigames at the Gold Saucer!) It&amp;rsquo;s likely that the next installment will be a next generation game; this lets Square put off an FF16 lol.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Late Game Review: Tales of Berseria

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/tales-of-berseria/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;For the past month, most of my gaming time was spent on the Steam version of Tales of Berseria, which I got from a Humble Monthly Bundle back in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary: One of the best entries in the Tales series. Has fun combat, a great cast, a darker story and a really good aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the Tales series of games, ever since Phantasia on the SNES and Destiny on the PS1, and I take the opportunity to play them whenever they come out for a console I actually have. I&amp;rsquo;m especially a fan of how their real-time battle engine has evolved over the years, and version in the Berseria may be one of my favorites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The combat balance is slightly tilted in favor of the heroine Velvet, but the rest of the party members are reasonably fun to play as well and each have their roles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I played majority of the first run on Hard difficulty, I think I dropped to Moderate a couple of times in the bonus dungeon, just to get things over with. Hard difficulty had a reasonable balance: if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t paying attention to random encounters, there was a nontrivial chance I could just die. (And I did, more than once!). You have to look out for Risky Encounters (back attacks!) or Dangerous Encounters (when you trigger more than one mob groups at the same time), as both those encounters give the mobs serious advantages. And then, there&amp;rsquo;s the Dire Foes, boss-type mobs with invincible minions that show up unannounced at the end of battle if you&amp;rsquo;re doing too well in a certain area. They&amp;rsquo;re great for farming grade later on, but the first few times I encountered one led to a game over due to me being unprepared. As you can tell, I like a bit of challenge in my random encounters, I like that if I&amp;rsquo;m not focused, I might die. For the second achievement-focused run, I played all of it on the highest difficulty (Chaos), though that was blunted by the XP boosts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the game&amp;rsquo;s cel-shaded aesthetic as well. I took a whole bunch of screenshots, you can see them later in this post!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the story is a bit atypical of Tales games where you&amp;rsquo;re usually some chosen hero out to save the world. In this case you start out more as a villain/anti-hero and are out for revenge in a Count of Monte Cristo kind of way. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely darkier/edgier than most Tales games, although there are still light-hearted moments along the way. You spend most of the story as fugitives opposing the dominant authority of the era. The rest of your party members are mostly in the same boat: rogues and escaped criminals and pirates and rebels and whatnot. It&amp;rsquo;s a refreshing change of pace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Berseria also acts as long-ago prequel for Tales of Zestiria, though the world map is mostly different (due to certain in-game events vastly changing geography at the end of Berseria), it was fun to revisit that world and remember how everything lines up with what happened in Zestiria.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did two runs for the achievement completion. Total playtime came out to 119 hours, which seems like a lot, but for comparison, when I finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/01/690206344666750976/&#34;&gt;Tales of Zestiria back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, my playtime clocked in at a whopping 472 hours (where did I find the time?!?), so Berseria actually took a lot less time. Tales games typically have a lot of super-grindy achievements, Berseria had some, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as bad as it usually was, I would guess my overall grinding specifically for achievements took less than ten hours total.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Happy to see Milla and Jude appear as cameo characters in this one, as Xillia was one of my favorite ones, and Milla may be my favorite character design in the Tales series overall. (They&amp;rsquo;re in a bunch of screenshots below!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the screenshots below, you can see that I had everyone wear Normin suits for the second run lol. I like how the Tales series has introduced cosmetics with the advent of 3d models. It&amp;rsquo;s not unreasonable as DLC, since they&amp;rsquo;re not really essential, but they can also be fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what RPG I&amp;rsquo;m playing next - FF7R is coming out in April, and I already have it preordered; there might not be time to squeeze in another long one in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screenshots follow!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Kind of a late game review since this game came out in 2016, but XCom 2 is the game I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing the past couple of weeks. (the newer one, not Terror from the Deep, though that was fun too). I finished my first run yesterday, just on normal (Veteran) difficulty, nothing special, but here are my thoughts on the game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall: a fantastic follow-up to the 2012 game adding more mission variation, more unique soldier roles, more unique items, more enemies, and a more involved geoscape&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The story conceit is a lot more original than TFTD was (&amp;ldquo;Ooh, it&amp;rsquo;s like UFO Defense, except now the aliens are &lt;em&gt;underwater&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;quot;). At the start of the game, XCom is on the run in a mobile helicarrier-style base, while the world governments have struck an alliance with the invading aliens. That&amp;rsquo;s right, in this game, instead of defending the earth from the invading aliens, you are leading a plucky resistance group to liberate an already invaded earth!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the turn-based part is still pretty sweet. There are a lot of new types of missions to mix things up. Rescue missions, missions with a timer, missions where you have to avoid damaging certain things, &amp;ldquo;capture alive&amp;rdquo; missions, defense missions, escape missions, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Geoscape part is a lot more interactive now, as there is a subgame where you have to build a global resistance communications network to gain more income, at the same time responding to alien events and guerilla tactics opportunities. The aliens also trigger &amp;ldquo;Dark Events&amp;rdquo; which give them bonuses against you, and you have to complete certain missions to prevent those Dark Events. There is also a global countdown timer towards the aliens&amp;rsquo; nefarious master plan, so you always know how far you are from losing. Completing crucual missions will set back the timer, and allowing certain Dark Events to complete will move it forward faster, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of aliens, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more variation on the enemy soldier types, including new mech types, a new berserker unit (sometimes helps you if you can get it to go into a blind rage!), and a varied set of human-soldier hybrid officers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the learning curve is a bit harsh, even on the normal difficulty. I spent a few months in-game figuring things out, not really building avenger facilities optimally, not really prioritizing scientists and engineers, and getting most of soldiers wounded after every mission and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game gets much easier as you level up and they gain new abilities, like the ability to hack enemy mech units (I was using this all the time when my soldiers got high enough hack levels), the ability for your sharpshooter to fire multiple shots as long as she keeps killing, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was of course, a ton of savescumming on my part. Maybe someday I&amp;rsquo;ll be good enough at this game to avoid that. It&amp;rsquo;s easier on the missions where there&amp;rsquo;s no timer, since you have all the time to advance your squad slowly and set up favorable ambushes, but the timed missions are a lot more challenging to get through unscathed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These feel great:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Killing an entire enemy squad with a single sharpshooter&amp;rsquo;s turn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sniping an enemy from across the map using squadsight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking control of two enemy mech units at the same time and charging them into other enemy squads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up an corridor of death where the enemies just run into my soldiers on overwatch and ambush them. I finished the final mission during the enemy turn this way (see image below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The run took me about 30 hours over two weeks (stats below). I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I have the energy for a second run right now, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll let the game rest for a while before coming back to it. I considered buying the &lt;em&gt;War of the Chosen&lt;/em&gt; expansion immediately as well, but I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll do that when I have the energy for a second run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The corridor of death where I finished the game. Probably around 15-20 aliens died in this area&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I bought the Outer Worlds &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/11/b4op_a_h17a/&#34;&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because I had been without both my graphics card and my PS4 for a bit and I kind of wanted to play a relatively new game. I got the PS4 version because I hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet replaced my video card at the time and besides, the game was not available on Steam. I guess minor spoilers follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary: A reasonable Fallout-esque RPG from the makers of Fallout: New Vegas. It&amp;rsquo;s not as expansive or quite as nonlinear as their previous games, but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty serviceable and there&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable amount of stuff to do. A decent purchase, though I chafe at buying games at full $60 price these days lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;setting is a far future corporate dystopia in a remote human colony. Or at least, a caricature of a corporate dystopia. Your main enemies are evil corporations, which appeals to my recent disdain for capitalism. There are no intelligent alien races to interact with, but plently of wild animals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the space map shows something like 6-7 inhabited planets in the cluster, but you really only interact with 3-4 of them so that&amp;rsquo;s disappointing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are some gorgeous environments on those planets though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feels a bit like Fallout, with the general aesthetic hewing closely to Fallout&amp;rsquo;s 40s/50s vibe. Even the loading screens and movie advertisements are throwbacks to monster flicks from that era.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also feels a bit like Mass Effect, mainly with you getting a ship and the shuffling between worlds and the companion system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would say the companions are not as fleshed out as the Mass Effect ones though. Some of them are a lot less fleshed out than others. One of them is basically just a cleaning robot that you stuck a gun to, and he has no further storyline. Also, tbere is no companion romance option, but completing companion questlines unlocks an extra perk for them (though this isn&amp;rsquo;t clearly indicated when it happens, you have to check their status screen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phineas Welles gives a strong Rick Sanchez vibe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It isn&amp;rsquo;t a true open world, more like a forest of smaller open world areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a lot of quests to do, at least at the start, and they do a good job of putting the other quests in your path so that you naturally feel like you&amp;rsquo;re running into them. Towards the last third of the game, new quests seem to taper off though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually, by the last third of the game, everything felt a bit same-y. I was definitely less enthused to play towards the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combat especially doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much variation. Either enemies run at you with melee weapons or shoot at you from afar etc. I wish I used a more sniper-rifle style with scoped hunting rifles, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t. There is a version of VATS (which only you can use so somehow its a superpower), but it&amp;rsquo;s more like a bullet time effect to help you aim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like the voice acting, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty decent, although as always it&amp;rsquo;s noticeable when multiple NPCs have the same VA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load time between areas can be a bit horrendous, sometimes as long as 1-2 minutes, or does it only feel that way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It feels like you earn a lot of money, but there isn&amp;rsquo;t really anything to spend it on. There&amp;rsquo;s no reason to buy anything from shops, you&amp;rsquo;ll get more than you ever need just from looting and picking up stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a respec machine on your ship, which is cool, since it means you can commit skill points without too much fear of screwing up. However, I never really felt the need to respec during my run. I did respec after finishing the game to do some achievements though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Level cap is 30. I did all the quests I could and I got to the cap before the point of no return, so that was annoying. I even went with nonviolent solutions a lot of the time, so if you were one of those guys who like to kill all the enemies instead, you&amp;rsquo;ll hit the level cap even earlier. You won&amp;rsquo;t be able to max a lot of skills. I like to be a &amp;ldquo;jack of all trades&amp;rdquo; kind of guy, so my skill distribution was fairly spread out and I was only able to max one skill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For some reason, the game has a plethora of consumable items. I suspect these are mainly to support the hardest difficulty (supernova), as on normal difficulty there was never any reason to use a consumable other than the standard &amp;ldquo;Heal X HP&amp;rdquo; item.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished the game yesteday, on normal difficulty. I actually started out on hard, but then, surprise, I had a hard time at the start. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be too stressed so I downgraded to medium for the rest of the run. I got the &amp;ldquo;good ending&amp;rdquo;, that is to say, the one where you &amp;ldquo;defeat&amp;rdquo; the corporate master class, such as they are. Normal difficulty is relatively stress-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually want to go for 100% achievement completion, but this game had one that requires finishing on the highest difficulty, so that&amp;rsquo;s another run altogether. Presumably the second run would be much faster since I don&amp;rsquo;t have to do everything any more. I might get around to it someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screenshots follow!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I might be lending out my PS4 next month when the latest annual release of a sports franchise rolls around, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d finish off a PS4 game before the console vanishes on me for a few months. &lt;em&gt;What Remains of Edith Finch&lt;/em&gt; came out on PS+ a couple of months ago and people are always raving about how good it is and how it&amp;rsquo;s relatively short, so I decided to give it a go. I went in blind, not knowing anything, since mysteriously no one on Reddit could explain what makes the game good. This is understandably so as any sort of information kind of spoils the story for you. As such, consider yourself warned that this review might be considered spoiler-y. Overall if you like story-based games, just go ahead and play this one, then come back here to read the review if you&amp;rsquo;d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-narratives&#34;&gt;1 Narratives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Remains of Edith Finch&lt;/em&gt; is a first-person exploration game. The gameplay is largely focused around the story and advancing the narrative. The story revolves around the Finch family and their so-called &amp;ldquo;curse&amp;rdquo; which causes many of the family members to die of unusual causes. You spend the game exploring the now-abandoned Finch family house where five generations of Finches have lived since coming to America. As you explore the house you come across shrines for each deceased Finch family member, and each one takes you into a different scenario narrating their individual stories. Each family member&amp;rsquo;s story is told in a different manner: there&amp;rsquo;s one told as if it were a comic book, one told from the point of view of a baby in a bathtub, several are seen through the lens of a child&amp;rsquo;s imagination, and so on. The presentation of the substories and the main story exploring the house is very clever, with the actual text of the narratives often appearing throughout the environment, guiding you where to go next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-gameplay&#34;&gt;2 Gameplay&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gameplay is primarily based on exploration and experimentation. In the main story you explore the house and unlock secret passages and crawl through tunnels and climb to the roof and so on. There are no failure states in the gameplay, you simply keep pushing forward. If you get stuck, you walk around until you figure out a way to advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual substories are the same way, although many of them adjust the control schemes and expect you to experiment accordingly. As an example, in one of the substories you get to fly around as an owl, then later crawl around a cruise ship as some kind of tentacle monster. In another, you&amp;rsquo;re a baby in a bathtub imagining your toys coming to life. In yet another, you&amp;rsquo;re an assembly-line worker in a cannery dreaming of a fantasy world, and you must explore your fantasy world and slice off fishheads at the cannery at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The substories take place in their own little sandboxes, so to speak, and many of them seem like tech demos of cool things a developer would want to try like &amp;ldquo;Ooh, let&amp;rsquo;s make the player a shark on land and he has to fall into the ocean!&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s make a scenario where the player is just flying a kite!&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s not a proble, and it does create some interesting ways of presenting the narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this happens from the first person view, which was a bit problematic at times. Since I&amp;rsquo;m getting along with age, I&amp;rsquo;m not as good with first person gaming as I used to be, and playing with this view for an extended period of time can give me some dizziness. Luckily, the game was quite short, and I managed to finish it in two sittings. (Maybe 1.5 hours total)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-achievements&#34;&gt;3 Achievements?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually try to go for achievement completion before posting a review, especially for story-based games like this. But this time I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother. Most of the achievements are silly things that you can do during the exploration gameplay, like knocking all of the balls off a pool table. Most can be acquired after completing the game the first time, since that unlocks the ability to replay individual substories. But there was one achievement that required looking through every peephole/telescope in the game, and that seemed like I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it without replaying everything from the beginning. That didn&amp;rsquo;t appeal to me because (a) I might get dizzy again; and (b) this is the sort of game where it&amp;rsquo;s best experienced the first time around, and successive playthroughs won&amp;rsquo;t be of much value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-overall&#34;&gt;4 Overall&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;I liked it, though not as much as say, Life is Strange. The exploration of the house is great and the all of the scenes and sandboxes are well set up and very detailed, although the overarching Finch family story is a thinly-veiled framing device to bring together the individual substories. The game is well worth the 1-2 hours to go through it.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/03/rip-ps-vita/&#34;&gt;PS Vita recently being discontinued by Sony&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to work on reducing my Vita backlog a bit. One of the games I&amp;rsquo;d been meaning to play for a while now was Zero Time Dilemma, the third game in the Nonary Games trilogy. I&amp;rsquo;ve only previously played the 2nd game in the series, Virtue&amp;rsquo;s Last Reward, which is a bit appropriate given how the events in these games often unfold nonlinearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#eec3f3dcaf74c2aba71bfe2db6d3e39e-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/03/zero-time-dilemma/ztd-phi_hu2d16a9ba67469bfb9806d424cff0a232_107631_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;eec3f3dcaf74c2aba71bfe2db6d3e39e-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/03/zero-time-dilemma/ztd-phi.jpg&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;20 Mar 2019 5:56am&#34;&gt;20 Mar 2019 5:56am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZTD is pretty good, but the story is understandably complex, given how it builds off a series of games that already involved espers and time travel and multiple timelines and cults and world pandemics and so on. It didn&amp;rsquo;t help that it&amp;rsquo;s been 4-5 years since I played VLR, and that game already had an overly complex plot so I can barely remember the details from that game as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;rsquo;s a story-based series, the gameplay largely consists of two parts: (a) escape rooms; and (b) decision-making. The escape rooms part are entertaining enough, nothing too difficult, but satisfying enough to solve everything. The decision-making part is used to unlock branching timelines, and the path to the &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; endings is determined by your ability to find the correct decisions to unlock the correct events. Not all decisions are binary or multiple-choice; some of the more important ones require text or numeric input, making it impossible to guess them. At multiple points, you will need to reference information learned from other branches of history (don&amp;rsquo;t worry, there is a story reason for why this happens).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took me a couple of weeks of playing sporadically to finish the game. I enjoyed the game enough to spend a couple of late nights to finish it once I got really going. I will shamefully admit I did get stuck in one place and in my impatience I googled my way past it. Still, a platinum is a platinum:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, given how old the first game is, it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely I&amp;rsquo;m going to get to complete the trilogy. There&amp;rsquo;s still a couple of other Vita games I want to play as well (notably, I&amp;rsquo;m still in the middle of a 3-year old Tales of Hearts R run), so maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get around to those&amp;hellip; someday!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Game Review: Hollow Knight
</title>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Back in 2017 during a Steam Sale, I was trying to choose a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania&#34;&gt;Metroidvania&lt;/a&gt; to play. My choices came down to either Ori and the Blind Forest or Hollow Knight. My impression that was that Ori had the more challenging platforming, while Hollow Knight had the more challenging combat. I chose Ori at that time, and I enjoyed that game. Last October, Hollow Knight was in a Humble Monthly, and I decided to go for it. I played it for just about a month since January, and my impressions remain the same, but I now think that while Ori had a better visual presentation, Hollow Knight is the superior game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not taking anything away from Hollow Knight&amp;rsquo;s aesthetic mind you, it&amp;rsquo;s a perfectly gorgeous game. It&amp;rsquo;s just that I remember enjoying Ori&amp;rsquo;s visuals more. Here&amp;rsquo;s a couple of screens!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#1073c52a955cb3a5b062d5f3b6230717-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/02/game-review-hollow-knight/hollowknight-2_huc974cf01ba4dd9ebd56121af5b622b13_252794_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;

  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/02/game-review-hollow-knight/hollowknight-2.jpg&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;16 Feb 2019 5:56am&#34;&gt;16 Feb 2019 5:56am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ori had a few more challenging platforming bits, but some areas in Hollow Knight provide a significant challenge as well (looking at you White Palace!). Movement in Hollow Knight also felt a lot more fun and fluid - it was great dashing and double jumping and wall jumping across the screens once I had full mobility. Hollow Knight has a stronger combat focus, and some of the fights can get very challenging indeed (as of this writing I have yet to complete the Trial of the Fool).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The progression in Hollow Knight is also less linear than Ori - which can be a bit of a double-edged sword. While the freedom to roam is nice, it can also lead to some frustrating moments when you find a path that looks like you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be able to do it with a bit tighter platforming, but it turns out you should just wait for some other ability to unlock before going for it. I feel like there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more stuff to hunt down for completionists too. I finished the game at 105% completion. Post-launch DLC pushed the maximum up to 112%, but I doubt I&amp;rsquo;ll be bothering to do most of the other stuff, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty satisfied with the game as-is. I did manage to hit all three main endings somehow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#ee97af99d43d89918d192d8596599111-lightbox&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Ori, not gonna go for achievement completion on this one. Some of the challenges are a bit too much for me. It&amp;rsquo;s actually surprising to me how I can still play and enjoy action games like this, given how terrible my reflexes are nowadays, but Metroidvanias have a special place in my gaming heart for some reason and somehow I am able to muddle through. With deaths. Many, many deaths. I finished Ori with 900+ deaths. Hollow Knight doesn&amp;rsquo;t track this statistic (thankfully?), but I probably got close to that number in Hollow Knight too. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably wait a while before picking another one up again though, maybe let my slow reflexes relax for a while with some turn-based games instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Coincidentally, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFAknD_9U7c&#34;&gt;sequel for Hollow Knight&lt;/a&gt; was just announced! IDK if I&amp;rsquo;d play it - I haven&amp;rsquo;t played yet the sequels to the last two Metroidvanias I played (Guacamelee and Ori and the Blind Forest), somehow a completely new experience seems better for me.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I picked up Slay the Spire during the last (Winter) Steam Sale, not really knowing what I was getting into. I had heard some good things, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know much other than it was a roguelite where I had to go through a dungeon. But it was cheap so I took the dive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to find that not only was it a roguelite, it was also a deckbuilding game! I love deckbuilding games, they often generate a significant amount of variance that translates to fun, and pairing that mechanic with a roguelite meant each run would be pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in Slay the Spire, you choose a character from three choices, each of which have a different set of powers and cards. You go through the dungeons, one room at a time. Each room might have an enemy, a treasure or a random event. The map for the entire dungeon act is available ahead of time, so you can plot your route as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your character is equipped with a deck of cards that includes attacks and blocks and powers. Along the way you can add new cards to your deck by defeating enemies or opening chests or buying from merchants and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three available characters to play (as of now), and they offer pretty different play styles. There&amp;rsquo;s the Ironclad, who&amp;rsquo;s kind of a straightforward attack and block kind of guy. There&amp;rsquo;s the Silent, a rogue who prefers chaining multiple attacks or using poison. And there&amp;rsquo;s the Defect, who summons persistent orbs that perform various functions. The dungeon proceeds the same way for each class, but they have different card sets to choose from so battles often play out differently, and each character has different builds you can lean towards to increase your odds of a successful run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battles proceed in a turn-based manner. You draw some number of cards from your deck and each turn, and play as many as your energy allows. The unique thing about Slay the Spire is that during your turn, you can see each enemy&amp;rsquo;s intent. That is, you can see what the enemy will do next turn, more or less, via an icon over their head (see image).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;aafaacd2db44b2628a0dce0eb63cb6a4-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;2 Feb 2019 5:56am&#34;&gt;2 Feb 2019 5:56am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the enemy plans to attack, there&amp;rsquo;s an icon over their head indicating how much damage and how many attacks they&amp;rsquo;re going to do. If they&amp;rsquo;re going to block, there&amp;rsquo;s a shield icon. And there&amp;rsquo;s icon for if they are going to do buffs or debuffs. In a sense the game gives you perfect information about what the enemies are going to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means every turn is sort of a mini-puzzle: what are the cards I need to play to minimize the amount of damage I take (always your priority, since taking too much damage endangers your run) or should I try to avoid debuffs or can I maybe already beat the enemy this turn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all plays out in the framework of the spire, the dungeon you&amp;rsquo;re trying to conquer, with the map being randomly generated rooms. Every room presents choices: which card to add to your deck? Which card to remove? Should I risk some HP to gain a relic? And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s all very fun, and quite challenging. It can also be frustrating, but since the game gives you near perfect information (you even know at the start of a floor which among a set of bosses you are going to be facing at the end of the floor), any deaths are always at least partly your fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to wait until I&amp;rsquo;ve &amp;ldquo;completed&amp;rdquo; games before I review them, and for Slay the Spire I did manage to finish a run with each class at least once. But I&amp;rsquo;ve only scratched the surface, there&amp;rsquo;s a ton of content beyond that. I haven&amp;rsquo;t even gotten the &amp;ldquo;true ending&amp;rdquo; yet, which only becomes available after beating the game once with each class, as the &amp;ldquo;true ending&amp;rdquo; boss is quite difficult. And even beyond that there&amp;rsquo;s special cards to unlock, daily challenges with different parameters, and even an endless mode I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried yet. I also hear that the devs are very diligent and add content on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slay the Spire recently went &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo; and left Early Access, just last month, and they&amp;rsquo;re planning for a Switch port too. The one disadvantage of the game for me is that each run takes a considerable amount of time (You can actually quit at any time during a run and resume it later, but I always feel compelled to finish each run in one sitting), and I have a lot of other games to play. I&amp;rsquo;ll still probably revisit the Spire from time to time, but frankly trying to &amp;ldquo;complete&amp;rdquo; the game, Steam achievements and all, seems like a huge task, given the large amount of variance in the game, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get there someday.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I had been eyeing &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dukope&#34;&gt;Lucas Pope&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s acclaimed indie hit &lt;em&gt;Papers Please&lt;/em&gt; on Steam for a while, but finally bit the bullet on it during the last sale. The story of the game itself is interesting, as Pope was more or less a one-man team, doing the design, code, music and art for the game himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, the game places you in the role of a border inspector in a fictional 1980s totalitarian state called Arstotzka, a thinly-veiled parallel to communist East Germany and similar nations. As border inspector, you&amp;rsquo;re charged with inspecting the documents of people who want to enter the country, and your meagre salary depends on how many people you are able to correctly process in one day. The day-to-day gameplay tension is between your need to process as many people as possible so that you have enough to pay rent and feed your family; vs your desire to avoid making mistakes. Mistakes often come in the form of allowing entrants with discrepancies in their papers to pass through unchallenged, and making multiple mistakes in the same day is painful for your salary and endangers your family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#be6c48b1b69c8295e4e30d0815d116ca-lightbox&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;be6c48b1b69c8295e4e30d0815d116ca-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/01/papers-please/papers-please.jpg&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;13 Jan 2019 5:56am&#34;&gt;13 Jan 2019 5:56am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gameplay is mostly attention to detail. At the start of a run, you only have one or two documents per entrant and it&amp;rsquo;s relatively simply: make sure their passport photo matches their appearance, make sure the passport isn&amp;rsquo;t expired, make sure it has a valid issuing city, etc. As the days pass, the Arstotzkan bureaucracy imposes more requirements upon entrants, making your job considerably harder. Towards the end of the story mode&amp;rsquo;s 31-day period you&amp;rsquo;ll be checking 4-6 different documents per entrant, making sure all their papers are valid and all the info on each document matches the others and so on. It has an element of tediousness reflecting the actual job you are doing, and yet is strangely engaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story mode is fairly good, and it finds you dealing with challenges like smugglers, refugees, bribes, forged documents, a nosy press, and even a group of rebels plotting to take down the fascist Arstotzkan government, and the occasional terrorist attack on your booth. There are a number of endings, you can choose to play it straight, do your job as ordered and not support any criminal elements at all, and you and your family will live your same life in Arstotzka. Or you can risk everything by helping dissidents and refugees and criminals, and in the end you have to find a way to escape your homeland with your family. Or you could make the wrong decision at some points, and the game will end earlier than expected. Many of the noncritical entrants are randomly-generated I think, but the story-critical ones are preordained to come at specific times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation-state of Arstotzka is surprisingly efficient in some ways - if you make a mistake such as letting through an entrant with an invalid passport, you are immediately issued a citation (something you come to dread in the game). So somehow the bureaucracy is able to know what is happening in your booth - yet they are unable to detect your interactions with the dissidents and some of the criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achievements: The game provides an autosave each day you complete, and you can resume from any of the previous days, so that&amp;rsquo;s helpful for achievement hunting. I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother going for achievement completion yet though, as the remaining ones I missed seem to require too much backtracking, and there&amp;rsquo;s other games to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was a good buy, and perhaps even still a bit relevant in the modern world, despite it&amp;rsquo;s 1980s setting.&lt;/p&gt;

            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I said in my previous &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2017/02/review-duelyst/&#34;&gt;Duelyst review&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.direwolfdigital.com/eternal/&#34;&gt;Eternal&lt;/a&gt; didn&amp;rsquo;t really hook me. That was in Feb 2017. I stopped playing Duelyst after around six months. I started playing Eternal regularly July of that year, and have been playing regularly ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What changed my mind? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure, but once I got around to playing Eternal regularly, I found myself enjoying it. I think one of the main factors is that out of all &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/ccgs/&#34;&gt;the online ccgs&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve tried, Eternal is the one that&amp;rsquo;s closest to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/categories/magic-the-gathering/&#34;&gt;Magic the Gathering&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s not really surprising, since a number of Eternal&amp;rsquo;s lead designers are MTG Pros and Hall of Famers. As such, my review will tend to compare Eternal to MTG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eternal games play out almost exactly like MTG games. Each player plays mana sources (called Power in eternal), then uses his pool to play creatures and spells to interact with the enemy. You send in creatures to attack and deal damage to the enemy until the enemy&amp;rsquo;s life total is at 0 (Eternal starts at 25 life vs MTG&amp;rsquo;s 20.), the enemy can send his units to block your attackers, and so on. Eternal feels like a smoother, more streamlined MTG. I&amp;rsquo;m also playing MTG Arena regularly these days, so I know that by comparison Eternal&amp;rsquo;s games feel like they flow quicker and finish faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the relevant changes that I believe make it feel like a faster MTG:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;limited fast effect windows. This is the main one. MTG Arena has to stop and ask you what you want to do every time there&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to play fast effects, and there&amp;rsquo;s tons. In Eternal, there are only three windows: during combat, at the end of the enemy&amp;rsquo;s turn, and whenever the enemy plays a spell. And you can only play fast spells (basically MTG instants), there are no creature abilities to activate at instant speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the game will automatically pass priority whenever you don&amp;rsquo;t have any relevant plays. MTG Arena does this automatically as well. You can turn it off, since it has a bit of disadvantage (it conveys information to the opponent)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;similar to HS, Eternal limits the number of creatures you can have on the board. Eternal allows twelve on each side vs Heathstone&amp;rsquo;s seven. This is more due to technical constraints than anything else. MTG Arena has to play the same on paper, so you can crash the game by generating some large number of creatures somehow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/eternal_board_limit_hub36af13f9519955d1931871364475345_567453_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt; (Click to view full-size)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;f653e5535156b73f5d214483a5874674-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/eternal_board_limit.jpg&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;25 Nov 2018 2:00am&#34;&gt;25 Nov 2018 2:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eternal&amp;rsquo;s power system is similar to MTG&amp;rsquo;s mana system - you have to draw cards that provide power the same way that you have to draw lands in MTG. This means one of MTG&amp;rsquo;s inherent &amp;ldquo;problems&amp;rdquo; - mana screw - still happens in Eternal. In fact, on the forums mana screw is one of the complaints that often comes out (I suspect from former HearthStone players). Coming from MTG, I understand that building your deck to avoid mana screw is one of the skills needed in games like Magic and Eternal. Eternal eases the problem a little bit with its mulligan mechanic: Eternal gives you one free mulligan, and the 2nd hand is guaranteed to have 2-4 power. As I write this, they are also experimenting with allowing a 2nd mulligan that drops your starting hand size by one, still with the guarantee of 2-4 power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color screw can still be a problem in Eternal, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough of the correct influence (Eternal&amp;rsquo;s analogue to color), you can&amp;rsquo;t play cards that require that influence. They improved on this a bit because in Eternal, power and influence aren&amp;rsquo;t tied together the way mana and color are, they are independent. The influence requirements are &lt;em&gt;minimums&lt;/em&gt; that aren&amp;rsquo;t used up like mana of a given color. That is, if you have one Fire influence, you can play any number of cards that require one Fire influence. In MTG, if you only have one source of red mana, that red mana can only be spent for one card at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of color/influence, Eternal has five factions like MTG&amp;rsquo;s color pie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Faction&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Symbol color&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Closest analogous MTG color&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fire&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Red&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Red&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Shadow&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Purple&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Black&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Primal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Blue&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Blue&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Justice&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Green&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;White&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yellow&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Green&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, they don&amp;rsquo;t map cleanly. Often in my own head I still refer to the factions by their MTG analogue (and I call Justice Green and Time White), but I&amp;rsquo;ve been improving on this lately. The play styles largely map correctly though. Fire decks are often aggressive with small quick creatures and burn for reach. Primal decks have card draw and counter magic. Shadow decks have a lot of removal and life draining. Time decks have mana acceleration and big creatures. Justice decks have Wrath of God lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, many of Eternal keywords are similar or analogous to MTG keywords. And they added some fun, unique keywords of their own. Eternal already has a number of expansions out, so there are quite a number of keywords already. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Keyword&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;MTG Analogue&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Notes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Aegis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hexproof&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Unlike hexproof, Aegis only works once (it resets if the unit enters play again). Also, Aegis will protect against Wrath-style effects whereas Hexproof does not. I think this is a neat hexproof variant that could also work in MTG, maybe.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Berserk&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;None&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This is a fun, unique risk-reward mechanic that has no equivalent in MTG. Basically you can choose to attack twice if a unit has Berserk, one time only. After activating berserk, the unit becomes Reckless.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Charge&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Haste&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deadly&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deathtouch&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Deadly + Overwhelm/Quick Draw work exactly the same as MTG&amp;rsquo;s Deathtouch + Trample/First Strike&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Double Damage&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Double Strike&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Well, the damage is just doubled, there&amp;rsquo;s no second damage step.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Endurance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Vigilance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In addition to not tapping to attack, units with Endurance can&amp;rsquo;t be tapped (exhausted) or stunned by enemy effects&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Flying&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Flying&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Big surprise!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Killer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fight&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fight is a close analogue, but there are major differences. A unit with Killer can attack one enemy unit at any time (even with summoning sickness), and the fight is treated as a combat (effects that trigger on attack or block will take place)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lifesteal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lifelink&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Overwhelm&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Trample&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Quickdraw&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;First strike&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;But only when attacking. No defensive first strike!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Reckless&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Attacks each turn if able&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Revenge&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The first time this unit dies, it gains Destiny (automatically played when drawn) and is shuffled back the top ten cards of your deck&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Unblockable&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Unblockable&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Warcry&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Warcry&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This was my favorite when first starting out. Whenever a unit with Warcry attacks, the next unit or weapon in your deck gains an attack/defense buff. Value! This is one of those abilities that can&amp;rsquo;t happen in a paper game like MTG.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Scout&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Scry&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just the battle skills! Eternal also has a set of trigger keywords that define when an effect will happen. There&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Summon&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Entomb&lt;/strong&gt;, analogous to HS&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Battlecry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Deathrattle&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Empower&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Spark&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tribute&lt;/strong&gt;, are analogous to MTG&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Landfall&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Bloodthirst&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Morbid&lt;/strong&gt;; and so on. There&amp;rsquo;s far too many to cover here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re: other mechanics, the main one to note is that Eternal takes full advantage of the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s a computer game and doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to deal with player memory issues. This means that buffs and debuffs stay on cards, even when they leave zones. Unlike Hearthstone, the graveyard/void zone exists and thus reanimator strategies are viable. There is some amount of RNG, such as &amp;ldquo;units gain a random battle skill&amp;rdquo;, but not as much as HS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice mechanic they have is the &amp;ldquo;Market&amp;rdquo;. Basically each deck can have a set of five cards set aside as a &amp;ldquo;Market&amp;rdquo;/sideboard, and there are a set of cards (one for each faction) that allow you to fetch a card of that faction from the market. Basically similar to the way the Wishes worked in Magic. It&amp;rsquo;s a clever approach that allows for some form of &amp;ldquo;sideboarding&amp;rdquo; even for best of one matches&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skill Level, Competitive Play and F2P&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Eternal is inherently more skill-based than HS because of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;manabase decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;much less RNG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attacking and blocking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meta for competitive play is rather healthy, there are a number of viable decks in different archetypes that can you to Master ranking on the ladder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eternal provides several modes for Limited play as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s Forge, which is similar to Hearthstone&amp;rsquo;s Arena&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s monthly sealed leagues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s 4-pack draft available at any time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of F2P, Eternal is the most generous among CCGs I&amp;rsquo;ve tried in terms of how much it gives players for free, as far as I can tell. Aside from the standard three daily quests, your first ranked win of each day gets you a free pack. There&amp;rsquo;s a free Gauntlet mode where you fight against AIs, and just grinding Gauntlet can get you enough gold to purchase the campaigns, which give you more cards to work with. When you start out, you quickly earn starter decks for five factions and five color pairs. These decks are decent enough for ranked play; I remember I took the Rakano and Stonescar starter decks up to Gold rank during my first month. They recently nerfed gold rewards from chests (that you earn from quests) by 10% for balance reasons, but I think the rewards are still pretty generous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hit Master rank in constructed on my third month of play (same rate as with Duelyst I believe) and have regularly hit it ever since. By comparison, I&amp;rsquo;ve never hit legend rank in HS. It really helps that Eternal games are quick and a lot more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a while longer to hit Master rank in draft - more than one year in fact, I only hit it last week. This was the last achievement I needed for Steam completion too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lore and Aesthetics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eternal&amp;rsquo;s world is described as &amp;ldquo;Six Guns and Sorcery Combined&amp;rdquo;, which means there&amp;rsquo;s Gunslingers alongside magic users and shamans and such. There&amp;rsquo;s a little bit of steampunk in there too, along with valkyries, yetis, centaurs, wisps, dinosaurs, radiants (basically magical aliens), grenadin (basically goblins), sentinels (basically giant robots), and a bunch of other stuff too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s pretty fun, and the story is continuously being updated. Each monthly league and the occasional campaign or new card set represents a change in the story. Major characters are represented by powerful cards and often have multiple versions representing their stages of growth. A prime example is Icaria, the young Valkyrie captain who later becomes a rebellious keyword-souped Akroma-like avenger after witnessing her superior&amp;rsquo;s misdeeds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/eternalcardgame/images/6/6d/Icaria%2C_Valkyrie_Captain.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/318?cb=20180307222958&#34; alt=&#34;Icaria, Valkyrie Captain&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/eternalcardgame/images/e/eb/Icaria%2C_the_Liberator.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/318?cb=20181012184436&#34; alt=&#34;Icaria, the Liberator&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the lore, I like the game&amp;rsquo;s overall aesthetic. Many game actions have smooth and quick animations that keep the game alive. Units with Aegis are wrapped with an animated bluish glow. Legendary units crash onto the field with force, attacking units dive towards their blockers, and so on. I think the animations and aesthetic are comparable with HS in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is now: will I keep playing Eternal now that I&amp;rsquo;ve hit my usual target of all the Steam achievements? Or should I focus on MTG Arena for the foreseeable future? (MTG Arena blog post sometime in the next month maybe)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is still pretty fun to play Eternal, and they just came out of Early Access and launched on XBoxOne, so there might be an upsurge in community activity. I think I will play it for a while, the designers seem to know what they&amp;rsquo;re doing, and a new set comes out next month too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few other online CCGs I have accounts for that I haven&amp;rsquo;t really gotten into for some reason or another, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll try giving them another chance next year. There&amp;rsquo;s Spellweaver (very slow games and kinda boring), Shadowverse (not a fan of the aesthetic and ugh the UI is so messy/cluttered), and Gwent (uh, it&amp;rsquo;s weird). There&amp;rsquo;s Valve&amp;rsquo;s Artifact coming out too, I might try that if reviews are good. So many card games to play!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Game Review: Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man for PS4
</title>

            <pubDate>Sun, 18 Nov 2018 02:00:21 +0000</pubDate>
            <author>hello@roytang.net (Roy Tang)</author>
            <guid>https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/11/game-review-marvels-spider-man-for-ps4/</guid>
            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Finally had the time to play &lt;em&gt;Marvel&amp;rsquo;s Spider-Man for PS4&lt;/em&gt;. Took just a little under two weeks from start to Platinum. Maybe mild, unmarked spoilers somewhere in this review, be warned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall: the game was amazing and spectacular and fun, especially for a big comic book fan like me, well worth the buy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanics: Combat felt a bit weird to me at first, mainly because I was expecting it to be closer to Arkham-style combat, and I kept trying to use Spider-Man&amp;rsquo;s Circle Dodge the same way I use Batman&amp;rsquo;s Triangle counter, and that got me clocked by the first boss of the game (Kingpin) a few times. Spider-man&amp;rsquo;s Dodge doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow you to cancel out of existing animations like Batman&amp;rsquo;s counter, so I really needed to unlearn that instinct. Once you get a hang of it, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty good, but feels a lot more chaotic than Arkham style combat. Arkham combat felt a lot more rhythmic where you just tap commands out and point at the baddie you want to hit. Here it feels like you have to be jumping all the time and swinging across the air and moving the camera around to look for objects to throw at enemies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanics: Web-swinging around Manhattan also felt weird at first. Sometimes the command to web swing would be unresponsive, which I would later realize would be because I was at a height that was too high to find surfaces to swing from. Once you get the hang of it, it feels very smooth and fun and you&amp;rsquo;re zipping around Manhattan like a boss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Story: Peter Parker in this universe is reminiscent of old-school Peter Parker who&amp;rsquo;s always late to things and always behind on his rent. The early parts have him getting evicted from his apartment (classic Parker!) and looking for a place to crash. (Although after that point, it&amp;rsquo;s never mentioned where he&amp;rsquo;s sleeping, if he is at all.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Story: Spider-man here is however, a well-known public figure, a veteran of super-heroing who even gets some assistance from law enforcement primarily in the form of Captain Yuri Watanabe. He&amp;rsquo;s been webslinging around long enough to build a stable of villains who are constantly referenced about being held in the Raft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanics: There&amp;rsquo;s actually a lot to do around the city. Not really collectibles, but more like different kinds of challenges and missions. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of crimes to stop that you&amp;rsquo;ll hear on police bands as you&amp;rsquo;re web-swinging around. More difficult crimes and missions unlock as the story progresses, and they all come with optional objectives (such as perform X type of special move, etc) that give you bonus rewards. There&amp;rsquo;s also stealth missions reminiscent of Arkham&amp;rsquo;s predator modes, pigeon chasing, research missions that have you doing all sorts of weird tasks, and so on. Missions typically reward you with some form of tokens, which are used to unlock suits, gadgets and upgrades. This Spider-Man has a lot of gadgets, making him closer to a Batman figure in this universe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Story: In this universe, J. Jonah Jameson is retired from his days at the Daily Bugle and instead hosts an internet radio show where as can be expected, he&amp;rsquo;s always castigating Spider-Man. His broadcasts come in as you&amp;rsquo;re swinging around the city, and Jonah will often comment on things you&amp;rsquo;ve recently done or missions recently accomplished. I especially like it when one of the missions had you doing something ridiculous like intentionally swinging through smog and Jonah makes wild speculations about what the hell you were smoking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanics: The suit selection in the game is fairly good, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of suits available and you unlock more as you level up (you need to purchase them with tokens). You can change costumes at any time, and most cutscenes will show Spider-Man wearing whatever suit you have on at the time, which can be sometimes hilarious. I&amp;rsquo;m severaly disappointed at the lack of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/spiderman/images/6/69/F0ab528486904cef1297397514b73ef9.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120721011355&#34;&gt;Fantastic Four Amazing Bag-Man costume&lt;/a&gt; though. My favorite costume from this game is the classic comic book costume (screenshots below), I really like how well it&amp;rsquo;s animated so smoothly and gives such a cartoony vibe. I would totally play an entire game rendered in this fashion. It&amp;rsquo;s also hilarious when this costume is used in cutscenes!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/KcHOHTc.png&#34; alt=&#34;My favorite costume!&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/4KOBWj0.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Why won&amp;rsquo;t you take me seriously MJ?!?&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imgur.com/XyiqRIW.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Those guns won&amp;rsquo;t work on me, I&amp;rsquo;m a cartoon!&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mystery: I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why, but the distance scaling in this game is super-off. In-game measurements tell me Manhattan island is about 4 km from top to bottom, which feels really small. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan&#34;&gt;Wikipedia entry&lt;/a&gt; says Manhattan is almost 60 sq km, but in-game it can&amp;rsquo;t be more than 10 sq km. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why it would be like this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Story/Mechanics: You don&amp;rsquo;t get to play as Peter Parker/Spider-Man all the time, there&amp;rsquo;s also a few missions you have to play out as one of two side characters. One of them is the lovable spunky red-headed Mary Jane Watson, who in this universe is not a supermodel actress, but rather has a more Lois-Lane like role as an investigative reported for the Daily Bugle. That means she gets herself into all sorts of troublesome situations where she has to sneak around enemies in order to escape. She&amp;rsquo;s no damsel in distress here, I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure if Peter ever rescues her directly. I like this MJ iteration, she has a lot more spunk. The other side character you get to play at is young Miles Morales, who enter&amp;rsquo;s Peter&amp;rsquo;s life somewhere in the 2nd act of the story. Miles parts consist of sneaking around as well, although he has a different toolset than MJ, mainly consisting of a hacking app that lets him create distractions to bypass guards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Story: One of the best things in this game&amp;rsquo;s story is the mentorship relationship between Peter Parker and Otto Octavius, although if you know comics, you have a pretty good idea of where this is headed. Unlike the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2004/07/movies-spiderman-2/&#34;&gt;2nd Tobey movie&lt;/a&gt;, the game gives their relationship sufficient time to develop before you start to see signs of trouble. The fall itself is well-executed and heavily foreshadowed and Peter has only himself to blame when he finds out he helped turn his mentor into an insane mechanical octopus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Story: The overall story had some twists and some surprises in the ending itself. At the heart of all the problems facing Spider-Man this time around is the incumbent Mayor Norman Osborn, but who never actually turns into a green villain himself. The game&amp;rsquo;s ending heavily hints at a 2nd outing, so they&amp;rsquo;re probably saving Norman for later. Wise decision as well, Spider-Man has a deep bench of villains to pull from, and many of the classic ones haven&amp;rsquo;t been hinted at yet in this game. Aside from the Goblin, the 2nd game could very well introduce us to the Lizard, Sandman, Mysterio, and maybe even Venom among others!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After getting the platinum, I was tempted to purchase the &amp;ldquo;City That Never Sleeps&amp;rdquo; DLCs as well for additional content, but I decided to hold off for now. My experience already feels &amp;ldquo;complete&amp;rdquo; and just right anyway, and adding more missions might be too repetitive. Maybe if it goes on sale sometime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stan Lee (RIP) also had a small cameo in this game. For me it&amp;rsquo;s bittersweet that I got the platinum a couple of days after his death; I consider the game to be a fitting tribute to his life&amp;rsquo;s work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is tradition, here&amp;rsquo;s a screendump, awash with in-game spoilers! (Mainly because I chose to include the automatic screenshots that came with each Trophy unlock). You can see during the later parts I was using the comic costume almost exclusively!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(“Late Game Review&amp;rdquo; because I’m trying to play through games on my ridiculously old backlog, so these games are pretty old)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim came out on 11/11/2011. I remember I bought the game for Steam on launch day. I finally &amp;ldquo;finished&amp;rdquo; it after 350 hours of gameplay and seven years real-time. &amp;ldquo;Finished&amp;rdquo; in this case means &amp;ldquo;achievement complete&amp;rdquo;, not just &amp;ldquo;main quest complete&amp;rdquo;, because as any Bethesda gamer knows, that’s not how their RPGs roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been looking forward to this game because I had previously enjoyed both ES4: Oblivion and Fallout 3 on PS3 and had also just finished Fallout: New Vegas on Steam and was open to more open-world exploration. I remember being tempted by the badass collector’s edition Alduin statue too but opted out due to price and the fact that it was huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first character was a male Nord named Hunter. I actually managed to finish the main quest a bit more than a month after getting the game (fairly fast!). I used that first character to complete all the guild quests &amp;ndash; Companions, Mage’s Guild, Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood. Afterwards I immersed myself with the open world and toyed around with mods for a bit. I played it on and off again for a few years, and buying the DLC expansions (Hearthfire, Dawnguard and Dragonborn) eventually when they were on sale. I started a few other runs but never got far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, I started my final run &amp;ndash; the character that I would be able to bring to &amp;ldquo;achievement completion&amp;rdquo; including all DLCs. This final character was Arche, an Imperial (named after the Tales of Phantasia character).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I greatly enjoyed this game obviously. It’s been available for a while and been ported to every platform imaginable (it even got a new console release this year!), so there’s not much point talking about the features and whatnot. There are some other things I’d like to cover though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Levelling Up and Legendary Dragons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last achievement I got was the one for killing a legendary dragon, which took me forever. The first issue was that legendary dragon’s don’t spawn unless you’re already level 78. In my 2nd run, I finished the Dawnguard and Dragonborn content and all other achievements by around level 50, and it was a grind to get to level 78 througn conventional means. I didn’t want to do any console cheats to get to 78, so I tried to look for faster ways to level up. There’s a bunch of suggestions on the internet, but here are the best ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telekinesis &amp;ndash; with enchantments to reduce MP cost, you can use Telekinesis to quickly level up Alteration, simply by levitating an object in front of you until you run out of magic, then you just rest and repeat. This method was still fairly slow for me though and more importantly it was really boring. I read some posts saying you could speed up this process by levitating an object then doing fast travel to a far location so that the game thinks you were using Telekinesis during the entire trip, but I could never get this to work and that feels a bit too exploit-y for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giant blocking &amp;ndash; basically go find a camp with high level giants, then keep blocking their attacks with your shield, healing when necessary. The advantage of this is that it increases multiple skills &amp;ndash; Block, Restoration and Light/Heavy Armor (depending on what you’re wearing). However, it wasn’t much faster than the Telekinesis method and it was also quite tedious and if you weren’t careful, you could die.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, I came upon, in my opinion, the single fastest way to level up in Skyrim: the Illusion mastery spell Harmony. You can use Muffle to level up your Illusion until you learn Harmony, but once you have Harmony, things go into overdrive. You simply go into the middle of Whiterun (near the plaza is fine, or that big tree in the middle section) and cast Harmony. The spell has a very, very wide AOE so it affects almost all citizens, gaining you ridiculous amounts of Illusions skill levels. A single casting can earn you as much as 50+ Illusion levels. This method is quick, safe, easy, and I wish I had discovered it earlier. As it is, it took me from 68 to 81 in around an hour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting to Level 81, the next problem was actually finding a Legendary Dragon to fight. Supposedly there was one that always spawns at Arcwind Point, but I never got one to spawn there, even after clearing my mods. I tried fast-travelling across dragon burial grounds for a while with no luck. Eventually I managed to randomly find a Legendary Dragon while wandering near Dragon Bridge (that’s where my last save is!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a *lot* of mods installed, mostly additional gameplay/quests, additional items added to the game world, convenience mods (adding map markers etc), or stuff to improve the ambience. I’m not much for stuff like graphics improvements or silly mods that add Thomas the Tank Engine or Macho Man dragons. I did have this mod that added Star Wars lightsabers to the game that I wanted to get rid of but I had so many mods installed I always gave up trying to find it on the list. The best mods I used throughout my 350 hours were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70219/&#34;&gt;Forgotten City&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; this mods add a self-contained quest that involves time travel, groundhog day-style time loops, multiple paths to resolution and investigating a mystery. It was so good it got turned into its own &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/874260/The_Forgotten_City/&#34;&gt;standalone game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=720815421&#34;&gt;Stan Bush combat music&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; basically replaces Skyrim’s combat music Stan Bush’s songs &amp;ldquo;The Touch&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Dare&amp;rdquo; from &lt;em&gt;Transformers The Movie,&lt;/em&gt; giving you a quick adrenaline boost when combat starts. I didn’t actually notice that Skyrim had separate combat music before I installed this mod!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That’s it, out of literally two hundred mods only two stood out for me lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wishlist for Elder Scrolls 6 (or things I wish they had done in Skyrim)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the shovel useful &amp;ndash; it’s weird that there’s a shovel object in the game but it’s not really used for anything, not even as a weapon (I’m sure there’s mods that do that), but I was thinking stuff like buried treasure quests could require you to have a shovel to dig up chests or maybe you can randomly dig in the dirt and hope for goodies (one of the Zelda games did this AFAICR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mountain climbing &amp;ndash; okay, this wish is straight from Breath of the Wild. One of the best things about BOTW was the ability to climb anywhere, a refreshing addition to an open world overworld after Skyrim’s &amp;ldquo;How the heck do I get to the top of this mountain&amp;rdquo; challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More immersion in the Hearthfire DLC &amp;ndash; don’t get me wrong, I liked the Hearthfire DLC, it added a nice opportunity for role-playing with the chance to get married and adopt kids, makes for some nice stories and &lt;a href=&#34;https://tumblr.roytang.net/post/174535189435/playing-skyrim-i-have-my-wife-aela-and-adopted&#34;&gt;fun moments like this&lt;/a&gt;. After a while everything falls into a rut though, it would have been nice if they had expanded the Hearthfire content with some additional radiant quests. Some random ideas: Your wife or one of your kids goes missing, you have to find her; bandits threaten your house and you and your family have to defend it; you gave one of your kids two many daggers and now he accidentally stabbed one of his friends; your entire house has vanished along with your family! It has been teleported somewhere!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually just more radiant quests in general would have been nice for a bit more variance (I’m not sure if I will ever be satisfied). I think there’s already mods that do this, but I never tried them out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to take over a fort after you clear it. Skyrim has a lot of small forts or buildings held by bandits or whatever, it would have been a nice alternative to buying a house, after you clear a bandit the Jarl of the containing hold offers you a chance to buy/earn the title for the hold. Once you own a hold, whenever you recruit new followers you can choose to send them to the hold instead of following you around, and same as the house you could build improvements like a smith, stables, etc, and earn money from shops maybe?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have the Legendary Edition on Steam (free upgrade since I had the DLCs), but I don’t think I have the patience to go through the entire game again. The size of the game and the excellent mod community mean one could very well play Skyrim forever, especially since Bethesda tells us &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-elder-scrolls-6/elder-scrolls-6-next-console-generation&#34;&gt;The Elder Scrolls 6 is still a ways away&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, there are still a lot of other games to play, and now I’m finally able to uninstall Skyrim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attached to this post are a dump of my Steam screenshots folder. (These used to be embedded via an &lt;a href=&#34;//imgur.com/a/ZWNxtnz&#34;&gt;Imgur album&lt;/a&gt;, but I edited the post on 2020-Sep to embed them here instead, for reasons.)&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(&amp;ldquo;Late Game Review&amp;rdquo; because I&amp;rsquo;m trying to play through games on my ridiculously old backlog, so these games are pretty old)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my digital PS3 copy of &lt;em&gt;Ni No Kuni&lt;/em&gt; during some kind of PSN sale a while back for like $10 and seeing as how the sequel came out recently, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d better finish the first game before my rarely-used PS3 decides to die on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the game was great and I enjoyed it enough to go for the platinum (post-game was a bit grindy though):&lt;/p&gt;











&lt;a href=&#34;#ed40962d3c92d7f644de56616ab1d035-lightbox&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/10/late-game-review-ni-no-kuni-wrath-of-the-white-witch-2013/DopmwwhUcAMCTak.jpg-large_hu00624a9d56d0f06fdbe8477345c3c7f9_109019_300x0_resize_q75_box.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;tn&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;ed40962d3c92d7f644de56616ab1d035-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/10/late-game-review-ni-no-kuni-wrath-of-the-white-witch-2013/DopmwwhUcAMCTak.jpg-large.jpg&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;13 Oct 2018 1:00am&#34;&gt;13 Oct 2018 1:00am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visually, it&amp;rsquo;s a very pretty game, animated Ghibli-style. The combat system is basically Pokemon. So yes, it&amp;rsquo;s Ghibli+Pokemon. Pokemon in this game are called &amp;ldquo;familiars&amp;rdquo; and each party member can have up to 3 familiars ready to fight in battle. The party members can fight directly as well, but most of the time it&amp;rsquo;s a better idea to let your familiars go at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, the grindiest part of the post-game was collecting all the familiars. Ok, not all of them, the achievement only required 250 different species captured, but that&amp;rsquo;s a helluva lot. During the normal main game run, I only captured a bit less than 100 different species. It was made more grindy by the fact that there&amp;rsquo;s no mechanism for trying to capture the familiars (i.e. pokeballs), you basically just have to beat them in battle and whenever you beat one, there&amp;rsquo;s like a 2-8% chance that you will get an opportunity to recruit it. Thankfully, you can shortcut the grind a bit by collecting the lower level ones and using metamorphoses (basically pokemon evolutions) to get the higher level ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story feels like it&amp;rsquo;s targeted towards children, so it has a kind of fairy tale feel, and the world is very bright and cheerful (mostly) and there&amp;rsquo;s things like a kingdom where the king is a giant cat, and so on. Not that the plot is simple mind you &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s quite a bit or parallel worlds, a tiny bit of time travel, and a few plot twists thrown in (although you might have seen them coming).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of the game has to be all the puns. Many of the familiars have some sort of pun involved in their name, like there&amp;rsquo;s a dog familiar called &amp;ldquo;Ruffian&amp;rdquo;; there&amp;rsquo;s an egg-shaped familiar with a pharoah mask called &amp;ldquo;Eggyptian&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s a cat thief familiar called &amp;ldquo;Purrloiner&amp;rdquo;, who evolves into a &amp;ldquo;Cutpurrse&amp;rdquo;, and can then evolve into another form which you can fight on the seas called a &amp;ldquo;Puss in Boats&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s a sheep familiar called &amp;ldquo;Baatender&amp;rdquo; who can evolve into a &amp;ldquo;Baabarian&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s a familiar that wears a turban and he&amp;rsquo;s called a &amp;ldquo;Turbandit&amp;rdquo;, and he has higher forms called &amp;ldquo;Turban Myth&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Turban Legend&amp;rdquo;. Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ll stop before I enumerate them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a few other systems familiar to JRPG players &amp;ndash; crafting, a casino, farming enemies for drops, bounty hunts, errand boards and so on on. Oh and some nonsense about fixing people&amp;rsquo;s hearts by finding people willing to contribute attributes like confidence and kindness and whatnot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all a very fun game and something I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have gotten off my backlog! Not sure if I&amp;rsquo;ll have time to play the second game though, maybe in another five years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Thanks to the free promo on Humble, I played through Orwell today. Story-focused game about gov surveillance, very well done&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I think I made the most of the BBTag free weekend lol. Fun game, a lot easier to get into than the other BBs, though I&amp;rsquo;m still pretty bad at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also despite the #bbtag free weekend, I couldnt find a ranked match (ended up playing in casual lobbies instead). Is no one playing this on steam?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Finally finished Twilight Princess HD, which I started back in January. All hearts, 51/60 Poes, 37/50 stamps. With this, the only console Zeldas I haven&amp;rsquo;t finished are Zelda 2 (which I have on 3DS) and Skyward Sword (maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll give up on this as I dislike the Wiimote lol)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Finished Tomb Raider. Not gonna go for achievement completion since there&amp;rsquo;s multiplayer stuff. 100% collectibles is good enough!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;My first Persona game was Persona 4 Golden on the Vita &amp;ndash; a fantastic game. After that I dived into Persona 3 Portable and eventually the spin-off games Persona 4 Arena (and Ultimax) and Persona Q on 3DS. So it was no surprise that one of the game releases I was most looking forward to this year would be the next numbered game in the series: Persona 5 on the Playstation 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like P4G before it, the focus is on the school life of a young man forced into a new environment, interspersed with some good old JRPG dungeon crawling. You meet a ragtag group of misfits and somehow band together to save all of Japanese society from itself. Or something to that extent. This is just an excuse to dump some screens of P5, so let&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;#resources&#34;&gt;get that out of the way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JRPG side streamlines a lot of the problems from P4G: the main story dungeons are hand-built JRPG style dungeons and there are save points in between to make dying not so much of a pain. Even on normal difficulty, I still managed to die a few times &amp;ndash; notably to those Angel enemies that tend to suicide when low on life. And they brought back Persona negotiation! I didn&amp;rsquo;t appreciate this too much in &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei IV&lt;/em&gt; as it felt a bit obtuse there, but here the Persona&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;personality&amp;rdquo; is shown which makes it easier to figure out the &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be leading a team of thieves there&amp;rsquo;s also a bit of a &amp;ldquo;stealth system&amp;rdquo; while dungeon crawling. It&amp;rsquo;s not a very deep stealth system, basically just hide behind corners and ambush enemies to gain battle advantage. The only problem is that the camera and the controls don&amp;rsquo;t always agree with your stealth plans, and sometimes the wrong button press can lead you to disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Phantom Thieves story is okay, although most of the plot is telegraphed ahead of time. I kind of liked P4G&amp;rsquo;s big murder mystery where you had to figure out who among your confidants was a big ‘ol bad guy. Here in P5, it&amp;rsquo;s painfully obvious who sold you out, even if you hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed his &amp;ldquo;mistake&amp;rdquo; early on. That being said, there is a surprise twist near the end that caught me by surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to P4G, Persona 5 comes out at the height of social media, so while I like the P4G&amp;rsquo;s battle theme a bit better, P5&amp;rsquo;s battle music has managed to become a meme of its own:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WUWQFnC2zqU&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must&amp;rsquo;ve seen this video at least 50 times now due to some of my friends (you know who you are).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I dislike about the Persona series is that because of the time management aspect of the game, a lot of things are missable. Since I tend to play RPGs without any guides or walkthroughs the first time around, it&amp;rsquo;s problematic for me. This means that on my first run through I missed completing the Confidants/Social Links, even though when I started the run I told myself I&amp;rsquo;d prioritize them over other activities. Definitely need a second run for the platinum. (Of course, I have yet to platinum P4G either due to a mistake I made during the second run~)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion: Despite (or maybe because of?) it&amp;rsquo;s ridiculousness, Persona 5 is a great game. Story is tight, and the dungeon crawling has been streamlined a lot. That being said, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely not a game for everyone, mostly because of the style. If you dislike Japanese stuff or anime or anything turn-based, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely not for you. Go play Call of Duty or something. For everyone else, enjoy one of the year&amp;rsquo;s best JRPGs (sorry FF15!)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This game is educational, I didn&amp;amp;rsquo;t actually know this before.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When dungeon crawling, you can summon mighty persona in battle! They&amp;amp;rsquo;re like Pokemon, only way more phallic.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;With The FFXIII trilogy not being particularly well-received and FFXIV being an MMO, Final Fantasy XV has been a long awaited as the next mainline single-player game in the much-acclaimed series. This review will have minor spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2017/03/review-final-fantasy-xv/mxS7hvb.jpg&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;18 Mar 2017 1:30am&#34;&gt;18 Mar 2017 1:30am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FFXV follows the story of Noctis, prince of Lucis and his band of brothers (okay they&amp;rsquo;re not really brothers, but they might as well be). They&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be on a road trip to get Noctis married, but things happen along the way and eventually they have to figure out how to liberate their homeland from The Evil Empire. That&amp;rsquo;s the backstory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story as presented in the game has a few problems. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of significant back story and goings-on that happen off-camera:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s both a feature-length movie (Kingsglaive) and a six-episode anime (Brotherhood) that expounds on the four main characters&amp;rsquo; backgrounds and how the current political situation got to where it is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s supposedly a whole effort by minor characters like Cor to organize a resistance against the Empire, but we&amp;rsquo;re never really exposed to it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then there&amp;rsquo;s Lunafreya, Noctis&amp;rsquo; betrothed, who goes off and does her own stuff to try to undermine the Empire and supposedly help Noctis, but for most of the game it&amp;rsquo;s never really explained what exactly she&amp;rsquo;s doing or how it&amp;rsquo;s relevant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of your friends, Gladio, goes off on a short sidequest of his own and vanishes for a while, and it&amp;rsquo;s never explained WTH that was about. Presumably it will be covered in a future DLC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem is that Noctis and the gang spend most of the game sort of lollygagging around enjoying their road trip without much sense of urgency. Understandably they wanted to present an open world this time (since much of the criticism of FFXIII was for its linearity), but the problem is that the open world is filled with a lot of frivolous things that don&amp;rsquo;t seem particularly urgent given the fate of the world being at stake. I mean, the party spends a lot of time camping out, cooking food, fishing, taking pictures, driving around looking for auto parts, and so on. The sense of urgency is not apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose the lack of urgency is an acceptable trade-off for the open world, but even for the supposed main story quests in the earlier chapters, it&amp;rsquo;s not immediately clear how they serve to help you overcome the Empire. I feel like there should have been more story quests related to helping establish a resistance and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The later chapters narrow down the open world significantly, and the second half of the game takes place outside the main continent where there is significantly less freedom to explore. It feels a bit like they spent a lot of their design budget on the open world half and so just restricted the second half to the meaty story parts. Reminds me a bit of Xenogears disc 2!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the chapters near the end was also executed very poorly. To establish a sense of tension, most of the systems you had been relying on throughout the game are taken away from you. While this would have been okay for a short segment, the chapter goes on a bit too long and ends up being far too tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did find myself surprised by events leading up to the final chapter, although I felt like it was another wasted opportunity. The final chapter gives us a glimpse at a different version of the open world but never really let us see most of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ending itself was bittersweet (and easily trolled haha), but I found it an acceptable ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;lightbox&#34; id=&#34;789f63e586a9f7d449e790cce4b79cef-lightbox&#34; style=&#34;display: none;&#34;&gt;

    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2017/03/review-final-fantasy-xv/RTcRL3u.jpg&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;lightbox_overlay&#34;&gt;

    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;18 Mar 2017 1:30am&#34;&gt;18 Mar 2017 1:30am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I found the main cast of Noctis, Ignis, Gladio and Prompto to have engaging personalities, they don&amp;rsquo;t really have much backstory in-game (most of the character backstories are in Brotherhood). In fact, later on, a startling revelation is made about one of them and none of them really bat an eye at all. It was in the sense of &amp;ldquo;hey, we don&amp;rsquo;t care about that, we&amp;rsquo;re your friends,&amp;rdquo; but it still felt like something that should have been explored further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interaction among the group is great though. They regularly banter and tease each other even during combat. It really felt like they were a group of long-time friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Combat **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m an old-school FF fan, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be the first to admit I miss ye olde active time battle. FFXV&amp;rsquo;s battles take place entirely in real-time, with the player controlling Noctis and the other characters controlled by AI. The AI control goes about as well as you could expect, they do fine against weak enemies but against tougher battles you find yourself constantly having to help them with potions or other items. You can command them to do special attacks when available, and they will participate in combo attacks when possible, but for the most part it&amp;rsquo;s just Noctis warping and striking.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combat is fluid and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of movement and jumping around and looking for opportunities to strike from behind. Early on you are discouraged from wandering around at night as the enemies might be too high level, but the combat system is set up such that most tough battles can be overcome simply by having enough recovery items around. I only got a game over once, early in the game when didn&amp;rsquo;t know what I was doing and I tried wandering at night and promptly got squashed by an iron giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Open World&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open world gives the party a lot to do. There&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;hunts&amp;rdquo; dished out by people in diners (basically quests to go kill a specific bunch of monsters) and other side quests given out by various characters. There&amp;rsquo;s a fishing minigame, because apparently it&amp;rsquo;s a hobby of Noctis. The fishing minigame is okay, except I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the patience to try to get the most difficult fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;rsquo;s the photos and the food porn. A lot of pandering to the modern-day youths here, I&amp;rsquo;m surprised instagram hasn&amp;rsquo;t been invented in their world. Cooking is Ignis&amp;rsquo; specialty, and the game renders each dish really well, sometimes enough to make you hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the photos are the specialty of Prompto. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those things that feels really frivolous in the game. Every time you camp you can browse pictures that Prompto has taken so you can save them for later viewing. A later patch provided a photo mode that you can control directly. There&amp;rsquo;s an entire reddit thread about how players have snapped more pics for this game than for their own vacations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m no exception. Exporting a lot of photos is a pain though, as there is no batch export option in-game. Attached to this post are a sampling of the photos I got (a bunch of them are from achievements).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of achievements, I was a touch disappointed with FFXV&amp;rsquo;s achievement set. I got the Platinum trophy, but I felt like it was a bit too easy, as there was still a lot of things to do in the game outside of the achievements. I don&amp;rsquo;t want annoying grindy achievements, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want them to be too easy and &amp;ldquo;no challenge&amp;rdquo; either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other stuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had this weird Chocobo carnival DLC that somehow takes place in another timeline or something LOL. IDK how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that the more action-oriented combat system is indicative of where SE plans to take the series moving forward, there&amp;rsquo;s still a significant amount of nostalgia in the game for old-schoolers to appreciate. Callouts range from Prompto humming the classic victory fanfare after the battle to 2d sprites in the store menus jumping up in down to indicate which characters can equip each item. Classic FF beasties like the Malboro still make an appearance (and are still a pain to fight!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weirdest thing overall has to be the Cup Noodles thing! They had some sort of tie-up with Nissin and Cup Noodles is one of the meals your party can have in the game and Gladio is obsessed with them. Later on you even get a quest to try to find a way to improve on Cup Noodles and it ends with the characters saying there&amp;rsquo;s really no beating the original since it has a perfect mix of ingredients already. I feel like the VA&amp;rsquo;s really enjoyed doing those lines haha.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I had a bunch of complaints and nitpicks but to be honest, I enjoyed the game. There was a lot of gameplay, some seriously though battles and some annoying dungeons that took forever, but I finished most of it and got the platinum in under a month. Nowadays for an RPG that&amp;rsquo;s very quick for me, an indication of how much I liked the game. There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch more content planned for it, including DLC story packs for each of the other main characters, and high-end boss fights and what not. Not sure if I&amp;rsquo;d still play those since there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more RPGs on the horizon (2017 is a good year for RPG gamers.) But if Final Fantasy XV is the next step for the series moving forward, I find it acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I might be done with Stardew Valley. Game was great, but getting the last few achievements would be too grindy for me&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/05/hearthstone-vs-mtg/&#34;&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;, I tried out a couple of other digital CCGs: &lt;a href=&#34;http://store.steampowered.com/app/429680/&#34;&gt;Spellweaver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://store.steampowered.com/app/531640/&#34;&gt;Eternal&lt;/a&gt;, but neither one hooked me. The one I enjoyed the most and did pick up to play regularly was &lt;a href=&#34;https://duelyst.com/&#34;&gt;Duelyst&lt;/a&gt;. So this review is written from the perspective of someone who has played both Magic the Gathering (MTG) and Hearthstone (HS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearthstone, Spellweaver and Eternal played like digital MTG with some advantages, as I outlined in the HS post linked above. Duelyst keeps many of the same elements and advantages, but adds an extra dimension. Besides being a card game, Duelyst is also a board game.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Board game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a game of Duelyst your General (the analogue to Hearthstone&amp;rsquo;s hero) and his minions are played into a 9×5 board. Minions can only be summoned on empty spaces adjacent to one of your units. During your turn, each unit can either: attack an adjacent enemy; or move up to two spaces, then attack an adjacent enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a board and unit movement greatly enhances the &amp;ldquo;positioning matters&amp;rdquo; mechanic as compared to Hearthstone. In HS, it only mattered whether minions were adjacent, to the left or to the right. In Duelyst, you can position minions to prevent enemies from reaching your General, or to restrict enemies from moving completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means a number of spells and abilities care about positioning too. Each of the available Generals has a Bloodborn spell (BBS), the equivalent of Hearthstone&amp;rsquo;s Hero Power. One of the Generals has a BBS which allows her to deal damage to all enemy units in the same column as the opposing General. This means you have to be careful where you place your minions whenever her BBS is active! There are spells that affect a small area (2×2 or 3×3 and so on). There are spells that care about adjacency (&amp;ldquo;Destroy target minion that is not nearby any general&amp;rdquo;). And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factions and Generals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearthstone has different heroes, and each hero has a different card pool available. By contrast, Duelyst has factions and Generals. Each faction has its own card pool, and of course there is a global or &amp;ldquo;neutral&amp;rdquo; card pool as well. Each faction also has two Generals, each of which has a different BBS. The factions and Generals encourage a lot of different playstyles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some factions like the Songhai are more focused on spell-based damage and backstabs. The Lyonar focus on cheap, efficient creatures. Vetruvian has obelisks that can generate temporary minions. Abyssian focuses on swarm tactics and shadow creep. The Vanar rely on placement and trickery. My favorite General, the Magmar Vaath, likes to go toe-to-toe with the enemy General and &lt;strong&gt;punch him in the face!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, many of Duelyst keywords care about positioning, and thus have no meaningful equivalent in either MTG or HS. Namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Airdrop&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; minions with Airdrop can be summoned anywhere on the board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backstab&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; this unit deals extra damage when attacking from behind (yes, even facing matters!) and doesn&amp;rsquo;t receive a counterattack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blast&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; attack hits all enemies in the same row or column&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flying&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; may move anywhere on the battlefield&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frenzy&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; normal attacks hit ALL adjacent enemies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infiltrate&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; gains bonus effect if its on the enemy&amp;rsquo;s starting side of the board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Provoke **&amp;ndash; somewhat like HS&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Taunt. A&lt;/strong&gt;djacent enemies cannot move and &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; attack a Provoke unit if there is one nearby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ranged&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; can attack from anywhere on the board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shadow Creep&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; this is a modifier that can be added to board tiles. An enemy standing on Shadow Creep takes 1 damage at the end of the Shadow Creep owner&amp;rsquo;s turn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Zeal **&amp;ndash; gains bonus effect as long as it&amp;rsquo;s next to the General&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duelyst also has a number of keywords that are analogous to abilities in MTG and HS. &lt;strong&gt;Rush&lt;/strong&gt; is the same as MTG&amp;rsquo;s **Haste **and HS&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Charge&lt;/strong&gt;. **Opening Gambit **and &lt;strong&gt;Dying Wish&lt;/strong&gt; are the same as HS&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Battlecry&lt;/strong&gt; and **Deathrattle. **(I worry that at some point new cardgames will run out of names for &amp;ldquo;enters the field&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;leaves the field&amp;rdquo;.) And so on &amp;ndash; no need to cover everything here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skill Level, Competitive Play and F2P&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The added dimension of positioning means that Duelyst is strictly more skill-based than HS. This is obvious if you note that there are a lot more choices for where to place minions. Hearthstone is also more reliant on RNG than Duelyst is, although I can&amp;rsquo;t say that will hold for the future. I enjoy some level of RNG as it creates variance, but the randomness means a higher chance of losing due to bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find competitive play on the ranked ladders for both Duelyst and Hearthstone to be about the same. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying either meta is healthy, but as I see it there are more viable decks in Duelyst ladder as compared to HS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;ve already spent a bunch of money in MTG, I don&amp;rsquo;t like spending money on digital card games. So for both HS and Duelyst, I am strictly free-to-play (F2P). Both games offer similar monetization models (pay money for booster packs/cosmetics) but I was able to get further up the ladder in competitive Duelyst.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my first full month (December), I was already able to get to Duelyst&amp;rsquo;s Gold Division. This should be similar to around rank 10 in HS. After a lot (and I mean &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt;) of grinding from Diamond rank, I managed to hit the S-Rank Division last month. This is the equivalent of HS&amp;rsquo;s Legend rank. The highest rank I ever got in HS was around rank 6 or 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I think Duelyst is more skill-based than HS, why did I find it easier to get to S-Rank than HS&amp;rsquo;s Legend rank? Two reasons come to mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I found Duelyst games more fun&lt;/strong&gt;. This means I was playing Duelyst on a daily basis since it started. At the start, I played regularly because I wanted to get Steam Achievement completion. But I found myself enjoying the game and continuing to play even after that. There are also a lot more variance in decks being played on the Duelyst ladder. By comparison, HS ladder seemed to be almost 50% the one best deck (used to be Midrange Shaman, nowadays Pirate Aggro&amp;hellip; ) while the other 50% are trying to beat it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was easier to get the powerful cards and build the tier one decks in Duelyst&lt;/strong&gt;. The pricing of packs is about the same (100 gold), but on average I could earn around 100-150 gold per day from Duelyst&amp;rsquo;s quests, compared to 40-60 for HS. The drop rates for Legendaries (highest rarity in both games) is higher in Duelyst as well. Unlike HS, Legendaries in Duelyst are not restricted to one per deck, you can play as many as three. This meant you need more of them, which annoyed me at first. But I think that&amp;rsquo;s counterbalanced by the higher drop rate. For comparison, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing HS for more than a year and have only gotten two premium (golden) Legendaries. Three months into Duelyst and I&amp;rsquo;ve opened the same amount of premium (prismatic) Legendaries. (Well, this comparison may be skewed since I open more Duelyst packs due to the increased gold rate.) Another factor was the Bloodborn expansion, which you could complete by playing enough to grind 3900 gold. That expansion came out in December, and I completed the set early in January. This set gave me access to many useful cards that were important in the meta. This allowed me to build a tier one deck and reach S-Rank in January. Even after that deck was nerfed, I was also easily able to shift to another tier one deck from another faction. In HS, I still haven&amp;rsquo;t found a new competitive deck after Midrange Shaman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I told myself I would stop playing Duelyst after I completed the Steam Achievements. Then I said I would stop playing after I got to S-Rank. But I&amp;rsquo;m still playing it now. By comparison, I now launch HS once or twice a week, and I don&amp;rsquo;t clear the quests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duelyst is still a young game &amp;ndash; the second expansion just came out last December. So in the future it may yet be plagued with the problems Hearthstone currently has. The developers have shown themselves to be responsive in nerfing problematic cards and shaking up the meta though. Whether they are able to keep this up remains to be seen. In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;m willing to keep playing as long as the game is still enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I also finished Persona 3 Portable today (been playing it on and off since Feb 2015). I figured I should clear it off my backlog before P5 next year. Didnt manage a completionist run though&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Just in time for the end of the year, I finally finished Xenoblade Chronicles X, which I started playing around the first week of August (5 months!), with 120+ hours of game time. The game doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the best graphics (WiiU, etc), but I really like how it looks and how the world is built and all the different environments and the weird and sometimes absurdly large beasts.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a whole lot of stuff to do in-game. It plays mostly like a single-player MMO, with party members that act on their own and most skills on a cooldown. There&amp;rsquo;s a ridiculous number of quests and items to grind for, I&amp;rsquo;m even tempted to still continue with the post-game content (if only I didn&amp;rsquo;t have FFXV waiting for me!), as I&amp;rsquo;m only at around 70% completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story was okay, at many points well-told and hitting a lot of emotional highs (although some of the characters felt a bit over-acted). The ending was&amp;hellip;  well, kind of sequel-baiting. A mixture of disappointment and confusion and hope haha. I don&amp;rsquo;t imagine that they&amp;rsquo;ll have a sequel set in the same universe/timeline, so it felt a bit like they made up a ridiculous explanation that would attempt to explain some of the nonsense that happens in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attached some screenshots from the game!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;So I managed to &amp;ldquo;platinum&amp;rdquo; Rocket League on Steam (all nonDLC achievements) despite not being very good at it. Goes to show how easy it is to get into, but I guess I&amp;rsquo;m done with the game for now&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Finally finished Wind Waker HD, great game. Didn&amp;rsquo;t bother with the completion, there&amp;rsquo;s just too much other stuff to do. If the game had achievements, I&amp;rsquo;d think about it lol&lt;/p&gt;
