<p>It sounds like it would be a &ldquo;feel bad&rdquo; mechanic for many people and thus would have difficulty being mass-market successful</p>

<p>I like interesting battle systems. Is there some place that documents what are the best things about the Pokemon battle system for someone who doesn&rsquo;t play the games?</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>They don&rsquo;t feel out of vogue. Off the top of my head, turn-based games I played within the last year: Persona Q, Disgaea 4, Divinity:OS. Bravely Default, Fire Emblem: Awakening, X-Com, Civ 5 (okay, I play Civ every year). I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s more I&rsquo;m forgetting.</p>
<p>Edit: I also played Banner Saga and Shadowrun Returns Dragonfall, thanks to the replies for reminding me</p>

<p>I was around 10 when I played and finished the first Legend of Zelda; probably 15 or 16 when I beat A Link To The Past. ALBW is easier than both of those, I think. You might just not be giving younger you enough credit, kids are surprisingly good at games.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Time and effort and cost (assets, etc.) and the story all factor in. Some stories are stronger when told in a straight/linear fashion.</p>
<p>The term laziness here upsets me for some reason (nothing personal). Might be because I&rsquo;m a programmer and I understand what it means to need to cut content or features or avoid feature-creep in order to meet budgets and schedules. It&rsquo;s not like &ldquo;branching paths&rdquo; are on a standard RPG checklist and developers are just &ldquo;naw, fuck that&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That being said, there are still a lot of very nonlinear RPGs around. The Fallout series and the Elder Scrolls games come to mind, and I think the Witcher series offers a lot of choice too.</p>

<p>I was playing LBP and I was thinking it would be pretty sweet to have a level editor and community-created levels for a Mario game. It would legitimize all those romhacks that create fun or impossible stages, etc. Why hasn&rsquo;t Nintendo done something like this?</p>

<p>While I have fond memories of it (and still have a copy at home), it kind of bothers me that late game always devolved to having one uber-hero with a stack of doom and a bunch of other heroes to assist him by moving troops and items and resources around. I&rsquo;m not sure if this has changed in 5 or 6.</p>

<p>Turn-based RPGs, for example, really have nothing to show in terms of gameplay. I suppose responsive menus and quick responses to button presses, but past that it gets pretty hard to improve the gameplay aspect of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wat. I take it these type of games aren&rsquo;t really your style. Skill trees and builds, ability choices, enemy balancing, equipment choices are all gameplay elements.</p>

<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s a lot more assets that are needed given the amount of content typically packed into an RPG. That means a lot more story, characters, items, balancing, models, voices, videos, etc compared to something like an FPS, which translates to higher effort and thus higher costs. Is this a valid assumption? If yes, then why do companies keep making RPGs, are they more profitable than other genres? If no, what other factors go into the cost of other genres?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I consider myself ok in terms of strategy like spacing, pokes, mind games and the like, but my problem in general is poor execution; it&rsquo;s most probably because i dont want to put in the effort to memorize and practice combo strings and stuff. Like in sf4 i can pull of fadc&rsquo;s occasionally in training mode, but i dont have any hope of pulling it off in the middle of a heated match. For this reason i tend to rely more on short bnb combos</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Sid Meier once said that a game is a &ldquo;series of interesting decisions&rdquo;. When your decisions have no consequence, the decisions become less interesting and meaningful. If your decisions don&rsquo;t have consequences, why bother having the decisions at all? Why not just give the player everything all at once, since that&rsquo;s what it essentially comes down to when you can respec at will?</p>
<p>I remember when I was playing Kingdom of Amalur, you could respec at any time for a small gold cost. The gold cost increases gradually every time, but it never becomes a very high value such that respeccing was practically free. That means there was no point investing in the Crafting skills since at any point you could decide &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do all my crafting now&rdquo;, respec to the best crafting build, craft your stuff, then respec back to what you normally have.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>It&rsquo;s a problem of balance. If the RPG isn&rsquo;t well-balanced, it may punish the player for decisions made early on (i.e. he chose an ability that didn&rsquo;t turn out to be as useful as he expected), and having no respec option at all locks him into that choice. I agree that there needs to be some level of consequence to your choices and we can&rsquo;t expect the game to be balanced 100% with regards to character choices, but the problem is that for a new player playing a new game, he will almost invariably be unable to judge correctly whether certain choices are good or bad.</p>
<p>So my answer is: I&rsquo;d prefer not having respec options, but I understand the need for them. Maybe not have respeccing be so easy or something would be a good idea (i.e. need to complete some quest that gets harder every time you want to respec)</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>These are all very different games. Super Meat Boy and VVVVV focus on difficulty and twitch-gaming, while Braid and Trine are more of puzzle platformers. AYIM I didn&rsquo;t like at all lol.</p>
<p>When I say a Mario-like game, I mean something that focuses on exploration I guess? Trine is probably the closest among the ones you mentioned.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m asking about this because I have friends who got the WiiU simply because none of the other consoles has a Mario game. Sony has Little Big Planet trying to be the platformer of choice for the PS3/Vita, but that doesn&rsquo;t really seem to come close to the Mario experience. Xbox has&hellip;well I don&rsquo;t even know if there are platformers on Xbox. If you really want to play Mario or something that provides a reasonably close experience, are you really forced to go Nintendo?</p>

<p>How is that relevant to the question? The same thing can be said for franchises like Call of Duty, Madden, etc.</p>
<p>I <strong>like</strong> Mario games, I&rsquo;d love if it something similar came out on the PS3/Vita</p>

Why is this?&#39; on /r/truegaming</a>:

<p>I&rsquo;m in SE Asia. Outside of shops, I&rsquo;ve never seen a 360 in person. I don&rsquo;t personally know anybody who owns one. Of the gamers with consoles at the office where I work 50-70% have PS3s, while the rest have Wiis.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Saying all games should have a certain trait is a bit like saying all movies should be the same genre. It&rsquo;s ok that there are games that are hard - theyre not for casuals. And complaining that not everybody gets to experience those games or their content is a it like complaining that not everybody gets to enjoy twilight. Surprise - different people like different things!</p>
