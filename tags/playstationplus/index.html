<div class="content e-content">

<p>AFAIK only the console where the account is set as primary can that account&rsquo;s games be played by other accounts.</p>
<p>For cross-region compatibility of game DLC, it depends on the game.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Okay, the sale has been up for a few days, but I still can&rsquo;t decide what to get, if any. I have $20 available in the PSN wallet to spend, but I already have a ridiculously long backlog and next to no free space on my Vita memcard.</p>
<p>Here are the games I&rsquo;m considering:</p>
<p>Tales of Symphonia Chronicles - the price is really good, but I can borrow this from a friend</p>
<p>MGS HD Collection (Vita) - I can borrow the PS3 version from a friend, however I generally have more time/am more inclined to play on a Vita</p>
<p>Muramasa - looks interesting, but I&rsquo;m worried it will be free on Plus soon</p>
<p>Ys: Memories of Celceta - a lot of people recommend it, but it looks like I might be able to get a used physical copy at around the sale price</p>
<p>Tactics Ogre - it seems like it would be nice to have this on Vita, but I have it on PSP (I think my PSP is still working&hellip;haven&rsquo;t touched it in a while)</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>

<p>If Muramasa is on this sale, does that mean it&rsquo;s less likely to be free on PS+ anytime soon?</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Seems we got the preview pretty early this month? I usually expect it on the last week before we get the first free game.</p>
<p>This month is okay (yay, Skullgirls!), but I wonder what&rsquo;s the chance of getting Metal Gear HD Collection or UMvC3 on the PSVita for PSPlus?</p>

<p>I would suggest using a US PSN account instead of Asian. Aside from online via Amazon (I have a friend with a US credit card buy the cards for me), Datablitz also sells PSN cards.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>A bit unrelated and assuming this &ldquo;free multiplayer weekend&rdquo; promo is over: I don&rsquo;t have a PS4 yet, but I assume it supports multiple user accounts same as the PS3? My account has PS+, but my brother&rsquo;s does not. If we both have accounts on the same PS4, will my brother be able to play multiplayer from his account?</p>

<p>This is untrue, at least for the PS3. Any account on the PS3 can run any content download by other accounts on the same machine. Source: I have 2 brothers and we each have a couple of accounts, only I have PS+ and they can run the downloads fine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is there anyway to know what games are upcoming in the U.S. store?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only for the coming month, since they announce all of the month&rsquo;s free games on the first week.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if I buy a U.S. subscription, and I later buy a Europe one when the U.S. expires, can I still acces my games I bought with the U.S. account?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it possible to buy a code in stores in the EU and use it on the U.S. store?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The code you buy would have to specifically be for the US store; ask the clerk at the store you&rsquo;re buying at to give you a US code/card.</p>

<p>You can make an NA account from anywhere, but if you plan to use credit card payments for the store, it will only accept cards with a US address. I&rsquo;m from SE Asia and I have an NA account, I use prepaid PSN cards for buying stuff.</p>
<p>Edit: and yes, if you have both the NA account and your main account on the same PS3, your main account can play downloads from the NA account.</p>

<p>You can get what is currently free. As long as you have &ldquo;purchased&rdquo; a free game, it stays in your download list and you can redownload it any time as long as your subscription is active, even after it rotates from the IGC.</p>
<p>This should be in the sidebar, it gets asked all the time.</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1ebnjw/question_about_regions_moving_overseas/">&#39;Question about regions- moving overseas.&#39; on /r/PlayStationPlus</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Physical purchases (vita cartridges/ps3 discs) are not region locked, you can play games you bought from any physical store anywhere.</p>
<p>For PS+, you&rsquo;ll need a Sony Entertainment Network (SEN) account. Your account will have a country associated with it at creation time and this cannot be changed later.</p>
<p>Online purchases made through the PSN store are tied to your SEN account and the Vita can only have one account active. If you will be in Canada long-term, I suggest that you get a North American PS+ code with your Vita and create a North American (Canada or US) account. However, I don&rsquo;t know if the NA Plus offerings are better than whatever Australian accounts get.</p>
<p>Additionally, I think the PSN stores will only accept credit cards from the same region (this is true for the US store), so it if you plan to make online purchases, take this into account.</p>
<p>DLC for some games is region-locked. For example: a region 1 (North America) copy of Street Fighter x Tekken will only work with DLC downloaded/purchased from a US or Canada PSN store.</p>
