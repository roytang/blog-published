            &lt;p&gt;Sorry if this is dumb: you know sometimes when you build a district but placing it has a warning like “this will remove woods” or such, does doing this have a chopping bonus too? or it has to be chopped with a builder first?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;In that case, what effect does ability have in the city he was activated in? I initially assumed it was a global effect like you mentioned but then there was a second activation available so I got confused&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking that in anticipation of Civ 6, I would play a game each of Civ 1-5. I have 3-5 on Steam, but any copy of Civ 1 and 2 have been lost to the sands of time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been travelling for a few months and have been playing Civ V on my laptop where I already sunk 300+hours into my desktop back home. Will any mines I built/forests I chopped/etc count towards my totals back home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I would assume the Gold Edition Upgrade is for people who dont yet have G&amp;amp;K and the other current DLC, so that they can upgrade to Gold edition without having to rebuy everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to disable those leader messages that I don&amp;rsquo;t really have to respond to? Like when they denounce me, or &amp;ldquo;I see you&amp;rsquo;ve become friends with [country]&amp;rdquo;? Also the CS popup when you first meet them. It&amp;rsquo;s like those things can just be little notifications on the right side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does having a GS build an Academy add resources on the tile to your trade network? I put an Academy on a Gems tile but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have Mining yet, I assumed I would just get the happiness bonus once I got Mining, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be travelling for a bit, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a PDF or something else (maybe a single web page that I can save) that I can read offline while I&amp;rsquo;m travelling. I&amp;rsquo;m looking for the sort of thing that I can read off the civfanatics forums, but I dont want to have to save each thread individually? Just thought I&amp;rsquo;d post here on the off chance that someone one knows something like this somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d just delete the extra workers and keep maybe 2-3 that I can sleep somewhere safe. (Depends on your number of cities). You&amp;rsquo;re going to need them again later as tech progresses (new resources become available, or railroads)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it wasn&amp;rsquo;t long ago that I was putting roads/railroads on every tile possible rather than just linking cities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember doing this back in Civ1, because roads/rails gave tiles a trade bonus and there was no maintenance penalty for having too many roads. At that time too, rails cost ZERO movement points, which meant railing my entire continent = units instantly move from one end to the other at will. Good times lol&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a chance to be friendly with them and earn their favor. I usually just say no&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I wish they&amp;rsquo;d add these random events to Civ5, they&amp;rsquo;re really fun.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This is a great idea. I would enjoy marathon, except it takes forever and a half to build anything&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Civ V is a perfectly fine game. It&amp;rsquo;s never been particularly buggy for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I havent played civ5 in a while and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give the latest patch a go. I find that every so often the game hangs between turns - it&amp;rsquo;s stuck with &amp;ldquo;Please wait&amp;rdquo; and the mouseover message says it is waiting for other human players (it&amp;rsquo;s a singleplayer game obviously). It&amp;rsquo;s not that it&amp;rsquo;s just taking too long to complete, it seems to be stuck in some sort of infinite loop. I left it running for 10-15 minutes at one point with no luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When i get to this state I need to load a few turns back and change a few decisions. If I just do the same things, the game will hang again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone encountering this? Not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s a problem with my particular save, gonna try to start another game.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Thanks and upvotes to those who answered. Holy crap that was stupid. I had to reenable auto unit cycling to figure out which unit was holding me up&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I remember back during Civ1, the civilopedia descriptions were in plain text files somewhere in the program directory. I used a bunch of these in a school report I believe.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;In real life, you cannot ask infinite numbers of soldiers or tanks or whatever to occupy the a finite area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single unit in civ represents just enough numbers of that unit that can fully occupy whatever amount of area a single hex represents.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I think there&amp;rsquo;s a wonder that halves the amount of unhappiness generated by the number of cities. Combine that with keeping per-city population low (to reduce unhappiness from total population), it should work.&lt;/p&gt;
