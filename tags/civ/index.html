<div class="content e-content">

<p>Sorry if this is dumb: you know sometimes when you build a district but placing it has a warning like “this will remove woods” or such, does doing this have a chopping bonus too? or it has to be chopped with a builder first?</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/civ/comments/ammpn5/how_does_mimar_sinans_activated_ability_work_if_i/efn8nyr/">a comment by unoimalltht on &#39;How does Mimar Sinan&#39;s activated ability work? If I activate it in a city, then that city completes an Industrial District bordering another civ, it flips those tiles over to me? (It seems weird to do it this way instead of just activating over an existing Industrial District to flip adjacent tiles)&#39; on /r/civ</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>In that case, what effect does ability have in the city he was activated in? I initially assumed it was a global effect like you mentioned but then there was a second activation available so I got confused</p>

<p>I was thinking that in anticipation of Civ 6, I would play a game each of Civ 1-5. I have 3-5 on Steam, but any copy of Civ 1 and 2 have been lost to the sands of time</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been travelling for a few months and have been playing Civ V on my laptop where I already sunk 300+hours into my desktop back home. Will any mines I built/forests I chopped/etc count towards my totals back home?</p>

<p>Is there a way to disable those leader messages that I don&rsquo;t really have to respond to? Like when they denounce me, or &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve become friends with [country]&rdquo;? Also the CS popup when you first meet them. It&rsquo;s like those things can just be little notifications on the right side.</p>

<p>Does having a GS build an Academy add resources on the tile to your trade network? I put an Academy on a Gems tile but I didn&rsquo;t have Mining yet, I assumed I would just get the happiness bonus once I got Mining, but I haven&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be travelling for a bit, and I&rsquo;m looking for a PDF or something else (maybe a single web page that I can save) that I can read offline while I&rsquo;m travelling. I&rsquo;m looking for the sort of thing that I can read off the civfanatics forums, but I dont want to have to save each thread individually? Just thought I&rsquo;d post here on the off chance that someone one knows something like this somewhere.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d just delete the extra workers and keep maybe 2-3 that I can sleep somewhere safe. (Depends on your number of cities). You&rsquo;re going to need them again later as tech progresses (new resources become available, or railroads)</p>

<p>it wasn&rsquo;t long ago that I was putting roads/railroads on every tile possible rather than just linking cities</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember doing this back in Civ1, because roads/rails gave tiles a trade bonus and there was no maintenance penalty for having too many roads. At that time too, rails cost ZERO movement points, which meant railing my entire continent = units instantly move from one end to the other at will. Good times lol</p>

<p>I havent played civ5 in a while and I thought I&rsquo;d give the latest patch a go. I find that every so often the game hangs between turns - it&rsquo;s stuck with &ldquo;Please wait&rdquo; and the mouseover message says it is waiting for other human players (it&rsquo;s a singleplayer game obviously). It&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s just taking too long to complete, it seems to be stuck in some sort of infinite loop. I left it running for 10-15 minutes at one point with no luck.</p>
<p>When i get to this state I need to load a few turns back and change a few decisions. If I just do the same things, the game will hang again.</p>
<p>Anyone encountering this? Not sure if it&rsquo;s a problem with my particular save, gonna try to start another game.</p>
