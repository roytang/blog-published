<p>Kaladesh Remastered draft ep 1 <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy">https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy</a> #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgkld</p>
<p>Sadly, internet wasn&rsquo;t too good so I just cut the stream short. Too bad, so sad</p>
<p>Draft didn&rsquo;t feel super good, but I managed to break even in the games. No video because no stream. (In hindsight I could have just recorded locally!) Maybe I&rsquo;ll try streaming a draft again early next week.</p>

    <p>All Saints Day Zendikar Rising draft (final episode) https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgznr

<p>The only bug I encountered was that I lost the first game and it awarded me the prize for the win anyway lol. I won the second game, so I only needed to play twice.</p>

    <p>10/23 Friday afternoon Zendikar Rising draft! ep9 https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #mtgznr #twitch
Draft no. 11 went reasonably well, although I realized later that I didn&rsquo;t get a full art land for this one, apparently the promo had already ended. Will still play one more draft next week in this series to wrap it up, I guess.

<p>I got a bunch of Zendikar cards already (not sure if I also retained the stuff I got from the buggy renewal gift earlier)</p>

<p>While checking to see if Zendikar was already on #magicarena, I found that I still had an unfinished Historic Event with Jeskai Fires. I get to play with banned cards!</p>
<p>oops, went down for maintenance! Hopefully this is still around when it comes back up (and that I dont get the third loss!)</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re back! I decided to wrap this up before drafting Zendikar. When my opponents pause with Fires or Teferi on the stack, I can only assume they are dumbfounded lol</p>
<p>Got my 3rd loss to Rakdos Arcanist, which gives you an idea of how dumb that deck is. Maybe it&rsquo;s safe to bring Teferi and Fires back now? Lol. Anyway, on to Zendikar!</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Dont both triggers go on the stack regardless of the order of the triggers? i.e. even if you sac the pact to doom foretold before the pact trigger resolves, youre still losing the game</p>

<p>Decided to risk my precious gems playing Ikoria Turbo Draft on #magicarena. Turned out well! Just need to draft crystals (essentially moxes). Draw cards and counterspells are great, so blue is best in this format apparently. #mtg</p>
<p>Okay, I had a lot of fun so I did another one. No Boon of the Wish Giver meant the deck wasn&rsquo;t as strong. This one was a lot closer, but managed to get there.</p>
<p>I went for a third one and was struck down for my insolence. Only got three crystals this time and even fewer card draw! I think that&rsquo;s enough for this event lol</p>
