            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit interesting, this mentality of &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t trust this person because they appear to be a goody-goody do-gooder, they&amp;rsquo;re probably fake or have ulterior motives!&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m no psychologist, so idle speculation thread:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;cite class=&#34;u-quotation-of h-cite&#34;&gt;
    Quoted &lt;a  href=&#39;https://twitter.com/gangbadoy/status/1269534267081502720&#39;&gt;gangbadoy&amp;#39;s tweet&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, apparently they DO message!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Sunday, everybot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;time class=&#34;dt-published&#34; datetime=&#34;7 Jun 2020 8:43am&#34;&gt;7 Jun 2020 8:43am&lt;/time&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#_&#34;&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes you wonder what kind of trauma this person must have experienced in his life, to automatically mistrust people who present as good people; were they betrayed by some person who initially presented as a good person?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(IDK Gang Badoy personally, but from what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen of her public persona, she hasn&amp;rsquo;t been anything but a decent person.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume it&amp;rsquo;s this same crowd that had a backlash against the &amp;ldquo;disente&amp;rdquo; push of the last admin (as if being decent was objectionable) and related more to one who presented himself as a thug since they find him more relatable somehow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mentality perhaps speaks to a pessimistic belief that people are inherently bad anyway, so anyone who presents as &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; is a lying faker, and might as well support the ones who present as more &amp;ldquo;relatable&amp;rdquo; yet flawed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might also reflect on the person&amp;rsquo;s view of himself: he might have a poor self-image or sense of self-worth and projects that to everyone else, hence why he relates more to the problematic people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I find it easier on my own sanity to just judge people by their words and deeds, and not by whatever imaginary motives I may ascribe to them. If a person is doing good, then you can assume they are a good person until proven otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correspondingly, if someone jokes about rape and murder or makes light of human rights or favors a foreign aggressor, you can judge them by that too. No need to imagine motives beyond what you see and hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Maya Angelou:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;When someone shows you who they are, believe them&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Disclaimer: this is not to say that one should automatically trust any person who presents as good, just not to unnecessarily assume false motives; use your common sense.)&lt;/p&gt;
