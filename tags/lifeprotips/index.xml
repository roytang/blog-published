            &lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t that mean they&amp;rsquo;re dangerous to the neighbors too, and the neighbors have to be told to stay inside as well?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Set some high-energy song as your alarm. I use &amp;ldquo;The Final Countdown&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use multiple alarms, spaced 20-35 minutes apart. Try setting the first alarm to be around 1-1.5 hours before you need to wake up. Adjust the number of alarms and the spacing and the initial time until you find a mix that works for you. You can use different tunes/songs for each alarm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point I had something like 10-12 alarms, two of them were Final Countdown, five of them were some rooster crowing, and the others were alarm clock sounds. The earliest alarm came at around 5 AM while the last one fired at 8:10 AM (which at that time was the absolute latest time I could wake up without risking being late for work)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;What is this information based on? Is it something applicable only to the United States?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Won&amp;rsquo;t this lead to some downvote brigades among the top contenders?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;WTF Chrome, that&amp;rsquo;s so disappointing. Thanks, this is a really good tip.&lt;/p&gt;
