My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2109440552&#34;&gt;4 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It was ok. Some tropes turned around. Kind of frustrating how a lot of stuff just dragged out until the end. The identify of the Hero of Ages pretty much given away early on by the flavor text at the start of each chapter. I finished it in two sittings so that&amp;rsquo;s something

My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2104551754&#34;&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Great book. The story&amp;rsquo;s pace was a bit slow at first as Sanderson was doing his excellent worldbuilding and introducing us to the magic system in his world (he&amp;rsquo;s good at that sort of thing!), but it picks up about a third of the way through. A lot of the plot twists and character developments are handled very well. The pace proceeds fairly quickly towards the end - I burned through the last third of the book in one night because things were escalating quickly. Looking forward to the other books in the series

My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2106145410&#34;&gt;4 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I finished Well of Ascension only two days after finishing The Final Empire. I think I enjoyed it a bit less than the first book - mainly because there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of self-doubt here among the protagonists, a lot of paragraphs of &amp;ldquo;why am i doing this? I&amp;rsquo;m not good enough, etc&amp;rdquo;. The plot also takes longer to solidify. Unlike the first book where they had a very solid objective until the end (the downfall of the Final Empire), the protagonists spend most of this book running in circles trying to figure out what they should do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I did read through the book in two days, so I still found it compelling. Sanderson expands upon the worldbuilding, mythos and systems from the first book. The first book already had a theme of hopelessness around it, but the second book goes even darker. And as you can expect for the second book of a trilogy, the ending doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave our heroes or the world in a very good spot. Looking forward to the final book.
