            &lt;p&gt;I recently imported my old reviews from Goodreads into this blog as &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/source/goodreads&#34;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;. These days I generally prefer just writing my book reviews here anyway, so I will likely stop using Goodreads as a service completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To facilitate tracking of my read/unread books (and perhaps to inspire me to read more, as I really should), I&amp;rsquo;ve published an old file which I&amp;rsquo;ve been using as a sort of &amp;ldquo;to-read&amp;rdquo; list since 2010. I don&amp;rsquo;t restrict myself to reading items from this list, but it serves as a helpful reference should I feel like picking up a new book. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a target for reading them all or anything like that. There are so many items on this list that it&amp;rsquo;s doubtful I will be able to read them all in this lifetime or the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking them on the blog is a bit more low-tech than using Goodreads, but at least it&amp;rsquo;s straightforward. Here you go: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/lists/reading&#34;&gt;The Reading List&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
