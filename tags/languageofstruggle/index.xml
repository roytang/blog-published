            &lt;p&gt;Ingat (careful out there) became the word of good-bye, replacing the old &amp;ldquo;sige,&amp;rdquo; during the martial law years. It was the last word uttered between and among those meeting to discuss what had to be done, in ways big and small, to end the Marcos Dictatorship. It was said with all the love and respect one was capable of. Because chances were one would meet again only in a prison cell, or a torture house (called a safe house by the military) or at a wake. #neverforget #cultureaswitness #languageofstruggle&lt;/p&gt;
