            &lt;p&gt;I have a GeForce 970, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit old, I got it in 2015. I&amp;rsquo;ve been having an issue where sometimes in some games, my displays (I have two monitors) will die (go completely black), but the game goes on running for a while (I can hear the audio), then after a couple of minutes or so the audio also stops so I can&amp;rsquo;t really do anything except do a hard reboot. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried VNCing into the PC to see what&amp;rsquo;s going on after this time, but it&amp;rsquo;s not accessible over the network so I assume it&amp;rsquo;s dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crashes happen most often while playing Magic Arena (says a lot about the game!), but I&amp;rsquo;ve also had it happen once or twice on Starcraft 2 and Borderlands 2. I don&amp;rsquo;t play very demanding games graphically. I can&amp;rsquo;t identify any specific action that causes the crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other things I&amp;rsquo;ve tried:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attach my 2nd monitor to onboard graphics, keeping the main monitor connected to the vidcard. In this case when the crash happens, the main monitor goes black, while the 2nd monitor still has a display, but is frozen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove my 2nd monitor (I thought I might be overtaxing the graphics card by having two of them??)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;checking for memory (RAM) issues. I did have some RAM issues a couple of months ago, but that turned up to be due to a dirty connector, and it was causing crashes not just in games but in general Windows usage, so I think this is a different issue now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;checking for disk issues. I actually found some bad sectors on my secondary drive and ended up replacing it. But even if I ran everything from my primary (SSD) drive, the graphics crashes still occur&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reinstalling/updating device drivers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;resetting Windows 10 (yup, I went that far)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all of these, I&amp;rsquo;m still encountering these crashes so I&amp;rsquo;m seriously considering replacing the graphics card now, but I&amp;rsquo;d like the be sure that it&amp;rsquo;s a graphics card issue and not something wonky with the motherboard, as my purchasing decisions will be different if the motherboard was the problem (I might as well get a new PC then). I&amp;rsquo;m looking for any advice to help me diagnose or confirm the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference, my current PC specs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Case	Silverstone Precision 10SST-PS10B&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fan	120mm internal aux fan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PSU	Cooler Master B600 V2 600W&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPU	Intel Core i5-4460&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MB	ASUS H97ME&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RAM	2x DDR3 Kingston HyperX Fury 8gb 1600&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VC	Asus GTX970 STRIX OC 4gb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSD	Samsung 850Evo 250gb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSHD  Seagate Firecuda 2tb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;When I came home today, my video card started displaying graphic artifacts, and logging in to windows 7 would cause the computer to reboot. The computer was working fine when i last shut it down last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KP4tIKvtZ_Q&amp;amp;feature=g-crec-u&#34;&gt;a video of what&amp;rsquo;s happening&lt;/a&gt;. I have two monitors, in the middle of the video I pan to the second monitor. At about 0:24, I attempt to login and the machine reboots. My video card is an NVidia GeForce GTX 460.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KP4tIKvtZ_Q&amp;amp;feature=g-crec-u&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.stack.imgur.com/yWYGp.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some more symptoms I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered and stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve tried over the course of several reboots:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;was able to login normally once, but after launching a few apps (chrome, tweetdeck), graphic artifacts started appearing again and the machine eventually froze&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;am able to login successfully in safe mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sometimes the display is fine during the start up, and only starts getting wonky a few seconds after I go to the login screen by selecting a user to login with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have encountered Windows failing to start up at all a couple of times (blue screen during startup)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have tried System restore/repair a few times. i&amp;rsquo;ve already tried all the restore points available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have tried uninstalling the vid card driver; machine boots and lets me login and use apps as normal but of course i&amp;rsquo;m at a low resolution (and won&amp;rsquo;t be able to play games). tried to reinstall the vid card driver using automatic update; after the reinstall, same problem occurred&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how to proceed; all signs point to the video card being damaged and probably in need of replacement; my question is are there any other things I can try first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like, is it possible there&amp;rsquo;s just something loose in the connections internally and I can try to remove and reconnect the card first? Or some alternative video driver to try? Or would a shop tech be able to do something to save the card?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have time to take apart the computer at the moment, probably I&amp;rsquo;ll do it this weekend, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to know my options ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
