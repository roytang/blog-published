            &lt;p&gt;Not only that, but the traffic situation gets a lot better in Manila, there are hardly any cars on the road. If only Pacquiao had fights every day&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I imagine he&amp;rsquo;s already made enough money as an actor and doesn&amp;rsquo;t see a need to be a filthy-rich celebrity and just wants to chill with a normal life. I can get behind that&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;zee&amp;rdquo; in American English according to the article, not just in the USA. I&amp;rsquo;d imagine any country that speaks American English uses zee&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;$265 million divided by $60, that means at least 4.5 million copies of GTAV have been pre-ordered? Number seems way high&lt;/p&gt;
