He woke up like normal and adrenaline kept him up as he did his routine. He used the sink,did dishes and made breakfast while bleeding out. He was locked out while picking the newspaper and died trying to find the spare key&#39; on /r/todayilearned</a>:

Rockstar has already made the money back on pre-orders alone.&#39; on /r/todayilearned</a>:

<div class="content e-content">

<p>$265 million divided by $60, that means at least 4.5 million copies of GTAV have been pre-ordered? Number seems way high</p>
