It&rsquo;s the last weekend of March. It feels like the month went by quickly.
The world:  Local covid response: The government introduced the concept of an &ldquo;NCR Plus&rdquo; bubble last Monday, restricting travel in and out of the NCR and adjacent provinces, in response to the rising cases. Still, the daily counts kept rising, hitting record highs of almost 10k cases daily. Even before the dust has settled on the bubble response, they decided to announce last night a reversion to the stricter ECQ.

The world:  Over the past couple of days, our nationwide daily covid cases broke 7000+, the highest recorded so far. Have to be super careful when going out for errands. Not that I wasn&rsquo;t being careful even before, mind you. Just now, government has announced we are still under GCQ (see my post about the PH quarantine levels), but with more restrictions, etc. Looks like they are still hesitant to provide a stronger lockdown which would require paying people to stay home so they don&rsquo;t starve to death.

Happy Pi Day!
The world:  It&rsquo;s the one year anniversary of the world&rsquo;s longest lockdown. In some kind of sick anniversary celebration, local covid cases are on the rise. Yesterday, 5000 new cases were reported, the highest daily rate in 6 months or so. And now a Philippine variant has been detected. Now is not the time to be complacent, we all need to be more careful. The government seems unwilling to impose another widespread ECQ and are focusing on targetted, granular lockdowns.

March has begun. Did it ever really end?
The world:  Vaccination finally starts in the country, with initial donated batches of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccine arriving in the country. Just in time for the one year anniversary of the world&rsquo;s longest lockdown. SinoVac isn&rsquo;t the best choice, but many of my doctor friends say they&rsquo;ll settle for it if that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s available for them. I think QC is planning to use AstraZeneca for their citizens, but worrying is that AZ&rsquo;s efficacy has been shown to be not so good against certain variants such as the South African one, which has already been detected in the country.

Today is the last day of February. Tomorrow, we march on.
The world:  Biden ordered his first military strike last week. America is back, etc. This past week, embrassingly our local police and anti-drug agency got into a shootout against each other near the Ever Gotesco mall in Quezon City. Both sides claim they were doing a buy-bust, which is impossible. As usual, there is little transparency about what actually happened, and many promises of &ldquo;impartial&rdquo; probes and investigations.

Last week of February is about to start. Time flies, as they say.
The world:  Texas (and other parts of the southern US I guess) have been hit by heavy winter storms, with accompanying power grid failures and such. We have some relatives there so it&rsquo;s a concern. Meanwhile, their governor falsely blames renewables for the power problems and their senator went to Cancun. Facebook cut off Australian news links.

The world:  Trump has been acquitted in his second impeachment trial, proving yet again to the world that the US is a flawed democracy dominated by corruption at the highest levels Duterte says he cannot be brave in the mouth against China. Back before the 2016 elections, somebody I used to know claimed that we needed a &ldquo;rottweiler&rdquo; like Duterte as president because he would be tough against China. I remember this sometimes and laugh and then am also sad.

The world:  Myanmar&rsquo;s military staged a coup, and have apparently cut off the country from the internet, maybe? Last night during an international voice chat, the two of us who were in the Philippines were suddenly dropped/disconnected and one of my first thoughts were &ldquo;Wait, is there a coup happening in our country RIGHT NOW?

It&rsquo;s February tomorrow! Somehow, the world still turns.
The world:  Somehow the most viral world news this week doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been about any kind of politics, but rather about capitalism. The Gamestop/stock market brouhaha was a sage of retail investors on reddit going head-to-head with hedge funds over the stock price of a dying gaming company (among others) that dominated most of my feeds for the week. It&rsquo;s actually a lot more compliced than that.

Wow, January is almost done. Wouldn&rsquo;t you know it.
The world:  Biden inaugurated as US president, world celebrates US getting rid of Trump. Biden isn&rsquo;t exactly unproblematic, but he is at least sane and boring. There will be time enough to criticize him later, for now let them be enjoy victory. My expectations of him are at least moderately higher than the ones I had for Trump the internet gets inundated with an inordinate amount of Bernie Sanders memes locally: the govt continues to bombard us with controversies, this time stirring up a red-tagging hornests nest by abrogating the DND-UP accord, paving the way for militarization of campuses and stifling of free expression  Links of interest:  Someone made a Mandalorian trailer in the style of old-school spaghetti westerns.

This is 2021 week 3. Or week 2. Two and a half? How do calendars work?
The world:  relatively calm compared to the chaos of the previous week. However in the US, a storm may be brewing over Biden&rsquo;s inauguration next week locally: still a lot of confusion/inconsistencies around the vaccination plan. Or at least some senators think so. Meanwhile, we are close to breaching 500k cases.  Links of interest:  I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about personal note taking recently, in a bid to find ways to improve my own systems.

We are barely more than a week into 2021 and it has already been quite a year.
The world:  the week started off with something as innocuous as a guy going viral for making his daughter work six hours to figure out how to use a can opener and open a can of beans. I can&rsquo;t explain Bean Dad, but it was so weird and surreal the way it took over the internet for a while.

It&rsquo;s a brand new year, a brand new week, a brand new day. There&rsquo;s no real reason to believe 2021 will be a better year, but we can choose to try to be better, and maybe that in itself is better.
Last week&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s Eve transition played out pretty much as expected. We just stayed at home, actually had an early media noche dinner (around 9ish) and observed the fireworks for a little bit.

I started doing these weeknotes at the top of 2020, so this one signals one complete year of doing my weekly reviews/notes in public. I thought it appropriate for a review!
Did it turn out to be a good practice? I think for me yes! Not necessarily for anyone following the blog (all 3 of you), since a lot of the weeknotes stuff might seem boring or irrelevant to you. But for me, forcing me to publicly write some thoughts about the past week has been good for my own self-awareness and keeping me writing regularly.

It&rsquo;s the penultimate week of the year, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not the only who&rsquo;s had enough of this accursed year and looking forward to moving on to the next one. I know that&rsquo;s silly since the world won&rsquo;t magically become better when the calendar flips over to January the first, but I think it helps our mental health to have this sort of &ldquo;fresh start&rdquo; mentality, even if it&rsquo;s on an arbitrarily chosen date.

Time passes yet again. I think I have to get used to not having much personal stuff to report in the weeknotes on certain weeks (aside from the watching/gaming parts), especially given the pandemic where I&rsquo;m at home 90% of the time.
Speaking of the pandemic, the UK started vaccinations last week, and the US FDA approved the Pfizer vaccine as well, so hopefully this is where things start to turn around.

This week felt like another set of those moments-in-between, where not much seemed to happen, but it somehow still went by quickly anyway.
I think the household and the family has slowly gotten used to the idea that any big Christmas celebration isn&rsquo;t happening. My niece&rsquo;s birthday was last weekend, so we sent her gifts via Grab delivery instead of being able to get together. Most likely something similar&rsquo;s going to happen for gift exchanges on Christmas.

December is almost upon us!
I had an opportunity last week to take on some additional work, but on further reflection, I thought I&rsquo;d pass on it. I am in general, averse to working during the Christmas season (that is to say, more so than during the entire year in general). Even back when I was working full-time, I&rsquo;d prefer taking most of my leaves during December. It&rsquo;s really a result of the terrible traffic in Metro Manila, which gets significantly worse during Christmas season, a trauma that lingers even when I&rsquo;m home all the time.

This week felt weird. It kind of went by quickly for me, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel like anything important really happened. Its kind of like those moments in-between other events, where you&rsquo;re just coasting along and waiting for the more significant things to happen. My country is still recovering from the storms of the past few weeks, Trump is still flailing around trying to overturn democracy, and our own president is still insecure when someone gets more attention than him.

Weather this past week was very bad for those of us in Metro Manila (and many other places in Luzon). Howling winds and strong rains dominated for 2-3 days of the week due to typhoon Ulysses. This typhoon wasn&rsquo;t as strong as Rolly a couple of weeks ago, but it seems that it brought a lot more rains, causing flooding and loss of power in a whole lot of places. Metro Manila was hit quite badly, even drawing comparisons to Ondoy back in 2009.

The World: Somehow the week seemed to go by both quickly and agonizingly slowly, mostly because of the US presidential elections held this week. Slowly because after the initial burst of results on Tuesday night (US time), the remaining states&rsquo; results trickled in very slowly. Quickly because much time was spent doomscrolling and refreshing election-related updates. I think the world collectively breathed a sigh of relief this weekend as the US networks finally called the race for former VP and now president-elect Joe Biden.

Now: Stormy weekend here in Manila. Supposedly the &ldquo;strongest storm of 2020&rdquo; so far, typhoon Rolly made landfall earlier today and is currently battering many of the provinces south of Metro Manila. Storm signals are as high as number 5. As of this writing, weather is currently cold and nippy but not particularly rainy where I am. We expect stronger winds and rain to hit us as evening approaches as well.

Server migration update: I had encountered some trouble with the Travis-CI -based Hugo build generating this here website last week. Luckily, most of the migration work to the new backend was already done, so I went ahead and switched over the servers. So this site is no longer plain-old deployed HTML, but rather powered by a Django backend. The site should be mostly the same, though I did take the opportunity to move some stuff around.

So my current webhost finally decided to give me a deadline, the long and short of it is that my new server needs to be ready by December the 9th, giving me a bit under a month to get things in order. I&rsquo;m already in the middle of setting up the new server, so I think I&rsquo;ll be ready by early November anyway. Most of the code to run the new blog is also mostly ready (who knows how many bugs there are though!

The world continues to be terrible. The PH government wants people to get back to work and everything to spur the economy (with health precautions and everything). A lot of people have no choice, but I&rsquo;m fortunate enough to not have to go out there yet, and I&rsquo;m sure people like me will still hold back. This all would have been a lot easier if the government had gotten control of this pandemic early on but it is what it is.

October is imminent! There are two distractions I&rsquo;m looking forward to in the coming month.
  The first one is Inktober, which I&rsquo;ve been doing since 2016. Basically it&rsquo;s just to do 30 ink drawings in October, one per day. There are some official prompts, which I&rsquo;ll probably follow. I haven&rsquo;t really done any serious sketching in a while, maybe this will help me get back into the groove.

It&rsquo;s hard to imagine this is already the 3rd week of September, it feels like the month is passing by quickly, although I haven&rsquo;t been particularly busy recently.
I did do some paid work this past week; not a lot, just filling in to provide some emergency support/consultation.
I guess the reason it feels like the week passed by quickly is that I started a new side project (like many programmers, I am afflicted by the curse of wanting to start too many side projects).

It has certainly been a week, yes it has. The world continues to turn (and burn even).
I&rsquo;ve been busy. Not so much with work, though there was a bit of that due to a required emergency software change (aren&rsquo;t they always emergencies?). I wasn&rsquo;t doing the emergency work myself, more like consulting and advising how to approach it, so not much to tell there.
I did quite a bit of work on my personal data processes/backups/workflows.

It&rsquo;s September! The last six months were a blur.
It&rsquo;s considered &ldquo;Christmas season&rdquo; over here already I guess. The local memes are that once the clock hits midnight between Aug 31 and Sep 1, your neighbor&rsquo;s Christmas lights are magically up. Also of course the famous Jose Mari Chan gets famous starting September, since malls and stores love to play his Christmas songs during this time. IDK what to expect for Christmas season this year though, since we are still in a pandemic.

This last week was weird. I feel like I didn&rsquo;t really get much done in terms of productivity, yet I don&rsquo;t feel I was unproductive. A very relaxed and chill week.
Once again a tiny bit of work done this past week, some fixes, including to side projects. I also spent some time preparing for some events next weekend. Although I wasn&rsquo;t productive this week, I did outline a bit of a roadmap of new features for one of my side projects, hopefully I can get into that in the coming weeks!

The week after I posted about phoning in the weeknotes, here I am with one where there&rsquo;s nothing much to report. Not that surprising, given how busy I was over the previous few weeks, I took the opportunity to take a more relaxing week.
There was a bit of work to be done, but very miniscule by comparison. Minor fixes here and there, including to some side projects.
I did get to write on the blog more, as expected.

These weeknotes are coming in late in the day because of reasons. (The reasons being laziness and procrastination.)
Actually, I feel like I&rsquo;ve been kind of phoning in the weeknotes over the past few weeks, they&rsquo;ve mostly been &ldquo;hey, I&rsquo;ve been busy, so nothing of significance happened, but here are some things I watched/played.&rdquo; Supposedly one of the side effects of writing regular updates is that you tend to look out for more interesting things to do so you have something to write about, even on an unconscious level.

Still kind of busy, although there&rsquo;s a bunch of things I hope I can finally wrap up this week, so I can move on to the long list of other things I want to be doing. The world continues to be bleak, so I&rsquo;m still hiding from it.
My stuff:
 Forty-two. I thought about just merging these into a single post for the day, but nah, this seems better. Reworking the old charity side project still ongoing.

Kind of a busy week for me again, so the week kind of passed me by quickly. It&rsquo;s August! In one month it will be (PH) Christmas season! It feels like July went by more quickly than other quarantine months.
My stuff:
 A bit of consulting work. Reworking the old charity side project still ongoing. I was hoping to finish all the changes last week and next week would be testing and deployment, but stuff got in the way (and estimates may have been a bit off), but the spillover is small and we should still be fine for finishing everything next week.

 hm. I was a bit busy this week, so I wasn&rsquo;t paying too much attention, so I don&rsquo;t have too much to rail against today. Well of course, things are still ongoing. There&rsquo;s still the pandemic, fascist police state philosophy continues to rear it&rsquo;s ugly head in the US, PH gov&rsquo;t continues to be dumb, etc., but this week seemed a bit tame comparably.

 There are days when I have to consciously temper my rage at the shenanigans of this government. I can&rsquo;t write about them today.  My stuff:
 This week&rsquo;s pandemic notes. Had a busy work week again; at the same time I also picked up an older charity project where the client asked for UI updates. Had issues with running the old code, and it was small enough, so I decided to rewrite it in a new tech stack.

 Friday afternoon the House of Representatives voted to deny the franchise application of the nation&rsquo;s biggest broadcaster ABS-CBN. This despite all agencies of the executive testifying that the company had no violations. Justifications cited were mostly personal reasons. The Palace claims they remained neutral on this issue, but no one really believes that. Probably not even then. What now, Philippines?  My stuff:

My country:
 Friday afternoon the president sighed the controversial &ldquo;Anti-terror law&rdquo; that vastly expands police powers, allows people to be arrested without warrants on mere suspicion of terrorism etc. Interesting timing, right after China applies a new anti-terror low to Hong Kong (and rightly gets castigated for it by countries all over the world) and also right after the PNP (who promise not to abuse their newfound powers) are under criticism for killing some soldiers in a misencounter and tampering with the crime scene to cover it up.

My stuff:
 This week&rsquo;s pandemic notes. Easily the most annoying thing this week: our broadband modem conked out Wednesday night. Customer support isn&rsquo;t super responsive for local telcos: I called their support line the next day (support line is not even available 24/7!), got put on hold for 45 minutes TWICE before they agreed to send a repair crew over the next day (Friday). Friday morning I got a text that the technician visit was actually scheduled for SATURDAY morning.

My stuff:
 This week&rsquo;s pandemic notes. Some days still hot, but weather beginning to turn for the better. Sleep kind of better and a bit more regular too. Did my quarterly medical checkup this past week (slightly delayed). No issues, but I need to do an FBS test for next time. Sleep schedule kind of settling back into my usual biphasic sleep. Although the second phase seems to move around a lot&hellip; Not much work-wise the past week, and a bit more family-related expenses.

Surprisingly, no new crises have emerged during the past week. I think. More of the same crises, carrying on.
Last Friday was the PH independence day holiday. I didn&rsquo;t feel like celebrating. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like we are free. In any case, a protest rally against the yet-to-be-signed terror bill took place at the university that morning, inspite of threats from the authorities that it wasn&rsquo;t allowed. The protestors spaced themselves out and everything.

The world isn&rsquo;t letting up. The virus is still around, but both the US and my own country have gotten distracted.
The US is in its second week of police brutality/black lives matters protests. Meanwhile, our government took on a sidequest of trying to enact a wide-ranging and easily abusable anti-terror bill, triggering some smaller (by comparison to the US).
I haven&rsquo;t written about the terror bill, mainly because I haven&rsquo;t had the opportunity to dig into it too deeply.

It seems difficult to write about stuff today, when the world seems like it is on fire.
For historical context, for the past few days the USA, presumably a first-world nation, has been in the grip of massive protests and riots and police brutality following the murder of a black man by four police officers was captured on video and went viral. Basically, many states are responding to protests against police brutality with&hellip; police brutality.

My stuff:
 This week&rsquo;s quarantine notes. the weather has been so hot lately, I&rsquo;ve taken to shifting my sleep schedule to afternoons so that I can maximize the use of the air-conditioning to when it&rsquo;s most needed. It also helps me be more productive, since I can get more things done if I&rsquo;m awake during the cooler hours of the day. I think I&rsquo;m more looking forward to the end of summer than the end of quarantine.

My Stuff:
 This week&rsquo;s quarantine notes. Work: A bit of Laravel work, and a bit of server management and deployment. Nothing too ridiculous. Watching: Haven&rsquo;t watched much this week. There was the really great Justice League Dark: Apokolips War which came out last week. Apparently it&rsquo;s the last one for the DC AMU, or this particular timeline at least. Quiz: We are now up to 3 locally produced online quiz nights per week, which seems like a lot because we only used to attend 2-3 live events per month.

My Stuff:
 Early this morning I took a walk outside for the first time since the lockdown started. Previously I had only gone out for groceries and meds. Only for less than 30 mins, and only in our subdivision, walking up and down the street. It&rsquo;s good to be walking again, although this short and limited route is quite boring and full of neighbor&rsquo;s dogs barking at me, so I&rsquo;m not too fond of it, but it&rsquo;s better to get the habit started again since I&rsquo;ve been feeling the fatness piling on due to the quarantine and the lack of exercise.

First week of May. At least two more weeks of quarantine remain. COVID19 Diary still exists, only updated every so often. I stayed in the entire week!
 The week was slightly more productive than the last one, at least in terms of personal projects. I moved a couple of them forward. And also spent a bunch of time spring cleaning and moving stuff around here on the site. Details to follow.

It&rsquo;s the last week of April, but thanks to an extension, we are still in for three more weeks of quarantine.
The COVID19 Diary is still being updated sporadically. Only went out once this week, for groceries. We tried to buy a bit more than usual, hoping to reduce the number of times we need to go out. We also celebrated a couple of birthdays in the family, through a zoom call, complete with the grandkids blowing on a candle from across the internet.

This week went by quickly, for some reason. And despite the fact that it&rsquo;s summer, the rains have started coming in early, although only sporadically. inb4 &ldquo;the world is healing&rdquo;
The COVID19 Diary is still being updated every few days. Actually went out 3 times this week, once for groceries, and twice for meds for the parental units (one would assume they would coordinate so I can just buy everything in one go, but nooooo.
