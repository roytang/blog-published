            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s August!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-quote&#34;&gt;A quote:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: there is no real life. There is no full, meaningful, &amp;ldquo;best life.&amp;rdquo; There are, at best, more and less meaningful pursuits, from your perspective, based on your upbringing, imprinting, and your own specific cocktail of longings. It is natural for us to feel anxiety about how we spend our limited time. No matter how happy you convince yourself to be, you will sometimes feel the vague ache of other possible lives.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/berkun/status/758664382867832832&#34;&gt;SandwichBear via Amy Hoy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some good news for the country last Monday, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philstar.com/business/2021/07/28/2115647/president-dutertes-last-sona&#34;&gt;the old man&amp;rsquo;s last SONA&lt;/a&gt; (where I heard he spent more time talking up China than discussing the pandemic response). The good news was actually that the country &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/1419655504289095688/&#34;&gt;finally got an Olympic gold via champion weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz&lt;/a&gt;, after we some commentators described our country during the opening ceremony as having the dubious distinction of having won the most Olympic medals without a gold. Additionally, a couple of our boxers are still in the running for another gold, currently guaranteed a silver and a bronze each. Go sports!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that the delta variant is here, on Thursday the IATF announced that &lt;a href=&#34;https://pia.gov.ph/news/2021/07/29/ncr-to-remain-under-gcq-with-heightened-restrictions&#34;&gt;NCR would be on &amp;ldquo;GCQ with heightened restrictions&amp;rdquo; up to Aug 15&lt;/a&gt;, despite calls for a &amp;ldquo;circuit breaker&amp;rdquo; lockdown to face the delta threat. Not 24 hours later, they changed their mind and said &lt;a href=&#34;https://pia.gov.ph/news/2021/07/30/ncr-to-be-placed-under-ecq-starting-aug-6&#34;&gt;the NCR will undergo the stricter ECQ lockdown starting Aug 06&lt;/a&gt;. I suppose we should be happy they flip-flopped reasonably quickly? As is typical for the pandemic response so far, we still don&amp;rsquo;t have a clear idea what specifically this new season of ECQ will entail and whether or not there will be ayuda for the poor.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2016: Our trivia team &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/07/BIXlZpmhpFr/&#34;&gt;won the inaugural Pop Quiz&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2008: I bought a cellphone with my own money for the first time. It was a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2009/08/3067225022/&#34;&gt;Nokia 5800&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;; My favorite sketch this week was this Roy Mustang one I did early in the week:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I enjoyed this one and liked how it turned out, but it took me over an hour because I was playing with various #Procreate tools and brushes. Here&amp;rsquo;s a timelapse: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOYUkG1ac38&#34; title=&#34;Roy Mustang #sketchdaily 205/365

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/reviews-casino-gunpowder-halloween-masters/&#34;&gt;Casino Royale (2006), Gunpowder Milkshake (2021), Batman the Long Halloween (2021)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During this week&amp;rsquo;s Saturday gaming session we did a rewatch of &lt;strong&gt;Mortal Kombat (1995)&lt;/strong&gt;, a fitting followup to our rewatch of &lt;strong&gt;Street Fighter&lt;/strong&gt; a couple of weeks ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TV: Here&amp;rsquo;s the review for &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/reviews-casino-gunpowder-halloween-masters/#masters-of-the-universe-revelation-season-1-part-1&#34;&gt;Masters of the Universe: Revelation (season 1 part 1)&lt;/a&gt;. I also watched the new season of &lt;strong&gt;The Movies That Made Us&lt;/strong&gt; on Netflix; not much commentary needed here, but I really enjoy learning about the ins and outs of movie production and how movies can sometimes take years to get off the ground, even before filming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;m close to completing all the &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn (PS4)&lt;/strong&gt; Frozen Wilds quests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding matches on &lt;strong&gt;Guilty Gear Strive&lt;/strong&gt; has gotten a bit more difficult lately. I think it&amp;rsquo;s mostly because I got promoted to a higher floor? A new DLC fighter came out last week though, so hopefully that means a resurgence of players?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went ahead and bought &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/1420071833718591489/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Steam! I did a Let&amp;rsquo;s Play + commentary with some friends for the first hour or so of the game: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jAUOpQUO4&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jAUOpQUO4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magic Arena:&lt;/strong&gt; Still drafting the latest MTG set &lt;strong&gt;Adventures in the Forgotten Realms&lt;/strong&gt; on Magic Arena, you can follow via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgafr&#34;&gt;MTGAFR tag&lt;/a&gt;. I managed a couple of quick drafts this week, one of them a 7-winner! I may end up wrapping up the AFR run this coming week because on the 12th we&amp;rsquo;re getting Jumpstart Historic Horizons which was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ign.com/articles/jumpstart-historic-horizons-spoilers-mtg-arena-digital-only-card-reveal-details&#34;&gt;just unveiled last week&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;ll probably want to focus on collecting that. There&amp;rsquo;s also a Standard Open going on this weekend, and I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/08/1421693688900505603/&#34;&gt;somehow managed to qualify for Day 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I managed to hit both Mythic on Arena and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/1421158845007634433/&#34;&gt;Masters on Eternal&lt;/a&gt; this past month, a feat I haven&amp;rsquo;t managed to do in a while!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular Saturday group played some &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/blood-rage/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/a&gt; again, as usual. I just keep copying this sentence over from previous weeks lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A friend has been trying to convince me to get the just-released &lt;strong&gt;Orcs Must Die 3&lt;/strong&gt; on Steam, but I complained that we haven&amp;rsquo;t even finished our long-running coop run of &lt;strong&gt;Orcs Must Die 2&lt;/strong&gt; yet, so we did just that this weekend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: Mostly just comics again this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No quiz night this past week, just the usual NY Times crosswords and spelling bee with the trivia team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;August is fairly stacked, and that kicks off this week with James Gunn&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/strong&gt;, which should be out by Friday. Despite being an MCU fanboy, this is the superhero movie I&amp;rsquo;ve most been looking forward to this year!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also some &lt;strong&gt;Street Fighter V&lt;/strong&gt; reveals/updates &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/StreetFighter/status/1420384085302730753&#34;&gt;slated for Aug 3&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not playing the game regularly anymore, but I am willing to be sucked back in, especially since the upcoming DLC character Akira is a favorite of mine from Rival Schools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;a-quote&#34;&gt;A quote:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I just wanna keep being proof that good people with no hidden agendas still exist in this world.&amp;rdquo; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/diorkenn/status/1416160966560161792/&#34;&gt;@diorkenn on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This past week in Metro Manila was very cold and rainy, which came with the attendant problems like flooding and such. There&amp;rsquo;s a typhoon nearby, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s in the PAR; instead it&amp;rsquo;s just doing this thing where &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/07/21/news/pagasa-habagat-causing-rainin-metro-manila-parts-of-ph/1807856&#34;&gt;it drags in rains and winds via the Habagat monsoon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/7/16/Delta-variant-Philippines-local-transmission-COViD-19.html&#34;&gt;feared delta variant is here in the PH&lt;/a&gt; and has been since May. The DOH &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/7/22/DOH-confirms-Delta-variant-local-transmission.html&#34;&gt;confirms local transmission&lt;/a&gt;. And the response in Metro Manila is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/7/23/NCR-4-other-provinces-GCQ-with-heightened-restrictions-until-July-31.html&#34;&gt;to revert back to &amp;ldquo;GCQ with heightened restrictions&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. For only a week? Seems super optimistic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local food delivery app FoodPanda is in a bit of a PR crisis after suspending some drivers for protesting. Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/roycanivel_inq/status/1416922167896203272&#34;&gt;a twitter thread about it.&lt;/a&gt; Some lawmakers are already calling for investigations into whether local food delivery drivers should be treated as employees and given benefits, which this level of control certainly implies. We&amp;rsquo;ll see if that goes anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internationally: The 2020 Olympics held their opening ceremony this past weekend. Yes, that is surprisingly still on, in spite of (waves arms around) all of this. Gamers everywhere were surprised to hear &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tokyo-2020-olympics-opening-ceremony-uses-video-game-music-for-team-entrances/1100-6494313/&#34;&gt;some of their favorite video game soundtracks during the opening ceremony&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Because as long as you have advertising, you have this perverse incentive to make it manipulative. You can’t have a behavior-modification machine with advertisers and have anything ethical; it’s not possible. You could get away with it barely with television because television wasn’t as effective at modifying people. But this, there’s no ethical way to have advertising.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2019: Jonathan Hickman took over the X-Men books with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/07/186514742325/&#34;&gt;House of X #1&lt;/a&gt;! Can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s been two years of this Krakoa Kraziness!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2018: The last time I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgnats2018/&#34;&gt;managed to participate in the MTG PH Nationals&lt;/a&gt;. Not sure if I&amp;rsquo;ll ever get that deep into paper Magic again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2007: Inmates at a Cebu prison went viral &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMnk7lh9M3o&#34;&gt;for performing the &amp;ldquo;Thriller&amp;rdquo; music video&lt;/a&gt; (I&amp;rsquo;m surprised this has survived all these years without being DMCA&amp;rsquo;ed or whatever)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the annoying thing about all this rainy weather we&amp;rsquo;ve been having is that I don&amp;rsquo;t get to go out on my daily walks. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried doing some time on the stationary bike instead, but I am much less inclined to do that (it&amp;rsquo;s more boring!), so less exercise for me this week overall. I should try to do the bike thing while watching TV stuff maybe?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;; As it usually happens, I am behind by a couple of sketches during the weekend. I think part of it is because the Friday prompt &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/SketchDaily/&#34;&gt;on the subreddit&lt;/a&gt; is always free draw, and I&amp;rsquo;m often too lazy to think something up, so I get blocked. Anyway, I used up one of this week&amp;rsquo;s daily sketches to participate in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tumindig&#34;&gt;#Tumindig&lt;/a&gt; thing on Twitter:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/dad-aotd-vatcoatp-omelas/&#34;&gt;Die Another Day (2002), Army of the Dead (2021), Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During this week&amp;rsquo;s Saturday gaming session we managed to watch &lt;strong&gt;Gunpowder Milkshake (2021)&lt;/strong&gt;. Will include a review in my next &amp;ldquo;Reviews&amp;rdquo; post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TV: Finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/dad-aotd-vatcoatp-omelas/&#34;&gt;Superstore season 5&lt;/a&gt;. Also, Ted Lasso season 2 &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/1418852829381337088/#superstore-season-5&#34;&gt;has started&lt;/a&gt;! I had also forgotten that &lt;strong&gt;Masters of the Universe: Revelation&lt;/strong&gt; is out on Netflix this weekend, we ended up binging it during the Saturday gaming session as well, so I&amp;rsquo;ll also include it in the next reviews post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still the usual regular games &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Guilty Gear Strive&lt;/strong&gt;. Been trying to start some new games like &lt;strong&gt;Avadon the Black Fortress&lt;/strong&gt;, but nothing has stuck yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still drafting the latest MTG set &lt;strong&gt;Adventures in the Forgotten Realms&lt;/strong&gt; on Magic Arena, you can follow via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgafr&#34;&gt;MTGAFR tag&lt;/a&gt;. I only managed one (terrible) draft this week though, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if we can get more done next week since there&amp;rsquo;ll be Quick Drafts available now. Instead, I seem to be doing well in constructed this month! I managed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/1416936573212389378/&#34;&gt;hit Mythic early&lt;/a&gt;, and then the next day I managed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/1417339197384323075/&#34;&gt;win the Standard challenge&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular Saturday group played some &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/blood-rage/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/a&gt; again, as usual. I just keep copying this sentence over from previous weeks lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finally managed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/1418849098460016643/&#34;&gt;win a game of Advance Wars By Web&lt;/a&gt;! It was a three-way free-for-all game so it took a while with a lot of back and forth. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit worried about this web-based game because it&amp;rsquo;s obviously not licensed by Nintendo and it keeps running into server issues, so it might not be long for this world lol. But I am grateful for the chance to play some Advance Wars again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: Mostly just comics again this week, but I did mange to read &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/dad-aotd-vatcoatp-omelas/#the-ones-who-walk-away-from-omelas-by-ursula-k-le-guin&#34;&gt;The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas by Ursula K. Le Guin&lt;/a&gt;, which is much more of a short story than a book, but I&amp;rsquo;ll count it in my &amp;ldquo;books read for 2021&amp;rdquo; anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oh, we joined an online quiz night this week, it was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/PopQuizPH/&#34;&gt;PopQuizPH&lt;/a&gt; fifth anniversary game! We actually did fairly well, ending up in a triple tie for first place, but the tiebreaker was about local actress Jolina Magdangal and we were terrible at it, so we finished the night in third place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition, the trivia team is still enjoying the NY Times crosswords and spelling bee, which we now regularly do on the weekends whether there is a quiz night or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s the last week of July! Supposedly we are getting the &lt;strong&gt;Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&lt;/strong&gt; on Steam this week, as it says it&amp;rsquo;s releasing July 2021, but we don&amp;rsquo;t have a definite release date yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our erstwhile president is delivering his last SONA tomorrow. I kind of want to unplug from social media for the day mostly because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear about his nonsense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;had a couple more family escort missions this week, but those should be the last ones til August.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;; As is typical, I&amp;rsquo;m behind by a couple of days again. I liked this sketch I did of the Cantina band (or part of them at least):&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Actually managed to watch a fair amount of movies this week!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James Bond run continues with Brosnan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/wine-barry-loki/&#34;&gt;The World is Not Enough (1999)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The watch-along movie during this week&amp;rsquo;s Saturday gaming session was one of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/10/my-top-10-favorite-movies-of-all-time/&#34;&gt;my all-time favorites&lt;/a&gt;: Street Fighter the Movie (1994). Still super quotable!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TV: Watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/wine-barry-loki/&#34;&gt;Barry season 1 and of course the Loki season 1 finale&lt;/a&gt;. Also started watching &lt;strong&gt;Superstore&lt;/strong&gt; season 5, since I saw it&amp;rsquo;s on Prime Video now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still playing &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Guilty Gear Strive&lt;/strong&gt; regularly. Also decided to revive my &lt;strong&gt;Wasteland 2&lt;/strong&gt; save for some reason. Also woke up my &lt;strong&gt;Disgaea 4 (Vita)&lt;/strong&gt; save game since I had to wait in a corridor for a while during an errand this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still drafting the latest MTG set &lt;strong&gt;Adventures in the Forgotten Realms&lt;/strong&gt; on Magic Arena, you can follow via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgafr&#34;&gt;MTGAFR tag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular Saturday group played some &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/blood-rage/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/a&gt; again, as usual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some friends got me into playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://awbw.amarriner.com/&#34;&gt;this web-based version of Advance Wars&lt;/a&gt;, which hopefully Nintendo takes a while to notice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: No books this week, mostly just comics. Yet again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No online quiz night for the trivia team this week, we just indulged ourselves with the NY Times crossword and spelling bee again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Huh no big events coming up, maybe I can actually get some stuff done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;a-quote&#34;&gt;A quote:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You are the books you read the films you watch, the music you listen to, the people you meet, the dreams you have, the conversations you engage in. You are what you take from these. You are the sound of the ocean, the breath of fresh air, the brightest light and the darkest corner. You are a collective of every experience you have had in your life. You are every single second of every single day. So drown yourself in a sea of knowledge and existence. Let the words run through your veins and let the colours fill your mind.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Jac Vanek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Richard Branson is &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/09/tech/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-flight-walkup-scn/index.html&#34;&gt;scheduled to go to space this weekend&lt;/a&gt;, kicking off the billionaire&amp;rsquo;s race to get off the planet they ruined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Covid19: The delta variant continues to ravage many parts of the world, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/delta-variant-now-dominant-covid-strain-u-s-n1273214&#34;&gt;the US&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/05/asia/indonesia-covid-outbreak-intl-hnk/index.html&#34;&gt;our neighbor Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. Surprisingly, despite lax border controls the variant is not yet widespread here, though some people fear we are undergoing a silent surge with less people willing to be tested and undergo quarantine restrictions.&lt;/li&gt;

The weird thing is that I don&amp;rsquo;t remember sharing this via pocket, but it appears I did, and it&amp;rsquo;s a decent enough read, so yay?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.npr.org/joy-generator/#story=intro&amp;amp;page=0&#34;&gt;NPR&amp;rsquo;s Joy Generator&lt;/a&gt;: A nice experiment&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;from-the-archives-this-week-in-history&#34;&gt;From the archives, this week in history:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2020: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/world/asia/philippines-congress-media-duterte-abs-cbn.html&#34;&gt;Philippine Congress shuts down ABS-CBN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2014: We &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2014/07/10153077595843912-0/&#34;&gt;bought a Nintendo console&lt;/a&gt; again after more than a decade!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HELTH&lt;/strong&gt;: Had a bit of a scare early in the week, as I ran a fever starting from Sunday evening. Pre-pandemic, it&amp;rsquo;s nothing I&amp;rsquo;d just take some biogesic and sleep it off, but now we have to worry about Covid. To be sure, I had an RT-PCR swab test taken by Monday lunch time. My brother and his family had passed by the house Sunday morning and we hung out a bit outside shooting the breeze, so aside from the seniors I live with, I was worried for them, so the test was mostly to be sure and for peace of mind. I thought the test itself would be uncomfortable, but it was super quick, swab went in and out once per nostril, then one more in the throat. It was a bit pricey, as someone comes to your home to do it, but the results came quickly, got the NEGATIVE result the next morning. Hugh sigh of relief. By then my fever had gone down. I self-isolated for a couple more days just to be sure. Am completely fine now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote a bunch of words on the blog this week. Other than the usual media reviews, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/comsat-and-compshops/&#34;&gt;this post on Compshop culture in the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/on-being-president/&#34;&gt;some commentary on what it takes to be President of this country&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;; Nothing I&amp;rsquo;m too proud of this week, kind of phoned in a lot of them. Here&amp;rsquo;s Squeeks from &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/2789a7cda3fd16feca84b58fae45811b/&#34;&gt;Transformers: The Last Knight&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;








    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Actually managed to watch a fair amount of movies this week!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James Bond run continues into the Brosnan era with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/goldeneye/&#34;&gt;Goldeneye (1995)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/tomorrow-never-dies/&#34;&gt;Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/black-widow/&#34;&gt;Black Widow&lt;/a&gt; came out this week of course, bringing the MCU back to the movies. Linked review starts spoiler-free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched some dumb movies (&lt;strong&gt;America the Motion Picture (2021)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Ice Road (2021)&lt;/strong&gt;) &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/saturday-10-movies/&#34;&gt;during the Saturday gaming watchalong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not much TV this week apparently. Still keeping up with Flash, Rick and Morty, Loki. Mildly annoyed that Loki has one episode to go and we still don&amp;rsquo;t have any real idea who the big bad is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduced gaming a bit during the few days I was sick, but I did resume &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Guilty Gear Strive&lt;/strong&gt; towards the end of the week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latest MTG set &lt;strong&gt;Adventures in the Forgotten Realms&lt;/strong&gt; has dropped on Magic Arena! I&amp;rsquo;ve started streaming drafts as usual, you can follow via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgafr&#34;&gt;MTGAFR tag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also thinking of streaming some non-MTG Steam games next week, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if that pushes through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular Saturday group played some &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/blood-rage/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/a&gt; again, as usual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steam Sale ended without me taking any damage! Also, I think I&amp;rsquo;m pausing this month&amp;rsquo;s Humble Choice again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: No books this week, mostly just comics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No online quiz night for the trivia team this week, we just indulged ourselves with the NY Times crossword and spelling bee again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loki season finale!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the Fourth of July, which really only means something in the US. Over here it used to be &amp;ldquo;Philippine-American Friendship Day&amp;rdquo;, but apparently that was phased out while I was still in grade school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-quote&#34;&gt;A quote&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts&amp;rdquo; - W. Churchill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our current president and one of our possible future presidents, who are ostensibly allies / partymates &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/07/01/2109536/duterte-teases-vp-bid-calls-pacquiao-a-shit&#34;&gt;have been feuding over the past week&lt;/a&gt;. Just another sign of how tenuous political alliances in this country are; they are no match for ambition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DOH &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1454411/doh-says-ph-now-low-risk-for-covid-19-octa-disagrees&#34;&gt;says we are now &amp;ldquo;low risk&amp;rdquo; for COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; (which feels a bit like &lt;a href=&#34;https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/obama-awards-obama-a-medal&#34;&gt;Obama awarding himself a medal&lt;/a&gt;, but whatever). While it&amp;rsquo;s nice to be optimistic, we should still be cautious, especially in light of &lt;a href=&#34;https://asiatimes.com/2021/06/delta-variant-wreaking-havoc-on-viral-indonesia/&#34;&gt;the delta variant ravaging our neighboring countries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other than the pandemic, if you need to be reminded of the world&amp;rsquo;s other problems, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npr.org/2021/06/28/1010836214/all-time-records-fall-as-a-heat-wave-roasts-the-northwest-u-s&#34;&gt;the Pacific Northwest in the US and Canada have been experiencing record-setting heat waves over the past week or so&lt;/a&gt;. Also, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/EoinHiggins_/status/1411075158006284290&#34;&gt;the ocean was on fire&lt;/a&gt; for a while.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Github recently announced &lt;a href=&#34;https://copilot.github.com/&#34;&gt;Github Copilot: Your AI Pair Programmer&lt;/a&gt;, basically autocompletes code snippets based on your intent? They do have access to a large dataset of written code so this just might turn out to be the next big thing for making things easier for devs. I&amp;rsquo;ve signed up for the technical preview, let&amp;rsquo;s see if I get in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tvaziri/status/1410330742010171392&#34;&gt;this twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; of people posting great shots from movies of the past decade, although I have &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/1411197557028495362/&#34;&gt;a complaint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like this Tumblr post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://depsidase.tumblr.com/post/654356401031921664&#34;&gt;Bert and Ernie at the end of the world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2020: It&amp;rsquo;s been one year since I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/1277249348716212225/&#34;&gt;deactivated my Facebook account&lt;/a&gt;! Here&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/quitting-facebook/&#34;&gt;corresponding essay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2013: Google &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2013/06/351351791226589187/&#34;&gt;shut down Google Reader&lt;/a&gt;, forever changing the adoption trajectory of RSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2011: Google launched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2011/07/86804113995730945/&#34;&gt;Google Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was again a busy week due to family-related errands, mostly involving escort missions to the hospital (nothing major, just routine checks and such.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hit the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/1410485781219536901/&#34;&gt;900 daily streak on Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;! Road to 1000!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;; this week, I really liked my rendition of the classic &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=616&#34;&gt;Icy Manipulator&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;








&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Actually managed to watch a fair amount of movies this week! Watched both Dalton Bond films: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/69d2374b0f0232065102954a54736506/&#34;&gt;The Living Daylights (1987)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/4e93006d466cb2f6a53325cba8e27b63/&#34;&gt;License To Kill (1989)&lt;/a&gt;; looking forward to Brosnan next! Caught the Matt Damon film &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/c7033ad094d89afab1a8e1abcb2c3015/&#34;&gt;Downsizing (2017)&lt;/a&gt; because I was stuck in a waiting room, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/07/cb5279cfdbc686e55eef33bd58e8aaeb/&#34;&gt;Under Siege (1992)&lt;/a&gt; because the Saturday gaming group decided we can do watch-alongs while playing our online boardgames. I actually have been paying attention to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/&#34;&gt;r/movies&lt;/a&gt; lately so I keep wanting to actually watch more movies, let&amp;rsquo;s see if that happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managed to catch up with most of the Arrowverse stuff this week. That&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Flash&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Legends of Tomorrow&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Superman and Lois&lt;/strong&gt; (Supergirl still on hiatus). Current season rankings: S&amp;amp;L &amp;gt;  Legends &amp;gt; Flash. These shows are pretty good to have in the background while I do other stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dove into the Frozen Wilds DLC for &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4! Apparently I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too tired of the game yet, despite playing it for over two months now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still playing &lt;strong&gt;Guilty Gear Strive&lt;/strong&gt;. Wrote some words about it &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/fg-complex-ggs/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular Saturday group played some &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/blood-rage/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/a&gt; this weekend, same as last weekend. I finally rolled Lizard Cult in random select!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still managing to avoid Steam Sale damage! (A few days still remain.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: Finished reading: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/linchpin/&#34;&gt;Linchpin by Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;strong&gt;Einstein&amp;rsquo;s Dreams&lt;/strong&gt; by Alan Lightman (will probably write a short review this week)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No online quiz night for the trivia team this week, although we&amp;rsquo;ve still been regularly doing the Saturday NY Times crossword and spelling bee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Loki, Rick and Morty, etc episodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black Widow is out this week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New set Adventures in the Forgotten Realms drops this week on Magic Arena! I&amp;rsquo;m not a big D&amp;amp;D fan (though I am a bit familiar), so I&amp;rsquo;m not super hyped specifically for the set, but any shakeup to constructed formats is welcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s almost July, which means 2021 is just about halfway done, and yet here we still are in pandemic mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-quote&#34;&gt;A quote&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Each year that passes rings you inwardly with memory and might. Wield your heart, and the world will tremble.&amp;rdquo; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://scryfall.com/card/lrw/247/doran-the-siege-tower&#34;&gt;Doran the Siege Tower&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last Thursday, former PH President Noynoy Aquino III &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/former-president-benigno-aquino-iii-dies&#34;&gt;passed away quietly&lt;/a&gt;. This led to the usual condolences and accolades from across the political spectrum, although many noted the delay in the palace issuing a statement (I suspect it was because the current president was still asleep). Many of his friends and supporters came out with stories of his time in office, many portraying him as misunderstood, uncharismatic, and quiet; holding his emotions close to his chest, but devoted to the job. My favorite entry is &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.abs-cbn.com/ancx/culture/spotlight/06/25/21/pnoy-was-my-boss-a-delayed-dispatch-from-a-palace-speechwriter&#34;&gt;this post by his former speechwriter&lt;/a&gt;. His legacy was tainted by several problems and a lot of black propaganda near the tail end of his term, leading many online to preface their accolades with phrases like &amp;ldquo;He wasn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, but&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, perhaps to avoid being tagged with the divisive &amp;ldquo;Dilawan&amp;rdquo; label or to avoid being targetted by the hordes of online trolls. This is silly; no one is perfect, so &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1408053878579294208/&#34;&gt;such a preface is unnecessary&lt;/a&gt;. All presidents have their pros and cons, their accomplishments and faults, but Noynoy was unquestionably better overall than his murderous successor, and arguably over his probably corrupt predecessor as well. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2010/05/elections-2010-my-ballot/&#34;&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t vote for him&lt;/a&gt; in 2010, and I had my fair share of criticisms especially over &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/01/685359171198308352/&#34;&gt;his transport policies&lt;/a&gt;, but the man deserved better. (Maybe the political opponents are worried about &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/treseroApol/status/1408079723591258113&#34;&gt;prophecy&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Actually managed to watch three movies this week: the just-released-on-Netflix &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/rurouni-kenshin-final/&#34;&gt;Rurouni Kenshin: The Final (2021)&lt;/a&gt;, final Moore Bond film &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/7d38789afe70956e56d61914ed7d195a/&#34;&gt;A View To A Kill (1985)&lt;/a&gt;; and the very poorly reviewed &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/2789a7cda3fd16feca84b58fae45811b/&#34;&gt;Transformers: The Last Knight: 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also managed to finish binge-watching the award-winning comedy &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/schitts-creek/&#34;&gt;Schitt&amp;rsquo;s Creek&lt;/a&gt; and also catch up on &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1409018870111768584/&#34;&gt;Boku No Hero Academia season 5&lt;/a&gt;. This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/schitts-creek/&#34;&gt;Loki&lt;/a&gt; was still meh for me, I need more exciting MCU stuff! &lt;strong&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/strong&gt; first episode for the season was ok, but it led to some discussions with friends about how it&amp;rsquo;s a very mean-spirited show lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally finished the main game of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1407592883184488451/&#34;&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/a&gt; on PS4! I was thinking of taking a break from the game afterwards, since I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing it for like 2 months now, but a friend insisted I do the Frozen Wilds DLC (I assume because it&amp;rsquo;s good?!?) so I might do that and maybe also attempt a Platinum run?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still playing &lt;strong&gt;Guilty Gear Strive&lt;/strong&gt; during weeknights and generally being a scrub online. At least I&amp;rsquo;m using a second character now!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular Saturday group played some &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/blood-rage/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/a&gt; this weekend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steam Sale is ongoing right now, but my discipline is holding and no damage so far, though I am considering Hades and some other small games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: Still reading: &lt;strong&gt;Linchpin&lt;/strong&gt; by Seth Godin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia team got third place in this week&amp;rsquo;s comedy-themed About Quiz and third place overall for the current season. Could be better!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Loki, Rick and Morty, etc episodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a few more family errands and escort missions to do this week, and probably a few more in the weeks to come. Kind of disruptive to the daily rhythms, but it is what it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Today is father&amp;rsquo;s day. If you&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough to have a good father in your life, be sure to show your appreciation. Today&amp;rsquo;s weeknotes are shorter than usual for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;

The admin is all like &amp;ldquo;ha ha we don&amp;rsquo;t care, you have no basis, we won&amp;rsquo;t cooperate, etc etc&amp;rdquo;, but despite the posturing, it kind of feels like they&amp;rsquo;re a bit scared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the pandemic front, NCR is now on GCQ &amp;ldquo;with less restrictions&amp;rdquo; mode or whatever it is they&amp;rsquo;re calling it this week. NCR cases are going down (but still a lot), but cases in Visayas and Mindanao are on the rise. Davao in particular is a hotspot, and coincidentally, it looks the bulk of what little Pfizer we had is going there too. Luckily, just today the government announced they&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1448436/ph-seals-deal-for-40-m-doses-of-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine&#34;&gt;sealed a deal for 40M more Pfizer doses&lt;/a&gt;; hopefully they arrive in a timely manner as that should greatly help with vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In comic book news, Batman got into a bit of controversy this week when &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JoeOtterson/status/1404495349520244736&#34;&gt;DC apparently claims there are certain things he just can&amp;rsquo;t do&lt;/a&gt;. Zack Snyder tried &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ZackSnyder/status/1405702805948538881&#34;&gt;to get in on the fun&lt;/a&gt; but nobody knows where he got that image.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Seems like I had a relatively chill / relaxed week, which is good because last week was a bit stressful. I did have a bunch of family errands and escort missions to do, but nothing too major.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;; this week, I had fun drawing Spider-man villain Sandman playing around in a sandcastle:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Only one movie again this week, continuing the James Bond run: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1639118365d91bdbd1a41eb9b170a9a0/&#34;&gt;Octopussy (1983)&lt;/a&gt;. Only one more Moore to go! I also wanted to watch &lt;strong&gt;Rurouni Kenshin: The Final&lt;/strong&gt;, which came out on PH Netflix last Friday, but haven&amp;rsquo;t found the time yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My regular background watching this week was seasons 2 and 3 of &lt;strong&gt;Schitt&amp;rsquo;s Creek&lt;/strong&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;m already halfway through season 4 now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s episode of &lt;strong&gt;Loki&lt;/strong&gt; felt a bit meh and mostly setup, but I must admit I am enjoying Owen Wilson&amp;rsquo;s performance and his back-and-forth with Tom Hiddleston.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spent the week clearing up all the pending non-main quest stuff in &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4, including the hunting trials and all the collectibles. I believe only main quest and ancient armory remain. Still have yet to do any Frozen Wilds content though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular Saturday group played some &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/blood-rage/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/a&gt; this weekend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Been playing &lt;strong&gt;Guilty Gear Strive&lt;/strong&gt; on a regular basis during weeknights. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get through all the missions since GGS is fairly complicated with a lot of systems and mechanics, and the missions are very good as a tutorial. I typically do a few missions per night then play around 9 games online (3 sets vs 3 different opponents). I am not very good at the game, but I am having fun, and I really like how it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to find matches compared to SFV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: Still reading: &lt;strong&gt;Linchpin&lt;/strong&gt; by Seth Godin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia team got second place in this week&amp;rsquo;s comedy-themed About Quiz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got some positive feedback this week on some stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve done, in a couple of different realms. Positive feedback is always great, tell people if you enjoy their work!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Loki episode this wednesday!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Rick and Morty season beings this week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two quiz nights this coming week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;These weeknotes are being published a day late, for reasons that will be discussed later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-quote&#34;&gt;A quote&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The price of being a sheep is boredom. The price of being a wolf is loneliness. Choose one or the other with great care.&amp;rdquo; - Hugh MacLeod&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early last week, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/fastly-outage-shows-web-still-vulnerable-to-key-provider-failure?sref=E9Urfma4&#34;&gt;a slew of big websites went offline due to some problems at a CDN&lt;/a&gt;, which is some kind of testament to the problems with centralization, but my favorite part of that story was that tech news site &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; did their reporting from a Google doc during the outage but they &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1402221764776714243&#34;&gt;accidentally tweeted the edit link instead&lt;/a&gt; so for a short while everyone was reporting for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kim Jong-Un &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.yahoo.com/kim-jong-un-calls-k-121112259.html&#34;&gt;called K-Pop a &amp;ldquo;vicious cancer&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Not saying I agree or disagree (hey, let K-Pop fans have their fun!), but it would be so amusing if K-Pop really does bring down the North Korean regime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple is introducing a new &amp;ldquo;privacy relay&amp;rdquo; feature which for some reason related to regulations &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/roytang/status/1402080413628071936/&#34;&gt;they can&amp;rsquo;t apply to the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a local newborn was named HTML, as in &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/roytang/status/1403247589395296258/&#34;&gt;HyperText Markup Language&lt;/a&gt;. This got some people digging out that time there was one family named &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.abs-cbn.com/lifestyle/01/10/14/meet-siblings-macaroni-85-spaghetti-88-sincerely-yours-98&#34;&gt;Macaroni 85, Spaghetti 88 and Sincerely Yours 98&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last Saturday was Philippine Independence Day. On the same day, opposition coalition 1Sambayan &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/06/12/2104994/1sambayan-reveals-6-nominees-president-vice-president-2022&#34;&gt;nominated 6 people to run for president or vice president in the elections next year&lt;/a&gt;. Many have expressed misgivings about some of their choices. While I think it&amp;rsquo;s way too early for this kind of positioning, I think I would seriously consider any of these people should they decide to run, except for Villanueva lol.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2019: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/06/us-2019-theme-parks/&#34;&gt;We went to Disneyland!&lt;/a&gt;. This was the last time I was out of the country.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2018: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/06/kuala-lumpur-and-the-mtg25a-rptq/&#34;&gt;We went to Kuala Lumpur to play in an RPTQ!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2017: I finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2017/06/review-persona-5-you-never-saw-it-coming/&#34;&gt;Persona 5&lt;/a&gt;! Wow, it&amp;rsquo;s already 4 years ago. I haven&amp;rsquo;t played Royal yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2014: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2014/06/476353556467814400/&#34;&gt;I got an Instagram account&lt;/a&gt; because someone else used my email to sign up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2010: I scrubbed out of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2010/06/16035828372/&#34;&gt;Grand Prix Manila 2010&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently this is the one Grand Prix I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a blog post for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2009: Magic introduces &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2009/06/2104577047/&#34;&gt;the M10 rules changes&lt;/a&gt;, damage no longer uses the stack!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Okay, so the reason this post is delayed is because I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1404312180720226305/&#34;&gt;did another game jam this weekend&lt;/a&gt; and only made the submission around 10pm last night so that kind of used up most of my weekend time. I&amp;rsquo;ll do a separate post about the game jam sometime this week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;, though I had to skip the past two days because of the game jam thingy, so I&amp;rsquo;m behind again, which isn&amp;rsquo;t unusual. I did use up the free draw friday slot to draw the splash screen art for the game jam entry:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;            
        
    

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Managed another James Bond film this week: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/2641c1868d6ccb70715302ea340cae74/&#34;&gt;For Your Eyes Only (1981)&lt;/a&gt;. I think we&amp;rsquo;re only a couple of films away from the end of Moore&amp;rsquo;s tenure, then it&amp;rsquo;s two Daltons, and finally the modern era (i.e. the ones where I actually caught some of them on film) of Pierce Brosnan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For my background watching during the game jam weekend, I watched the first season of &lt;strong&gt;Schitt&amp;rsquo;s Creek&lt;/strong&gt;, which I&amp;rsquo;ve heard good things about. The first season was ok, so I went ahead and queued up the next two season too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last Wednesday was the first episode of &lt;strong&gt;Loki&lt;/strong&gt;! I enjoy this slow drip of MCU content, and the Timekeepers/TVA add a new aspect to the MCU&amp;rsquo;s universe/multiverse. One can&amp;rsquo;t help but think the multiversal status quo will be upset at the end of this series though, especially given some of the rumors about future films.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last week I shared a video of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1BneeJTDcU&#34;&gt;Bo Burnham&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Welcome to the Internet&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and this week I decided to watch his special &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Inside&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; on Netflix, from where the song came from. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty good, and probably took him forever to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;m close to the end game in the main quest of &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4, but I&amp;rsquo;m spending some time cleaning up quests and collecting collectibles and such. Still playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; with the regular Saturday group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last Friday I went ahead and purchased &lt;strong&gt;Guilty Gear Strive&lt;/strong&gt; on Steam. Was only able to play a few games online before I had to do the game jam stuff, but at least I managed to win my first ranked match! I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to have this replace the daily Street Fighter games I used to do, except hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to find matches since it&amp;rsquo;s a new release. And of course, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping I actually get good at it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: I started reading &lt;strong&gt;Linchpin&lt;/strong&gt; by Seth Godin which is a book from like 2008, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had a copy of it since forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia team only got sixth place in last weekend&amp;rsquo;s About Quiz, because we always do poorly when it&amp;rsquo;s horror themed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Loki episode this wednesday!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s E3 this past weekend and this week, I think, so there should be a lot of gaming news. Although given my massive gaming backlogs, I&amp;rsquo;m not often excited by new game announcements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;a-quote&#34;&gt;A quote&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Ernest Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week was the anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JeromeTaylor/status/1400791730685845511&#34;&gt;a recent tweet&lt;/a&gt; highlighted how the HK government, which used to freely allow commemorating the event, is now cracking down on the former colony&amp;rsquo;s freedoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/&#34;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2021/06/02/kinda-a-big-announcement/&#34;&gt;been sold to an investment company&lt;/a&gt;. The Q&amp;amp;A site founded by Joel Spolsky and Jeff &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/codinghorror/&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;@codinghorror&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; Atwood completely changed everyday software development when it launched in 2008. To this day, there are numerous programmer memes about how programmers can&amp;rsquo;t get anything done without Stackoverflow (and also the corresponding memes about how hostile Stackoverflow responses can be). Hopefully the founders selling the site doesn&amp;rsquo;t cause any major negative changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/89.0/releasenotes/&#34;&gt;New version of Firefox released&lt;/a&gt;, which came with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1400620815381524480/&#34;&gt;a UI refresh I&amp;rsquo;m not fond of&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local fast food giant Jollibee &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.tv5.com.ph/breaking/read/latest-buzz-netizens-react-to-fried-towel-from-fast-food-chain-company-apologizes1&#34;&gt;found itself in trouble this past week&lt;/a&gt; as a post complaining about a woman&amp;rsquo;s order of fried chicken instead being replaced with a fried&amp;hellip; towel?? went viral. Hard to imagine how that could have happened. A friend says the woman who ordered is a friend of his sister&amp;rsquo;s (chismis-chain much) and he says the family was approached by several lawyers and even by local hustler-trying-to-replace-the-justice-system Tulfo hoping to cash in on the phenomenon. A second post that said &amp;ldquo;our competitor threw in the towel&amp;rdquo; went viral and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ABSCBNNews/status/1400686251834028042&#34;&gt;McDonald&amp;rsquo;s had to deny it was them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manila Mayor Isko Moreno &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/6/2/Isko-urges-government-to-drop-use-of-face-shield.html&#34;&gt;urged the gov&amp;rsquo;t to scrap the face shield requirement&lt;/a&gt;. I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s the sort of the thing this admin wouldn&amp;rsquo;t rollback &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1400083631519850498/&#34;&gt;out of pride&lt;/a&gt;. I did get &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1400719659335229441/&#34;&gt;a kind of funny story about the face shield requirement&lt;/a&gt; early in the pandemic though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Isolated cases&amp;rdquo;: A local policeman &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/6/1/Police-shooting-Hensie-Zinampan.html&#34;&gt;to face murder charges after he was caught on video killing a 52-year old woman while he was drunk&lt;/a&gt;. The New PNP chief &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/pnp-chief-eleazar-berates-cop-killed-lilybeth-zinampan&#34;&gt;made a whole show of berating the cop&lt;/a&gt;. Not 6 months ago, the same cop posted that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/metro/789809/police-who-shot-52-year-old-woman-in-qc-i-m-proud-to-be-a-good-cop/story/&#34;&gt;he was &amp;ldquo;proud to be a good cop&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; following a case of another cop shooting his neighbors. While the PNP were busy saying people shouldn&amp;rsquo;t judge all cops for the sins of the few, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/manilabulletin/status/1399663750781669378&#34;&gt;another cop kills a different cop in a drunk shootout&lt;/a&gt;. I think they just &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1399693989582835713/&#34;&gt;shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be allowed to drink while carrying firearms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

My interest in this is purely because they used Hugo to generate more than a million static pages, and it looks their performance was much better than anything I ever got with the 20k+ pages on this site. I think it&amp;rsquo;s because they&amp;rsquo;re strictly generating a single page per record - while this site has stuff like listing pages, group pages, tag pages, archive lists and so on.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2020: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hedonometer/status/1266774310565425154&#34;&gt;The saddest day in the history of Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2015: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2015/06/10153840295903912-0/&#34;&gt;I got a driver&amp;rsquo;s license for the first time&lt;/a&gt;. I still don&amp;rsquo;t drive a car.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2010: I made &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2010/06/15378392570/&#34;&gt;my first Steam purchase!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last Thursday, everyone in the household has received their second vaccine dose. Hooray!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After my recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1396076491021058050/&#34;&gt;fitbit strap troubles&lt;/a&gt; I had a new problem with it: the charger stopped working! Wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a surprise, since I&amp;rsquo;ve been having trouble with it for the past few months. I just immediately ordered a new one, these are way cheaper than a new strap. I did lose a couple of days of Fitbit data before it came in though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After struggling through the terrible summer heat, we finally decided to get our one airconditioner in the house repaired, just in time for the onset of the rainy season. Oh well, at least I saved a lot on the electricity bill which &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2011/06/75920863496646656/&#34;&gt;has historically been very high in May&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;, though I spent most of the week catching up on sketch backlogs from the previous week. I caught up, but I&amp;rsquo;m a couple behind again today! Anyway, here&amp;rsquo;s a memorial of that time Trump played with an orb:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Advanced my James Bond agenda a bit this past week by watching the very campy &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/cbb6135fa20b48a488982eccc7df76ce/&#34;&gt;Moonraker (1979)&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve now crossed over into &amp;ldquo;Bond movies released when I was alive&amp;rdquo; territory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only one movie this week, but I did also manage to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1400634591166156805/&#34;&gt;binge the final season of Kim&amp;rsquo;s Convenience&lt;/a&gt; and also have been running the new Jeopardy episodes on Netflix in the background while I do other stuff, am about halfway through them. Also managed to get caught up with Legends of Tomorrow, Supergirl and Flash. What&amp;rsquo;s that, more episodes are coming?!?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still playing a bunch of &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4 and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; with the regular Saturday group. I should pick up something new for playing on the PC maybe?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tried to go for Master rank in Eternal at the end of the last month, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1399629350140407812/&#34;&gt;failed miserably&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: I finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/and-then-there-were-none/&#34;&gt;another Agatha Christie book&lt;/a&gt; this past week. Not yet sure what to read next. Should probably transition into some nonfiction again?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia team joined a sci-fi themed quiz this week but we only finished second. More interestingly, we recently got into doing the NYT crossword together. Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHbisLNf5C8&amp;amp;t=89s&#34;&gt;a couple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRmYf0r6Y4E&#34;&gt;of videos&lt;/a&gt;. Like and subscribe to the Youtube channel!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spent some time this weekend working on a personal project that I can&amp;rsquo;t really talk about publicly. I am learning a lot though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loki starts on Disney+ on June 9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guilty Gear Strive releases June 11! Still trying to convince myself to get it lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trese is also out on Netflix this weekend. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;d watch it, but a lot of my friends are fans and are looking forward to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am planning to join the &lt;a href=&#34;https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2021&#34;&gt;GMTK Game Jam&lt;/a&gt; next weekend (Jun 11). Same as &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/ludum-dare-48-diver/&#34;&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt; I have low expectations. I recently rewatched the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGeAkU2wu4o&#34;&gt;video of the top games from last year&amp;rsquo;s version of this jam&lt;/a&gt; and everything seems so great, hopefully I can come up with some innovative idea too!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;June is almost upon us, hopefully bringing some respite from the scorching summer heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year feels like it&amp;rsquo;s passing by very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-quote&#34;&gt;A quote&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a vitality, a life force, an energy, a quickening that is translated through you into action, and because there is only one of you in all of time, this expression is unique. And if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium and it will be lost. The world will not have it. It is not your business to determine how good it is nor how valuable nor how it compares with other expressions. It is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly, to keep the channel open. &amp;ndash; Martha Graham, quoted by Agnes DeMille&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Belarus earned the ire of non-authoritarian states anywhere &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.metafilter.com/191570/The-death-penalty-awaits-me-Belarus-diverts-plane-to-arrest-journalist&#34;&gt;when they diverted a plane to arrest an opposition journalist&lt;/a&gt;. Belarus is ruled by president Lukashenko, who has held the office since it was created in 1994 (!), and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.euronews.com/2021/05/26/lukashenko-is-turning-belarus-into-the-north-korea-of-europe-says-sviatlana-tsikhanouskaya&#34;&gt;critics have said he is turning Belarus into the North Korea of Europe&lt;/a&gt;. My only experience with Belarus before was that I used to work with a company that had a remote dev team in Minsk, during which I was surprised by how third-world their consulting rates were, compared to the rest of Europe. Now that I know they&amp;rsquo;re ruled by a tin-pot dictator, I&amp;rsquo;m no longer surprised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tech: Google &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/google-photos-unlimited-storage-ending-amazon-microsoft-adobe.html&#34;&gt;is going to remove unlimited photo storage by June 1&lt;/a&gt;. After reading this, I decided to also clean up some large files from my Google Drive, since the disk quota is now going to be shared across Photos, Drive and GMail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have any covid19 updates today. Cases are starting to tick up again though now that restrictions have been loosened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Pretty sure already read this when it came out last year, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve shared it yet: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jan/28/question-time-my-life-as-a-quiz-obsessive&#34;&gt;The Guardian article about quizzing subculture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

A lot of these seem to be marketing people, which isn&amp;rsquo;t really my cup of tea, but I&amp;rsquo;ll go through the list when I have time, maybe there&amp;rsquo;ll be some nice surprises.&lt;/li&gt;

I ordered a new one as soon as it broke last Friday. The package arrived today! And&amp;hellip; I accidentally ordered a small size when I needed a large lol. I can still use it by pairing with the unbroken half of my old strap, but still, pretty dumb of me. =/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;, although I&amp;rsquo;m starting to have trouble keeping up, I was a couple of days behind for most of the week yesterday. I liked this one I did of a kid on a giant chessboard, but playing around with the perspective guide on Procreate really made the final sketch weird:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Still playing a bunch of &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4 (probably only halfway through the main game content) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; with the regular Saturday group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Been losing a bunch on &lt;strong&gt;Street Fighter V&lt;/strong&gt; so I&amp;rsquo;m taking a break. Been thinking of getting into a different fighting game, preferably one with a more active playerbase so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to spend an hour trying to find more than one opponent. Coincidentally, Guilty Gear Strive comes out in June! We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: I finished a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/orient-express-nile/&#34;&gt;couple of Hercule Poirot books&lt;/a&gt; recently. Not yet sure what I&amp;rsquo;m reading next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re following my &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/triviastorm&#34;&gt;twitter triviabot&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m planning to reset the scores and start a new season at the end of month (i.e. tomorrow)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my parents are getting their second vaccine dose this week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the last week of May (more or less), and I&amp;rsquo;m mostly looking forward to a new month because I&amp;rsquo;m tired of ridiculous summer heat and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping the sun tones it down a bit in June. The one aircon we have in the house has been busted all summer, so we have been suffering through the heat and surviving mostly through stacking multiple fans and also an excessive number of showers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-quote&#34;&gt;A quote&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We must be willing to let go of the life we planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us.” ― Joseph Campbell &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2014/05/468028741092794373/&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Israel finally &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-ceasefire-palestinians-gaza-survey-destruction/&#34;&gt;agreed to a ceasefire in the Gaza strip&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly afterwards, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ajplus/status/1395716586342948865&#34;&gt;Israeli police stormed the Al-Aqsa mosque&lt;/a&gt;, claiming &amp;ldquo;there were riots&amp;rdquo;.&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://nypost.com/2021/05/21/amid-tentative-ceasefire-hamas-claims-victory-over-israel/&#34;&gt;Hamas claimed victory&lt;/a&gt;. As an example of how the pro-Israeli slant towards these issues is starting to shift, &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.yahoo.com/john-oliver-condemns-israeli-attacks-184359089.html&#34;&gt;John Oliver condemned the Israeli attacks&lt;/a&gt;. All in all, still a very complicated situation; if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in further reading, Andy Baio put together &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/1393630514469244929&#34;&gt;a list of stuff to read on the topic&lt;/a&gt;. One can only hope the ceasefire holds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local pandemic stuff: After people mobbed a vaccination site distributing Pfizer jabs, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1433727/doh-suggests-no-vaccine-brand-announcement-in-jab-site&#34;&gt;DOH declared that LGUs should not announce ahead of time the brand of vaccine to be used at vax sites&lt;/a&gt;, a directive that is problematic at best. Not everyone can get every vaccine, and this seems like it would just waste people&amp;rsquo;s time if they go to a site only to find out what&amp;rsquo;s there won&amp;rsquo;t work for them. I understand trying to reduce vaccine hesitancy, but that can be solved by more transparency and explanations of efficacy and vaccine safety, not less. I did get &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/first-sinovac-dose/&#34;&gt;sinovac myself&lt;/a&gt;, but I do understand the sentiment of prefering the Western brands due to the supposed higher efficacy and effectiveness in preventing transmission. Personally, I just want as many people as possible to get vaccinated, using any brands that are available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vaccination drive (and overall pandemic response) still feels pretty tepid, but at least &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/HerdImmunityPH/status/1395997730556682241&#34;&gt;the vaccination rate is starting to tick up&lt;/a&gt;. Actually hitting the wall of vaccine hesitancy might be a good problem to have soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This weekend was Eurovision, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/05/1129879612534558726/&#34;&gt;something I don&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;get&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, but it got me thinking: why don&amp;rsquo;t we have some kind of Asian equivalent, an &amp;ldquo;Asia-vision&amp;rdquo; if you will. I suspect the authoritarian states won&amp;rsquo;t like it though, as the venue might be used to publicize their nefarious deeds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-strange-story-of-dagobert-the-ducktales-bandit&#34;&gt;Fascinating story about a late 80s extortionist criminal who went by the name &amp;ldquo;Dagobert&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, named after the German name of Scrooge McDuck.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Making the rounds on Twitter this week: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/angryasianman/status/1395490103913377794/&#34;&gt;The Linda Lindas, a band of young girls, performs &amp;ldquo;Racist, Sexist Boy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; (in a library of some kind). &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3msSlr4PkDE&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the whole set&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was recently reminded of this story from a couple of months back: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dreams_of_sloth/status/1377051721655066629&#34;&gt;A new hire joined a software company, fix a bug that&amp;rsquo;s been bugging him from before the job, then promptly filed his two week&amp;rsquo;s notice&lt;/a&gt;. There is a bit of romantic adventurism here, as I imagine retiring to become a legendary wandering software developer, travelling from company to company, smiting bugs and vanishing just as quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netflix released &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUy0RgeggCQ&#34;&gt;the official trailer for Trese&lt;/a&gt;, an upcmong anime based on a Filipino comic. I&amp;rsquo;m not particularly looking forward to it and I haven&amp;rsquo;t read the source material, but a lot of my friends are hyped about it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My Fitbit strap broke off yesterday morning. I immediately ordered a new one on Lazada before thinking &amp;ldquo;wait, I&amp;rsquo;ve only had this one for around half a year, that seems ridiculous&amp;rdquo;. So I cancelled the order, and instead asked someone to help me &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1396076491021058050/&#34;&gt;apply a DIY fix&lt;/a&gt;. (I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it myself due to poor manual dexterity.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of Fitbit, now that I&amp;rsquo;m fully vaccinated and the NCR case rates are going down again, I&amp;rsquo;ve resumed taking at least some of my walks outside our subdivision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;, once again falling behind on the weekends. Briefly considered just breaking the streak and living with it, but no! The 365 counter is a commitment to doing at least a year of these! As today&amp;rsquo;s sample, here&amp;rsquo;s Batman getting vaccinated:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: This week I watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/ea715fa4d23937c15e47022adf93e192/&#34;&gt;The Spy Who Loved Me (1977)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/09b5a24d69042602b9ac909e277987a6/&#34;&gt;Mortal Kombat (2021)&lt;/a&gt;. My James Bond run is now officially crossing over into the &amp;ldquo;movies released after I born&amp;rdquo; territory. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping I can somehow get through the rest of them before the latest one (No Time To Die) comes out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still playing a bunch of &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4 and &lt;strong&gt;Street Fighter V&lt;/strong&gt; on Steam and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; with the regular Saturday group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still looking for a single-player game to play and stream on twitch when Arena limited is off season, so that I&amp;rsquo;m not only doing Arena streams for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading&lt;/strong&gt;: I finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/c72ceb2e3748ccd8611baab1cbfdfe74/&#34;&gt;What Matters Now, compiled by Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt;, a quick and easy read. After that, I decided to delve into some Agatha Christie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had quiz night last night, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t do particularly well, about the same as the previous week. There is another online quiz night announced and scheduled for next week, by a different group, with topics that we like, but we are hesitant because they have an increased entry fee which is supposed to contribute to a prize pool. Doing online trivia for charity or just for fun has been okay, but I&amp;rsquo;m not really comfortable competing for cash prizes, given that it&amp;rsquo;s all done online and it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to police whether the participants are googling or have a whole army sitting behind them or such. That&amp;rsquo;s also true even if there weren&amp;rsquo;t a prize, but having the prize just gives a lot more incentive for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of trivia for fun, this past week I migrated the &lt;a href=&#34;https://triviastorm.net/&#34;&gt;triviastorm&lt;/a&gt; site back-end code in order to merge it with this site&amp;rsquo;s backend. The motivation for this was to resolve some memory issues on my cheap DigitalOcean droplet; basically running two Django instances meant I was using twice as much memory as necessary. After merging the backends, I replaced the front end of the triviastorm site with a new VueJS-based static site. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write a blog post about VueJS as well, and dipping my toes into it again helped me solidify some thoughts, will probably do sometimes this coming week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern Horizons 2 spoilers (not that I expect to be playing Modern any time soon)&lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;a-quote&#34;&gt;A quote&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who has never killed an hour? Not casually or without thought, but carefully: a premeditated murder of minutes. The violence comes from a combination of giving up, not caring, and a resignation that getting past it is all you can hope to accomplish. So you kill the hour. You do not work, you do not read, you do not daydream. If you sleep it is not because you need to sleep. And when at last it is over, there is no evidence: no weapon, no blood, and no body. The only clue might be the shadows beneath your eyes or a terribly thin line near the corner of your mouth indicating something has been suffered, that in the privacy of your life you have lost something and the loss is too empty to share.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Mark Z. Danielewski, House of Leaves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Violence escalated in the Israel-occupied Gaza strip over the past week, as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-airstrike-gaza-kills-8-children-u-s-envoy-arrives-n1267490&#34;&gt;IDF bombarded Palestinian-occupied civilian areas and buildings&lt;/a&gt; (including a building housing the Associated Press and al-Jazeera) supposedly in retaliation for missile strikes from Hamas. I won&amp;rsquo;t pretend to be knowledgable in the history and complexities of the Israel-Palestine conflicts. We kind of grew up in a world where the international media narrative has almost always had a pro-Israel slant (especially since the US government tends to support them), so our opinions are often biased in that direction. But this time feels different, this time feels like the state of Israel is losing control of the narrative and more and more people are supporting the Palestinians. I would suggest anyone who has grown up exposed to the pro-Israel narrative to start following some sources espousing the POV from the Palestinian/Arab world. I personally follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tha_rami&#34;&gt;Rami Ismail&lt;/a&gt;, an indie gamedev who happens to be Muslim, his coverage of the current crisis over the past few days has been insightful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, in the US &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ransomware-attack-on-pipeline-propels-gas-to-near-3-a-gallon/&#34;&gt;a gas pipeline fell victim to a ransomware attack&lt;/a&gt;, causing people to worry about a gas shortage and apparently start &lt;a href=&#34;https://god.dailydot.com/americans-freaking-gas-shortage/&#34;&gt;pumping gas into plastic bags&lt;/a&gt;. Eh, what?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US CDC has issued guidance that vaccinated people are no longer required to wear masks indoors, but apparently this relies on some sort of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ryanstruyk/status/1392952564514238467&#34;&gt;honesty system&lt;/a&gt;. Not sure this is going to end well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lockdown restrictions are being lowered in the NCR+ bubble, and the powers-that-be have decided to define an entirely new classification level &amp;ldquo;GCQ with heightened restrictions&amp;rdquo;. Meanwhile, Singapore and Taiwan are increasing their lockdown levels because they got a few dozen cases. The contrast is stark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Cory Doctorow writes about &lt;a href=&#34;https://doctorow.medium.com/the-memex-method-238c71f2fb46&#34;&gt;The Memex Method&lt;/a&gt; (warning: Medium), basically reflections on 20+ years of blogging and how it has affected his thinking and note taking and such.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big of Doctorow as a blogger and have been basically following him since his days at &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/blogs-of-yesteryear/&#34;&gt;Boing-Boing&lt;/a&gt;. It feels like we&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging for around the same time, but he&amp;rsquo;s gone a lot further with the practice. I wish I had the energy and capacity he has for the regular, daily blogging and linksharing that he does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of Doctorow, I like &lt;a href=&#34;https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/08/copyfraud/#beethoven-just-wrote-music&#34;&gt;his recent discussion of how copyright filters lead to wage theft&lt;/a&gt;. Excerpt:

&lt;p&gt;The impossibility of automating copyright judgments didn&amp;rsquo;t stop Google from trying to perfect its filter, adding layers of complexity until Content ID&amp;rsquo;s appeal process turned into a cod-legal system whose flowchart looks like a bowl of spaghetti. &amp;hellip; The resulting mess firmly favors attackers (wage stealers, fraudsters, censors, bullies) over defenders (creators, critics). Attackers don&amp;rsquo;t need to waste their time making art, which leaves them with the surplus capacity to master the counterintuitive &amp;ldquo;legal&amp;rdquo; framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;StumbledUpon used to be a thing, and there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://stumbled.cc/stumble&#34;&gt;a new site&lt;/a&gt; that kind of aims to be a spiritual successor I guess? I haven&amp;rsquo;t found anything interesting yet in my few rolls though.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent most of my afternoon yesterday &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/going-merry-kit/&#34;&gt;putting together this One Piece ship model kit I got in Japan back in 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;, although I am once again behind by a day or so, something that seems to typically happen on the weekend. My favorite sketch this past week may have been this one I did of ramen noodles:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: This week I watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/ba2999c2cc9d8803ad982d24e52035e6/&#34;&gt;The Man With The Golden Gun (1974)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1392042759863689217/&#34;&gt;The Mitchells vs The Machines (2021)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still playing a bunch of &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4 and &lt;strong&gt;Street Fighter V&lt;/strong&gt; on Steam. Kind of stuck in a rut with Balrog (Boxer), need to leve up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currently looking for a single-player game to play and stream on twitch when Arena limited is off season, so that I&amp;rsquo;m not only doing Arena streams for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had quiz night last night, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t do particularly well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did some more work on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://triviastorm.net/&#34;&gt;triviastorm&lt;/a&gt; back-end code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh, nothing in particular I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to this week. Anything I missed?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This post is being published a day late. Things happen okay? Sometimes you get busy and things need to be pushed back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;like the thug that he is, our dear president &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1390134185222832132/&#34;&gt;claimed that the arbitral award ruling in the PH&amp;rsquo;s favor was nothing more than a sheet of paper he could easily discard&lt;/a&gt;. He also challenged former justice Antonio Carpio to a debate over the West Philippine Sea issue, a challenge the latter quickly accepted. As basically everyone expected, Duterte later chickened out, and offered his spokesman Roque as a distraction, er, proxy for the debate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debris from a Chinese rocket was expected to crash back into Earth sometime this weekend, but no one could predict when or where. Some of my chat groups remarked that if it hits the PH, we are well and truly cursed. It finally landed in the Indian Ocean yesterday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controversial billionaire Elon Musk hosted SNL this weekend and for some reason, this caused Dogecoin to crash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bill and Melinda Gates announced they are divorcing. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1389349579091365888/&#34;&gt;timing is suspicious&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the tech world, enterprise software maker Basecamp got into a bit of brouhaha this past week after a policy announcement of &amp;ldquo;no politics discussion at work&amp;rdquo; eventually led to around a third of their workforce choosing to resign. Casey Newton has &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406673/basecamp-political-speech-policy-controversy&#34;&gt;a great writeup about it&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a big disappointment because the founders of Basecamp have always had a reputation of promoting positive workplace practices, including a book titled &amp;ldquo;It Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Have to Be Crazy At Work&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-29/ignoring-the-rules-sometimes-works-for-elon-musk&#34;&gt;Money Stuff a while back&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;On the other hand, if you send out those cars to drive themselves everywhere and they all crash and kill a bunch of people, that will be bad! You will be in bad trouble. “It’s better to ask forgiveness than to ask permission,” you will say, but this is not quite right; maybe it is better to announce success and then smugly add “sorry we didn’t tell you first,” but it is strictly worse to fail catastrophically and apologize. If you are going to fail it is better to ask permission, because forgiveness will not be forthcoming. If you are going to succeed, sure, it is better to ask forgiveness. “There’s nothing to forgive, you’re perfect, you little scamp,” everyone will reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are doing some bold novel thing, you probably do not know, ex ante, if you will succeed or fail. Therefore you do not know, ex ante, if you should ask permission or forgiveness, if you should follow the law or not. But if you are the founder and chief executive officer of a company whose goal is to do some bold novel thing, you have been selected and encouraged precisely for your borderline-crazy optimism and self-confidence. You can’t do impossible things unless you first believe that you can, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are certain that you will succeed brilliantly in all your endeavors, then often the optimal strategy will sometimes be to ignore the law, or at least the parts of the law that stand in the way of your vision. Not, like, the objectively optimal strategy, but the strategy that you consider optimal given your subjective certainty that everything will work out for you&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signal &lt;a href=&#34;https://signal.org/blog/the-instagram-ads-you-will-never-see/&#34;&gt;tried to release instagram ads that highlighted how targetted advertising works&lt;/a&gt; but their account conveniently got disabled for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zdnet.com/article/facebook-accuses-signal-of-lying-about-its-attempt-to-run-transparent-instagram-ads/&#34;&gt;what Facebook claims was &amp;ldquo;an unrelated payments issue&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.garbageday.email/p/finally-a-weapon-to-surpass-groverhaus&#34;&gt;a recent Garbage Day&lt;/a&gt;, about Spotify&amp;rsquo;s algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve seen how Facebook&amp;rsquo;s algorithmic recommendation of content, based on an algorithm that&amp;rsquo;s maximized for engagement, has started to distort reality. It has started to undermine democracy and amplified really harmful ideologies like white supremacy and white nationalism. And you can already kind of start to see this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bands have kind of started to figure out like, “oh, all of our songs that sound kind of like this do super well with the Spotify algorithm, let&amp;rsquo;s just make more songs like that.” And you can&amp;rsquo;t fault the band for doing that. There&amp;rsquo;s so few opportunities for bands to make a living from their art at this point. But it terrifies me to think about a future where music is created to please some cold-blooded algorithm. And there&amp;rsquo;s just like something uniquely gross about that to me, when I think about how music is something that humans have been making for literally 1000s of years. It&amp;rsquo;s something that&amp;rsquo;s sacred, and, you know, not to pretend that it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been commodified in a variety of different ways for decades, or maybe even centuries. But this feels like a new frontier. That type of automated commodification of something that should be about humans and not robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marvel released what is basically a sizzle reel for the MCU&amp;rsquo;s next 3 years worth of movies: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdpxoFcdORI&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdpxoFcdORI&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m such a fanboy, I will gleefully admit that I got goosebumps when the video continued past the Shang-chi preview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rolling Stone lists the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-lists/best-tv-sitcoms-1162237/&#34;&gt;best TV sitcoms of all time&lt;/a&gt;. The comments are full of complaints about notable omissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got my &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/1391294087064477699/&#34;&gt;second dose of the Sinovac vaccine yesterday&lt;/a&gt;! Supposedly it&amp;rsquo;s fully effective about two weeks after the second dose, although studies show the efficacy is rather low. But some protection is better than none. Some better vaccines are starting to come in, we are supposedly due to get (a small amount of) Pfizer soon. I reckon since I&amp;rsquo;m hunkered down at home most of the time anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m okay with the weaker Chinese vaccine and don&amp;rsquo;t mind if the more effective vaccines go to the masses that have to go out and mingle for work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt;, although I&amp;rsquo;m a couple of days behind due to the aforementioned alleged busyness. Should catch up soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Didn&amp;rsquo;t watch any last week, should correct that soon. I&amp;rsquo;m not even a third of the way through my James Bond run!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing too notable, now that Invincible is done and we don&amp;rsquo;t have any running MCU series at the moment. Well, I did enjoy the recent two-part story on Supergirl where two characters travelled back to the past to meet young Kara and Alex in school. The rest of the season has bit a bit meh, so this was the highlight for me so far. The young versions were so perfectly cast!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drafted a bit more &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgstrixhaven/&#34;&gt;Strixhaven&lt;/a&gt; on Arena, and finally ran the Sealed Open yesterday!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still playing a bunch of &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4 and &lt;strong&gt;Street Fighter V&lt;/strong&gt; on Steam. Hey, I got Balrog (Boxer) to bronze!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finally finished the second run of Fire Emblem: Three Houses! There&amp;rsquo;s one more branch to explore (well, technically two, but I&amp;rsquo;m not too interested in the other one), but I might put the game aside for a while and find something else to play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Finished reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/snow-crash/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/strong&gt; by Neal Stephenson&lt;/a&gt;, still looking around for what to read next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t have any quiz nights this week! Instead, I started digging a bit into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://triviastorm.net/&#34;&gt;triviastorm&lt;/a&gt; back-end code and added some improvements I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do for a while. When I&amp;rsquo;m done, I hope the answer checking becomes a bit more robust. Will also probably add a new batch of questions to the bot sometime this month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh, nothing in particular I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to this week. Anything I missed?&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s already May? April felt like it came and went so quickly. But then again, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/1242953238497751040&#34;&gt;time has little meaning in this accursed pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The brouhaha over community pantries (as &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/weeknotes-2021-04-25/&#34;&gt;described last week&lt;/a&gt;), seems to have calmed down and they are now generally coordinating with LGUs for assistance in maintaining health protocols&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, the government has embarked on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1387324164910981121/&#34;&gt;propaganda campaign to assert that we aren&amp;rsquo;t the worst in terms of pandemic response in the world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certain congress people continue to promote the usage of the drug Ivermectin, which has no known effect on Covid-19, as a Covid-19 cure or something. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1388100027684331520/&#34;&gt;DOH/FDA keep saying there&amp;rsquo;s no sufficient evidence&lt;/a&gt;, but that has no effect when the people promoting it aren&amp;rsquo;t motivated by evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looks like the Office of the Solicitor General of the Philippines &lt;a href=&#34;https://restofworld.org/2021/philippines-data-exposure/&#34;&gt;accidentally leaked a bunch of sensitive legal documents&lt;/a&gt; due to a misconfigured public directory on their web server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently last weekend was the Oscars, which just goes to show how irrelevant they are now that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know until I saw the tweets about it happening live. They tried to re-arrange the awards with Best Actor last, apparently with the hope of ending with a posthumous award to Chadwick Boseman, but the award went to Anthony Hopkins instead, who wasn&amp;rsquo;t even at the ceremony. Awkward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have this mentor. And one of the best pieces of advice that he gave me is ‘always give someone the golden gate of retreat’, which is: give someone enough compassion, enough opportunity in a conversation for them to look good changing their mind. And it’s a really important thing to be able to do, because if you’re just like, ‘Oh you said this thing! You’re racist!’, you’re forcing that person to say, ‘No I’m not’. Et cetera. There’s no golden gate of retreat there. The only retreat there is to just barrel right through the opposing opinion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a constant practice of getting curious about all of the aspects of your experience. Not with the intention of receiving any adult-mind narrative answers, but with the curiosity of a talking monkey who has no ability to understand the universe. &amp;hellip; By continually introducing the immediate experience of not-knowing to your operating system, you will undo the stale old perceptual and cognitive habits of the adult-mind that thinks it knows, that thinks it has seen it all, that it has seen any of this before. It’s a skill like any other, and as you improve with practice you will get better at meeting everything for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&amp;rsquo;m still bitter over &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/10/1048949973801267200/&#34;&gt;not being able to recover my Yahoo Messenger convos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

I was tempted to write about my own experiences working with crypto, but I worry that not enough time has passed for me to talk perhaps a bit unkindly about some of the companies I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manuel Matuzovic writes about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matuzo.at/blog/html-boilerplate/&#34;&gt;his current HTML boilerplate&lt;/a&gt;, which at the very least is a good look at how many different tags and other things one needs to put in by default to support various modern web things including social media previews and such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone shared to me this version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyE80ebItlA&#34;&gt;Never Gonna Give You Up with Japanese lyrics&lt;/a&gt; that I enjoyed for some reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extremely satisfying: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/moylato/status/1387139670962843658&#34;&gt;Belgian man parks his car in a super narrow garage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found this &lt;a href=&#34;https://acesubido.net/ph-inflation-calculator/&#34;&gt;Philippines inflation calculator online&lt;/a&gt;. Prices have almost doubled from when I started working back in 2003!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For some reason all the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketches&lt;/a&gt; for the past week were done with pen and paper on this tiny pad I keep near my desk. Much quicker to do, but the sketches are also much simpler than anything I do in Procreate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Caught &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/3bf3bc036db88610a1c7b3474555eb69/&#34;&gt;Green Hornet (2011)&lt;/a&gt; on cable, a movie I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know existed. I should resume my James Bond run soonish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched the &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/05/99d3f5dffa9b1e1f2a4029f66c2b4f2a/&#34;&gt;second season of Jack Ryan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/04/183ab94b6cb10f5db0431e715cde1945/&#34;&gt;finished up season 1 of Invincible&lt;/a&gt;, both on Prime Video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Been drafting a bit more &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgstrixhaven/&#34;&gt;Strixhaven&lt;/a&gt; on Arena. I thought the Sealed Open was this weekend, but turns out it was actually next week. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably shift to Quick Drafts next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a bunch of &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4 already after it dropped for free last week. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big fan of the intro sequence, but I&amp;rsquo;ve warmed up to it as the story and the world gradually opened up. I can tell this will take a while to finish though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a bit of Street Fighter V again this week, though I&amp;rsquo;m still languishing in the Bronze ranks again. Have tried shifting to Balrog (Boxer) as my main, though I&amp;rsquo;m not super familiar with the combos and matchups. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how that goes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My regular Saturday gaming group immediately picked up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1586100/Root_The_Riverfolk_Expansion/&#34;&gt;new Riverfolk expansion for Root&lt;/a&gt; when it dropped last week and we had a lot of fun with some of the creepy new additions last night. And I really should get on with that Root review!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: I am close to finishing &lt;strong&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/strong&gt; by Neal Stephenson, should be done this week, hopefully have time to write the review as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia: Didn&amp;rsquo;t do too well in this week&amp;rsquo;s About Quiz, so we ended up in a distant finish in the league overall. No trivia next week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No new One Piece, BNHA, etc, I assume due to Golden Week. Boo!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strixhaven Sealed Open on Arena next week, for real this time!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting my second shot of Sinovac next Sunday!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was a bit rushed, so typos etc are a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a bit busy this weekend (see below), so this post is running a bit late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ongoing saga right here in the Philippines:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last weekend, community pantries for the needy started sprouting up in Metro Manila and all over the country, largely inspired by one started in Maginhawa here in Quezon City. The central idea was &amp;ldquo;give what you can, take what you need.&amp;rdquo; Stories spread of heartwarming stories like a poor old man donating some food even though he had very little and an ice cream vendor giving away the remnants of his cart for the day to those in the queue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government critics pointed out the need for these pantries was largely a result of the lack of support from the government. (They&amp;rsquo;re not wrong.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predictably, it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for the government to butt in, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/roytang/status/1384280033351462912&#34;&gt;the police reportedly investigating the people behind the pantries for communist links&lt;/a&gt;. Some other national government people even said they might require permits. For what, giving food away?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The backlash was predictably quick, with netizens and even local government offcials and senators castigating the critics. Mayors started chiming in that the community pantries were welcome in their cities and that there was no permit required to help each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, notable spokespersons of the NTF-ELCAC still insisted on insinuating communist links to the pantries. There were also the usual critics who decried people getting stuff for free, speaking from the privilege of their safe houses and expensive cars. Critics also raised whether these pantries were spreading covid because of how people spend a lot of time queued up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some women in Pasig went viral for a bit after they were caught on video raiding a community pantry and getting much more than could be reasonably expected, one of them even carting off a trayful of eggs. They supposedly claimed they were going to give away to their neighbors. They later &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.msn.com/en-ph/entertainment/other/mga-babaeng-nanlimas-sa-community-pantry-sa-pasig-dumepensa-na/ar-BB1fUtan&#34;&gt;apologized&lt;/a&gt;, but supposedly they &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/news5ph/status/1384855185932042241&#34;&gt;were planning to file charges against the person who took a video of them&lt;/a&gt;. My take: the thing about decentralized movements like this is that they tend to easily self-correct through the vigilance of the participants as seen here. There have been no other reports of similar incidents after this one went viral, so at the very least they served as an example of what not to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last Friday, a community pantry started by actress Angel Locsin ended in disaster when an old man died while in the queue. Blowback from the pantry critics and the DDS was fierce. Locsin &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gmanetwork.com/entertainment/showbiznews/news/76345/angel-locsin-issues-apology-after-senior-citizen-dies-in-line-at-her-community-pantry/story&#34;&gt;quickly issued an apology&lt;/a&gt; and accepted the blame, drawing contrasts with how the national government never apologizes or admits to mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently, news broke that the National Security Adviser &lt;a href=&#34;https://onenews.ph/gag-order-imposed-on-parlade-badoy&#34;&gt;had imposed a gag order on the notorious NTF-ELCAC spokespersons re: community pantries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probably one of the reasons we can&amp;rsquo;t have nice things: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LaTtEX/status/1384416859701792771&#34;&gt;people can&amp;rsquo;t be generous without some other people becoming suspicious and assigning nefarious motives&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens with these pantries moving forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of covid, India&amp;rsquo;s experiencing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56798248&#34;&gt;worst surge of the pandemic so far&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://mashable.com/article/twitter-hides-tweets-critical-indian-government-handling-covid/&#34;&gt;accused of censoring tweets critical of the Indian government&amp;rsquo;s covid response&lt;/a&gt;. The US is facing calls to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/25/us-pressed-to-lift-export-ban-to-help-india-fight-surge-in-covid-cases?CMP=twt_gu#Echobox=1619342451&#34;&gt;loosen export bans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/24/covid-vaccines-patents-pharmaceutical-companies-secrecy&#34;&gt;lighten up on vaccine patents&lt;/a&gt; to help out India (and the rest of us in the global south, really).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some lighter news: One year ago in Apr 24 2020, an epic battle among a ton of people named Josh was scheduled a year in advance, to fight for the name. It &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gothspiderbitch/status/1386031209457852418&#34;&gt;happened yesterday&lt;/a&gt;! They had a pool noodle battle and named a 5 year old &amp;ldquo;King Josh&amp;rdquo; or some such. Lots of fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messaging app Signal, famous for its encryption protections, raised concerns about vulnerabilities in software often used by authoritarian regimes to bypass the security of such apps: &lt;a href=&#34;https://signal.org/blog/cellebrite-vulnerabilities/&#34;&gt;Exploiting vulnerabilities in Cellebrite UFED and Physical Analyzer from an app&amp;rsquo;s perspective&lt;/a&gt;. The great thing is how the report does a hilarious &amp;ldquo;wink wink nudge nudge&amp;rdquo; implying the users of such apps might not want to target Signal in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some stuff about blogging and personal websites:

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gq.com/story/get-fit-from-just-walking&#34;&gt;How fit can you get from just walking?&lt;/a&gt; One of the tragedies of the pandemic is that I&amp;rsquo;ve had to reduce my general walking output, since I can&amp;rsquo;t just wander around as far as I want anymore.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Local liturgical song Tanging Yaman, often attributed to Carol Banawa, was actually &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/04/03/21/behind-the-music-tanging-yaman-by-fr-manoling-francisco&#34;&gt;first recorded by now-Senator Risa Hontiveros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The big thing for me this week (that I hinted at in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/weeknotes-2021-04-18/&#34;&gt;the previous weeknotes&lt;/a&gt;) is that I decided to give &lt;a href=&#34;https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48&#34;&gt;LUDUM DARE 48&lt;/a&gt; a shot! It&amp;rsquo;s a game jam, where you make a game in 48 hours (well, that&amp;rsquo;s the mode I&amp;rsquo;m participating in). Tt&amp;rsquo;s the first time I&amp;rsquo;m doing one, despite a lifetime of flirting with the idea of gamedev. Initial build is &lt;a href=&#34;https://hungryroy.itch.io/diver&#34;&gt;already available&lt;/a&gt;, even though there&amp;rsquo;s still 9ish hours to go. (I need to sleep!) I&amp;rsquo;ll probably (should) write more about this experience in a future post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Around the middle of this week, I got the first ever email that actually complied with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/about/contact/&#34;&gt;the contact protocol I had specified here in the site&lt;/a&gt; and on LinkedIn, namely putting a certain keyword in the subject line. I&amp;rsquo;ve had that condition for years, so I was really amazed someone actually read it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;still sketching&lt;/a&gt;, though I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen a couple of days behind due to the game jam. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1385224243848179719/&#34;&gt;tried to do one on paper like a comic&lt;/a&gt; but my handwriting was so terrible I had to edit it digitally!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/b178a1efcfc005930f062c7be447d7c1/&#34;&gt;Rocky (1976)&lt;/a&gt;, and I meant to watch the next Bond flick too, but ran out of time. New Mortal Kombat movie also came out this past week, I might watch that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt; season finale ran last Friday. A lot of people are happy with it (and the season overall), but I felt like some parts were too rushed and the finale suffered as a result. Will probably post more thoughts on it this week. After this, we won&amp;rsquo;t have MCU content until Loki kicks off next month I think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Invincible&lt;/strong&gt; is getting to the good part!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still drafting a bunch of Strixhaven on Arena (though I had to stop for the weekend due to the game jam). Most of my drafts went well, though the last 2 I did this week were terrible. I ended up listening to &lt;a href=&#34;http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-593-strixhaven-first-impressions/&#34;&gt;the Limited Resources podcast&lt;/a&gt; for the first time and got some good tips, hopefully that improves my drafts moving forward. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably play in the Sealed Open next weekend! Follow along via &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgstrixhaven/&#34;&gt;the MTGStrixhaven tag&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/strong&gt; actually had some progress this week. I really should finish this run soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downloaded &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4 because it&amp;rsquo;s temporarily free! I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to play this for a while, hopefully I have time for it this coming week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played some Street Fighter V again this week; I figured since a new character dropped, it might be easy to find matches again. I did manage to fight quite a few, but I also did quite poorly, dropping back to Ultra Bronze. Thinking about switching to a different character since everyone seems to know how to fight Ryu, so I unlocked Honda! We&amp;rsquo;ll see who I actually end up using.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Currently about halfway through &lt;strong&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/strong&gt; by Neal Stephenson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia: Pop Quiz is back (albeit monthly now, not weekly), so the trivia team was able to join two quizzes this past week. We didn&amp;rsquo;t win either though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a couple of birthdays in the family this weekend, so my game jamming was interspersed with zoom / messenger calls and food deliveries and such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Invincible, One Piece, BNHA, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new expansion dropping for Root, one of the digital boardgames we&amp;rsquo;ve been playing (and the one I have yet to write a review for&amp;hellip; sounds like a perfect opportunity!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strixhaven Sealed Open on Arena next week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was a bit rushed, so typos etc are a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to think of this past week, feels like it went by quickly. I may have spent too much of it daydreaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NCR+ bubble is now one week into modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ - an acronym that makes no sense). Cases still seem to be pretty high on a day-to-day basis, though we&amp;rsquo;re told the R number is dropping slightly, so that&amp;rsquo;s good I guess? Still, would be nice if the case numbers would calm down. Still lots of stories about people having trouble getting into hospitals and dying in ICUs. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/4/12/Roque-un-Christian-COVID-19-confinement.html&#34;&gt;the presidential spokesperson claims it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;unchristian&amp;rdquo; to ask how he managed to get a hospital booking despite all the problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quezon City is out of vaccines, at least for now, until the national government gives them some more. They were able to vaccinate around 100,000 people so far, which isn&amp;rsquo;t too bad. The two seniors I live with still haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten vaccinated, so hopefully supplies come back up soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a rare show of spine, the Philippine government, in coordination with American friends, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.esquiremag.ph/politics/news/china-backs-down-a00293-20210416-lfrm&#34;&gt;have sent coast guard ships to chase away the Chinese invaders&lt;/a&gt; in Julian Felipe reef!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not sure what&amp;rsquo;s happening with the rest of the world, haven&amp;rsquo;t really been paying attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I guess we could note that in the US, cops are killing more black people while protests about previous killings are going on while a former police officer is on trial for a previous killing, but this sort of thing doesn&amp;rsquo;t really feel &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; for the US anymore. Now, if they actually do something to fix the systemic rot in their police system, that would be news. (Not that our cops here are much better&amp;hellip;) Don&amp;rsquo;t really feel like providing links for this one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;! Practiced &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1383150746334466051/&#34;&gt;sketching some elaborate hair&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;rsquo;s always a challenge for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tried out &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1382290950483976200/&#34;&gt;these three-cheese donuts from Lola Nena&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;, after I heard about them from a local streamer. Pretty good!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1381509474259673090/&#34;&gt;Airplane! (1980)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/ced0a77eea2857ad31bd014fac3ded9a/&#34;&gt;Live and Let Die (1973)&lt;/a&gt; to continute the James Bond run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt; was mostly set up for the finale next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have also been enjoying &lt;strong&gt;Invincible&lt;/strong&gt;, but I guess that I will reserve commentary until the season is done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did not watch this year&amp;rsquo;s Wrestlemania.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new set, Strixhaven, has dropped on &lt;strong&gt;Magic Arena&lt;/strong&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;m having fun drafting it. Follow along via &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgstrixhaven/&#34;&gt;the MTGStrixhaven tag&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also randomly decided into &lt;strong&gt;Eternal&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Stormbreak open this weekend, did terribly, as could be expected lol. At least I got to open a bunch of packs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other than the card games, I actually didn&amp;rsquo;t get much gaming done this week. I should correct that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/strong&gt; has no progress this past week lol. I really should finish this second run. I did play a bit of &lt;strong&gt;Pac-Man 99&lt;/strong&gt; on the Switch, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t manage to actually win a game, seems harder than Super Mario 99.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Currently reading &lt;strong&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/strong&gt; by Neal Stephenson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia: This past Saturday, our trivia group split into two teams: one played in an Attack on Titan-themed trivia (I didn&amp;rsquo;t join because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be spoiled) while the rest of us played in the regular AboutQuiz, with a poetry-themed game. Coincidentally, we finished in third place for both quizzes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier finale!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Invincible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rose DLC character for Street Fighter V drops on the 19th, part of season 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn will be free on PSN on the 19th, no PS+ required!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final Civ6 balance update drops on the 22nd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A couple of family birthdays next weekend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We actually have two regular trivia events this coming week, since PopQuiz is back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mystery event on Saturday the 24th, I&amp;rsquo;ll post about it if I decide to participate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and Queen Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s husband, has passed away. So has DMX, American rapper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big facebook breach reported, etc. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like news, really. My &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1379404077319168000/&#34;&gt;phone number was among the data leaked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The country is still experiencing a surge in cases, hospitals and  ICUs still bursting to capacity. Yet in spite of the crisis, the president has not been around. This has prompted questions of whether he&amp;rsquo;s  still alive. This in turn prompted multiple proof-of-life photos and videos from the senator-who-is-also-presidential-assistant, some of which &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/News5PH/status/1380408229495119875&#34;&gt;may or may have been photoshopped&lt;/a&gt;. We are told he will make a public appearance Monday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of the president, it feels like an ABS-CBN reporter did more to defend our sovereignty vs China when &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/multimedia/slideshow/04/09/21/china-boat-chase-abscbn-news-team-chiara-zambrano&#34;&gt;they went to report on Chinese vessels near Ayungin Shoal and were harassed for their trouble&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After two weeks of ECQ, the NCR+ bubble is &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ABSCBNNews/status/1381142347489013761&#34;&gt;now placed under MECQ status until the end of the month&lt;/a&gt;. No, I have no idea what that means.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once again, the Philippines in the international news after &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/07/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-cases?#a-man-died-after-being-forced-to-do-300-squats-for-breaking-curfew-in-the-philippines&#34;&gt;a man died because he was made to do 300 squats for breaking curfew&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Wrestlemania weekend! And apparently it&amp;rsquo;s a two-night event this year. I don&amp;rsquo;t really follow WWE anymore, but I do often take the time to at least watch Wrestlemania and the Royal Rumble every year, so I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can get myself a copy somehow.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;! My favorite sketch for this week is of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1379656430081351687/&#34;&gt;Akira Kazama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOdgfo7OaLI&#34;&gt;upcoming fighter&lt;/a&gt; in the Street Fighter V season 5 DLC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/first-sinovac-dose/&#34;&gt;got my first dose of Sinovac vaccine today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing the James Bond run with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/8fd56682f77942eb0badef9444d465a4/&#34;&gt;Diamonds are Forever (1971)&lt;/a&gt;, Connery&amp;rsquo;s last outing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt; was great, and those last 10 minutes were intense!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other than that, just the usual weekly shows, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday gaming group decided to pick up &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1075190/A_Game_of_Thrones_The_Board_Game__Digital_Edition/&#34;&gt;Game of Thrones The Boardgame on Steam!&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve played this one IRL before, only once, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t remember much. The digital version reminds me why: It&amp;rsquo;s super complicated! Our first game took two hours, I didn&amp;rsquo;t win. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have time for a second one since I had to get up early for the vaccine appointment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses still progressing very slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This month&amp;rsquo;s Humble Choice was revealed, and was meh for me, so I immediately paused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did get Days Gone via PS+ on PS4 though, I might actually play that one. Though they are also planning to give away Horizon Zero Dawn sometime this month, that might be a higher priority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Finished reading Alexis Ohanian&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Without-Their-Permission-Century-Managed/dp/1455520020&#34;&gt;Without Their Permission&lt;/a&gt;, will write a review soonish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our trivia group posted a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1379623251479908354/#comments&#34;&gt;new trivia video&lt;/a&gt;. Like and subscribe to the channel etc. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly just us playing games and trivia, having fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Falcon and Winter Soldier, Invincible, One Piece, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strixhaven drops on Magic Arena!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s April! Or as it&amp;rsquo;s otherwise known, March 2020 month 13. As is usual, we are suffering the sweltering summer heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it&amp;rsquo;s Easter Sunday, if that means anything to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surprising almost no one, the PH government extended the ECQ lockdown in the NCR+ bubble. Anyone with half a brain could have told you that the one week ECQ was no way going to be enough, given what we know about the virus&amp;rsquo; life cycle. Meanwhile, we continued to hit record numbers of new cases, our 7-day rolling average now the highest in SEA since the pandemic began. It&amp;rsquo;s like we&amp;rsquo;re in the same situation we were in last year, except the numbers are much, much higher. And yet our leadership is like &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/inquirerdotnet/status/1377810270500790274&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not so bad, even France has lockdowns!&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Sigh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Austin Kleon reminds us that we all need &lt;a href=&#34;https://austinkleon.com/2018/01/19/something-to-look-forward-to/&#34;&gt;something to look forward to&lt;/a&gt;. (Arbitrary stupid goals!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was fascinated by this &lt;a href=&#34;https://theconversation.com/the-man-with-no-plot-how-i-watched-lee-child-write-a-jack-reacher-novel-51220&#34;&gt;article about how Lee Child writes Jack Reacher novels on the fly&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because that seems like the sort of &amp;ldquo;less work&amp;rdquo; approach I&amp;rsquo;d prefer when writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a curiosity: &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law&#34;&gt;Benford&amp;rsquo;s Law&lt;/a&gt;, or the law of anomalous numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://newrepublic.com/article/161106/defense-nothing&#34;&gt;In defense of doing nothing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent a long time working with Java projects, so &lt;a href=&#34;https://advancedweb.hu/a-categorized-list-of-all-java-and-jvm-features-since-jdk-8-to-16/&#34;&gt;this long list of new features from Java 8 to 16&lt;/a&gt; was interesting to me. After reading this, I asked my old workmates what version of Java they were now using, and they were still on Java 8, the same version as when I left there 6 years ago! Time flows differently in the enterprise universe I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My friends were amazed I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-1Ue0FFrHY&#34;&gt;Long, Long Man japanese commercials&lt;/a&gt; before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Peu6lw0nido&#34;&gt;this case study by Elsa Charretier of a Hawkeye comic book panel by David Aja&lt;/a&gt;. Probably helpful in my own sketching! Subscribed to her channel as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sony announced that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-store-shut-down-ps3-vita-psp&#34;&gt;they will be shutting down the PS3, Vita and PSP stores&lt;/a&gt;. End of an era really. A lot of people are complaining about content that will be forever lost, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure that there are people working to archive this stuff and make it available through other means. &lt;em&gt;Wink wink&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a person with comorbidities (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2005/05/hypertension/&#34;&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;), I&amp;rsquo;m in vaccine priority group A3, right after senior citizens (A2s). And since the stock of AstraZeneca is limited, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/QCGov/status/1377997094431129606&#34;&gt;QC is now allowing A3s to go ahead of A2s&lt;/a&gt;, so I was able to book a vaccine appointment on the 27th. Its a ways off, but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that means they&amp;rsquo;ve learned to streamline their on-site processes by then, so hopefully things go smoothly. It&amp;rsquo;s weird to have booked a schedule even before the more at-risk parents though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a bid to minimize having to go outside, we decided to try ordering groceries online via &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.metromart.com/&#34;&gt;Metromart&lt;/a&gt;. The first-time experience wasn&amp;rsquo;t great; we had to buy from a different grocery (since our usual one wasn&amp;rsquo;t available), not all the regular items we needed were there, and some items were way more expensive. And worst of all, I ordered Tostitos cheese dip and they bought spinach dip instead!! The weird thing is, there were some other items that were out of stock that they called me about (even though I explicitly set that if there were missing items, just don&amp;rsquo;t buy them??), yet for the dip, they just went ahead and bought a different flavor. I ended up having a long convo with their customer support about how disappointed I was, and somehow despite saying there&amp;rsquo;s nothing they could do, they later ended up offering me P100 store credit as compensation. I guess it will be useful if ever we decide to try this again. Anyway, we ended up doing a supplementary grocery run yesterday to cover the items the online delivery didn&amp;rsquo;t get (and the cheese dip!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only one movie watched this week, continuing the James Bond run: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1a1ab3ad610478ba3b672b0a89c26333/&#34;&gt;On Her Majesty&amp;rsquo;s Secret Service (1969)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supergirl&lt;/strong&gt; has started up again, carrying over baggage from the cut-short previous season, same as Flash. The writing was marginally better though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt; was pretty good, though I still found Wandavision more exciting overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tried grinding to Master Rank in Eternal on the last day of the month, but I ran out of time with half a level to go. Sigh. Arena I didn&amp;rsquo;t even bother and ended the month in platinum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a couple of Civ6 games, mostly achievement hunting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a bit more &lt;strong&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/strong&gt;, now down to 1 achievement remaining, but it requires going through all the secret levels, I think?? That might take a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s multiplayer games with friends: Blood Rage, Sentinels of the Multiverse, Root, and Orcs Must Die 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Finished reading Discworld&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Men at Arms!&lt;/strong&gt;, maybe I can write book review(s) this week. Need to find a new book to read, probably a nonfiction one this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was the second Holy Week in a row where we were just stuck at home all day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Falcon and Winter Soldier, Invincible, One Piece, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the last weekend of March. It feels like the month went by quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local covid response: The government introduced the concept of an &amp;ldquo;NCR Plus&amp;rdquo; bubble last Monday, restricting travel in and out of the NCR and adjacent provinces, in response to the rising cases. Still, the daily counts kept rising, hitting record highs of almost 10k cases daily. Even before the dust has settled on the bubble response, they decided to announce last night a reversion to the stricter ECQ. Shades of last year, during the run up to the first lockdown announcement: rumors circulated via chat groups about the impending lockdown before the government finally made their announcement. As can be expected, memes quickly circulated about how we came back to ECQ more than a year after the first lockdown. The lockdown is imposed only for one week, during the Holy Week period, presumably to take advantage of the two holidays in the week to minimize economic impact. The fact that they imposed two different levels of responses one after another &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1375737016407625729/&#34;&gt;reeks of poor planning and analysis&lt;/a&gt;, as if they were just making all this up as they go along, which might not be far from the truth. What happens if the case counts continue to rise until next Sunday?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a bit of economically-devastating-yet-unintentionally-hilarious world news: a very large container ship, the MV EVER GIVEN, ran aground in the Suez Canal, blocking passage, and has been stuck there since Tuesday-ish, clogging up global shipping trade through the canal. Apparently losses are at the order of $400M per hour or something? IDK, I&amp;rsquo;m not an economist. All I&amp;rsquo;m sure of is the internet almost immediately produced a &lt;a href=&#34;https://nypost.com/2021/03/25/the-best-suez-canal-memes-the-stuck-ship-ever-given-inspired/&#34;&gt;bunch of memes&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=&#34;https://jezebel.com/yes-people-are-writing-horny-fanfic-about-the-suez-can-1846562940&#34;&gt;horny fanfic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Read this interesting post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.ayjay.org/blogging-and-the-blogosphere/&#34;&gt;blogging and the blogosphere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something that interested me mostly for trivia purposes: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nme.com/photos/30-covers-that-are-better-than-the-originals-1405281&#34;&gt;30 covers that are better than the originals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Sketching, sketching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing my run on the Bond movies with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/fb71576d1974213ea471b5cda8a20948/&#34;&gt;You Only Live Twice (1967)&lt;/a&gt;. Secret volcano lair!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also managed to convince myself to sit down and watch &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/snyder-cut/&#34;&gt;Zack Snyder&amp;rsquo;s Justice League&lt;/a&gt;. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t manage to sit down for four hours straight, so it was two sittings over two days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second episode of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier last Friday. Still a bit meh, mostly because there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been anything I haven&amp;rsquo;t expected yet. But that&amp;rsquo;s bound to change as I think all the content from the trailers have been shown by now. Some good acting by Sebastian Sean though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finished watching &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek The Animated Series&lt;/strong&gt;, Star Trek TV series completion!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First 3 episodes &lt;strong&gt;Invincible&lt;/strong&gt; have dropped on Prime Video. Most of the first episode is good, clean superhero fun, but by the end of the episode you are dissuaded of that notion. Pretty good pacing, seems mostly accurate to the source material, looking forward to the rest of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also been rewatching The Office as my background watching, mostly because I listened to a podcast of Office trivia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run: Still ongoing, somehow. It feels like I&amp;rsquo;m doing these in real time, only advancing one week of the game per week of real life. At that rate, I should be done in like six months lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After five years of playing Street Fighter V, I managed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1374367400276025345/&#34;&gt;dig myself out of the pits of the bronze ranks and hit silver&lt;/a&gt;! Surprisingly, on the next two days after this, I had trouble finding ranked matches again. I took that as a sign to take a break before attempting to climb up to gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final Civ6 NFP drop came out as expected. Not super hyped, but I have started a Portugal game already, they seem really strong especially on island maps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strixhaven official previews kicked off, and I&amp;rsquo;m really hyped for the set, mostly because I really &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1375147827110629379/&#34;&gt;like the Mystical Archive cards&lt;/a&gt;. Collecting all of them on Arena is gonna be a challenge though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supposedly Magic Arena is now available &amp;ldquo;everywhere&amp;rdquo; on mobile, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/mdf9dp/androidios_versions_not_available_in_southeast/&#34;&gt;not in Southeast Asia though&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; I mentioned last week that I started reading the Discworld book &amp;ldquo;Guards! Guards!&amp;rdquo;, but for some reason everything seemed so familiar, and soon I realized it was because I had &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/12/805050532834353152/&#34;&gt;already read it back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Doh! I was enjoying it anyway, so I finished the re-read and will probably publish a review, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have one in 2016. But I&amp;rsquo;ll finish the next City Watch book first: Men at Arms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AboutQuiz this week a bit better than last week, but I still miss the other trivia groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1374212757189369861/&#34;&gt;I hit the 800-day streak on Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New FatWS episode, etc etc. I presume new Invincible episode as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe the world will miraculously be better next week? IDK, one can always hope right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Holy Week! Normally a big deal for the RC faithful in this country, but this time everyone has to stay at home for the second year in a row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ECQ! Well, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect me much, though there are now some errands that we have to push back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over the past couple of days, our nationwide daily covid cases broke 7000+, the highest recorded so far.  Have to be super careful when going out for errands. Not that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t being careful even before, mind you. Just now, government has announced we are still under GCQ (see my post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1373562580375986178/&#34;&gt;the PH quarantine levels&lt;/a&gt;), but with more restrictions, etc. Looks like they are still hesitant to provide a stronger lockdown which would require paying people to stay home so they don&amp;rsquo;t starve to death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.protocol.com/internet-archive-preserving-future&#34;&gt;The internet is splitting apart. The Internet Archive wants to save it all forever. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/01/checklist-achievements-happiness-boxes/617756/&#34;&gt;Stop Keeping Score&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also could&amp;rsquo;ve sworn there was a bunch of funny stuff I read on Twitter this week that I can&amp;rsquo;t find anymore. I need to get better at marking/sharing things I find funny or interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Sketching, sketching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing my run on the Bond movies with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/273eae12d668c24135d4db358511c9d4/&#34;&gt;Goldfinger (1964)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/c6152994fa5ddf4b9c3302bcddfdd699/&#34;&gt;Thunderall (1965)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I keep threatening to watch the Snyder Cut, but have yet to find a four hour block of time to do it. FOUR HOURS!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, I watched the first episode of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Kind of meh, though I appreciate the emotional angles they&amp;rsquo;re going for. Might have been more hyped if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware a certain character was going to be introduced in this series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finished watching &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;, now almost through the Animated Series. Almost to Star Trek TV series completion!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run: Still ongoing, somehow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to play Valkyria Chronicles 4 on Steam since I got it from Humble Choice, but since I&amp;rsquo;m still in the middle of a Fire Emblem run I keep putting it off. It feels weird to have two anime-styled tactical RPGs running at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I actually managed to finish a run of &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127610/Iris_and_the_Giant/&#34;&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/a&gt;! I still have a few more achievements to get, then I&amp;rsquo;ll probably write a review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually managed to play a fair bit of Street Fighter V over the past week, after getting inspired by watching some Justin Wong videos. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve found the sweet spot / happy hour for actually finding matches where I am, so here&amp;rsquo;s hoping to play more moving forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Finished reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/neuromancer/&#34;&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/a&gt;. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d follow it up with some lighter reading, so I got started on a Discworld book: &amp;ldquo;Guards! Guards!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/2021-site-update/&#34;&gt;Site changes applied!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We did an AboutQuiz this week, but it was terrible (for our team at the very least). I&amp;rsquo;m hoping the more mainstream pop culture trivia quizzes like PopQuiz and Geekfight come back some time soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe (could be wrong) that the Invincible animated series is coming out on Prime Video at the end of the week. I read a fair bit of the comic, though I don&amp;rsquo;t remember much of the later parts, so I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to this. I feel like JK Simmons as the protag&amp;rsquo;s dad is going to turn out to be a great casting decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;final drop in the Civ6 New Frontier pass, with new Civ Portugal, is coming out this week. I&amp;rsquo;m not very hyped for it, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy the recent barbarian update too much, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll give it a go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Falcon and Winter Soldier etc etc. WandaVision really got going by the end of episode 3, but FatWS is only 2/3rds as many episodes, so I assume important things are gonna be happening in episode 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Happy Pi Day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the one year anniversary of the world&amp;rsquo;s longest lockdown. In some kind of sick anniversary celebration, local covid cases are on the rise. Yesterday, 5000 new cases were reported, the highest daily rate in 6 months or so. And now a Philippine variant has been detected. Now is not the time to be complacent, we all need to be more careful. The government seems unwilling to impose another widespread ECQ and are focusing on targetted, granular lockdowns. Not sure how effective this would be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://seirdy.one/2020/11/23/website-best-practices.html&#34;&gt;An opinionated list of best practices for textual websites&lt;/a&gt;. Reading this reminded me there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of updates to this website I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bikobatanari.neocities.org/posts/2020/personal-museum.html&#34;&gt;My Website is a Personal Museum: the creative freedom we lost in the age of social media&lt;/a&gt;. This article, and the referenced &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/&#34;&gt;How the Blog Broke The Web&lt;/a&gt; are nostalgic for the days of curated homepages instead of blogs/social media platforms characterized by chronological feeds. Taking these into account as I consider how to reorganize the content on this website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/19/can-not-quit-facebook/&#34;&gt;Facebook invested heavily in the one feature it knew people couldn’t leave behind: Their groups&lt;/a&gt;. It kind of feels like an opportunity for a new contender to sneak in and develop a better social media platform that&amp;rsquo;s group-centered. Yahoo Groups provided this service in the 00s, but Yahoo being Yahoo, they screwed it up and YG had to close up last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/KimsConvenience/status/1369013822145576964&#34;&gt;Kim&amp;rsquo;s Convenience has been cancelled&lt;/a&gt;. I liked &lt;a href=&#34;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/kims-convenience-the-end-of-the-dream&#34;&gt;Noahpinion&amp;rsquo;s writeup about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;, not missing a beat apparently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in the final season of &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also started reading up on the show&amp;rsquo;s reception, which apparently wasn&amp;rsquo;t great, especially compared to the other Trek shows it succeeded. Not surprising, but the show isn&amp;rsquo;t that bad, really. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of doing a blog post reviewing all the Trek shows, but I should probably watch The Animated Series first for completion purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a long time now I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to watch the old pre-Brosnan Bond movies, which I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen. Maybe mostly for trivia purposes. I got started on this last week with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/2b14f8356f57460da0a4790b27b44b8a/&#34;&gt;Dr No (1962)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/096b7c67797c165b01283d0c7cd6c016/&#34;&gt;From Russia With Love (1963)&lt;/a&gt;. Side note: I&amp;rsquo;m a bit amazed about how they&amp;rsquo;re able to do a sequel based on the success of the previous film in just a year. Modern day Hollywood films cost so much and are so complicated the typical spacing for sequels is at least three years. Next is Goldfinger!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run: Such slow progress, but progress nonetheless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still trying to finish &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127610/Iris_and_the_Giant/&#34;&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Still very slowly reading cyberpunk classic &lt;em&gt;Neurmancer&lt;/em&gt; by William Gibson. I&amp;rsquo;m about 75% through, so maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll finish this in a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started applying some layout changes and other stuff to the site, things will probably be moving around for a bit. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll write a blog post about it when I&amp;rsquo;m done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coming out this week: Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Zack Snyder&amp;rsquo;s Justice League! More looking forward to FatWS than ZSJL obviously. I am awaiting ZSJL with more of a morbid curiosity than anything else, i.e. my expectations are low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have more medical errands to conduct this week, seems like a bad habit that I keep having to get into too often. Comes with the age, I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;March has begun. Did it ever really end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vaccination finally starts in the country, with initial donated batches of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccine arriving in the country. Just in time for the one year anniversary of the world&amp;rsquo;s longest lockdown. SinoVac isn&amp;rsquo;t the best choice, but many of my doctor friends say they&amp;rsquo;ll settle for it if that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s available for them. I think QC is planning to use AstraZeneca for their citizens, but worrying is that AZ&amp;rsquo;s efficacy has been shown to be not so good against certain variants such as the South African one, which has already been detected in the country. Cases have been on the rise in the past couple of weeks as well, possibly due to the variants. We may very well be in a race against time now (maybe we always have been). The next month may be the most crucial phase of the pandemic for us, as vaccination drives hopefully kick into gear to try to overcome the accelerating spread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohhelloana.blog/catching-up-on-my-bookmarks/&#34;&gt;OhHelloAna.blog shared a whole bunch of bookmarks&lt;/a&gt;. Quite a few look interesting. Looking forward to going through this list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/&#34;&gt;Great article about cutting loading times in GTA&lt;/a&gt; went around last week. A case study in the problems with blindly relying on dependencies perhaps, and the complexities of C code performance, and even software performance in general.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rachel True had &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RachelTrue/status/1365461618977476610&#34;&gt;problems with iCloud&lt;/a&gt; after accidentally inputting her last name in lowercase. Feels like the sort of thing that can be maybe part of standard QA test suites? Hope she gets it resolved soon!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this fan video: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UngE0qn3VRY&#34;&gt;What if Wes Anderson directed X-Men?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/NonsenseIsland/status/1366449816042102787&#34;&gt;this thread on classical music in classic cartoons&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m no musical expert by any means, so it was even educational for me!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve switched back to doing digital sketches via Procreate, with kind of a different style this time? I kind of like it, more or less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today I was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/lzagfz/eli5_whats_the_difference_between_joules_watts/gq0i81h/?context=3&#34;&gt;mentioned via the u/hungryroy syntax on reddit&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. Not a big deal, I was just surprised lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally the pandemic and the quarantine hasn&amp;rsquo;t hit me as bad as other folks. My day to day routine hasn&amp;rsquo;t actually changed that much, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t really go out too often even pre-pandemic. That being said, I do miss being able to go out to places just to wander around, take my daily walk in a public place like &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1366349139559129088/&#34;&gt;the QC circle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/01/saturday-morning-up/&#34;&gt;the university campus&lt;/a&gt;, or even just loitering at the mall. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I miss being able to hang out with other people (although I do to some degree as well). More like I miss the ability to be outside, alone, in public, just sitting quietly and letting the universe wash over me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; is done! Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/wandavision/&#34;&gt;a spoiler-free review&lt;/a&gt;, something I used to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/spoiler-free-review/&#34;&gt;do more regularly&lt;/a&gt;. I have more spoiler-related thoughts, but they may be too much for this space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m almost done with season 2 of &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;, which means I&amp;rsquo;m about halfway through the series overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Flash&lt;/strong&gt; started its new season last week, but it feels like their episodes are like 90% nonsense now. (Used to be closer to 60% nonsense.). Second ep of &lt;strong&gt;Superman and Lois&lt;/strong&gt; was okay, although we are definitely getting more moody teenager problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run: still WIP. Moving forward slowly, ever so slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got last month&amp;rsquo;s Humble Choice, and decided to go ahead and install and try out some of the games in the bundle.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started by playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127610/Iris_and_the_Giant/&#34;&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice little tactical battle indie game with CCG mechanics &amp;ndash; think Slay the Spire, but with turn-based tactical RPG battles that can also feel very puzzle-like. I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying well-designed indie games recently, and this one seems to fall into that bucket. It has a unique, minimalist aesthetic and the story is about a young girl&amp;rsquo;s mental health? Maybe? I&amp;rsquo;ll know more if I actually managed to finish a run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also tried to play a game of &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/392110/Endless_Space_2/&#34;&gt;Endless Space 2&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not unfamiliar with 4X games of course, but this one was a bit confusing for me. In the one game where I managed to get anywhere, it felt like I was always behind in tech, and there&amp;rsquo;s so many indicators and UI elements on the different views that I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand. I can see there&amp;rsquo;s going to be a learning curve for this one, so it may take a few games for me to get the hang of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of Humble choice, the next one has Control as a showcase game, but I already got that off PS+, so I think I&amp;rsquo;m pausing on this one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday regular gaming group decided to play &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1015930/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/a&gt; again yesterday, and we found out there was new DLC so we all decided to buy that and try it out. Might do a review for this game this week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also did quite a few Starcraft 2 1v1s with friends this past week. I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself very proficient with SC2, mostly because I&amp;rsquo;m very micro-averse, but I still enjoy playing it. Maybe not ladder though. We recorded some of our games, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bINjaPjt1M&#34;&gt;the first one is up on the Team Camote youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;, if you&amp;rsquo;d like to watch me be terrible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of reasons, I browsed some Ludum Dare games the other day. My favorite is this short and simple one: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/a-monster-hunter-story&#34;&gt;A Monster Hunter Story&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Still very slowly reading cyberpunk classic &lt;em&gt;Neurmancer&lt;/em&gt; by William Gibson. I&amp;rsquo;m about halfway through, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I understand everything that&amp;rsquo;s going on. Might need to look for a recap later on. Still, I soldier on!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh, nothing. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s going to be one of those weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Today is the last day of February. Tomorrow, we march on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biden ordered his &lt;a href=&#34;https://thehill.com/policy/defense/540631-Biden-orders-US-strikes-on-iranian-backed-militia-facilities-in-syria&#34;&gt;first military strike last week&lt;/a&gt;. America is back, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This past week, embrassingly our local police and anti-drug agency got into a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/pnp-pdea-shootout-bungled-buy-bust-operation-ever-gotesco-quezon-city&#34;&gt;shootout&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;against each other&lt;/em&gt; near the Ever Gotesco mall in Quezon City. Both sides claim they were doing a buy-bust, which is impossible. As usual, there is little transparency about what actually happened, and many promises of &amp;ldquo;impartial&amp;rdquo; probes and investigations. People speculate that at least one of the parties involved really was dealing drugs, and they got into a shootout because they were afraid of being EJK&amp;rsquo;ed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have any of these today, sadly. This is why I don&amp;rsquo;t have a newsletter, I&amp;rsquo;m unable to promise regular content lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week was busy with family and medical errands, so not much else was accomplished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; penultimate ep, people still liked it, but it was a bit meh for me. Still looking forward to next week&amp;rsquo;s finale, as there are still so many things to wrap up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started watching &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;, the last of the non-animated Trek shows I have yet to watch. (I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the TOS animated series). It&amp;rsquo;s Scott Bakula! Their uniforms here remind me of something like modern astronaut wear, so I assume they wanted something closer to &amp;ldquo;modern day&amp;rdquo; Earth to bridge to the Star Trek future. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting because at this point the relationship between the humans and Vulcans isn&amp;rsquo;t well established, there is no federation, no prime directive, etc, so we get to see the beginnings of those things later on I guess?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also watched a couple of movies this week. First was &lt;strong&gt;Space Sweepers&lt;/strong&gt;, a Korean space sci-fi adventure on Netflix. Entertaining enough, though the plot is easily predictable and the villain seemed like a moron. Great visuals and special effects, miles apart from anything local cinema has to offer. One-inch barrier of subtitles, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second movie was &lt;strong&gt;Once Upon A Time In Hollywood&lt;/strong&gt;. This was a very laid-back, relaxed movie, unfolding mostly as a series of slice-of-life vignettes of what life was like Hollywood in 1969, with no real plot urgency to speak of. The climax sort of just happens through no real actions by the main characters. Fairly long, took me four sittings to get through. Was surprised to find out later that it was based on a true story of a massacre that took place at that time, with Margot Robbie playing a real-life actress who was the victim in the actual massacre. The story unfolds a bit differently, probably due to the presence of fictional protagonists Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth (portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt). Bruce Lee also makes an appearance!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last week was also the premiere of &lt;strong&gt;Superman and Lois&lt;/strong&gt; on CW. I still like these positive portrayals of Superman better than something like Snyder&amp;rsquo;s Man of Steel, although I&amp;rsquo;m a bit meh on the premiere overall. Everything about the teens gives me Smallville vibes. They had a really big missed opportunity to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/1364758520885772288/&#34;&gt;match a scene from the opening sequence with a classic comic cover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a bit of Civ6 now that the Barbarian Clans mode has dropped. Restarted a few times with Kublai Khan before I got a decent start. Not super impressed with the Barbarian Clans mode so far, seems like the main effect is that we get more city-states going into the endgame. Will probably still try it out for a few games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run still in progress, finally got to the Edelgard decision point, and went as I planned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have been trying to figure out why I&amp;rsquo;m having &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/lquag0/sf5_is_it_expected_to_be_so_hard_to_find_a_match/&#34;&gt;so much trouble finding matches in Street Fighter V&lt;/a&gt;. Still no luck though. I want to indulge myself by getting the season 5 pass, but it&amp;rsquo;s not worth it if I can&amp;rsquo;t actually find matches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always annoying whenever this happens, but next month&amp;rsquo;s PS+ games include FF7 Remake, which I&amp;rsquo;ve already played and finished. Good for everyone else though! New content was also announced for the PS5 version of the game, which is also annoying since it&amp;rsquo;s probably goinna be a while before I bother with a PS5 (maybe waiting for a smaller version!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit: One of my loyal readers pointed out I failed to mention that we played a few games of 4-player Free For All in Starcraft 2 last Saturday. I won one and some undeserving people won the other two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Finished reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/ghost-of-my-father/&#34;&gt;Scott Berkun&amp;rsquo;s Ghost of my Father&lt;/a&gt;. Then started reading pioneering cyberpunk classic &lt;em&gt;Neurmancer&lt;/em&gt; by William Gibson. Kind of a challenging read, I&amp;rsquo;m inching through it slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz&lt;/strong&gt;: We managed to win the AboutQuiz league, just barely. Yay us!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managed to sneak in a few minor upgrades to this here site, mostly CSS and rendering improvements on the frontend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WandaVision finale!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Flash season premiere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New One Piece later tonight!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supposedly vaccination in this country will finally kick off!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Last week of February is about to start. Time flies, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Texas (and other parts of the southern US I guess) have been hit by heavy winter storms, with accompanying power grid failures and such. We have some relatives there so it&amp;rsquo;s a concern. Meanwhile, their governor falsely blames renewables for the power problems and their senator went to Cancun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.platformer.news/p/facebook-calls-australias-bluff&#34;&gt;Facebook cut off Australian news links&lt;/a&gt;. I think both sides of these are dumb, but that is the big tech controversy of the week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NASA has landed &lt;a href=&#34;https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/&#34;&gt;the Perseverance rover on Mars!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsurprisingly, we still do not have vaccines in this country.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://webdevlaw.uk/2021/01/30/why-generation-x-will-save-the-web/&#34;&gt;Why Generation X Will Save the Web&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m generation X! I think?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sci-fi author John Scalzi shares &lt;a href=&#34;https://whatever.scalzi.com/2021/02/13/general-unstructured-thoughts-on-being-cancelled/?amp=1&#34;&gt;some thoughts on &amp;ldquo;being cancelled&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In regards to front-end web development: &lt;a href=&#34;https://remysharp.com/2021/02/11/the-web-didnt-change-you-did&#34;&gt;The web didn&amp;rsquo;t change; you did.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://biglist.terraaeon.com/index.html&#34;&gt;The Big List of Personal Websites&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of blogs to browse!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noah Smith shares some &lt;a href=&#34;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/my-sci-fi-novel-recommendations&#34;&gt;sci-fi novel recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. Saving to go through later to add to my perennially-behind-book-backlog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a bunch of family and medical stuff to do this coming week, so I don&amp;rsquo;t expect to be very productive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had a &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/02/1362173871806287872/&#34;&gt;Globe fiber internet outage&lt;/a&gt; last week, starting Tuesday afternoon until Thursday morning. So I spent all of Ash Wednesday without internet, which is appropriate as a bit of &lt;em&gt;penitencia&lt;/em&gt; I guess. Spent the downtime complaining at their customer support account, and also reading and playing offline things. I thought about writing a post about their customer service, but it was an actual outage that affected a bunch of people in the area, and the customer service can&amp;rsquo;t really do much about that, so it seems a bit mean to pile on now that the service has been restored (and I seem to have gotten a rebate for the lost days). Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll still write the post, we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caught up with B99 up to season 7. Looks like the final season might not come out until 2022 though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went ahead and finished The Expanse season 5 yesterday. Overall the season wasn&amp;rsquo;t as exciting as some of the earlier ones, but still pretty good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; ended on another cliffhanger this week as usual, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big surprise for me, given everyone on reddit had been predicting it. Two eps to go, hoping for a strong finish!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I played a lot of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/Kaldheim&#34;&gt;Kaldheim limited this week&lt;/a&gt;, drafts at first as usual, then I did some sealeds to prep for the Arena Open, which I also did as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/02/1363386731240726533/&#34;&gt;season finale&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmU0vkKslGXgza5YFq3PfZZGHwyRIYYU-&#34;&gt;Kaldheim limited youtube playlist&lt;/a&gt;. I enjoyed this format, though I wasn&amp;rsquo;t super good at it (mostly my fault, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t really read up on pick orders and such early on). It&amp;rsquo;s fun and challenging. Looking forward to Strixhaven!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks to our internet outage, I finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/922710/Knightin/&#34;&gt;Knightin&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;! There&amp;rsquo;s a couple of achievements I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten which I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;ll bother - they&amp;rsquo;re for doing a speedrun and a no-death run, both of which I can probably do with a bit of practice, but not sure it&amp;rsquo;s worth it. I did like the game though, I might write a short review this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run still in progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks to our internet outage, I finished reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/walkaway/&#34;&gt;Cory Doctorow&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Walkaway&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Also started reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://scottberkun.com/the-ghost-of-my-father/&#34;&gt;Scott Berkun&amp;rsquo;s Ghost of my Father&lt;/a&gt;, which turned out to be a quick read, will probably finish it tonight or tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;penultimate WandaVision ep!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Street Fighter 6 first drop for season 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Civ6 New Frontier Pass free update for February (improved Barbarians mode!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Superman and Lois premiering this week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holiday on Thursday! (EDSA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AboutQuiz league season finale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;various family celebrations and medical errands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trump has been acquitted in his second impeachment trial, proving yet again to the world that the US is a flawed democracy dominated by corruption at the highest levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duterte says &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/duterte-cannot-afford-be-brave-in-mouth-against-china&#34;&gt;he cannot be brave in the mouth against China&lt;/a&gt;. Back before the 2016 elections, somebody I used to know claimed that we needed a &amp;ldquo;rottweiler&amp;rdquo; like Duterte as president because he would be tough against China. I remember this sometimes and laugh and then am also sad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A couple of Zelda-themed videos I enjoyed for some reason:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wsi1IbjPAkM&#34;&gt;Life as a Bokoblin - A Zelda Nature Documentary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDPRwLlpdTU&#34;&gt;The Legend of Beavis&lt;/a&gt;. This one is super dumb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this &lt;a href=&#34;https://cosmicdirtbag.com/2020/12/07/crop-circles-part-01/&#34;&gt;short webcomic series about crop circles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smolcss.dev/&#34;&gt;Smolcss.dev&lt;/a&gt;: Minimal snippets for modern CSS layouts and components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For everyone who likes NPM, there was this &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610&#34;&gt;fun story this week&lt;/a&gt; about attacking private source code repos by creating public versions of their private dependencies, so that NPM would pull those new public versions instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/books/a35118667/how-to-write-a-novel/&#34;&gt;How to Write a Novel, According to 10 Really Good Novelists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275441/jack-dorsey-decentralized-app-store-algorithms&#34;&gt;Twitter&amp;rsquo;s Jack Dorsey imagines a decentralized app store for social media algorithms&lt;/a&gt;. The article is sparse on details and I don&amp;rsquo;t know how accurate it is, but I do like the idea, if only because I hope somebody implements just the chronological timeline algorithm everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still working on that secret thing I&amp;rsquo;m learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote a bunch of actual non-weeknotes &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/blog/&#34;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt; last week, so go check them out! Or don&amp;rsquo;t, I&amp;rsquo;m not your mother.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily sketches still ongoing in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt;, somehow still managing to keep up. I make no pretense that the sketches are actually good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching a lot of old Brooklyn Nine-Nine eps, still haven&amp;rsquo;t caught up to the latest season already on Netflix. Was announced last week that the next season, only 10 eps, will be the last one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also started trying to catch up on The Expanse. This series is so hard to binge because each episode feels so heavy and dense I feel like I need time to absorb and reflect. Would have been perfect to be watching the eps weekly as they drop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; on the other hand continues to be really effective/frustrating with their cliffhangers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/f9e8b66a362f9a61612057f4db10b9cf/&#34;&gt;This note&lt;/a&gt; summarizes how I feel about these three shows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/Kaldheim&#34;&gt;Kaldheim drafts are continuing&lt;/a&gt;, although I find I&amp;rsquo;m much worse at this than Zendikar Rising. Despite being so terrible, I am considering throwing gems away on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/announcing-february-2021-arena-open-2021-02-10&#34;&gt;Sealed Arena Open next weekend&lt;/a&gt;, seems like it could be fund (although there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance of instant regret!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s this small indie game I bought a while back called &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/922710/Knightin/&#34;&gt;Knightin&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, I tried it a bit, kinda neat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Been getting back into Fire Emblem Three Heroes, on my second run at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Couple of gaming things this week that I&amp;rsquo;m interested in:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Street Fighter V made their initial previews for the first drop in season 5. The season pass includes something that lets me random select on ranked! I&amp;rsquo;d love to that, and I&amp;rsquo;d love to play more SF5 despite being so trash at it, except the real problem is I find it so hard to find online matches (possibly because I&amp;rsquo;m so bronze tier). Still, tempted to get this pass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser&amp;rsquo;s Fury for Switch released this week. Was initially not interested since I already finished 3D World on WiiU, but I saw a preview that made Bowser&amp;rsquo;s Fury look like a significant addition, so now I am once again waffling about whether to throw money Nintendo&amp;rsquo;s way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Still reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Walkaway-Novel-Cory-Doctorow-ebook/dp/B01FQQ47OC/&#34;&gt;Cory Doctorow&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Walkaway&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt; We were terrible in this week&amp;rsquo;s About Quiz, mostly due to the abundance of PH-local questions which we always find difficult. We finished second last, but I think we still manage to retain first place in the league, by a razor-thin margin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started to use an electric massager and doing arm rotations and other weird exercises to help loosen up my left shoulder and maybe regain flexibility and alleviate muscle pains. Here&amp;rsquo;s to hoping it works!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My eyes are a bit tired. Quite possibly from playing too much Fire Emblem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward-to-this-coming-week&#34;&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yet another WandaVision ep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new One Piece later today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think we should also be getting details on the next Civ6 New Frontier Pass drop next week? It should just be a free update for this month though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oh Ash Wednesday is this week, I wonder if they&amp;rsquo;ll provide an alternative for people who still don&amp;rsquo;t want to go to the actual church&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s February! We are nearing the one year anniversary of being in the longest covid19 lockdown in the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Myanmar&amp;rsquo;s military staged a coup, and have apparently cut off the country from the internet, maybe? Last night during an international voice chat, the two of us who were in the Philippines were suddenly dropped/disconnected and one of my first thoughts were &amp;ldquo;Wait, is there a coup happening in our country RIGHT NOW?&amp;rdquo; Luckily no, it was just the typical bad internet we have here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In local news: &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1392144/fwd-media-orgs-groups-call-out-parlade-for-remarks-vs-inquirer-net-reporter-shows-perils-of-anti-terror-act&#34;&gt;Red-tagging&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1392466/manigas-kayong-lahat-roque-touts-duterte-for-infrastructure-success-beating-covid-19&#34;&gt;immature public officials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1392786/go-says-duterte-also-against-imposing-child-car-seat-law-at-the-moment&#34;&gt;people objecting to laws due to poorly-thought of implementation rules&lt;/a&gt;, etc. So, same-same. Oh, also the anti-terror law challenged in the Supreme Court, and Napoles finally convicted of the pork barrel scam after a five-year trial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like noting down these current events in the weeknotes because they help future me frame my personal happenings around what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the world, but in a way &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/1358305512517849089/&#34;&gt;it can get exhausting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing for today, I&amp;rsquo;ll post some stuff later this week, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have been busy for the past week, mostly learning a thing that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about right now. So I haven&amp;rsquo;t been wandering the internets that much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily sketches still ongoing in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gurren Lagann&lt;/strong&gt; was added to Netflix! I watched the first few episodes, the series is as insane as I remember. It has English dubs, so I can watch it in the background (since I&amp;rsquo;ve already seen it before), but I have a bunch of other stuff to watch, so we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; episode 5 was fantastic. It also may or may not be a BIG DEAL (tm). We&amp;rsquo;ll see. I was a bit annoyed that this was a weekly show, but the reality is that their cliffhangers wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been as effective (or generated as much discussion/hype) if all the episodes came in one drop, so I guess it&amp;rsquo;s okay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On a whim, I decided to watch the &lt;strong&gt;Royal Rumble&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s so weird since their events have virtual audiences (with the wall of faces). Also like 1/3 to 1/2 of the actual Rumble participants have been around since forever, and in fact the current winner Edge won the Rumble for the first time 11 years ago to the day (which, together with him starting at #1, was a pretty strong hint he&amp;rsquo;d be winning). Not sure if I&amp;rsquo;d watch Wrestlemania in two months, since I don&amp;rsquo;t really follow anymore and I&amp;rsquo;m not really invested in the storylines or anything, but they really do a pretty good job of recapping storylines, feuds, etc in the events themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Humble Choice is out and includes &lt;strong&gt;Valkyria Chronicles 4&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Endless Space 2&lt;/strong&gt;, which seem like good picks for me, so I&amp;rsquo;m probably getting it. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2009/01/valkyria-chronicles/&#34;&gt;played the first Valkyria Chronicles more than a decade ago&lt;/a&gt; and I was surprised to know there&amp;rsquo;d already been 3 sequels, so looking forward to this one. Endless Space looks like my kind of jam as well. What? Backlog? What&amp;rsquo;s that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have already drafted a bit of &lt;strong&gt;Kaldheim&lt;/strong&gt; on Magic Arena. It&amp;rsquo;s proving to be a rather fun format, and I did already get my first 7-x run on the third try. Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/Kaldheim&#34;&gt;Kaldheim tag&lt;/a&gt; for details/VODs/etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Finished Scott Berkun&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Year-Without-Pants-WordPress-com-Future/dp/1118660633&#34;&gt;The Year Without Pants&lt;/a&gt;, review sometime this week. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what to read next, so I just sat down and scrolled through the files in my Kindle til I decided on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Walkaway-Novel-Cory-Doctorow-ebook/dp/B01FQQ47OC/&#34;&gt;Cory Doctorow&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Walkaway&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt; Hey, we somehow managed to win this week&amp;rsquo;s AboutQuiz, so we are back on top of the league standings, I think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muscle pains in my left upper arm/shoulder seem to be more prevalent. Not more painful or anything, but like, easier to trigger at random angles so now I find myself wincing a lot. And the arm has a lot less flexibility when doing something like reaching behind me or such. At this point I should probably get a massage or something to try to fix it, but that would mean interacting with a stranger!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward-to-this-coming-week&#34;&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as always (at least until March), more WandaVision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new One Piece later today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s February tomorrow! Somehow, the world still turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somehow the most viral world news this week doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have been about any kind of politics, but rather about capitalism. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1354670019045584899/&#34;&gt;Gamestop/stock market brouhaha&lt;/a&gt; was a sage of retail investors on reddit going head-to-head with hedge funds over the stock price of a dying gaming company (among others) that dominated most of my feeds for the week. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a lot more compliced than that. If you want a more in-depth look, I recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine&#34;&gt;Matt Levine&amp;rsquo;s Money Stuff column over on Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, he covered the whole thing for most of the week. You can start &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-25/the-game-never-stops&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tony Hawk, age 52, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tonyhawk/status/1354305117982400514&#34;&gt;can still hit a 720&lt;/a&gt;, probably his last one ever. I think it&amp;rsquo;d kind of a bittersweet blessing to be doing something you love and knowing that it&amp;rsquo;s going to be the last time you get to do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/crossover-project/are-we-really-engineers/&#34;&gt;excellent series of posts by Hillel Wayne&lt;/a&gt; comparing software engineering to other engineering disciplines by interviewing people who have crossed over from other fields into ours. It addresses interesting questions like whether what we do can really be called &amp;ldquo;engineering&amp;rdquo; and what can software engineering and other engineering fields learn from each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kottke.org/21/01/usa-downgraded-from-democracy-to-anocracy-part-democracy-and-part-dictatorship&#34;&gt;USA has been downgraded from a democracy to an anocracy&lt;/a&gt;. This was the first time I heard of this term, anocracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.engadget.com/facebook-political-content-news-feed-mark-zuckerberg-232846266.html&#34;&gt;Facebook says they want to deprioritize political content&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ll see if that holds, given that generating political heat is good for their engagement metrics. But if such a thing were to happen (and applied to the PH), it would seriously reduce the reach of government propaganda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of Facebook, they appear to have recently &lt;a href=&#34;https://lincoln.metacannon.net/2021/01/facebook-disabled-my-account-after-i-criticized-them.html&#34;&gt;banned someone for criticizing them.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have yet to read through all of it, but there&amp;rsquo;s this metafilter thread full of all sorts of recommendations: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ask.metafilter.com/351766/What-do-you-always-recommend-to-people&#34;&gt;What do you always recommend to people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Chris Kiehl talks about &lt;a href=&#34;https://chriskiehl.com/article/thoughts-after-6-years&#34;&gt;software dev topics he&amp;rsquo;s changed his mind on after the last 6 years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rands talks about &lt;a href=&#34;https://randsinrepose.com/archives/doomscrolling-at-scale/&#34;&gt;doomscrolling at scale&lt;/a&gt; using Tweetdeck, an app &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/why-twitter/&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always recommended&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily sketches in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt;, somehow I still haven&amp;rsquo;t fallen behind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started watching the current NCIS season (TIL Fez from That 70s Show is a cast regular there now!) and also a bunch of Mike Birbiglia standup specials on Netflix. I do have other more interesting series on my backlog to watch, but somehow I found myself falling back to procedurals and standup comedy. The main reason is that these things don&amp;rsquo;t require a lot of attention, so I can leave them running in the background while I do other things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will admit I was a bit meh on &lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; episodes 1-3 (and even for the rest of the MCU offerings this year), but episode 4 was just fantastic and has renewed my MCU hype. If they manage to hit this level of quality for their other series, we have a lot to look forward to. It makes me a bit sad that the Netflix series/Agents of SHIELD never received the kind of MCU integration these series are getting, but what can you do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of gaming for me this week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played three whole games of &lt;strong&gt;Civilization VI&lt;/strong&gt; over the past week, two of them before the latest New Frontier Pass drop even. I won one game with the new Civ Vietnam. (I &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFiA4HBCi8&#34;&gt;streamed a bit of this game&lt;/a&gt; if you want to watch me be dumb.) I&amp;rsquo;m glad I got one already, because I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;d play them again, as the terrain restrictions are very challenging. The Corporations mode is nice, but I feel like I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet maximized it too much. It does feel like I&amp;rsquo;ll be enabling this by default from now on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of reasons, I purchased a copy of &lt;strong&gt;Princess Maker 2 Refine&lt;/strong&gt; on Steam. I played a bunch of the original game back in the day, and it was weird reading through the old guides on GameFAQs and some of them would have advice on configuring old-timey things like &lt;code&gt;config.sys&lt;/code&gt; and such. Anyway, I played almost 5 hours of this in one session, which was really bad for my eyestrain. This was one of the first calendar-based life sims I played, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the reason I really enjoyed the Persona series? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why I found this game in particular so engaging, as it&amp;rsquo;s kind of like watching spreadsheet numbers go up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kaldheim&lt;/strong&gt; is out on Magic Arena! I only had time to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1355164547842248704/&#34;&gt;do a Sealed&lt;/a&gt; so far, but I expect to be drafting (and streaming on Twitch) a few times a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Still reading Scott Berkun&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Year-Without-Pants-WordPress-com-Future/dp/1118660633&#34;&gt;The Year Without Pants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finances:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t talk about my finances a lot in this space, but I will note that a couple of weeks ago I started investing in the US markets via an app called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.etoro.com/&#34;&gt;eToro&lt;/a&gt;. I got lucky with an initial trade that had a bit too much leverage for my taste, because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t reading too carefully. Luckily the NASDAQ spiked that day so I made it out with a bit of profit. I used a bit of that profit to buy-in a minimal amount of Gamestop, trying to cash in on the trend, unfortunately I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get in on a low price. Well, I can afford to risk (and lose) this profit, so that&amp;rsquo;s fine. I just hope the Gamestop thing doesn&amp;rsquo;t crash the markets entirely, that would be just my luck for such a thing to happen just when I started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt; We were still ahead in the AboutQuiz league going into this week&amp;rsquo;s Price is Right-themed game, but we only finished 5th this time, so IDK if that will still hold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a lot of family errands during the week as well, mostly financial stuff and helping my folks with medical appointments and such. I think this was the week where I had the most trips out of the house since the pandemic lockdowns began.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;site-updates&#34;&gt;Site updates:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you follow this site via an RSS/feed reader (both of you), you may want to know that I&amp;rsquo;ve added a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/daily/feed/&#34;&gt;daily feed&lt;/a&gt; to the site, it will cough up a single post per day with a summary of all the things I&amp;rsquo;ve posted for that day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward-to-this-coming-week&#34;&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new WandaVision episode!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a new thing I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to learn/get into, hoping to get started on it this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Wow, January is almost done. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biden inaugurated as US president, world celebrates US getting rid of Trump. Biden isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly unproblematic, but he is at least sane and boring. There will be time enough to criticize him later, for now let them be enjoy victory. My expectations of him are at least moderately higher than &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2017/01/822558467265335297/&#34;&gt;the ones I had for Trump&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the internet gets inundated with an inordinate amount of Bernie Sanders memes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;locally: the govt continues to bombard us with controversies, this time stirring up a red-tagging hornests nest by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/phkule/status/1351128229462028288&#34;&gt;abrogating the DND-UP accord&lt;/a&gt;, paving the way for militarization of campuses and stifling of free expression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone made &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJH_RbnrGUs&#34;&gt;a Mandalorian trailer in the style of old-school spaghetti westerns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like this &lt;a href=&#34;https://myk.ninja/loremen&#34;&gt;random lore generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote a bunch of words about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/tech-censorship/&#34;&gt;my thoughts on tech censorship and social media&lt;/a&gt;; there are some relevant links in there, if that kind of thing interests you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.idrlabs.com/difficult-person/test.php&#34;&gt;difficult person test&lt;/a&gt; did the rounds in some of my online groups this week (and sparked some silly discussions about gaming self-assessments)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wow, did I not internet that much or was the internet just boring this week? Boring can be good though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily sketches in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt;, ongoing, streak yet unbroken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1352137686614564867/&#34;&gt;World War Z&lt;/a&gt;, though I kinda wish I had seen it back at the start of the pandemic, seemed like it would have been appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WandaVision ep 3: So weird! I don&amp;rsquo;t mind the sitcom stuff, though I&amp;rsquo;m mostly here for the Marvel plots. The pacing is fine, with just enough easter eggs and plot teasing to not be annoying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kicked off a second run of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1349796416042856448/&#34;&gt;Fire Emblem Three Houses&lt;/a&gt;! Now in hard/classic, and going down the red/Black Eagle path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG: &lt;strong&gt;Kaldheim&lt;/strong&gt; previews are done, and set is out on Arena next week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular Saturday gaming group tried to do some Jackbox games via Discord, but we ran into audio issues, so we ended up just playing Sentinels and Root again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books: I finished reading Katie Mack&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;End of Everything&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;, here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/end-of-everything/&#34;&gt;a short review&lt;/a&gt;. For the next book, I started on Scott Berkun&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Year-Without-Pants-WordPress-com-Future/dp/1118660633&#34;&gt;The Year Without Pants&lt;/a&gt; of which I&amp;rsquo;ve had a copy forever. It&amp;rsquo;s about remote work back in the early 2010s, which is a fun contrast to our current remote work-heavy world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz: We actually won the online Wheel of Fortune-themed AboutQuiz the week before this (forgot to mention in last week&amp;rsquo;s notes), so we were defending champs in this week&amp;rsquo;s Weakest Link-themed quiz, but we were too conservative with our banks and only finished 3rd place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health: Still have muscle pains in my left upper bicep and shoulder, though they seem to be in different places compared to before? Am using this hand massager to massage the area occassionally while I&amp;rsquo;m at the computer, and still continuing the warm compress. Hoping this fixes it up soon, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to ask a stranger to come in and massage me or whatever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the first time since March, I put on pants! I had only been going out in shorts when going to the grocery or the nearby pharmacy, but this week I had to do an errand at a hospital a bit farther away, so I figured it would be a good time to figure out where my pants were. Hospital protocols were strict, as expected. We had to wait in like 3 different waiting areas before we could get to our appointment. This hospital was one of the hotspots back in the early days of the pandemic, so their vigilance is reassuring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PC died unexpectedly today. As in, lost power while I was using it and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t turn back on, power light just blinking. This has happened once before, towards the end of 2020. Back then I had tried unplugging the power supply and opening it up, then reconnecting to see what happened, and it just miraculously fixed itself. This time, I just unplugged the PS, then left it alone for a while. When I came back later and reconnected everything and booted up, it was fine. So I guess there&amp;rsquo;s some issue with the power supply? I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to upgrade just yet, although this rig is already more than 5 years old, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping I can get a couple more years out of it at least. (That and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to go to a shop to have one assembled during the pandemic, and I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna do the assembly myself.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I filled up an online application form for Quezon City&amp;rsquo;s new QC id, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how this goes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward-to-this-coming-week&#34;&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new WandaVision episode!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaldheim releases on Magic Arena!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new drop in Civ6&amp;rsquo;s New Frontier pack!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;This is 2021 week 3. Or week 2. Two and a half? How do calendars work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;relatively calm compared to the chaos of the previous week. However in the US, a storm may be brewing over Biden&amp;rsquo;s inauguration next week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;locally: still a lot of confusion/inconsistencies around the vaccination plan. Or at least &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/01/17/2071005/senate-seeks-further-hearings-vaccines&#34;&gt;some senators think so&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, we are close to breaching 500k cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot about personal note taking recently, in a bid to find ways to improve my own systems. I skimmed this book from like 2004ish: &lt;a href=&#34;https://users.speakeasy.net/~lion/nb/html/&#34;&gt;How to Make a Complete Map of Every Thought You Think&lt;/a&gt;, which is like a super paper-heavy system. Probably totally impractical (for me at least), but some ideas there worth considering. The modern day equivalent would be something like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/&#34;&gt;Zettelkasten method&lt;/a&gt;, something I&amp;rsquo;ve also been considering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I read this Substack &lt;a href=&#34;https://paulskallas.substack.com/p/is-culture-stuck&#34;&gt;post about culture being stuck in the mid-2000s&lt;/a&gt;, presumably because the Internet became mainstream and people started forming a hivemind around what was popular, and creators responded accordingly by creating more of the same stuff. I think there&amp;rsquo;s still some space for fringe tastes out there, but it is true that pop culture has seemed monolothic recently. What hits me most from the article is the phasing out of rock n roll in favor of hip hop, because a more diverse crowd favors it. I&amp;rsquo;m not really a hip hop person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cory Doctorow &lt;a href=&#34;https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/&#34;&gt;blogs about his daily linkblogging process&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate 20 years of blogging. This reminded me that during my recent blog-hopping I also ran across &lt;a href=&#34;https://althouse.blogspot.com/2021/01/another-bloggiversary-this-blog-is-17.html&#34;&gt;Ann Althouse&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt;, which has been posting daily for 17 years without breaking the streak! I kind of wish I could be that prolific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald%27s_Restaurants&#34;&gt;McDonald&amp;rsquo;s coffee lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, often held up as an example of frivolous ambulance-chasing lawsuits, was much more complicated than that. The woman was hospitalized for more than a week and had to have skin grafts, and McDonald&amp;rsquo;s refused to settle for more than $800, which wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have even covered medical expenses, leading to the huge jury award.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tom Critchlow asks &lt;a href=&#34;https://tomcritchlow.com/2021/01/14/new-browsers/&#34;&gt;why we can&amp;rsquo;t write code in our browsers&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel B. Markham argues that &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielbmarkham.com/the-platform-is-the-enemy/&#34;&gt;platforms might be turning us into idiots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this (kinda old) story about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.damninteresting.com/who-wants-to-be-a-thousandaire&#34;&gt;a guy who hacked a TV game show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not a big fan of Tiktok, but I admit I have been enjoying some of the sea shanty performances coming out of it. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/etelsverdlov/status/1348654717036093440&#34;&gt;Example one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/EKingstonBooks/status/1349906687537373189&#34;&gt;example two&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PH stuff: A trailer came out for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ4ChZPlikM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&#34;&gt;Voltes V Legacy&lt;/a&gt;, which will be airing on GMA. I don&amp;rsquo;t have high expectations, but the animation seemed decent enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily sketches in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt;. I used to crosspost them all to &lt;a href=&#34;https://instagram.com/roytang0400&#34;&gt;instagram&lt;/a&gt; pretty consistently, but now I only do it when I feel like it. Been thinking of getting off instagram anyway, but that&amp;rsquo;s something for another time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finished &lt;strong&gt;Spectacular Spider-Man&lt;/strong&gt; on Netflix. I liked it, even if it was a kids&amp;rsquo; show. Too bad it was cut off abruptly due to licensing issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also started (re-?) watching Attack on Titan, from season 1, as the final season has been getting some hype. Anime is hard to background-watch though (due to subs), so this might take a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched my first two movies of the year: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1350042544567029763/&#34;&gt;The Godfather&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1350361902149324800/&#34;&gt;The Godfather Part II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First two eps of WandaVision are in! It&amp;rsquo;s so weird. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing how things unfold. Series runs until March, I feel like I should do one of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/spoiler-free-review/&#34;&gt;spoiler-free reviews&lt;/a&gt; when it&amp;rsquo;s done (haven&amp;rsquo;t done any of those in a while) but it feels weird to do it for a show that drops weekly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1349796416042856448/&#34;&gt;Fire Emblem Three Houses&lt;/a&gt;! Will probably kick off the 2nd run sometime this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG: &lt;strong&gt;Kaldheim&lt;/strong&gt; preview season in progress. I am fairly excited for the new set to come in, because I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to draft, the limited environment looks exciting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I feel like I should be starting one of the many Steam RPGs on my backlog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books: Been reading Katie Mack&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;End of Everything&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;m around 2/3rds in, so hopefully I can finish it and at least get 1 book in this month lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health: My muscle pains in the left upper arm are still there, although they&amp;rsquo;ve tapered off a bit, I think because I&amp;rsquo;ve been applying warm compresses twice a day for most of the week. Hopefully it will be gone by next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward-to-this-coming-week&#34;&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biden inauguration (chaos?!?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometime this week, I will probably put on pants for the first time since March.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;We are barely more than a week into 2021 and it has already been quite a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the week started off with something as innocuous as a guy going viral for making his daughter work six hours to figure out how to use a can opener and open a can of beans. I can&amp;rsquo;t explain &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9506541/bean-dad-explainer-reactions/&#34;&gt;Bean Dad&lt;/a&gt;, but it was so weird and surreal the way it took over the internet for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;impossible to discuss the last week without mentioning the violent attack by Trump supporters on the US capitol upon incitement by the president himself
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching the events unfolding on the news &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1347017186317983745/&#34;&gt;gave me the same feeling as watching the 9/11 twin towers assault almost two decades ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the subsequent condemnation and consequences not just from US politicians but worldwide, including Trump himself subsequently getting booted off/banned from almost every social media service (of course sparking many opinions about the first amendment and the disproportionate control by tech giants over the public sphere).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s talk of second impeachment and 25th amendment calls (I know about the 25th amendment mostly due to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1347018337990021122/&#34;&gt;Air Force One&lt;/a&gt;), although Pence has thumbed that down. If Trump faces no consequences for this one, they might be looking at something much worse down the line, possibly as soon as the Biden inauguration on the 20th.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s consequences for the actual rioters though: many are being identified on social media and some have already been fired from their jobs. Nascent social media app Parler, used to coordinate the attacks, has been booted off Apple and Google mobile stores AND off their Amazon webhosting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, gootecks showed himself to be once again a MAGA idiot supporting the violence, so his emote got banned from Twitch, which was a weird piece of news.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yesterday (Saturday) was the feast of the Black Nazarene, a big deal in Manila. It was reported that &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1381685/doh-to-quiapo-crowd-watch-for-symptoms&#34;&gt;up to 400,000 devotees&lt;/a&gt; crowded the streets of Manila in what is probably a COVID19 super-spreader event. I mean sure, we held back and stayed at home for Holy Week/Easter/Christmas but somehow we can&amp;rsquo;t avoid celebrating the Black Nazarene. This when our local case counts have been rising since the holidays. Sigh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started these weeknotes, I sometimes put in a section with recent links I&amp;rsquo;ve found interesting during the week. It kind of died off, mostly because I haven&amp;rsquo;t been good about going through my backlog of feeds and sources to get much content for the section. I&amp;rsquo;m bringing it back here as a regular section (for now), so that (a) I force myself to go through all that stuff at least once a week; and (b) people who aren&amp;rsquo;t super interested in what&amp;rsquo;s going on with me have more stuff to read in these weeknotes. I also considered just having a separate weekly &amp;ldquo;linkblog&amp;rdquo; post with the links of interest section, but figured maybe I&amp;rsquo;d check first if I can keep up with the volume needed for that sort of thing? Also, a lot of these are available on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/links/&#34;&gt;links&lt;/a&gt; list, which I also share to Twitter/Masto as they come, so if you follow me there, you might have seen me tweet some of these, and this is just sort of a weekly recap. Anyway, for this week, here we go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for gamers, the wonderful &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.engadget.com/spotify-persona-5-4-3-fes-2-pq-dancing-arena-soundtracks-104349652.html&#34;&gt;Persona 4 and 5 soundtracks are now officially available on Spotify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for people who like old-school blogs and personal websites: Robin Rendle writes &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.robinrendle.com/essays/newsletters&#34;&gt;a nicely-formatted post about newsletters and writing on the web&lt;/a&gt;, Desmond Rivet wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://desmondrivet.com/2020/04/28/writing-reasons&#34;&gt;about using his blog to manage his thinking&lt;/a&gt; back in Apr 2020, and I realized I never shared this &lt;a href=&#34;https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse&#34;&gt;2019 post from Matthias Ott about personal websites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For self-improvement, ideopunk &lt;a href=&#34;https://ideopunk.com/2020/12/22/100-tips-for-a-better-life/&#34;&gt;talks about 100 tips for a better life&lt;/a&gt;. Probably not all of these are for you, but maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll get some stuff of interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For optimists, it can be nice to know there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://reasonstobecheerful.world/the-year-in-cheer/&#34;&gt;quite a few bits of good news in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, in spite of everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snAhsXyO3Ck&#34;&gt;video about lockdown productivity&lt;/a&gt; came out early on in the pandemic, but a lot of the advice still seems sound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.damninteresting.com/who-wants-to-be-a-thousandaire/&#34;&gt;old story about a guy who gamed one of the earliest game shows&lt;/a&gt; by studying the RNG patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some recent Twitter threads of interest:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently, it&amp;rsquo;s a thing for teens &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/unikunka/status/1346602536904523777&#34;&gt;to disbelieve in Hellen Keller&lt;/a&gt;, wth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are told that abusers and white supremacists &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lilithsaintcrow/status/1347293759155838976&#34;&gt;absolutely do not believe their own bullshit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to determine if &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/NomeDaBarbarian/status/1338876619205746688&#34;&gt;something is a sandwich&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone compiled some ridiculous &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/paulisci/status/1340764722811957248&#34;&gt;2020 headlines of the year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hey, the new daily habits I kicked off starting the New Year are holding strong so far. Well, except for daily blog posting, I missed yesterday. But I never claimed that as a resolution, so maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t count that.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily sketches in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;rsquo;re not super good, but maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll like that kind of thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I binged season 3 of &lt;strong&gt;Cobra Kai&lt;/strong&gt; in under 24 hours. Still greatly enjoying it, despite the high school drama. I really like the evolving dynamic between Johnny and Daniel, and the callbacks to all 3 Karate Kid movies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For my background watching I started &lt;strong&gt;Spectacular Spider-Man&lt;/strong&gt; on Netflix. Not bad for a kids&amp;rsquo; show, covers most of the mythos fairly well, though I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed at how Peter treats Gwen like a sidekick given in the comics she&amp;rsquo;s the love of his life. I&amp;rsquo;m only halfway through, maybe that changes later? I always felt Spider-man was better as a serialized TV series than the constant movie reboots. He has a lot of nice street-level villains and supporting cast that can only feature in a longer storyline than blockbuster movies can afford. Oh well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Star Trek Discovery&lt;/strong&gt; Season 3 finale was this week. Nothing too exceptional, I mean, we knew they were going to pull out a win somehow, there were very few surprises. Star Wars wins 2020 I guess lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Emblem Three Houses&lt;/strong&gt; still ongoing. I actually took a few days break this week because I felt like I was playing it a bit too much lol. I think I&amp;rsquo;m fairly close to the end though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG: &lt;strong&gt;Kaldheim&lt;/strong&gt; preview season kicked off this week, but nothing too exciting for me so far, though there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of interesting cards of course. Lore-wise, I do like how they translated a lot of the Norse myth stuff into card form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books: Been reading Katie Mack&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;End of Everything&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty interesting so far, but I&amp;rsquo;m less than halfway in, not a good rate. To help reinforce my book reading, I&amp;rsquo;ve switched up my evening meals reading from the day&amp;rsquo;s news to whatever book I have on tap at the moment. It works I guess, but I eat quickly, so I don&amp;rsquo;t get to read much per session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the past week or so I&amp;rsquo;ve had some kind of strange muscle (?) pain in my upper left bicep, but only when I hold up the arm or stretch it at certain angles. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of annoying, like I slept on it wrong. I thought it would just go away on its own, but now I&amp;rsquo;m thinking maybe it&amp;rsquo;s one of those old age things where things just hurt randomly and you have to live with it?!? Friends recommended trying a warm compress and/or self-massage on the arm, gonna try those out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward-to-this-coming-week&#34;&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WandaVision kicks off on Disney+! I think we&amp;rsquo;re getting two episodes this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more Kaldheim previews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a brand new year, a brand new week, a brand new day. There&amp;rsquo;s no real reason to believe 2021 will be a better year, but we can choose to try to be better, and maybe that in itself is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week&amp;rsquo;s New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve transition played out pretty much as expected. We just stayed at home, actually had an early media noche dinner (around 9ish) and observed the fireworks for a little bit. Yes, there were still fireworks, despite the supposed ban at the LGU level. I would estimate a drop in fireworks volume of maybe 20% at best. Ma says maybe most of those are &amp;ldquo;sanctioned&amp;rdquo; fireworks in common areas, but I remain unconvinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/2020-year-in-review/&#34;&gt;year in review blog post&lt;/a&gt; covered most of the stats for the past year. I enjoyed putting this together, I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker both for reflecting over the past and for gathering stats, so it&amp;rsquo;s a pleasant combination for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really believe in New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions anymore, but I did decide to try to restart a few daily habits and see which ones stick. Don&amp;rsquo;t feel like talking about them all here, but a couple are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the daily walking, but this time I only do a small loop right in front of the house and still inside our subdivision. It&amp;rsquo;s super boring, so I can&amp;rsquo;t tolerate doing it for too long, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get used to it. I&amp;rsquo;ve started listening to a trivia podcast while walking, maybe that will help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/03/sketching-daily/&#34;&gt;sketchdaily&lt;/a&gt;! This might be the most ambitious one. You can check all my sketches via &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt; on this site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;: Fire Emblem run ongoing! And the usual Eternal, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/1344593852154347520/&#34;&gt;Magic Arena&lt;/a&gt;, regular Saturday gaming, etc. I paused on the new Humble Monthly, seems meh. There&amp;rsquo;s still time to get stuff from the Steam sale, but there&amp;rsquo;s nothing particularly interesting. FOR NOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching&lt;/strong&gt;: I finally watched Wonder Woman 1984. Kind of meh. First one was definitely better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: I purchased Katie Mack&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;ldquo;The End of Everything&amp;rdquo; on Kindle because it was on sale, hopefully to restart the book reading habit for the New Year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star Trek Discovery season finale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG Kaldheim preview season kicking off!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shenanigans in the US congress/senate when they try to certify the EC results. Also Georgia elections determine whether Biden will have Senate support!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I started doing these weeknotes at &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/01/weeknotes-01-12/&#34;&gt;the top of 2020&lt;/a&gt;, so this one signals one complete year of doing my weekly reviews/notes in public. I thought it appropriate for a review!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did it turn out to be a good practice? I think for me yes! Not necessarily for anyone following the blog (all 3 of you), since a lot of the weeknotes stuff might seem boring or irrelevant to you. But for me, forcing me to publicly write some thoughts about the past week has been good for my own self-awareness and keeping me writing regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned this in the first weeknotes linked above, but I used to do private weekly reviews before this. I haven&amp;rsquo;t found much need to supplement the public weeknotes with private ones over the year, but that&amp;rsquo;s basically because (a) my other tracking systems have evolved this year to better capture more data, so less review was actually needed; and (b) this silly pandemic keeping me at home most of the year means there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much to report most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I&amp;rsquo;ll be carrying the weeknotes practice into 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the past week, it was of course Christmas week, which went about as expected. Noche buena night was just me and the folks at home, although the brothers and their families did pass by for a short while on the morning of that day for some gift exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world was relatively quiet. Well, there&amp;rsquo;s finally a post-Brexit trade deal, and Trump seems to be screwing over everybody as expected, and there&amp;rsquo;s a new Covid19 variant, and our government is still being dumb. So, same old same old?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good chunk of my week went towards playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/1340074409961222146/&#34;&gt;Fire Emblem Three Houses&lt;/a&gt;. As is typical of JRPGs, the startup is a bit slow, but once you get into the whole Persona-like loop of tasks and battles, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty addictive. Pretty sure this will take a while to finish though!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steam Christmas Sale is still ongoing. Thinking of actually getting Hades, because of all the GOTY accolades it&amp;rsquo;s getting. On the other hand, Fire Emblem&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular weekly gaming with friends: Root, Sentinels of the Multiverse. I also played a couple more Civ6 games for achievement hunting purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new Jeopardy eps on Netflix ran out quickly. Haven&amp;rsquo;t really started on anything seriously yet, though I did watch first episodes of The Expanse S5 and Kimetsu no Yaiba, but I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling like binging either series yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of cramming a few more movies into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/lists/2020/movies/&#34;&gt;2020 movies list&lt;/a&gt; this week, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if I get around to it or just play more Fire Emblem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To whoever is reading this: despite everything about this year, I hope you somehow managed to have a good holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This coming week: end of year stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the penultimate week of the year, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;m not the only who&amp;rsquo;s had enough of this accursed year and looking forward to moving on to the next one. I know that&amp;rsquo;s silly since the world won&amp;rsquo;t magically become better when the calendar flips over to January the first, but I think it helps our mental health to have this sort of &amp;ldquo;fresh start&amp;rdquo; mentality, even if it&amp;rsquo;s on an arbitrarily chosen date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holiday season continues to be weird, thanks to the pandemic. My brothers and I have been trying to hash out how to have the usual holiday gift exchange among the four households. In theory nobody will be coming inside the house, just parking outside and dropping off and picking up gifts, but they need to coordinate since they also need to exchange gifts with each other. They&amp;rsquo;re trying to see if they can synchronize their visits so that the exchanges can happen, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if that works out. Meanwhile, the usual family and extended family reunions will probably happen on Zoom, like many of my friends&amp;rsquo; recent company Christmas parties. Hopefully they go smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the pandemic and the holiday, cases continue to rise locally. This trend will probably carry on into January as a result of holiday gatherings. In pandemic related government screwups recently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requiring face shields everywhere in public, even for joggers or bikers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a pilot for face to face classes in January because the education secretary says they are more likely to get infected at home anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apparently we could have had vaccines as early as the first quarter of 2021, but the health secretary dropped the ball during negotiations with pfizer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I guess they were working with some sort of backlog due to the holiday sales, but my local gaming store took an entire week to ship me my copy of Fire Emblem Fates. It finally arrived last Friday so yay! I haven&amp;rsquo;t started playing yet, beyond opening the package and checking that the cartridge works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead this week, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a bit of achievement hunting in Civilization VI, since a new patch with balance updates dropped last week. I also tried resuming my Wasteland 2 game. It took me a while to get my bearings, but the game just seems so fiddly, I have a hard time getting into it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG: Kaldheim previews started this week! We don&amp;rsquo;t get any more until January though. The metal-themed previews reminded me of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/1339627168947601408/&#34;&gt;something from 10 years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finished The Big Bang Theory rewatch, I totally did not almost tear up at Sheldon&amp;rsquo;s speech in the finale. TBBT gets a lot of flak for being terrible, but I think it holds up reasonably well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;caught up with Mandalorian and Discovery. Discovery was so-so, but wow, the Mandalorian. What a fantastic season finale. I watched it around half a day after the episode dropped and I was very happy I wasn&amp;rsquo;t spoiled by the internet. The team behind the show are doing a great job with the Star Wars franchise. After the problematic sequel trilogy (which I still enjoyed), maybe the real future of the franchise is on episodic TV. Looking forward to all the new Star Wars content next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New background binge watching: There&amp;rsquo;s new episodes of Jeopardy on Netflix! Not a lot, but more trivia is always fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, most of my time was again spent on digging through and sorting old files. Additionally, one of my old external hard drives had also started getting errors, so I ordered and got a new 1tb one, and spent some time trying to move old backup files across from the old drive to the new one. It was annoying because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t play any games that use a controller while this was happening, for fear of disturbing the long file transfers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m kind of looking forward to doing my year in review blog post for this strange and accursed year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Time passes yet again. I think I have to get used to not having much personal stuff to report in the weeknotes on certain weeks (aside from the watching/gaming parts), especially given the pandemic where I&amp;rsquo;m at home 90% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the pandemic, the UK started vaccinations last week, and the US FDA approved the Pfizer vaccine as well, so hopefully this is where things start to turn around. Sadly, it may be a while before vaccinations get widespread, especially here in the Philippines. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping things clear up by mid next year for us here, but I&amp;rsquo;m not optimistic about it. It would be really sad if the pandemic restrictions reach next year&amp;rsquo;s holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that people here seem to realize there&amp;rsquo;s still a pandemic going on, if pictures coming out of Divisoria are any indication. I get that not everyone has access to online shopping, but are there no other options for holiday gift shopping than walking through such dense crowds? This may be one instance where our generous gift-giving culture is bad for us, since people are still out trying to buy gifts when the pandemic is a perfectly good excuse for scaling back on the shopping. Capitalism ho!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The saddest part of this pandemic for me has that my brothers and their families can&amp;rsquo;t come over to visit, which means my parents don&amp;rsquo;t get to see their grandkids (and I don&amp;rsquo;t get to see the pamangkins). Sometimes we push back a bit on that envelope, but it&amp;rsquo;ll be a while before we all really get to see each other and enjoy company in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I managed to finish &lt;strong&gt;Batman: Arkham Origins&lt;/strong&gt;! The main story at least. Achievement completion seems unlikely, given the multiplayer achievements, and even some of the single-player ones seem a bit too challenging. I was able to enjoy the game despite the graphical issues I encountered early on. Lowering the settings helped a lot I think, though things still weren&amp;rsquo;t 100% good. I really take to these style of games where there&amp;rsquo;s an open world and you have a lot of things to collect and such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ordered &lt;strong&gt;Fire Emblem Three Houses&lt;/strong&gt; for the Switch yesterday! I was also considering Paper Mario Origami King, but that had some mixed reviews, so holding off for now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently doing a binge re-watch of The Big Bang Theory as my background watching, I&amp;rsquo;m up to season 7 at the moment. I think the show holds up better than some of its contemporaries such as How I Met Your Mother. I know the geek portrayals can be a bit exaggerated or patronizing, so a lot of geeks don&amp;rsquo;t like it, but for me it&amp;rsquo;s fine. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of doing a bad comic book movie marathon sometime this month, covering the ones I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother watching, stuff like Ben Affleck Daredevil, Michael B Jordan Fantastic Four, and the recently released New Mutants. We&amp;rsquo;ll see if I get around to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just under two weeks until Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This week felt like another set of those moments-in-between, where not much seemed to happen, but it somehow still went by quickly anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the household and the family has slowly gotten used to the idea that any big Christmas celebration isn&amp;rsquo;t happening. My niece&amp;rsquo;s birthday was last weekend, so we sent her gifts via Grab delivery instead of being able to get together. Most likely something similar&amp;rsquo;s going to happen for gift exchanges on Christmas. We&amp;rsquo;re still trying to figure out what we can do in the meantime. The extended family has proposed a zoom call on the day of, instead of our traditional annual get-together, I&amp;rsquo;ll let them manage the logistics of that, they have a lot of digital natives to figure it out I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past couple of weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve made improvements to one of my side projects which is an app I use for personal data tracking. Improvements to that app&amp;rsquo;s feature set meant I could also take the time to do some digital housekeeping. That mostly means digging into a whole bunch old files to process their contents and possibly extract them the tracking app. Also regular maintenance things like backing up what needs backing up, deleting what can be deleted. It feels appropriate as a near-year-end activity to be going through junk from the past. (Although I should get started on going through actual physical junk as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;: In the never-ending quest to defeat the  gaming backlog, I started working on Arkham Origins. I believe I&amp;rsquo;ve had  my Steam copy for years now, well before I finished Arkham Knight, and  never got around to it. It&amp;rsquo;s not a particularly new game, so I figured  my five-year old PC could handle it fine. However I&amp;rsquo;m experiencing graphical  slowdowns, especially when dealing with bug groups of enemies. I&amp;rsquo;ve  already tried turning the graphics down to minimum settings, but still  experiencing some issues. My suspicion is that it may have something to  do with me currently using an AMD graphics card (the game does say it&amp;rsquo;s  optimized for NVidia when starting up). So maybe I should have gotten  around to it before my old GeForce card started having trouble. It&amp;rsquo;s  still mostly tolerable, and I did manage to get through some of the  quick-time event sections despite framerate drops. I&amp;rsquo;ll stick with it a  bit to see if I can crawl my way to the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt; Finished the binge watch of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/perfect-strangers/&#34;&gt;Perfect Strangers&lt;/a&gt;, and have caught up with Mandalorian and Discovery. I also blazed through S4 of My Hero Academia. I&amp;rsquo;d read the manga already, so just skipped ahead through the boring parts. I kind of want them to catch up with the current manga arc, as I want to see some of the more recent fights animated, but I guess that&amp;rsquo;s going to take a while. I also started rewatching The Big Bang Theory as my background show of choice, it&amp;rsquo;s aged reasonably well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned recently that I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write more, and I did manage to churn out one blog post per day last week! Maybe I went overboard? And that says nothing about their quality of course. Still, writing more + going through the past should help me focus my thoughts to help me figure out what I want for the upcoming year (aside from the to-be-expected wish for the end of the pandemic of course.) I&amp;rsquo;m not committed to daily posting, but let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can keep up the writing pace.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;December is almost upon us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an opportunity last week to take on some additional work, but on further reflection, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d pass on it. I am in general, averse to working during the Christmas season (that is to say, more so than during the entire year in general). Even back when I was working full-time, I&amp;rsquo;d prefer taking most of my leaves during December. It&amp;rsquo;s really a result of the terrible traffic in Metro Manila, which gets significantly worse during Christmas season, a trauma that lingers even when I&amp;rsquo;m home all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past week went by quickly. Not so much because of anything stressful or such, but more like there were a bunch of errands to be done. I also did a bunch of maintenance work for some of my smaller side projects (adding questions to the trivia bot, fixing some bugs in this site&amp;rsquo;s code, adding some minor features to some of my tracking stuff, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t been writing much lately, other than these weeknotes. Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve also found my thoughts wandering a lot and been having difficulty focusing on anything productive. I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel these things are related, and that I should be writing more to help me focus and get back into the habit of thinking better. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can get a few more blog posts out in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing much new. A new drop in the Civ6 New Frontier pass was released a couple of weeks ago, so I played a few Civ6 games this week to try things out. The new leader/civ (Hammurabi of Babylon) was pretty fun, kind of a unique experience, and I like the Heroes and Legends mode. I actually want to try the other new game modes added by the NFP recently, it&amp;rsquo;s just that Civ games always take so long, so it&amp;rsquo;s hard to fit them in when I have other single-player games I want to play. Steam Autumn sale is currently ongoing, but so far I have taken no damage (though I did let myself get billed for November&amp;rsquo;s humble choice). I kind of wanted to buy a couple of additional Switch games, but I might just start something on my very extensive Steam backlog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; I finished &lt;em&gt;Rhythm of War&lt;/em&gt;! Fun book, I may write a longer review, as I kind of regret not having a review for the previous book Oathbringer, as I had nothing to go back to as a bit of review before starting on Rhythm of War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt; I think I&amp;rsquo;ve only been watching more Perfect Strangers this week. Two more seasons to go! This also means I&amp;rsquo;m behind on the Mandalorian and Discovery, which means I risk spoilers lol. Should try to catch up this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward to:&lt;/strong&gt; December? Christmas? Not really, not so much, though it can&amp;rsquo;t hurt, but I&amp;rsquo;m counting the days until we are rid of this accursed plague year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;This week felt weird. It kind of went by quickly for me, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like anything important really happened. Its kind of like those moments in-between other events, where you&amp;rsquo;re just coasting along and waiting for the more significant things to happen. My country is still recovering from the storms of the past few weeks, Trump is still flailing around trying to overturn democracy, and our own president is still insecure when someone gets more attention than him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These moments feel fleeting, but they&amp;rsquo;re a pretty good time for some self-reflection. I probably need a bit more of that, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found my mind has been wandering through parallel universes lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; I pushed the post-game completion on Super Mario Odyssey, but I might just be at my limit. I have 7 moons remaining, and 5 of those are for minigames, and the last 2 are for the super frustrating Breakdown Road stage. All of these probably require a great deal more patience than I have available, so that might be it for me. Still, it was a great ride, and I&amp;rsquo;m proud I can even get this far given I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself great at platformers nowadays. Still looking around for a new single-player game to dig into, not sure if I want to do another platformer or look for an RPG or such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magic:&lt;/strong&gt; Still been drafting a bit of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgkld/&#34;&gt;Kaladesh Remastered&lt;/a&gt;, although it seems the draft format doesn&amp;rsquo;t like me very much. I&amp;rsquo;ve gone a single 5-3 and three 0-3s, so it&amp;rsquo;s pretty bad! Still, I can keep doing at least one draft a week until Kaldheim comes out next year I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Rhythm of War&lt;/em&gt;, fourth book in Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s Stormlight Archive came out this past week! I got a Kindle copy off Amazon and have been reading a few chapters every night. I&amp;rsquo;m about a third of the way through I think. The problem with this book is I didn&amp;rsquo;t do a re-read of the previous books (they&amp;rsquo;re pretty long!) so every few chapters I&amp;rsquo;m like &amp;ldquo;Who is this person again and why is she here?&amp;rdquo;. This is a typical problem for epic fantasy series like this, so I&amp;rsquo;ll probably have this same problem if/when GRRM manages to get &lt;em&gt;Winds of Winter&lt;/em&gt; out. (I think these two are the only unfinished fantasy series I&amp;rsquo;m still following.) I will say that Sanderson still writes quite well, and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this gets me back into the habit of reading regularly again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I caught up with the Mandalorian, pleasant surprise to see Katie Sackhoff around, apparently playing a character she voiced in Clone Wars (which I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen). Since I caught up with both Mandalorian and Discovery mid-season, now I have to wait every week for new episodes, like some kind of peasant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For my background binge watching, I found some old copies I had of Perfect Strangers, so I&amp;rsquo;ve burned through a few seasons of that already. I loved this series when it was on TV back when I was young. It&amp;rsquo;s not particularly deep; most episodes have the same plot of &amp;ldquo;Balki does/says something naive and/or Larry overreacts and gets them into trouble and hilarity ensures&amp;rdquo;, but it&amp;rsquo;s still fun, and has probably one of the best ever TV show opening themes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward to:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t know? US thanksgiving is next week, which is mainly relevant for me because there&amp;rsquo;s usually a bunch of gaming sales at the time, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything I&amp;rsquo;m particularly interested in yet. There&amp;rsquo;s also some family events coming up (my eldest niece&amp;rsquo;s birthday), but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to get excited about those since we can&amp;rsquo;t actually get together.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Weather this past week was very bad for those of us in Metro Manila (and many other places in Luzon). Howling winds and strong rains dominated for 2-3 days of the week due to typhoon Ulysses. This typhoon wasn&amp;rsquo;t as strong as Rolly a couple of weeks ago, but it seems that it brought a lot more rains, causing flooding and loss of power in a whole lot of places. Metro Manila was hit quite badly, even drawing comparisons to Ondoy back in 2009. Even up to today I&amp;rsquo;m still reading about a ton of people who need assistance, relief or rescue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fortunately got off relatively unscathed. The howling winds and pouring rain meant it was heard to sleep at some point, but we experienced no other bad effects and in fact were a bit more comfortable due to lower temps. Oh, and we still don&amp;rsquo;t have cable service until today, a minor inconvenience. A lot of my friends lost power and some in the more Northern provinces were subject to severe flooding as well. It also took us a couple of days to get in touch with some relatives on the southern side of Luzon, but it seems they are fine, power issues notwithstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; Still playing Super Mario Odyssey, hopefully to completion. Although given how difficult some of these minigames are for me, I&amp;rsquo;m not optimistic. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how close I can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magic:&lt;/strong&gt; Kaladesh Remastered is out on Arena! I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten started on a sealed and a draft, you can follow along via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgkld/&#34;&gt;MTGKLD tag&lt;/a&gt;, if you&amp;rsquo;d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Boys S2: Surprisingly the Boys kind of got a &amp;ldquo;good ending&amp;rdquo; this time, although there are still threats lurking around. I went back and reread the first Omnibus of the comic book after finishing the season, and the differences are really stark, as in the comics Butcher is really portrayed as a bastard, maybe even as much as Homelander, while in the series they&amp;rsquo;re pretty tame by comparison. Somehow a lot of the issues raised in this season feel topical too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star Trek Discovery S3: Season isn&amp;rsquo;t done yet, but I went ahead and got this started. It&amp;rsquo;s quite a trip. Discovery is charting an unknown future now in the Star Trek timeline, and there are a lot of fun moments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Queen&amp;rsquo;s Gambit: This Netflix limited series has been getting a lot of buzz so I decided to give it a go. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly good, in a sports anime kind of way.  It&amp;rsquo;s a testament to how good and realistic the portrayal of the 1960s chess scene is that for a while I thought it was based on a real-life chess prodigy. Apparently, the show is based on a novel instead, a well-researched one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misc:&lt;/strong&gt; In the starting-yet-another-side-project department, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with this library called the Dragonruby Game Toolkit, which I got from the itch.io Racial Justice bundle a while back. I tried building a simple platformer using a Kenney asset pack that I also got from the bundle. Here&amp;rsquo;s the WIP: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDRShB4psyU&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDRShB4psyU&lt;/a&gt;. I like that I can work with the framework using only my text editor (as compared to some big bulky IDE like Unity), and it&amp;rsquo;s fairly quick to start up, as it makes a lot of assumptions for you so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about things like screen resolution, screen coords, fps, etc. I don&amp;rsquo;t doubt that using Unity might have made the platforming physics a bit easier, but I did enjoy figuring things out on my own. Not sure if this is going anywhere, I&amp;rsquo;m mostly just dabbling with it at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trivia:&lt;/strong&gt; we actually won an online quiz this past week! Amazing. We had so much fun, we even went ahead and had our own internal 2-hour trivia quiz right after: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no0sYBcU5LA&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no0sYBcU5LA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward to:&lt;/strong&gt; I just found out that the next book in Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Stormlight Archive&lt;/em&gt; is coming out next week! That&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a huge book, hopefully I can manage to finish it before year-end (so that I can at least get my books read stat for the year up a tiny bit)&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The World&lt;/strong&gt;: Somehow the week seemed to go by both quickly and agonizingly slowly, mostly because of the US presidential elections held this week. Slowly because after the initial burst of results on Tuesday night (US time), the remaining states&amp;rsquo; results trickled in very slowly. Quickly because much time was spent doomscrolling and refreshing election-related updates. I think the world collectively breathed a sigh of relief this weekend as the US networks finally called the race for former VP and now president-elect Joe Biden. Celebrations on the streets in many cities in the US, notably New York and Philadelphia. Trump still won&amp;rsquo;t concede and vows legal action, but that seems unlikely to go anywhere except make him look immature and pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biden isn&amp;rsquo;t even the best or most exciting candidate, and it&amp;rsquo;s still to be seen how he handles crises like the BLM and police brutality stuff and even healthcare, but at the very least the US will now have a coherent leader and hopefully will be able to address the pandemic better. I would guess that Harris as VP will ultimately end up the more historic win. But I imagine the celebrations are less about Biden winning and more about Trump losing. It must be weird to be a fanatic Trump supporter seeing all these people celebrating his loss. He still got a lot of votes - America remains a deeply divided nation, but at least under Biden there&amp;rsquo;s a chance of that being rectified at least a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have written a lot of words on this topic, considering I&amp;rsquo;m not an American. My stakes in this are a bit lower, but I still found myself glued to the ever-changing blue and red numbers. The US leadership affects the rest of the world of course, especially in terms of climate change and multilateralism moving forward, so it&amp;rsquo;s serious business. But I admit, I also enjoyed the drama and the memes. I had more than one chat groups where some of the members were living in the US, and let me tell you, they were super active during this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of all this drama has to be the whole &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-four-seasons-total-landscaping_n_5fa6e08bc5b6f21920dc14f7&#34;&gt;Four Seasons Total Landscaping&lt;/a&gt; brouhaha. Basically, Trump announced his lawyers would have a press conferencce at Four Seasons in Philadelphia, then later corrected himself saying it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the Four Seasons Hotel, but rather Four Seasons Total Landscaping. Basically a parking lot in an industrial area, next to a dildo shop. It smacks of incompetence and miscoordination of the highest order. It&amp;rsquo;s the kind of comedy that TV shows just can&amp;rsquo;t make up, proving indeed that reality can be stranger (and funnier) than fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump&amp;rsquo;s loss is a repudiation of his style of populist, lying leadership. I wish I could say I was as hopeful for similar positive change in my own country in two years, but that remains to be seen&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, back to my stuff lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Server migration update:&lt;/strong&gt; Today, I&amp;rsquo;ve closed my account at the old hosting provider, so there is no more turning back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; I started and finished Super Mario Odyssey! Just about a week, but that was main game only, finished with a bit over 400 moons. (I believe I can get up to 999 in the game?). Immediately proceeding into the post-game, since I only borrowed this game, so I want to get as close to completion as I can before I have to give it back. That being said, there are some moons gated behind annoying minigames like jump rope, RC racing, etc, which I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;d have the patience to grind through, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see. After Odyssey, I&amp;rsquo;ll take it easy on the Switch games for a little bit, though I am already considering getting either Fire Emblem or the new Paper Mario. Would be good to get back to an RPG after all these platformers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt; About halfway through The Boys season 2 now. More thoughts when I finish I guess? I thought about watching a Sean Connery James Bond flick when he died this week, but neither Netflix nor Prime had any, sadface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got a new pair of glasses last Wednesday, but up to today my eyes still feel like they are adjusting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not start Nanowrimo. I started trying something else instead, not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s gonna go anywhere though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing I was anxious about last week never pushed through. I should care less about things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward to:&lt;/strong&gt; Kaladesh Remastered comes out next week on Arena, so there&amp;rsquo;s that!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now:&lt;/strong&gt; Stormy weekend here in Manila. Supposedly the &amp;ldquo;strongest storm of 2020&amp;rdquo; so far, typhoon Rolly made landfall earlier today and is currently battering many of the provinces south of Metro Manila. Storm signals are as high as number 5. As of this writing, weather is currently cold and nippy but not particularly rainy where I am. We expect stronger winds and rain to hit us as evening approaches as well. On top of everything, a second typhoon has entered the PH area of responsibility and is expected to affect us over the next couple of days as well. If those two typhoons get together, it may be very bad. Hoping for the best. (I thought about doing these weeknotes end of day&amp;hellip; but we might lose power, so here we go.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Server migration update:&lt;/strong&gt; Migrating the final domain now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; I finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1322214646221205504/&#34;&gt;Link&amp;rsquo;s Awakening!&lt;/a&gt; Full heart and seashell completion even! It was fun and a great throwback to classic games like Link to the Past. I never played the original on Gameboy, though maybe that&amp;rsquo;s for the best, as I liked how this one looked and my memory is not tainted by nostalgia over GB graphics. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a particularly long game, especially compared to other Zeldas, but there is a custom dungeon feature (new to this remake) which probably adds some replay value, though I don&amp;rsquo;t have much interest in it at the moment. On to Super Mario Odyssey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; I did terribly at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/11/review-eternal/&#34;&gt;Eternal Card Game&lt;/a&gt; worlds LCQ, but I must admit their current celebration promo was super effective in getting me back into the game, as I&amp;rsquo;m now doing daily grinds in both Eternal and Magic Arena again. I managed to hit Mythic in Magic Arena before month end, but didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough time for Eternal, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can keep it up next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying games of &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/965580/Root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; with the Saturday gaming group. It&amp;rsquo;s a multifaction boardgame where each faction plays differently and has different ways of scoring victory points, and the factions will naturally clash with each other. The main challenge is finding a fine balance between advancing your agenda and interfering with the others. Disrupting the other factions might lose you some momentum compared to the others, but if no one keeps the others in check, someone might run away with victory! Pretty fun. And given that the game supports asynchronous games (up to 3 days per turn), the term &amp;ldquo;Saturday gaming group&amp;rdquo; is a bit obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Done:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober2020&#34;&gt;the Inktober thing&lt;/a&gt;! I managed to get through the whole thing without missing a day! Doing daily drawings with a pen are hard for me, given my poor manual dexterity at this age (and it was never that good in the first place). My hands got tired so easily, and a lot of my lines were shaky. Still, I enjoyed doing a lot of the sketches, and while I don&amp;rsquo;t want to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/03/sketching-daily/&#34;&gt;commit to daily drawings&lt;/a&gt; again (at least for now), maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll warm up the old Apple Pencil every so often and do some digital stuff? Maybe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt; I finished Season 4 of The Expanse. I didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy it as much as the first 3 seasons, though the second half was better than the first. Things were ramping up too slowly, and a lot of things didn&amp;rsquo;t seem relevant to the what was going on with the Roci crew (and turned out to be mostly geared towards next season&amp;rsquo;s big crisis apparently?). As I said to a friend, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m here for the scifi protomolecule stuff not OPA terrorist or earth politics BS.&amp;rdquo; Still, looking forward to the next season. Also: Finished five seasons of NCIS (that&amp;rsquo;s all they had on Prime Video). In the queue: The Boys S2, Star Trek Discovery S3, Mandalorian S2. Where&amp;rsquo;s my Orville?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skipped:&lt;/strong&gt; Hacktoberfest. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considering:&lt;/strong&gt; Nanowrimo. Haven&amp;rsquo;t done any prep, so if ever it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a late start. I do have some ideas rolling around in my head, but I also have some other stuff to do, so for now let&amp;rsquo;s say this is &amp;ldquo;low probability&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxiety:&lt;/strong&gt; Low, most of it due to awaiting a call back about something that hasn&amp;rsquo;t pushed through yet, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really need? Why am I anxious about it then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Random:&lt;/strong&gt; This storm reminded me of my worst typhoon experience in Metro Manila, Ondoy back in 2009, so I wrote a short &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2009/09/ondoy/&#34;&gt;back-dated retrospective on it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad luck:&lt;/strong&gt; The hinge on one side of my glasses&amp;rsquo; frame broke while I was at the cashier at the grocery yesterday! D: I have a slightly older pair I can use in the meantime, but it&amp;rsquo;ll probably be a few days before I can even go to get a real replacement, given the storm and the long weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward to:&lt;/strong&gt; the US presidential elections, with a mix of morbid dread and anticipation, like an onlooker at a car crash.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Server migration update: I had encountered some trouble with the Travis-CI -based Hugo build generating this here website last week. Luckily, most of the migration work to the new backend was already done, so I went ahead and switched over the servers. So this site is no longer plain-old deployed HTML, but rather powered by a Django backend. The site should be mostly the same, though I did take the opportunity to move some stuff around. There&amp;rsquo;s probably some bugs floating around, and maybe some secrets even. Probably need a longer blog post writing about the migration itself, though it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too complicated. I also have a bunch of notes about the server setup that I&amp;rsquo;ll also carve into a blog post when I have time. Things should be mostly done for this site, but I have one other domain I have to migrate, and I have scheduled that for the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that hopefully all my apps/domains will be on the new server after the first week of November. My account at the old webhost is paid until Nov 15th, and I&amp;rsquo;ve already indicated I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to migrate to whatever new system they have, so it&amp;rsquo;s just in time I think. Hoping things go smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming: I did &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1318238520251621377/&#34;&gt;the 120 stars &amp;ldquo;completion&amp;rdquo; for Super Mario Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;, although that&amp;rsquo;s really more like half of actual completion. I put down the Switch for a few days after that to cool down on it for a bit, as I have been playing it a lot since I got it. Still deciding whether to play Odyssey next or try Link&amp;rsquo;s Awakening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming: I haven&amp;rsquo;t played &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/11/review-eternal/&#34;&gt;Eternal Card Game&lt;/a&gt; in months, which meant falling behind on the collection as new sets came out and such. But they&amp;rsquo;re running an event right now where all accounts have access to all cards, and there are qualifiers for their worlds event. I figured why not and gave it a shot, running a deck I got from their recent tournaments, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1319794495395745793/&#34;&gt;managed to qualify for the LCQ on my first try&lt;/a&gt;. Eternal has always been a fun game, but the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve preferred playing on MTG Arena. The timing of this Eternal event was pretty nice, as it came up just after Arena got a patch that severely downgraded the UX, with bugs being reported everywhere and general laggy performance. The Eternal client was, as always, snappy and had no issues. Arena dev team needs to get their act together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still ongoing: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober2020&#34;&gt;the Inktober thing&lt;/a&gt;. Still haven&amp;rsquo;t missed a day! This week is the final stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not ongoing: Hacktoberfest. I mentioned before that I was planning to do it, but&amp;hellip; I haven&amp;rsquo;t. Less than a week to go, so doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem likely I can get into it, especially since other things have come up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my current webhost finally decided to give me a deadline, the long and short of it is that my new server needs to be ready by December the 9th, giving me a bit under a month to get things in order. I&amp;rsquo;m already in the middle of setting up the new server, so I think I&amp;rsquo;ll be ready by early November anyway. Most of the code to run the new blog is also mostly ready (who knows how many bugs there are though!) I am (re-)learning a lot about server setups though, so hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll have quite a few blog posts to write the migration is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching lately: Mostly old NCIS seasons still, and I&amp;rsquo;m just past the halfway point on The Expanse season 4. Slow going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to November, and am awaiting the outcome of the US presidential elections with morbid interest.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;So my current webhost finally decided to give me a deadline, the long and short of it is that my new server needs to be ready by December the 9th, giving me a bit under a month to get things in order. I&amp;rsquo;m already in the middle of setting up the new server, so I think I&amp;rsquo;ll be ready by early November anyway. Most of the code to run the new blog is also mostly ready (who knows how many bugs there are though!) I am (re-)learning a lot about server setups though, so hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll have quite a few blog posts to write the migration is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming: Hey, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1317023064555548672/&#34;&gt;finished Super Mario Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;! There&amp;rsquo;s 15 post-game stars only available after beating the game, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to work through them before moving on to Odyssey, alhough some of them are quite stressful. (Apparently there&amp;rsquo;s an entire 120 stars again afterwards in some kind of second quest, but I figure I can come back to that some other time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still ongoing: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober2020&#34;&gt;the Inktober thing&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s surprising that I haven&amp;rsquo;t missed a day yet. (Hopefully I haven&amp;rsquo;t jinxed it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching lately: I&amp;rsquo;ve taken to having old seasons of NCIS running in the background (via Prime Video) recently, they&amp;rsquo;re the sort of show you can just leave running while you&amp;rsquo;re doing other things, and if you miss something it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. I also started on Expanse season 4, but that requires more focused watching so the going is slow. I have some backlog to work through, since The Boys season 2 and Star Trek Discovery season 3 are both out now.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The world continues to be terrible. The PH government wants people to get back to work and everything to spur the economy (with health precautions and everything). A lot of people have no choice, but I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate enough to not have to go out there yet, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure people like me will still hold back. This all would have been a lot easier if the government had gotten control of this pandemic early on but it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still not writing blog posts apparently. I have a lot of thoughts swirling in my head, I&amp;rsquo;m sure they&amp;rsquo;ll pop out sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming: Hey, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1314224120490389504/&#34;&gt;finished Super Mario Sunshine&lt;/a&gt;! I started Super Mario Galaxy right afterwards. It&amp;rsquo;s actually interesting playing through these 3d Mario games for the first time, since I can see how things evolve. Will hopefully have some good thoughts for the eventual review, probably after I also play Odyssey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still ongoing: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober2020&#34;&gt;the Inktober thing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still ongoing: The site rewrite project. It&amp;rsquo;s going reasonably well, and might be ready soonish (famous last words), so I started looking into the new server as well. I&amp;rsquo;ve also mentioned before that I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/03/rip-webfaction/&#34;&gt;migrate to a new webhost because GoDaddy etc.&lt;/a&gt;, and I had been leaning towards getting a VPS on Linode so I tried to do that this week, but for some reason they kept rejecting my application, so I just went with DigitalOcean instead. They give free two months $100 credit, so I&amp;rsquo;m not paying for anything until December or such, so that&amp;rsquo;s nice. I spent a couple of hours wrangling with Nginx + uWSGI + my app on Ubuntu, with permission problems and everything. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll figure it out eventually!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some recent fun things on the internet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Toadsanime/status/1312880060899233797&#34;&gt;Twitter thread about free indie games&lt;/a&gt;. Not like I have time to play all of these, but I find it fun to browse these lists and fantasize about my lifelong dream of being an indie game developer that I still hope to eventually get back to someday (why not today)? Anyway, check them out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vulture.com/article/most-influential-best-scenes-animation-history.html&#34;&gt;100 Sequences that shaped animations&lt;/a&gt;. Some fun history of animation stuff to go through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBpxhfBlVLU&#34;&gt;Why do mirrors flip horizontally but not vertically?&lt;/a&gt;(Youtube video). I always have trouble explaining this, so this one was nice to watch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.playstation.com/2020/10/07/ps5-teardown-an-inside-look-at-our-most-transformative-console-yet/&#34;&gt;Sony released a PS5 teardown video&lt;/a&gt;. My biggest takeaway from this is that this console is HUGE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the news this week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donald Trump, who for some reason is still the US president, has tested positive for Covid19, adding even more chaos and uncertainty to the US election season. The rest of the world has no choice but to pay attention, given how much US politics affects the rest of us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Philippines is now #20 worldwide in total Covid cases, yay! Yay?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some drama about the PH congress leadership? IDK, whatever man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annoyingly, I&amp;rsquo;ve not been doing any blog posts other than these weeknotes during the past few weeks. It is what it is though. I guess I haven&amp;rsquo;t really had time for longer writing things lately?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; busy, but the I have felt busy during the past week. Part of it is probably becaause I&amp;rsquo;ve started &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober2020&#34;&gt;doing the Inktober thing&lt;/a&gt;, so that&amp;rsquo;s an additional daily task. Another part of it is probably the fact that I purchased a Nintendo Switch last week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, gaming then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the aforementioned Nintendo Switch. I got Super Mario 3D All Stars and Link&amp;rsquo;s Awakening together with the purchase. I originally wanted to get Mario Odyssey, Fire Emblem and Paper Mario as well, but I figured two games (really four) was plenty for a first set, and my brother was going to lend me Odyssey anyway. I started playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/09/1310497720117784577/&#34;&gt;Mario 64&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not too far in, but I found the camera really problematic, and I can&amp;rsquo;t play it for too long without getting dizzy. I also started playing Super Mario Sunshine, which was a noticeable improvement camera-wise, and I can play it for extended periods without dizziness problems, so I&amp;rsquo;m quite a bit farther along there. I hope to get back to Mario 64 eventually, but it&amp;rsquo;s no big loss if I don&amp;rsquo;t. I understand it&amp;rsquo;s a classic game a lot of people look back fondly on, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s aged well, and not just because of camera problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also tried the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1311655542008377346/&#34;&gt;free Super Mario 35 battle royale game&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s reasonably fun, although when you&amp;rsquo;re at the last 2-3 players, it takes a while to get to a winner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally managed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1311602939891535872/&#34;&gt;hit the 7 wins in Zendikar Rising draft&lt;/a&gt;! Standard is still terrible though. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll just play 1 draft a week and that&amp;rsquo;s it? The MTG community was also in an uproar the past few weeks, both due to the poor state of standard and due to some controversy over an upcoming Secret Lair crossover with The Walking Dead. WOTC has implied they are looking at expanding Magic mechanics to other IPs, so the TWD thing is mostly a trial balloon, I think. Many people are upset and are predicting the death of Magic, but the game has been pronounced dead before. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens. I&amp;rsquo;m not personally affected (since I don&amp;rsquo;t Commander), my primary concern is the health of Standard formats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday gaming group picked up a new multiplayer game, it&amp;rsquo;s Root, from Leder Games (and published for digital by Dire Wolf, creators of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/&#34;&gt;Eternal&lt;/a&gt;). It&amp;rsquo;s reasonably complicated, and thematically and mechanically quite different from the last digital boardgame we were doing (Blood Rage).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned last week that I was planning to participate in &lt;a href=&#34;https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/&#34;&gt;Hacktoberfest&lt;/a&gt;. I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet, and there was some controversy over the past few weeks, with OSS maintainers complaining about spam PRs due to the event. Apparently, it was the fault of a Youtube who had a few hundred thousand followers. He had made a video showing how easy it was to make PRs and win the event swag, and a lot of people were following his low effort examples. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;ll still participate, though I have been looking around a few repos here and there, we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, I haven&amp;rsquo;t watched anything of note the past week. A couple of standup specials on Netflix, that&amp;rsquo;s it. I guess the Switch took most of my entertainment time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IFTTT, a service I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/01/ifttt/&#34;&gt;been using for a while now&lt;/a&gt;, has &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1312652625511280640/&#34;&gt;obnoxiously been insisting I upgrade to their Pro tier&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;rsquo;re going to start severely restricting free accounts, so I&amp;rsquo;m looking to minimize my usage of the service moving forward. All of the social media syndication stuff can be handled by the new blog backend I&amp;rsquo;m writing, so that&amp;rsquo;s fine. The only things that should remain are stuff I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked into automating myself yet, mainly backing up of SMS, so I&amp;rsquo;ll probably look into that soonish. I&amp;rsquo;m not against paying for services, but in this case it&amp;rsquo;s simply not worth it for me, since I can trivially write my own replacement software for most of my usage of the service. So long IFTTT, it&amp;rsquo;s been swell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no closing words of wisdom today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;October is imminent! There are two distractions I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to in the coming month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober/&#34;&gt;Inktober&lt;/a&gt;, which I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing since 2016. Basically it&amp;rsquo;s just to do 30 ink drawings in October, one per day. There are some &lt;a href=&#34;https://inktober.com/rules&#34;&gt;official prompts&lt;/a&gt;, which I&amp;rsquo;ll probably follow. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really done any serious &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt; in a while, maybe this will help me get back into the groove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second one is &lt;a href=&#34;https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/&#34;&gt;Hacktoberfest&lt;/a&gt;! Basically it&amp;rsquo;s an event where you have to submitted some number of GitHub PRs in October, and there&amp;rsquo;s some swag for people who finished. I last &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/02/hacktoberfest/&#34;&gt;participated in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, skipped last year because I was a bit busy. I have a bit more free time this year, so hopefully I can get into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these are welcome distractions, as the world continues to suck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past week, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the Django-based rewrite for my personal site (this one!). It&amp;rsquo;s one of those projects where I find myself being productive not because of deadlines or anything like that, but because I genuinely enjoy working on it. When I find myself thinking of of new things that need to be done, or a new feature, or a way to solve an interesting problem, I am cursed (blessed?) with restlessness until I get it done. There are a number of challenges with the way I chose to approach this problem, most probably the subject of a future blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned this before, but I went ahead and paid for a year of the Micro plan on Migadu.com. The email in/out limits aren&amp;rsquo;t that high, but the price is decent, and I don&amp;rsquo;t really use my personal email that much anyway (I&amp;rsquo;m no spammer!). I&amp;rsquo;ll re-evaluate next year whether I want to migrate. (Sets a calendar event.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve watched this past week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went ahead and watched the second season of Umbrella Academy. It&amp;rsquo;s more or less structured like the first season: each member has their own problems; five discovers an upcoming apocalypse, so he tries to bring everyone together; also, there&amp;rsquo;s people who want to kill them. The ending of this is more satisfying than S1 though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enola Holmes on Netflix. It was ok, but it&amp;rsquo;s more of a young adult story, maybe a bit above the Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming this past week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;managed to get in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgznr/&#34;&gt;couple more Zendikar Rising drafts&lt;/a&gt;. Fun format, but I continue to have a terrible record, with only one draft actually going well. I did get a refund for that last one, so let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can&amp;rsquo;t do better this coming week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;additional drop on the Civ6 New Frontier pass came out, giving us Gaul and Byzantium. A friend and I tried it in a multiplayer game. I played Byz and he went with Gaul; we only played for a couple of hours, but both new civs seem quite powerful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my SC2 group managed to finish the Wings of Liberty coop campaign! Pretty fun, and it was fun to relive the story too, as I had already forgotten a lot of it. We started the Heart of the Swarm version the next day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday gaming group have been playing Blood Rage over the past few months, and it even came out with a new DLC/expansion a couple of weeks ago. The game client is a bit buggy, but we tolerate it because it&amp;rsquo;s a fun/deep game anyway. We&amp;rsquo;re looking at maybe trying out a different game next week though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia was meh this week, the topics weren&amp;rsquo;t really to our liking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I purchased last month&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription&#34;&gt;Humble Choice&lt;/a&gt; (or rather, let it lapse into purchase). It&amp;rsquo;s not unreasonable, there&amp;rsquo;s some games there I can try like Forager and Evoland, and given my recent streak of Mario playing, I was wanting a platformer for the PC, so Yooka Layle isn&amp;rsquo;t a bad idea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Late-breaking Sunday news: I have kind of impulse bought a Nintendo Switch. Well, I was agonizing over it for a while, but stores were selling it just a bit overpriced. Today I found that there was a slight price drop (around $40 worth) of the Labo bundle at one of my local stores, so I impulsively went ahead and ordered it. Maybe should have waited a day or so? regardless, it&amp;rsquo;s on the way, along with Zelda: Link&amp;rsquo;s Awakening and Super Mario 3D All Stars. No interest in the Labo personally, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll try to sell it off?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried using Messenger Rooms for a family conf call today, in lieu of Zoom which limits us to 40-minute calls. Might have been bad luck or poor internet, but the experience was substantially worse. Disconnections, lag, poor video quality, etc. We&amp;rsquo;ll see if they want to switch back to Zoom next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems weird that we are so close to the end of 2020 now. Still no idea what Christmas is going to look like. I&amp;rsquo;m sure many other people are also looking forward to closing out 2020 and going to 2021, even though that holds no logical promise of things being better than they are now. But we can always dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine this is already the 3rd week of September, it feels like the month is passing by quickly, although I haven&amp;rsquo;t been particularly busy recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did do some paid work this past week; not a lot, just filling in to provide some emergency support/consultation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the reason it feels like the week passed by quickly is that I started a new side project (like many programmers, I am afflicted by the curse of wanting to start too many side projects). This one will probably get finished: I&amp;rsquo;m writing a Django based server for this website. I am generally happy with the current Hugo workflow I use for publishing things here, but the build times have struggled with the sheer number of posts I have. This started back when I decided to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/10/archive-of-my-own/&#34;&gt;start importing my social media activity to this site&lt;/a&gt;, which increased the post count from a couple of thousand to more than twenty thousand now. Even the automated builds take forever, and I can&amp;rsquo;t even run the local Hugo build on my laptop due to too many open files error on Mac. And Hugo is already one of the faster static site generators, so I have doubt that other SSGs would be able to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I briefly considered moving back to Wordpress, but that seems like a step back. I also briefly considered writing a new backend using a new programming language like Rust, giving me an opportunity to learn something new as well. But I kind of needed to get this done quickly, given that I have a pending server migration within the next couple of months; it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary, but it would be nice to have the new system up in place by the time I do that, so that all the migration happens in one go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still generally happy with the workflow of writing using my local editor and pushing markdown files to git, so I plan to retain that. The Django webapp will have a database, but that will be a secondary data structure used mainly for indexing and searches. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be some kind of weird file system/database storage, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how that goes. Anyway, probably more details on all that when I am ready to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching this past week: I finished both seasons of Cobra Kai. The series is decent. I&amp;rsquo;m here mostly for the Karate Kid nostalgia and the Lawrence/LaRusso rivalry. Season two had a lot of high school drama, which I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too interested in, so I liked the first season a lot more. Will still probably watch S3 when it comes out on Netflix. Now to figure out what to watch next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming this past week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zendikar Rising is out on Magic Arena! I&amp;rsquo;ve already played a couple of drafts, but things didn&amp;rsquo;t go as well as I hoped, so now I am poor, will probably be able to draft again in a couple of days. Hopefully I get better at this format, as I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to draft this set a lot; posts on these should be under &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgznr/&#34;&gt;the mtgznr tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t play much else this week other than the regular multiplayer games with the gaming groups SC2, Blood Rage, etc. I have yet to find a new game to knock off the backlog. I have also been considering trying out some of the smaller indie games in my collection, and maybe streaming some let&amp;rsquo;s play/reviews for them, as a bit of support for indie game devs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this week was the much awaited PS5 announcement, with pricing and release dates and everything! The $499 price tag is reasonable, but I probably won&amp;rsquo;t be getting one on launch, since there&amp;rsquo;s not a lot of games I want immediately. I will admit to getting a bit excited at the FF16 reveal, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably a ways off. I&amp;rsquo;m probably more likely to get a Switch first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trivia team put up a new chaotic video of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U52L9c2kB8M&#34;&gt;us playing some trivia&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out, like, subscribe, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big news from the other side of the pacific is that US SC Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has died. &amp;ldquo;No no no&amp;rdquo; was trending on Twitter for a little bit, and a lot of people on my timeline were swearing. I had a short discussion with some friends living on the west coast about it. Many of my US friends also have some level of anxiety/worry about what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen during/after their elections. It&amp;rsquo;s actually annoying how informed I am about US politics, although it doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect me directly. Like it or not though, the US further sliding into single-party autocracy will likely be bad for the rest of the world, so let&amp;rsquo;s all hope they get their shit together.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It has certainly been a week, yes it has. The world continues to turn (and burn even).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy. Not so much with work, though there was a bit of that due to a required emergency software change (aren&amp;rsquo;t they always emergencies?). I wasn&amp;rsquo;t doing the emergency work myself, more like consulting and advising how to approach it, so not much to tell there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did quite a bit of work on my personal data processes/backups/workflows. It involved streamlining my backups, dedepulication, going through old records and cleaning them up, and so on. Some combination of Python scripts and manual work was required. One specific thing I did was to get a whole bunch of my old photos out of Google Photos and onto disk backups, and also had to do some deduplication there. I was able to remove around 1300 duplicates from over 12000 photos, so around 10% ish duplication rate, not too bad. My original intent was to remove them from Google Photos, dedupe, then add them back, but now I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure I need to add them back. The main advantage of Google Photos has been that they make the photos more searchable, but I don&amp;rsquo;t seem to have an urgent need for that anyway, and probably there are other ways to do that? I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll look into it when the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also been browsing some old (physical) albums stored around the house. There&amp;rsquo;s another few thousand photos there, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of eventually digitizing them, as a means of backup, but that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work, so maybe in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming was good again this week. I finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/09/uncharted4/&#34;&gt;Uncharted 4&lt;/a&gt;! I guess any week where I manage to tick something off the backlog is a good week. Last weekend I mentioned I was near the end, that was so untrue lol. Turned out more than half the game was still to come. My SC2 buddies and I started to play this 3-player coop version of the Wings of Liberty campaign (avaiable as custom arcade things), that&amp;rsquo;s been fun. Then the usual stuff: Blood Rage with the Saturday group. Quiz nights/codenames with the trivia team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kind of want to get into SFV again, presumably there&amp;rsquo;s a flood of new players coming in recently since it was free on PS+ this past month, so hopefully it won&amp;rsquo;t be so hard to find matches this time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My desire for a Nintendo Switch is being tempered by two things at the moment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rumors of a new, upgraded Switch coming out next year. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the first time that I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased a console just before it&amp;rsquo;s successor came out though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;frustration at the difficulty of the special stages in Super Mario 3D Land lol. It&amp;rsquo;s a stark reminder that I&amp;rsquo;m getting old and I&amp;rsquo;m not as good at these games as I used to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this week, I binged four seasons of Superstore. It&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable enough ensemble comedy, though it&amp;rsquo;s no Brooklyn Nine Nine. A lot of the characters&amp;rsquo; problems are of their own making due to selfishness, that&amp;rsquo;s always annoying. But it&amp;rsquo;s good enough for side-watching while I&amp;rsquo;m doing other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also started watching Cobra Kai, not even halfway through the first season yet. It&amp;rsquo;s slightly painful, since it casts Johnny Lawrence as the POV character/protagonist, and he&amp;rsquo;s kind of a loser asshole, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My desktop PC seems to be showing it&amp;rsquo;s age. It&amp;rsquo;s like recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been hitting 100% CPU and/or RAM much more often. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried uninstalling some unneeded software, hopefully that helps. I got this PC back in 2015, so it&amp;rsquo;s not unreasonable that I might need an upgrade soon, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I want to spend that money yet. I&amp;rsquo;m kind of hoping it can still hold on for a few years still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same thoughts for the rest of the world, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s September! The last six months were a blur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s considered &amp;ldquo;Christmas season&amp;rdquo; over here already I guess. The local memes are that once the clock hits midnight between Aug 31 and Sep 1, your neighbor&amp;rsquo;s Christmas lights are magically up. Also of course the famous Jose Mari Chan gets famous starting September, since malls and stores love to play his Christmas songs during this time. IDK what to expect for Christmas season this year though, since we are still in a pandemic. I keep telling my mom not to get her hopes up that we (i.e. my brothers and their families) will all be able to get together as tradition dictates. It&amp;rsquo;s possible, but I&amp;rsquo;m not optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My week was kinda busy. Not really in terms of work, but in terms of&amp;hellip; high school stuff, I guess? My high school batch hosted our 25th year alumni homecoming this past weekend. Since we were unlucky enough to have it in the middle of the pandemic, it was an online-only affair, with presentations and raffles and whatnot. And a quiz night! A lot of my batchmates did a lot more work, my participation was mostly limited to some tech stuff, since I had access to the database of registrants for the raffle, and also representing the batch at the Pisay Quiz Night held online. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only PQN team member, I was just the one assigned to join the zoom and show the whiteboard; I was drafted against my will due to my past quiz night experience. My other batchmates were supporting me from a Discord, I basically streamed the Zoom call to them via Discord (which is really troublesome, always has tech issues) and they fed me possible answers etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting my PQN participation to take too much time, but there was like a tech rehearsal and a dry run before the event proper, to make sure everything worked well and that all the team got it, plus my team also got together a couple of times for &amp;ldquo;practice.&amp;rdquo; I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to take it seriously, as with all online quiz nights I&amp;rsquo;m mostly there for the fun since it&amp;rsquo;s super likely for at least some people on some teams to be googling their answers lol. The PQN is super competitive though, I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s to be expected given the nature of Pisay. We didn&amp;rsquo;t win, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the final scores yet, but I guess that we finished around middle of the pack among the 22 teams, but we had a good time (more or less!) and it was fun hanging out with the batchmates virtually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming this week was pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/09/1301222471568297984/&#34;&gt;and finished Disco Elysium&lt;/a&gt; during the first half of the week. Fantastic game, and I was probably unhealthily engrossed in it for like 2-3 days. I was so into the whole mystery thing, when the game warned me that I was at a critical point and that proceeding further would end other sidequests, I just created a save and pushed to the finish anyway. I went back later to load and finish the other side stuff. It&amp;rsquo;s the kind of game you&amp;rsquo;d enjoy if you like getting your Speech skill to 100 in Fallout. It&amp;rsquo;s very well-written and had some really great/shocking moments. Since it has very little actual &amp;ldquo;action&amp;rdquo; aside from delving inside the MC&amp;rsquo;s thoughts, I understand that it&amp;rsquo;s not for everybody, but it&amp;rsquo;s certainly a worthwhile experience. I thought about writing a full review post, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll save that for when/if I manage full achievement completion (looks tough!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after getting distracted by Disco Elysium, I went ahead and resumed my Uncharted 4 game. I think I&amp;rsquo;m close to the end on this one, should finish it this coming week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;already half way through the Super Mario 3D Land special worlds. Speaking of Mario, Nintendo announced a bunch of new Mario releases for the Switch this past week, which significantly increases my want for a Switch. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how long I can hold off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;still playing my regular games with the playgroups: Starcraft 2 Coop, Blood Rage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it&amp;rsquo;s September, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing my regularly quarterly data backups/exports. One of them is Google Takeout. The last one was back in April, and that last export was 27 chunks (they split it into 2GB or less chunks). The new one is 44 chunks! I suspect the huge increase is because I&amp;rsquo;ve been streaming on Twitch and exporting them to Youtube, so they&amp;rsquo;re probably part of this current export. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even export everything this time, since I don&amp;rsquo;t need to re-export data from those services I&amp;rsquo;m no longer using. One of my ongoing projects is reducing my Google footprint, so I need to figure out how to get the size of this export down.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This last week was weird. I feel like I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get much done in terms of productivity, yet I don&amp;rsquo;t feel I was unproductive. A very relaxed and chill week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again a tiny bit of work done this past week, some fixes, including to side projects. I also spent some time preparing for some events next weekend. Although I wasn&amp;rsquo;t productive this week, I did outline a bit of a roadmap of new features for one of my side projects, hopefully I can get into that in the coming weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still in a pandemic! But I did have my first dine-in meal at a restaurant last Monday. It was because I went to get blood drawn for routine medical reasons, and I had needed to skip breakfast for the test (spoiler: my blood sugar levels were very, very normal). So after getting the blood drawn I was super hungry and decided to have breakfast at the nearby Pancake House. I was the only customer since it was super early (and you know, pandemic), although a second guy came in after I had given my order. I almost subconsciously picked up the glass of water to sip from it as soon as it was served, luckily I remembered I was wearing a face mask and a face shield. I decided to hold off on removing the gear until the actual pancakes were served, to minimize the exposure time. The next day I also decided to have a snack at a Starbucks after running some errands, mainly because I had a free coffee from Globe Rewards. It was afternoon so there were a few other customers there. The cashier said it was ok to dine in, but for a maximum of one hour only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a longish post I was writing, but it felt too raw to publish and might break it up into smaller posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We actually managed to win an online quiz night this week! It&amp;rsquo;s been a while, good job trivia team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels great to no longer be following the covid19 stats regularly, even though they are still fairly terrible. UP experts are projecting that we get the reproduction rate to below 1 in like a month though, so that&amp;rsquo;s some good news, though we may still be a ways away from getting this under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching and playing the past week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still playing a lot of SC2 Coop, trying to unlock the new prestiges. Levelling the commanders again can be a pain, but at least they managed to provide new goals/objectives for the players, breathing back a bunch of life into this game mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still drafting Amonkhet Remastered, although the last few drafts haven&amp;rsquo;t gone well. Need to save up gems, so I&amp;rsquo;ll do one last one draft once I get enough gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Huh, I guess I kind of paused Uncharted 4 for most of the week, not sure why. I should get back to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started re-playing Super Mario 3D Land (on the 3DS) lately, mostly to stave off my desire to get a Nintendo Switch (prices are still inflated here due to supply issues!). I had forgotten a lot about this game, so even when I finished the first 8 worlds and rescued Princess Peach, I was pleasantly surprised to find there were another 8 &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; worlds to play!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watched the video game history documentary &lt;strong&gt;High Score&lt;/strong&gt; on Netflix. Pretty good, although there&amp;rsquo;s some Dragon Quest erasure going on in the RPG episode!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watched &lt;strong&gt;Bill and Ted Face the Music&lt;/strong&gt;, this was a most excellent sequel. I found the start a bit clunky (I always find it awkward watching characters be awkward), but the rest of it was a fun and sweet adventure that echoed elements of both of the first two movies. A lot of the time travel stuff didn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense if you sat down and thought about it, but I was smiling through a lot of it. Little Billie and Theda are great!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also watched &lt;strong&gt;Superman: Man of Tomorrow&lt;/strong&gt;, the first entry in the new DC animated universe (following the reboot at the end of Justice League Dark: Apokolips). Yet another Superman origin story here. Not too happy with this one. Not fond of the animated style, and the writing and plot seemed weird at many points. I felt like there could have been a better way to resolve the whole situation with the big bad that felt more &amp;ldquo;Superman&amp;rdquo;-like, and the movie doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to earn the monicker &amp;ldquo;Man of Tomorrow&amp;rdquo; for the hero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for one reason or another, I also ended up watching a few standup specials on Amazon Prime. A couple from Craig Ferguson, and one from Jimmy Yang.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cobra Kai is now on Netflix! Yet another thing to add to the ever-increasing backlog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some tech stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have about three months left on my Webfaction hosting, which I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/03/rip-webfaction/&#34;&gt;been planning to migrate away from&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m currently leaning towards getting a cheap $5/mo VPS from Linode, although I&amp;rsquo;m still willing to accept any recommendations. Switching to a VPS means more effort (since it won&amp;rsquo;t be a managed service anymore), but that should provide some learning opportunities. It&amp;rsquo;s just as well anyway, my apps have been pushing the memory limits on the current hosting, and even the cheapest Linode VPS provides more RAM.  I&amp;rsquo;ll probably start looking into the migration in September.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote before about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/gmail-migration/&#34;&gt;migrating away from GMail&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Migadu.com&amp;rsquo;s free tier for about half a year now. This past week, they wrote that they are sunsetting the free tier. Totally understandable, given the economy. They are also introducing a new Micro tier at $20 a year, with slightly better limits than the old free tier, so I may migrate to that near the end of September (when the free tier runs out). In theory, I could just try to run a mail server on whatever VPS I set up (see above bullet), but that&amp;rsquo;s a big hassle. This cost + the $5/mo for the VPS is still less than what I was paying for at Webfaction, so I don&amp;rsquo;t mind paying for this for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was notified by a local bank that their old web platform is being sunsetted and I needed to migrate to the new system, so I did that. But whenever I tried the migration steps, the process never completed, it just kept telling me it was processing. I finally had to message someone I knew on the dev team lol. Hopefully it can getr resolved next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The week after I posted about phoning in the weeknotes, here I am with one where there&amp;rsquo;s nothing much to report. Not that surprising, given how busy I was over the previous few weeks, I took the opportunity to take a more relaxing week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a bit of work to be done, but very miniscule by comparison. Minor fixes here and there, including to some side projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did get to write on the blog more, as expected. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope I can keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These week&amp;rsquo;s quiz nights were terrible for our team, but on the bright side, I got to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/08/quiz-night-sketches/&#34;&gt;do a couple of sketches&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching and playing the past week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continued drafting Amonkhet Remastered, although the last few drafts went a bit poorly. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgakr/&#34;&gt;mtgakr tag&lt;/a&gt; on this site has all the records.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After finishing D:OS2 and FF7R, I looked around for a new game to start and decided on Uncharted 4, which I guess I got free from Plus or something. I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten very far yet, but unsurprisingly Nathan Drake&amp;rsquo;s antics still really challenge one&amp;rsquo;s suspension of disbelief. He has to be one of the most peak-performance athletes in the world to consistently pull of the jumping and wall climbing stunts he regularly does. Not to mention being able to win over basically hordes of heavily-armed mercenaries in gunfights. Not that it&amp;rsquo;s not fun and engaging as a game, it just feels so ridiculous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dcfandome.com&#34;&gt;DC Fandome&lt;/a&gt; was today, I watched some panels and new trailers and such. I enjoyed the Suicide Squad reveals and the Wonder Woman 1984, Shazam 2 and Justice League Snyder cut trailers, plus previews for the new Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad games, looking forward to those. (I should probably get around to Arkham Origins first.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing to play SC2 coop and Blood Rage with the regular groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that there&amp;rsquo;s anything wrong with a bit of relaxing downtime, but I am hoping to eventually ramp up to being more productive in the coming weeks, especially with the side projects.&lt;/p&gt;
