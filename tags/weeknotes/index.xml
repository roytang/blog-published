            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s already May? April felt like it came and went so quickly. But then again, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/1242953238497751040&#34;&gt;time has little meaning in this accursed pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The brouhaha over community pantries (as &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/weeknotes-2021-04-25/&#34;&gt;described last week&lt;/a&gt;), seems to have calmed down and they are now generally coordinating with LGUs for assistance in maintaining health protocols&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, the government has embarked on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1387324164910981121/&#34;&gt;propaganda campaign to assert that we aren&amp;rsquo;t the worst in terms of pandemic response in the world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certain congress people continue to promote the usage of the drug Ivermectin, which has no known effect on Covid-19, as a Covid-19 cure or something. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1388100027684331520/&#34;&gt;DOH/FDA keep saying there&amp;rsquo;s no sufficient evidence&lt;/a&gt;, but that has no effect when the people promoting it aren&amp;rsquo;t motivated by evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looks like the Office of the Solicitor General of the Philippines &lt;a href=&#34;https://restofworld.org/2021/philippines-data-exposure/&#34;&gt;accidentally leaked a bunch of sensitive legal documents&lt;/a&gt; due to a misconfigured public directory on their web server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently last weekend was the Oscars, which just goes to show how irrelevant they are now that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know until I saw the tweets about it happening live. They tried to re-arrange the awards with Best Actor last, apparently with the hope of ending with a posthumous award to Chadwick Boseman, but the award went to Anthony Hopkins instead, who wasn&amp;rsquo;t even at the ceremony. Awkward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/feb/16/how-to-have-better-arguments-social-media-politics-conflict&#34;&gt;How to have better arguments online&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have this mentor. And one of the best pieces of advice that he gave me is ‘always give someone the golden gate of retreat’, which is: give someone enough compassion, enough opportunity in a conversation for them to look good changing their mind. And it’s a really important thing to be able to do, because if you’re just like, ‘Oh you said this thing! You’re racist!’, you’re forcing that person to say, ‘No I’m not’. Et cetera. There’s no golden gate of retreat there. The only retreat there is to just barrel right through the opposing opinion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://caitlinjohnstone.com/2021/04/20/how-to-live-in-wonder/&#34;&gt;How to live in wonder&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a constant practice of getting curious about all of the aspects of your experience. Not with the intention of receiving any adult-mind narrative answers, but with the curiosity of a talking monkey who has no ability to understand the universe. &amp;hellip; By continually introducing the immediate experience of not-knowing to your operating system, you will undo the stale old perceptual and cognitive habits of the adult-mind that thinks it knows, that thinks it has seen it all, that it has seen any of this before. It’s a skill like any other, and as you improve with practice you will get better at meeting everything for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/04/how-yahoo-became-internet-villain/618681/&#34;&gt;Yahoo the Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;, on the once-great internet company not being great at preserving the content under its purview. I&amp;rsquo;m still bitter over &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/10/1048949973801267200/&#34;&gt;not being able to recover my Yahoo Messenger convos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drew DeVault writes about &lt;a href=&#34;https://drewdevault.com/2021/04/26/Cryptocurrency-is-a-disaster.html&#34;&gt;how cryptocurrency is an abject disaster&lt;/a&gt;. I was tempted to write about my own experiences working with crypto, but I worry that not enough time has passed for me to talk perhaps a bit unkindly about some of the companies I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manuel Matuzovic writes about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matuzo.at/blog/html-boilerplate/&#34;&gt;his current HTML boilerplate&lt;/a&gt;, which at the very least is a good look at how many different tags and other things one needs to put in by default to support various modern web things including social media previews and such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone shared to me this version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyE80ebItlA&#34;&gt;Never Gonna Give You Up with Japanese lyrics&lt;/a&gt; that I enjoyed for some reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extremely satisfying: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/moylato/status/1387139670962843658&#34;&gt;Belgian man parks his car in a super narrow garage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found this &lt;a href=&#34;https://acesubido.net/ph-inflation-calculator/&#34;&gt;Philippines inflation calculator online&lt;/a&gt;. Prices have almost doubled from when I started working back in 2003!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For some reason all the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;sketches&lt;/a&gt; for the past week were done with pen and paper on this tiny pad I keep near my desk. Much quicker to do, but the sketches are also much simpler than anything I do in Procreate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Caught &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/3bf3bc036db88610a1c7b3474555eb69/&#34;&gt;Green Hornet (2011)&lt;/a&gt; on cable, a movie I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know existed. I should resume my James Bond run soonish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched the &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/05/99d3f5dffa9b1e1f2a4029f66c2b4f2a/&#34;&gt;second season of Jack Ryan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/04/183ab94b6cb10f5db0431e715cde1945/&#34;&gt;finished up season 1 of Invincible&lt;/a&gt;, both on Prime Video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Been drafting a bit more &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgstrixhaven/&#34;&gt;Strixhaven&lt;/a&gt; on Arena. I thought the Sealed Open was this weekend, but turns out it was actually next week. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably shift to Quick Drafts next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a bunch of &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4 already after it dropped for free last week. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big fan of the intro sequence, but I&amp;rsquo;ve warmed up to it as the story and the world gradually opened up. I can tell this will take a while to finish though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a bit of Street Fighter V again this week, though I&amp;rsquo;m still languishing in the Bronze ranks again. Have tried shifting to Balrog (Boxer) as my main, though I&amp;rsquo;m not super familiar with the combos and matchups. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how that goes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My regular Saturday gaming group immediately picked up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1586100/Root_The_Riverfolk_Expansion/&#34;&gt;new Riverfolk expansion for Root&lt;/a&gt; when it dropped last week and we had a lot of fun with some of the creepy new additions last night. And I really should get on with that Root review!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: I am close to finishing &lt;strong&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/strong&gt; by Neal Stephenson, should be done this week, hopefully have time to write the review as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia: Didn&amp;rsquo;t do too well in this week&amp;rsquo;s About Quiz, so we ended up in a distant finish in the league overall. No trivia next week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No new One Piece, BNHA, etc, I assume due to Golden Week. Boo!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strixhaven Sealed Open on Arena next week, for real this time!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting my second shot of Sinovac next Sunday!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was a bit rushed, so typos etc are a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a bit busy this weekend (see below), so this post is running a bit late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ongoing saga right here in the Philippines:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last weekend, community pantries for the needy started sprouting up in Metro Manila and all over the country, largely inspired by one started in Maginhawa here in Quezon City. The central idea was &amp;ldquo;give what you can, take what you need.&amp;rdquo; Stories spread of heartwarming stories like a poor old man donating some food even though he had very little and an ice cream vendor giving away the remnants of his cart for the day to those in the queue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government critics pointed out the need for these pantries was largely a result of the lack of support from the government. (They&amp;rsquo;re not wrong.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predictably, it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for the government to butt in, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/roytang/status/1384280033351462912&#34;&gt;the police reportedly investigating the people behind the pantries for communist links&lt;/a&gt;. Some other national government people even said they might require permits. For what, giving food away?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The backlash was predictably quick, with netizens and even local government offcials and senators castigating the critics. Mayors started chiming in that the community pantries were welcome in their cities and that there was no permit required to help each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, notable spokespersons of the NTF-ELCAC still insisted on insinuating communist links to the pantries. There were also the usual critics who decried people getting stuff for free, speaking from the privilege of their safe houses and expensive cars. Critics also raised whether these pantries were spreading covid because of how people spend a lot of time queued up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some women in Pasig went viral for a bit after they were caught on video raiding a community pantry and getting much more than could be reasonably expected, one of them even carting off a trayful of eggs. They supposedly claimed they were going to give away to their neighbors. They later &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.msn.com/en-ph/entertainment/other/mga-babaeng-nanlimas-sa-community-pantry-sa-pasig-dumepensa-na/ar-BB1fUtan&#34;&gt;apologized&lt;/a&gt;, but supposedly they &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/news5ph/status/1384855185932042241&#34;&gt;were planning to file charges against the person who took a video of them&lt;/a&gt;. My take: the thing about decentralized movements like this is that they tend to easily self-correct through the vigilance of the participants as seen here. There have been no other reports of similar incidents after this one went viral, so at the very least they served as an example of what not to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last Friday, a community pantry started by actress Angel Locsin ended in disaster when an old man died while in the queue. Blowback from the pantry critics and the DDS was fierce. Locsin &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gmanetwork.com/entertainment/showbiznews/news/76345/angel-locsin-issues-apology-after-senior-citizen-dies-in-line-at-her-community-pantry/story&#34;&gt;quickly issued an apology&lt;/a&gt; and accepted the blame, drawing contrasts with how the national government never apologizes or admits to mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently, news broke that the National Security Adviser &lt;a href=&#34;https://onenews.ph/gag-order-imposed-on-parlade-badoy&#34;&gt;had imposed a gag order on the notorious NTF-ELCAC spokespersons re: community pantries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probably one of the reasons we can&amp;rsquo;t have nice things: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LaTtEX/status/1384416859701792771&#34;&gt;people can&amp;rsquo;t be generous without some other people becoming suspicious and assigning nefarious motives&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens with these pantries moving forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of covid, India&amp;rsquo;s experiencing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56798248&#34;&gt;worst surge of the pandemic so far&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://mashable.com/article/twitter-hides-tweets-critical-indian-government-handling-covid/&#34;&gt;accused of censoring tweets critical of the Indian government&amp;rsquo;s covid response&lt;/a&gt;. The US is facing calls to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/25/us-pressed-to-lift-export-ban-to-help-india-fight-surge-in-covid-cases?CMP=twt_gu#Echobox=1619342451&#34;&gt;loosen export bans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/24/covid-vaccines-patents-pharmaceutical-companies-secrecy&#34;&gt;lighten up on vaccine patents&lt;/a&gt; to help out India (and the rest of us in the global south, really).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some lighter news: One year ago in Apr 24 2020, an epic battle among a ton of people named Josh was scheduled a year in advance, to fight for the name. It &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gothspiderbitch/status/1386031209457852418&#34;&gt;happened yesterday&lt;/a&gt;! They had a pool noodle battle and named a 5 year old &amp;ldquo;King Josh&amp;rdquo; or some such. Lots of fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messaging app Signal, famous for its encryption protections, raised concerns about vulnerabilities in software often used by authoritarian regimes to bypass the security of such apps: &lt;a href=&#34;https://signal.org/blog/cellebrite-vulnerabilities/&#34;&gt;Exploiting vulnerabilities in Cellebrite UFED and Physical Analyzer from an app&amp;rsquo;s perspective&lt;/a&gt;. The great thing is how the report does a hilarious &amp;ldquo;wink wink nudge nudge&amp;rdquo; implying the users of such apps might not want to target Signal in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some stuff about blogging and personal websites:
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kottke.org/21/04/the-conversation-has-never-been-wider&#34;&gt;The conversation has never been wider.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://disquiet.com/2021/04/10/q-why-blog-a-blogs-are-great/&#34;&gt;Why blog? Blogs are great.&lt;/a&gt;. (I mostly disagree with &amp;ldquo;have a topic focus&amp;rdquo; though. I&amp;rsquo;ll write what I want to write, damnit!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gq.com/story/get-fit-from-just-walking&#34;&gt;How fit can you get from just walking?&lt;/a&gt; One of the tragedies of the pandemic is that I&amp;rsquo;ve had to reduce my general walking output, since I can&amp;rsquo;t just wander around as far as I want anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kottke.org/21/04/make-everything-important&#34;&gt;Mads Mikkelsen: &amp;ldquo;Make everything important.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blolook.osa-p.net/&#34;&gt;page / app you can check&lt;/a&gt; to see how many people have blocked you on Twitter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;did-you-know&#34;&gt;Did you know:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Spanish dub of Terminator 2, instead of &amp;ldquo;Hasta la vista, baby&amp;rdquo;, the Terminator says &amp;ldquo;Sayonara, baby!&amp;rdquo; via &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/mwv4nd/fun_fact_in_the_spanish_dub_of_terminator_2_he/&#34;&gt;reddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jack Black&amp;rsquo;s parents were &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/mxsdzu/til_judith_love_cohen_who_helped_create_the/&#34;&gt;satellite engineers&lt;/a&gt;. (This entry spoils the ending of that entry, sorry!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local liturgical song Tanging Yaman, often attributed to Carol Banawa, was actually &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/04/03/21/behind-the-music-tanging-yaman-by-fr-manoling-francisco&#34;&gt;first recorded by now-Senator Risa Hontiveros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The big thing for me this week (that I hinted at in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/weeknotes-2021-04-18/&#34;&gt;the previous weeknotes&lt;/a&gt;) is that I decided to give &lt;a href=&#34;https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48&#34;&gt;LUDUM DARE 48&lt;/a&gt; a shot! It&amp;rsquo;s a game jam, where you make a game in 48 hours (well, that&amp;rsquo;s the mode I&amp;rsquo;m participating in). Tt&amp;rsquo;s the first time I&amp;rsquo;m doing one, despite a lifetime of flirting with the idea of gamedev. Initial build is &lt;a href=&#34;https://hungryroy.itch.io/diver&#34;&gt;already available&lt;/a&gt;, even though there&amp;rsquo;s still 9ish hours to go. (I need to sleep!) I&amp;rsquo;ll probably (should) write more about this experience in a future post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Around the middle of this week, I got the first ever email that actually complied with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/about/contact/&#34;&gt;the contact protocol I had specified here in the site&lt;/a&gt; and on LinkedIn, namely putting a certain keyword in the subject line. I&amp;rsquo;ve had that condition for years, so I was really amazed someone actually read it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;still sketching&lt;/a&gt;, though I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen a couple of days behind due to the game jam. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1385224243848179719/&#34;&gt;tried to do one on paper like a comic&lt;/a&gt; but my handwriting was so terrible I had to edit it digitally!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/b178a1efcfc005930f062c7be447d7c1/&#34;&gt;Rocky (1976)&lt;/a&gt;, and I meant to watch the next Bond flick too, but ran out of time. New Mortal Kombat movie also came out this past week, I might watch that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt; season finale ran last Friday. A lot of people are happy with it (and the season overall), but I felt like some parts were too rushed and the finale suffered as a result. Will probably post more thoughts on it this week. After this, we won&amp;rsquo;t have MCU content until Loki kicks off next month I think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Invincible&lt;/strong&gt; is getting to the good part!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still drafting a bunch of Strixhaven on Arena (though I had to stop for the weekend due to the game jam). Most of my drafts went well, though the last 2 I did this week were terrible. I ended up listening to &lt;a href=&#34;http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-593-strixhaven-first-impressions/&#34;&gt;the Limited Resources podcast&lt;/a&gt; for the first time and got some good tips, hopefully that improves my drafts moving forward. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably play in the Sealed Open next weekend! Follow along via &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgstrixhaven/&#34;&gt;the MTGStrixhaven tag&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/strong&gt; actually had some progress this week. I really should finish this run soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downloaded &lt;strong&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; on PS4 because it&amp;rsquo;s temporarily free! I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to play this for a while, hopefully I have time for it this coming week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played some Street Fighter V again this week; I figured since a new character dropped, it might be easy to find matches again. I did manage to fight quite a few, but I also did quite poorly, dropping back to Ultra Bronze. Thinking about switching to a different character since everyone seems to know how to fight Ryu, so I unlocked Honda! We&amp;rsquo;ll see who I actually end up using.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Currently about halfway through &lt;strong&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/strong&gt; by Neal Stephenson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia: Pop Quiz is back (albeit monthly now, not weekly), so the trivia team was able to join two quizzes this past week. We didn&amp;rsquo;t win either though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a couple of birthdays in the family this weekend, so my game jamming was interspersed with zoom / messenger calls and food deliveries and such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Invincible, One Piece, BNHA, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new expansion dropping for Root, one of the digital boardgames we&amp;rsquo;ve been playing (and the one I have yet to write a review for&amp;hellip; sounds like a perfect opportunity!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strixhaven Sealed Open on Arena next week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was a bit rushed, so typos etc are a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to think of this past week, feels like it went by quickly. I may have spent too much of it daydreaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NCR+ bubble is now one week into modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ - an acronym that makes no sense). Cases still seem to be pretty high on a day-to-day basis, though we&amp;rsquo;re told the R number is dropping slightly, so that&amp;rsquo;s good I guess? Still, would be nice if the case numbers would calm down. Still lots of stories about people having trouble getting into hospitals and dying in ICUs. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/4/12/Roque-un-Christian-COVID-19-confinement.html&#34;&gt;the presidential spokesperson claims it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;unchristian&amp;rdquo; to ask how he managed to get a hospital booking despite all the problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quezon City is out of vaccines, at least for now, until the national government gives them some more. They were able to vaccinate around 100,000 people so far, which isn&amp;rsquo;t too bad. The two seniors I live with still haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten vaccinated, so hopefully supplies come back up soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a rare show of spine, the Philippine government, in coordination with American friends, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.esquiremag.ph/politics/news/china-backs-down-a00293-20210416-lfrm&#34;&gt;have sent coast guard ships to chase away the Chinese invaders&lt;/a&gt; in Julian Felipe reef!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not sure what&amp;rsquo;s happening with the rest of the world, haven&amp;rsquo;t really been paying attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I guess we could note that in the US, cops are killing more black people while protests about previous killings are going on while a former police officer is on trial for a previous killing, but this sort of thing doesn&amp;rsquo;t really feel &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; for the US anymore. Now, if they actually do something to fix the systemic rot in their police system, that would be news. (Not that our cops here are much better&amp;hellip;) Don&amp;rsquo;t really feel like providing links for this one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google is rolling out a new Chrome feature called FloC that allows the browser itself to profile you for ads, instead of using third-party cookies. &lt;a href=&#34;https://seirdy.one/2021/04/16/permissions-policy-floc-misinfo.html&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s some more info.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://margint.blog/2021/04/05/creating-software-at-scale/&#34;&gt;Everyone is still terrible at creating software at scale&lt;/a&gt;. (I would argue humans are terrible at creating anything at scale&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dorinlazar.ro/2021-02-programming-is-hard/&#34;&gt;Programming is hard, says dorin.lazar.ro&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/programming-is-hard/&#34;&gt;a response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I might not play it, but I like the aesthetic of upcoming Metroidvania &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXDcMVvtPh4&#34;&gt;GetsuFumaDen: Undying Moon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;! Practiced &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1383150746334466051/&#34;&gt;sketching some elaborate hair&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;rsquo;s always a challenge for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tried out &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1382290950483976200/&#34;&gt;these three-cheese donuts from Lola Nena&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;, after I heard about them from a local streamer. Pretty good!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movies: Watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1381509474259673090/&#34;&gt;Airplane! (1980)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/ced0a77eea2857ad31bd014fac3ded9a/&#34;&gt;Live and Let Die (1973)&lt;/a&gt; to continute the James Bond run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt; was mostly set up for the finale next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have also been enjoying &lt;strong&gt;Invincible&lt;/strong&gt;, but I guess that I will reserve commentary until the season is done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did not watch this year&amp;rsquo;s Wrestlemania.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new set, Strixhaven, has dropped on &lt;strong&gt;Magic Arena&lt;/strong&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;m having fun drafting it. Follow along via &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgstrixhaven/&#34;&gt;the MTGStrixhaven tag&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also randomly decided into &lt;strong&gt;Eternal&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Stormbreak open this weekend, did terribly, as could be expected lol. At least I got to open a bunch of packs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other than the card games, I actually didn&amp;rsquo;t get much gaming done this week. I should correct that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/strong&gt; has no progress this past week lol. I really should finish this second run. I did play a bit of &lt;strong&gt;Pac-Man 99&lt;/strong&gt; on the Switch, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t manage to actually win a game, seems harder than Super Mario 99.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Currently reading &lt;strong&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/strong&gt; by Neal Stephenson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia: This past Saturday, our trivia group split into two teams: one played in an Attack on Titan-themed trivia (I didn&amp;rsquo;t join because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be spoiled) while the rest of us played in the regular AboutQuiz, with a poetry-themed game. Coincidentally, we finished in third place for both quizzes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier finale!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Invincible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rose DLC character for Street Fighter V drops on the 19th, part of season 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn will be free on PSN on the 19th, no PS+ required!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final Civ6 balance update drops on the 22nd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A couple of family birthdays next weekend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We actually have two regular trivia events this coming week, since PopQuiz is back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mystery event on Saturday the 24th, I&amp;rsquo;ll post about it if I decide to participate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and Queen Elizabeth&amp;rsquo;s husband, has passed away. So has DMX, American rapper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big facebook breach reported, etc. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like news, really. My &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1379404077319168000/&#34;&gt;phone number was among the data leaked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The country is still experiencing a surge in cases, hospitals and  ICUs still bursting to capacity. Yet in spite of the crisis, the president has not been around. This has prompted questions of whether he&amp;rsquo;s  still alive. This in turn prompted multiple proof-of-life photos and videos from the senator-who-is-also-presidential-assistant, some of which &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/News5PH/status/1380408229495119875&#34;&gt;may or may have been photoshopped&lt;/a&gt;. We are told he will make a public appearance Monday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of the president, it feels like an ABS-CBN reporter did more to defend our sovereignty vs China when &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/multimedia/slideshow/04/09/21/china-boat-chase-abscbn-news-team-chiara-zambrano&#34;&gt;they went to report on Chinese vessels near Ayungin Shoal and were harassed for their trouble&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After two weeks of ECQ, the NCR+ bubble is &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ABSCBNNews/status/1381142347489013761&#34;&gt;now placed under MECQ status until the end of the month&lt;/a&gt;. No, I have no idea what that means.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once again, the Philippines in the international news after &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/07/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-cases?#a-man-died-after-being-forced-to-do-300-squats-for-breaking-curfew-in-the-philippines&#34;&gt;a man died because he was made to do 300 squats for breaking curfew&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Wrestlemania weekend! And apparently it&amp;rsquo;s a two-night event this year. I don&amp;rsquo;t really follow WWE anymore, but I do often take the time to at least watch Wrestlemania and the Royal Rumble every year, so I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can get myself a copy somehow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kottke.org/21/04/ted-chiang-fears-of-technology-are-fears-of-capitalism&#34;&gt;Fears of technology are fears of capitalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/yes-experts-will-lie-to-you-sometimes&#34;&gt;Yes, experts will lie to you sometimes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently one of our possible climate change solutions is to &lt;a href=&#34;https://earther.gizmodo.com/the-u-s-is-one-step-closer-to-establishing-a-research-1846552421&#34;&gt;block out the sun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;! My favorite sketch for this week is of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1379656430081351687/&#34;&gt;Akira Kazama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOdgfo7OaLI&#34;&gt;upcoming fighter&lt;/a&gt; in the Street Fighter V season 5 DLC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/first-sinovac-dose/&#34;&gt;got my first dose of Sinovac vaccine today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing the James Bond run with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/8fd56682f77942eb0badef9444d465a4/&#34;&gt;Diamonds are Forever (1971)&lt;/a&gt;, Connery&amp;rsquo;s last outing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt; was great, and those last 10 minutes were intense!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other than that, just the usual weekly shows, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday gaming group decided to pick up &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1075190/A_Game_of_Thrones_The_Board_Game__Digital_Edition/&#34;&gt;Game of Thrones The Boardgame on Steam!&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve played this one IRL before, only once, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t remember much. The digital version reminds me why: It&amp;rsquo;s super complicated! Our first game took two hours, I didn&amp;rsquo;t win. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have time for a second one since I had to get up early for the vaccine appointment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses still progressing very slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This month&amp;rsquo;s Humble Choice was revealed, and was meh for me, so I immediately paused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did get Days Gone via PS+ on PS4 though, I might actually play that one. Though they are also planning to give away Horizon Zero Dawn sometime this month, that might be a higher priority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Finished reading Alexis Ohanian&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Without-Their-Permission-Century-Managed/dp/1455520020&#34;&gt;Without Their Permission&lt;/a&gt;, will write a review soonish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our trivia group posted a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1379623251479908354/#comments&#34;&gt;new trivia video&lt;/a&gt;. Like and subscribe to the channel etc. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly just us playing games and trivia, having fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Falcon and Winter Soldier, Invincible, One Piece, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strixhaven drops on Magic Arena!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s April! Or as it&amp;rsquo;s otherwise known, March 2020 month 13. As is usual, we are suffering the sweltering summer heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it&amp;rsquo;s Easter Sunday, if that means anything to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surprising almost no one, the PH government extended the ECQ lockdown in the NCR+ bubble. Anyone with half a brain could have told you that the one week ECQ was no way going to be enough, given what we know about the virus&amp;rsquo; life cycle. Meanwhile, we continued to hit record numbers of new cases, our 7-day rolling average now the highest in SEA since the pandemic began. It&amp;rsquo;s like we&amp;rsquo;re in the same situation we were in last year, except the numbers are much, much higher. And yet our leadership is like &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/inquirerdotnet/status/1377810270500790274&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not so bad, even France has lockdowns!&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Sigh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Austin Kleon reminds us that we all need &lt;a href=&#34;https://austinkleon.com/2018/01/19/something-to-look-forward-to/&#34;&gt;something to look forward to&lt;/a&gt;. (Arbitrary stupid goals!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was fascinated by this &lt;a href=&#34;https://theconversation.com/the-man-with-no-plot-how-i-watched-lee-child-write-a-jack-reacher-novel-51220&#34;&gt;article about how Lee Child writes Jack Reacher novels on the fly&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because that seems like the sort of &amp;ldquo;less work&amp;rdquo; approach I&amp;rsquo;d prefer when writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a curiosity: &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law&#34;&gt;Benford&amp;rsquo;s Law&lt;/a&gt;, or the law of anomalous numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://newrepublic.com/article/161106/defense-nothing&#34;&gt;In defense of doing nothing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent a long time working with Java projects, so &lt;a href=&#34;https://advancedweb.hu/a-categorized-list-of-all-java-and-jvm-features-since-jdk-8-to-16/&#34;&gt;this long list of new features from Java 8 to 16&lt;/a&gt; was interesting to me. After reading this, I asked my old workmates what version of Java they were now using, and they were still on Java 8, the same version as when I left there 6 years ago! Time flows differently in the enterprise universe I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My friends were amazed I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-1Ue0FFrHY&#34;&gt;Long, Long Man japanese commercials&lt;/a&gt; before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Peu6lw0nido&#34;&gt;this case study by Elsa Charretier of a Hawkeye comic book panel by David Aja&lt;/a&gt;. Probably helpful in my own sketching! Subscribed to her channel as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sony announced that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-store-shut-down-ps3-vita-psp&#34;&gt;they will be shutting down the PS3, Vita and PSP stores&lt;/a&gt;. End of an era really. A lot of people are complaining about content that will be forever lost, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure that there are people working to archive this stuff and make it available through other means. &lt;em&gt;Wink wink&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a person with comorbidities (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2005/05/hypertension/&#34;&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;), I&amp;rsquo;m in vaccine priority group A3, right after senior citizens (A2s). And since the stock of AstraZeneca is limited, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/QCGov/status/1377997094431129606&#34;&gt;QC is now allowing A3s to go ahead of A2s&lt;/a&gt;, so I was able to book a vaccine appointment on the 27th. Its a ways off, but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that means they&amp;rsquo;ve learned to streamline their on-site processes by then, so hopefully things go smoothly. It&amp;rsquo;s weird to have booked a schedule even before the more at-risk parents though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a bid to minimize having to go outside, we decided to try ordering groceries online via &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.metromart.com/&#34;&gt;Metromart&lt;/a&gt;. The first-time experience wasn&amp;rsquo;t great; we had to buy from a different grocery (since our usual one wasn&amp;rsquo;t available), not all the regular items we needed were there, and some items were way more expensive. And worst of all, I ordered Tostitos cheese dip and they bought spinach dip instead!! The weird thing is, there were some other items that were out of stock that they called me about (even though I explicitly set that if there were missing items, just don&amp;rsquo;t buy them??), yet for the dip, they just went ahead and bought a different flavor. I ended up having a long convo with their customer support about how disappointed I was, and somehow despite saying there&amp;rsquo;s nothing they could do, they later ended up offering me P100 store credit as compensation. I guess it will be useful if ever we decide to try this again. Anyway, we ended up doing a supplementary grocery run yesterday to cover the items the online delivery didn&amp;rsquo;t get (and the cheese dip!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only one movie watched this week, continuing the James Bond run: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/04/1a1ab3ad610478ba3b672b0a89c26333/&#34;&gt;On Her Majesty&amp;rsquo;s Secret Service (1969)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supergirl&lt;/strong&gt; has started up again, carrying over baggage from the cut-short previous season, same as Flash. The writing was marginally better though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt; was pretty good, though I still found Wandavision more exciting overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tried grinding to Master Rank in Eternal on the last day of the month, but I ran out of time with half a level to go. Sigh. Arena I didn&amp;rsquo;t even bother and ended the month in platinum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a couple of Civ6 games, mostly achievement hunting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a bit more &lt;strong&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/strong&gt;, now down to 1 achievement remaining, but it requires going through all the secret levels, I think?? That might take a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s multiplayer games with friends: Blood Rage, Sentinels of the Multiverse, Root, and Orcs Must Die 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: Finished reading Discworld&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Men at Arms!&lt;/strong&gt;, maybe I can write book review(s) this week. Need to find a new book to read, probably a nonfiction one this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was the second Holy Week in a row where we were just stuck at home all day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Falcon and Winter Soldier, Invincible, One Piece, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the last weekend of March. It feels like the month went by quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local covid response: The government introduced the concept of an &amp;ldquo;NCR Plus&amp;rdquo; bubble last Monday, restricting travel in and out of the NCR and adjacent provinces, in response to the rising cases. Still, the daily counts kept rising, hitting record highs of almost 10k cases daily. Even before the dust has settled on the bubble response, they decided to announce last night a reversion to the stricter ECQ. Shades of last year, during the run up to the first lockdown announcement: rumors circulated via chat groups about the impending lockdown before the government finally made their announcement. As can be expected, memes quickly circulated about how we came back to ECQ more than a year after the first lockdown. The lockdown is imposed only for one week, during the Holy Week period, presumably to take advantage of the two holidays in the week to minimize economic impact. The fact that they imposed two different levels of responses one after another &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1375737016407625729/&#34;&gt;reeks of poor planning and analysis&lt;/a&gt;, as if they were just making all this up as they go along, which might not be far from the truth. What happens if the case counts continue to rise until next Sunday?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a bit of economically-devastating-yet-unintentionally-hilarious world news: a very large container ship, the MV EVER GIVEN, ran aground in the Suez Canal, blocking passage, and has been stuck there since Tuesday-ish, clogging up global shipping trade through the canal. Apparently losses are at the order of $400M per hour or something? IDK, I&amp;rsquo;m not an economist. All I&amp;rsquo;m sure of is the internet almost immediately produced a &lt;a href=&#34;https://nypost.com/2021/03/25/the-best-suez-canal-memes-the-stuck-ship-ever-given-inspired/&#34;&gt;bunch of memes&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=&#34;https://jezebel.com/yes-people-are-writing-horny-fanfic-about-the-suez-can-1846562940&#34;&gt;horny fanfic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read this interesting post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.ayjay.org/blogging-and-the-blogosphere/&#34;&gt;blogging and the blogosphere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something that interested me mostly for trivia purposes: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nme.com/photos/30-covers-that-are-better-than-the-originals-1405281&#34;&gt;30 covers that are better than the originals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/mar/22/douglas-adams-note-to-self-reveals-author-found-writing-torture&#34;&gt;Douglas Adams&amp;rsquo; note to self reveals author found writing torture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul Graham reminds us to &lt;a href=&#34;http://paulgraham.com/simply.html&#34;&gt;write simply&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Sketching, sketching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing my run on the Bond movies with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/fb71576d1974213ea471b5cda8a20948/&#34;&gt;You Only Live Twice (1967)&lt;/a&gt;. Secret volcano lair!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also managed to convince myself to sit down and watch &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/snyder-cut/&#34;&gt;Zack Snyder&amp;rsquo;s Justice League&lt;/a&gt;. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t manage to sit down for four hours straight, so it was two sittings over two days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second episode of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier last Friday. Still a bit meh, mostly because there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been anything I haven&amp;rsquo;t expected yet. But that&amp;rsquo;s bound to change as I think all the content from the trailers have been shown by now. Some good acting by Sebastian Sean though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finished watching &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek The Animated Series&lt;/strong&gt;, Star Trek TV series completion!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First 3 episodes &lt;strong&gt;Invincible&lt;/strong&gt; have dropped on Prime Video. Most of the first episode is good, clean superhero fun, but by the end of the episode you are dissuaded of that notion. Pretty good pacing, seems mostly accurate to the source material, looking forward to the rest of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also been rewatching The Office as my background watching, mostly because I listened to a podcast of Office trivia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run: Still ongoing, somehow. It feels like I&amp;rsquo;m doing these in real time, only advancing one week of the game per week of real life. At that rate, I should be done in like six months lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After five years of playing Street Fighter V, I managed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1374367400276025345/&#34;&gt;dig myself out of the pits of the bronze ranks and hit silver&lt;/a&gt;! Surprisingly, on the next two days after this, I had trouble finding ranked matches again. I took that as a sign to take a break before attempting to climb up to gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final Civ6 NFP drop came out as expected. Not super hyped, but I have started a Portugal game already, they seem really strong especially on island maps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strixhaven official previews kicked off, and I&amp;rsquo;m really hyped for the set, mostly because I really &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1375147827110629379/&#34;&gt;like the Mystical Archive cards&lt;/a&gt;. Collecting all of them on Arena is gonna be a challenge though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supposedly Magic Arena is now available &amp;ldquo;everywhere&amp;rdquo; on mobile, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/mdf9dp/androidios_versions_not_available_in_southeast/&#34;&gt;not in Southeast Asia though&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; I mentioned last week that I started reading the Discworld book &amp;ldquo;Guards! Guards!&amp;rdquo;, but for some reason everything seemed so familiar, and soon I realized it was because I had &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/12/805050532834353152/&#34;&gt;already read it back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Doh! I was enjoying it anyway, so I finished the re-read and will probably publish a review, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have one in 2016. But I&amp;rsquo;ll finish the next City Watch book first: Men at Arms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AboutQuiz this week a bit better than last week, but I still miss the other trivia groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1374212757189369861/&#34;&gt;I hit the 800-day streak on Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New FatWS episode, etc etc. I presume new Invincible episode as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe the world will miraculously be better next week? IDK, one can always hope right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Holy Week! Normally a big deal for the RC faithful in this country, but this time everyone has to stay at home for the second year in a row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ECQ! Well, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect me much, though there are now some errands that we have to push back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over the past couple of days, our nationwide daily covid cases broke 7000+, the highest recorded so far.  Have to be super careful when going out for errands. Not that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t being careful even before, mind you. Just now, government has announced we are still under GCQ (see my post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1373562580375986178/&#34;&gt;the PH quarantine levels&lt;/a&gt;), but with more restrictions, etc. Looks like they are still hesitant to provide a stronger lockdown which would require paying people to stay home so they don&amp;rsquo;t starve to death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.protocol.com/internet-archive-preserving-future&#34;&gt;The internet is splitting apart. The Internet Archive wants to save it all forever. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/01/checklist-achievements-happiness-boxes/617756/&#34;&gt;Stop Keeping Score&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also could&amp;rsquo;ve sworn there was a bunch of funny stuff I read on Twitter this week that I can&amp;rsquo;t find anymore. I need to get better at marking/sharing things I find funny or interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Sketching, sketching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing my run on the Bond movies with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/273eae12d668c24135d4db358511c9d4/&#34;&gt;Goldfinger (1964)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/c6152994fa5ddf4b9c3302bcddfdd699/&#34;&gt;Thunderall (1965)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I keep threatening to watch the Snyder Cut, but have yet to find a four hour block of time to do it. FOUR HOURS!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, I watched the first episode of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Kind of meh, though I appreciate the emotional angles they&amp;rsquo;re going for. Might have been more hyped if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware a certain character was going to be introduced in this series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finished watching &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;, now almost through the Animated Series. Almost to Star Trek TV series completion!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run: Still ongoing, somehow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to play Valkyria Chronicles 4 on Steam since I got it from Humble Choice, but since I&amp;rsquo;m still in the middle of a Fire Emblem run I keep putting it off. It feels weird to have two anime-styled tactical RPGs running at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I actually managed to finish a run of &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127610/Iris_and_the_Giant/&#34;&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/a&gt;! I still have a few more achievements to get, then I&amp;rsquo;ll probably write a review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually managed to play a fair bit of Street Fighter V over the past week, after getting inspired by watching some Justin Wong videos. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve found the sweet spot / happy hour for actually finding matches where I am, so here&amp;rsquo;s hoping to play more moving forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Finished reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/neuromancer/&#34;&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/a&gt;. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d follow it up with some lighter reading, so I got started on a Discworld book: &amp;ldquo;Guards! Guards!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/2021-site-update/&#34;&gt;Site changes applied!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We did an AboutQuiz this week, but it was terrible (for our team at the very least). I&amp;rsquo;m hoping the more mainstream pop culture trivia quizzes like PopQuiz and Geekfight come back some time soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe (could be wrong) that the Invincible animated series is coming out on Prime Video at the end of the week. I read a fair bit of the comic, though I don&amp;rsquo;t remember much of the later parts, so I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to this. I feel like JK Simmons as the protag&amp;rsquo;s dad is going to turn out to be a great casting decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;final drop in the Civ6 New Frontier pass, with new Civ Portugal, is coming out this week. I&amp;rsquo;m not very hyped for it, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy the recent barbarian update too much, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll give it a go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Falcon and Winter Soldier etc etc. WandaVision really got going by the end of episode 3, but FatWS is only 2/3rds as many episodes, so I assume important things are gonna be happening in episode 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Happy Pi Day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the one year anniversary of the world&amp;rsquo;s longest lockdown. In some kind of sick anniversary celebration, local covid cases are on the rise. Yesterday, 5000 new cases were reported, the highest daily rate in 6 months or so. And now a Philippine variant has been detected. Now is not the time to be complacent, we all need to be more careful. The government seems unwilling to impose another widespread ECQ and are focusing on targetted, granular lockdowns. Not sure how effective this would be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://seirdy.one/2020/11/23/website-best-practices.html&#34;&gt;An opinionated list of best practices for textual websites&lt;/a&gt;. Reading this reminded me there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of updates to this website I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bikobatanari.neocities.org/posts/2020/personal-museum.html&#34;&gt;My Website is a Personal Museum: the creative freedom we lost in the age of social media&lt;/a&gt;. This article, and the referenced &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/&#34;&gt;How the Blog Broke The Web&lt;/a&gt; are nostalgic for the days of curated homepages instead of blogs/social media platforms characterized by chronological feeds. Taking these into account as I consider how to reorganize the content on this website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/19/can-not-quit-facebook/&#34;&gt;Facebook invested heavily in the one feature it knew people couldn’t leave behind: Their groups&lt;/a&gt;. It kind of feels like an opportunity for a new contender to sneak in and develop a better social media platform that&amp;rsquo;s group-centered. Yahoo Groups provided this service in the 00s, but Yahoo being Yahoo, they screwed it up and YG had to close up last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/KimsConvenience/status/1369013822145576964&#34;&gt;Kim&amp;rsquo;s Convenience has been cancelled&lt;/a&gt;. I liked &lt;a href=&#34;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/kims-convenience-the-end-of-the-dream&#34;&gt;Noahpinion&amp;rsquo;s writeup about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;, not missing a beat apparently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in the final season of &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also started reading up on the show&amp;rsquo;s reception, which apparently wasn&amp;rsquo;t great, especially compared to the other Trek shows it succeeded. Not surprising, but the show isn&amp;rsquo;t that bad, really. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of doing a blog post reviewing all the Trek shows, but I should probably watch The Animated Series first for completion purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a long time now I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to watch the old pre-Brosnan Bond movies, which I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen. Maybe mostly for trivia purposes. I got started on this last week with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/2b14f8356f57460da0a4790b27b44b8a/&#34;&gt;Dr No (1962)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/096b7c67797c165b01283d0c7cd6c016/&#34;&gt;From Russia With Love (1963)&lt;/a&gt;. Side note: I&amp;rsquo;m a bit amazed about how they&amp;rsquo;re able to do a sequel based on the success of the previous film in just a year. Modern day Hollywood films cost so much and are so complicated the typical spacing for sequels is at least three years. Next is Goldfinger!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run: Such slow progress, but progress nonetheless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still trying to finish &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127610/Iris_and_the_Giant/&#34;&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Still very slowly reading cyberpunk classic &lt;em&gt;Neurmancer&lt;/em&gt; by William Gibson. I&amp;rsquo;m about 75% through, so maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll finish this in a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started applying some layout changes and other stuff to the site, things will probably be moving around for a bit. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll write a blog post about it when I&amp;rsquo;m done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coming out this week: Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Zack Snyder&amp;rsquo;s Justice League! More looking forward to FatWS than ZSJL obviously. I am awaiting ZSJL with more of a morbid curiosity than anything else, i.e. my expectations are low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have more medical errands to conduct this week, seems like a bad habit that I keep having to get into too often. Comes with the age, I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;March has begun. Did it ever really end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vaccination finally starts in the country, with initial donated batches of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccine arriving in the country. Just in time for the one year anniversary of the world&amp;rsquo;s longest lockdown. SinoVac isn&amp;rsquo;t the best choice, but many of my doctor friends say they&amp;rsquo;ll settle for it if that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s available for them. I think QC is planning to use AstraZeneca for their citizens, but worrying is that AZ&amp;rsquo;s efficacy has been shown to be not so good against certain variants such as the South African one, which has already been detected in the country. Cases have been on the rise in the past couple of weeks as well, possibly due to the variants. We may very well be in a race against time now (maybe we always have been). The next month may be the most crucial phase of the pandemic for us, as vaccination drives hopefully kick into gear to try to overcome the accelerating spread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohhelloana.blog/catching-up-on-my-bookmarks/&#34;&gt;OhHelloAna.blog shared a whole bunch of bookmarks&lt;/a&gt;. Quite a few look interesting. Looking forward to going through this list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/&#34;&gt;Great article about cutting loading times in GTA&lt;/a&gt; went around last week. A case study in the problems with blindly relying on dependencies perhaps, and the complexities of C code performance, and even software performance in general.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rachel True had &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RachelTrue/status/1365461618977476610&#34;&gt;problems with iCloud&lt;/a&gt; after accidentally inputting her last name in lowercase. Feels like the sort of thing that can be maybe part of standard QA test suites? Hope she gets it resolved soon!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this fan video: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UngE0qn3VRY&#34;&gt;What if Wes Anderson directed X-Men?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/NonsenseIsland/status/1366449816042102787&#34;&gt;this thread on classical music in classic cartoons&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m no musical expert by any means, so it was even educational for me!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve switched back to doing digital sketches via Procreate, with kind of a different style this time? I kind of like it, more or less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today I was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/lzagfz/eli5_whats_the_difference_between_joules_watts/gq0i81h/?context=3&#34;&gt;mentioned via the u/hungryroy syntax on reddit&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. Not a big deal, I was just surprised lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally the pandemic and the quarantine hasn&amp;rsquo;t hit me as bad as other folks. My day to day routine hasn&amp;rsquo;t actually changed that much, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t really go out too often even pre-pandemic. That being said, I do miss being able to go out to places just to wander around, take my daily walk in a public place like &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1366349139559129088/&#34;&gt;the QC circle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/01/saturday-morning-up/&#34;&gt;the university campus&lt;/a&gt;, or even just loitering at the mall. It&amp;rsquo;s not that I miss being able to hang out with other people (although I do to some degree as well). More like I miss the ability to be outside, alone, in public, just sitting quietly and letting the universe wash over me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; is done! Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/wandavision/&#34;&gt;a spoiler-free review&lt;/a&gt;, something I used to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/spoiler-free-review/&#34;&gt;do more regularly&lt;/a&gt;. I have more spoiler-related thoughts, but they may be too much for this space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m almost done with season 2 of &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;, which means I&amp;rsquo;m about halfway through the series overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Flash&lt;/strong&gt; started its new season last week, but it feels like their episodes are like 90% nonsense now. (Used to be closer to 60% nonsense.). Second ep of &lt;strong&gt;Superman and Lois&lt;/strong&gt; was okay, although we are definitely getting more moody teenager problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run: still WIP. Moving forward slowly, ever so slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got last month&amp;rsquo;s Humble Choice, and decided to go ahead and install and try out some of the games in the bundle.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started by playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127610/Iris_and_the_Giant/&#34;&gt;Iris and the Giant&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice little tactical battle indie game with CCG mechanics &amp;ndash; think Slay the Spire, but with turn-based tactical RPG battles that can also feel very puzzle-like. I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying well-designed indie games recently, and this one seems to fall into that bucket. It has a unique, minimalist aesthetic and the story is about a young girl&amp;rsquo;s mental health? Maybe? I&amp;rsquo;ll know more if I actually managed to finish a run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also tried to play a game of &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/392110/Endless_Space_2/&#34;&gt;Endless Space 2&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not unfamiliar with 4X games of course, but this one was a bit confusing for me. In the one game where I managed to get anywhere, it felt like I was always behind in tech, and there&amp;rsquo;s so many indicators and UI elements on the different views that I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand. I can see there&amp;rsquo;s going to be a learning curve for this one, so it may take a few games for me to get the hang of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of Humble choice, the next one has Control as a showcase game, but I already got that off PS+, so I think I&amp;rsquo;m pausing on this one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday regular gaming group decided to play &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1015930/Blood_Rage_Digital_Edition/&#34;&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/a&gt; again yesterday, and we found out there was new DLC so we all decided to buy that and try it out. Might do a review for this game this week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also did quite a few Starcraft 2 1v1s with friends this past week. I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself very proficient with SC2, mostly because I&amp;rsquo;m very micro-averse, but I still enjoy playing it. Maybe not ladder though. We recorded some of our games, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bINjaPjt1M&#34;&gt;the first one is up on the Team Camote youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;, if you&amp;rsquo;d like to watch me be terrible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of reasons, I browsed some Ludum Dare games the other day. My favorite is this short and simple one: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/a-monster-hunter-story&#34;&gt;A Monster Hunter Story&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Still very slowly reading cyberpunk classic &lt;em&gt;Neurmancer&lt;/em&gt; by William Gibson. I&amp;rsquo;m about halfway through, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I understand everything that&amp;rsquo;s going on. Might need to look for a recap later on. Still, I soldier on!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh, nothing. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s going to be one of those weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Today is the last day of February. Tomorrow, we march on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biden ordered his &lt;a href=&#34;https://thehill.com/policy/defense/540631-Biden-orders-US-strikes-on-iranian-backed-militia-facilities-in-syria&#34;&gt;first military strike last week&lt;/a&gt;. America is back, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This past week, embrassingly our local police and anti-drug agency got into a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/pnp-pdea-shootout-bungled-buy-bust-operation-ever-gotesco-quezon-city&#34;&gt;shootout&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;against each other&lt;/em&gt; near the Ever Gotesco mall in Quezon City. Both sides claim they were doing a buy-bust, which is impossible. As usual, there is little transparency about what actually happened, and many promises of &amp;ldquo;impartial&amp;rdquo; probes and investigations. People speculate that at least one of the parties involved really was dealing drugs, and they got into a shootout because they were afraid of being EJK&amp;rsquo;ed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have any of these today, sadly. This is why I don&amp;rsquo;t have a newsletter, I&amp;rsquo;m unable to promise regular content lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week was busy with family and medical errands, so not much else was accomplished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; penultimate ep, people still liked it, but it was a bit meh for me. Still looking forward to next week&amp;rsquo;s finale, as there are still so many things to wrap up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started watching &lt;strong&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;, the last of the non-animated Trek shows I have yet to watch. (I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the TOS animated series). It&amp;rsquo;s Scott Bakula! Their uniforms here remind me of something like modern astronaut wear, so I assume they wanted something closer to &amp;ldquo;modern day&amp;rdquo; Earth to bridge to the Star Trek future. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting because at this point the relationship between the humans and Vulcans isn&amp;rsquo;t well established, there is no federation, no prime directive, etc, so we get to see the beginnings of those things later on I guess?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also watched a couple of movies this week. First was &lt;strong&gt;Space Sweepers&lt;/strong&gt;, a Korean space sci-fi adventure on Netflix. Entertaining enough, though the plot is easily predictable and the villain seemed like a moron. Great visuals and special effects, miles apart from anything local cinema has to offer. One-inch barrier of subtitles, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second movie was &lt;strong&gt;Once Upon A Time In Hollywood&lt;/strong&gt;. This was a very laid-back, relaxed movie, unfolding mostly as a series of slice-of-life vignettes of what life was like Hollywood in 1969, with no real plot urgency to speak of. The climax sort of just happens through no real actions by the main characters. Fairly long, took me four sittings to get through. Was surprised to find out later that it was based on a true story of a massacre that took place at that time, with Margot Robbie playing a real-life actress who was the victim in the actual massacre. The story unfolds a bit differently, probably due to the presence of fictional protagonists Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth (portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt). Bruce Lee also makes an appearance!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last week was also the premiere of &lt;strong&gt;Superman and Lois&lt;/strong&gt; on CW. I still like these positive portrayals of Superman better than something like Snyder&amp;rsquo;s Man of Steel, although I&amp;rsquo;m a bit meh on the premiere overall. Everything about the teens gives me Smallville vibes. They had a really big missed opportunity to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/1364758520885772288/&#34;&gt;match a scene from the opening sequence with a classic comic cover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a bit of Civ6 now that the Barbarian Clans mode has dropped. Restarted a few times with Kublai Khan before I got a decent start. Not super impressed with the Barbarian Clans mode so far, seems like the main effect is that we get more city-states going into the endgame. Will probably still try it out for a few games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run still in progress, finally got to the Edelgard decision point, and went as I planned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have been trying to figure out why I&amp;rsquo;m having &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/lquag0/sf5_is_it_expected_to_be_so_hard_to_find_a_match/&#34;&gt;so much trouble finding matches in Street Fighter V&lt;/a&gt;. Still no luck though. I want to indulge myself by getting the season 5 pass, but it&amp;rsquo;s not worth it if I can&amp;rsquo;t actually find matches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always annoying whenever this happens, but next month&amp;rsquo;s PS+ games include FF7 Remake, which I&amp;rsquo;ve already played and finished. Good for everyone else though! New content was also announced for the PS5 version of the game, which is also annoying since it&amp;rsquo;s probably goinna be a while before I bother with a PS5 (maybe waiting for a smaller version!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit: One of my loyal readers pointed out I failed to mention that we played a few games of 4-player Free For All in Starcraft 2 last Saturday. I won one and some undeserving people won the other two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Finished reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/ghost-of-my-father/&#34;&gt;Scott Berkun&amp;rsquo;s Ghost of my Father&lt;/a&gt;. Then started reading pioneering cyberpunk classic &lt;em&gt;Neurmancer&lt;/em&gt; by William Gibson. Kind of a challenging read, I&amp;rsquo;m inching through it slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz&lt;/strong&gt;: We managed to win the AboutQuiz league, just barely. Yay us!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managed to sneak in a few minor upgrades to this here site, mostly CSS and rendering improvements on the frontend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WandaVision finale!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Flash season premiere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New One Piece later tonight!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supposedly vaccination in this country will finally kick off!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Last week of February is about to start. Time flies, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Texas (and other parts of the southern US I guess) have been hit by heavy winter storms, with accompanying power grid failures and such. We have some relatives there so it&amp;rsquo;s a concern. Meanwhile, their governor falsely blames renewables for the power problems and their senator went to Cancun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.platformer.news/p/facebook-calls-australias-bluff&#34;&gt;Facebook cut off Australian news links&lt;/a&gt;. I think both sides of these are dumb, but that is the big tech controversy of the week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NASA has landed &lt;a href=&#34;https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/&#34;&gt;the Perseverance rover on Mars!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsurprisingly, we still do not have vaccines in this country.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://webdevlaw.uk/2021/01/30/why-generation-x-will-save-the-web/&#34;&gt;Why Generation X Will Save the Web&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m generation X! I think?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sci-fi author John Scalzi shares &lt;a href=&#34;https://whatever.scalzi.com/2021/02/13/general-unstructured-thoughts-on-being-cancelled/?amp=1&#34;&gt;some thoughts on &amp;ldquo;being cancelled&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In regards to front-end web development: &lt;a href=&#34;https://remysharp.com/2021/02/11/the-web-didnt-change-you-did&#34;&gt;The web didn&amp;rsquo;t change; you did.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://biglist.terraaeon.com/index.html&#34;&gt;The Big List of Personal Websites&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of blogs to browse!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noah Smith shares some &lt;a href=&#34;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/my-sci-fi-novel-recommendations&#34;&gt;sci-fi novel recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. Saving to go through later to add to my perennially-behind-book-backlog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a bunch of family and medical stuff to do this coming week, so I don&amp;rsquo;t expect to be very productive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had a &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/02/1362173871806287872/&#34;&gt;Globe fiber internet outage&lt;/a&gt; last week, starting Tuesday afternoon until Thursday morning. So I spent all of Ash Wednesday without internet, which is appropriate as a bit of &lt;em&gt;penitencia&lt;/em&gt; I guess. Spent the downtime complaining at their customer support account, and also reading and playing offline things. I thought about writing a post about their customer service, but it was an actual outage that affected a bunch of people in the area, and the customer service can&amp;rsquo;t really do much about that, so it seems a bit mean to pile on now that the service has been restored (and I seem to have gotten a rebate for the lost days). Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll still write the post, we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;Still sketching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caught up with B99 up to season 7. Looks like the final season might not come out until 2022 though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went ahead and finished The Expanse season 5 yesterday. Overall the season wasn&amp;rsquo;t as exciting as some of the earlier ones, but still pretty good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; ended on another cliffhanger this week as usual, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big surprise for me, given everyone on reddit had been predicting it. Two eps to go, hoping for a strong finish!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I played a lot of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/Kaldheim&#34;&gt;Kaldheim limited this week&lt;/a&gt;, drafts at first as usual, then I did some sealeds to prep for the Arena Open, which I also did as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://roytang.net/2021/02/1363386731240726533/&#34;&gt;season finale&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmU0vkKslGXgza5YFq3PfZZGHwyRIYYU-&#34;&gt;Kaldheim limited youtube playlist&lt;/a&gt;. I enjoyed this format, though I wasn&amp;rsquo;t super good at it (mostly my fault, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t really read up on pick orders and such early on). It&amp;rsquo;s fun and challenging. Looking forward to Strixhaven!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks to our internet outage, I finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/922710/Knightin/&#34;&gt;Knightin&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;! There&amp;rsquo;s a couple of achievements I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten which I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;ll bother - they&amp;rsquo;re for doing a speedrun and a no-death run, both of which I can probably do with a bit of practice, but not sure it&amp;rsquo;s worth it. I did like the game though, I might write a short review this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run still in progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks to our internet outage, I finished reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/walkaway/&#34;&gt;Cory Doctorow&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Walkaway&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Also started reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://scottberkun.com/the-ghost-of-my-father/&#34;&gt;Scott Berkun&amp;rsquo;s Ghost of my Father&lt;/a&gt;, which turned out to be a quick read, will probably finish it tonight or tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-coming-week&#34;&gt;This coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;penultimate WandaVision ep!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Street Fighter 6 first drop for season 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Civ6 New Frontier Pass free update for February (improved Barbarians mode!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Superman and Lois premiering this week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holiday on Thursday! (EDSA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AboutQuiz league season finale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;various family celebrations and medical errands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trump has been acquitted in his second impeachment trial, proving yet again to the world that the US is a flawed democracy dominated by corruption at the highest levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duterte says &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/duterte-cannot-afford-be-brave-in-mouth-against-china&#34;&gt;he cannot be brave in the mouth against China&lt;/a&gt;. Back before the 2016 elections, somebody I used to know claimed that we needed a &amp;ldquo;rottweiler&amp;rdquo; like Duterte as president because he would be tough against China. I remember this sometimes and laugh and then am also sad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A couple of Zelda-themed videos I enjoyed for some reason:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wsi1IbjPAkM&#34;&gt;Life as a Bokoblin - A Zelda Nature Documentary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDPRwLlpdTU&#34;&gt;The Legend of Beavis&lt;/a&gt;. This one is super dumb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this &lt;a href=&#34;https://cosmicdirtbag.com/2020/12/07/crop-circles-part-01/&#34;&gt;short webcomic series about crop circles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smolcss.dev/&#34;&gt;Smolcss.dev&lt;/a&gt;: Minimal snippets for modern CSS layouts and components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For everyone who likes NPM, there was this &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610&#34;&gt;fun story this week&lt;/a&gt; about attacking private source code repos by creating public versions of their private dependencies, so that NPM would pull those new public versions instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/books/a35118667/how-to-write-a-novel/&#34;&gt;How to Write a Novel, According to 10 Really Good Novelists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275441/jack-dorsey-decentralized-app-store-algorithms&#34;&gt;Twitter&amp;rsquo;s Jack Dorsey imagines a decentralized app store for social media algorithms&lt;/a&gt;. The article is sparse on details and I don&amp;rsquo;t know how accurate it is, but I do like the idea, if only because I hope somebody implements just the chronological timeline algorithm everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still working on that secret thing I&amp;rsquo;m learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote a bunch of actual non-weeknotes &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/blog/&#34;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt; last week, so go check them out! Or don&amp;rsquo;t, I&amp;rsquo;m not your mother.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily sketches still ongoing in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt;, somehow still managing to keep up. I make no pretense that the sketches are actually good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching a lot of old Brooklyn Nine-Nine eps, still haven&amp;rsquo;t caught up to the latest season already on Netflix. Was announced last week that the next season, only 10 eps, will be the last one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also started trying to catch up on The Expanse. This series is so hard to binge because each episode feels so heavy and dense I feel like I need time to absorb and reflect. Would have been perfect to be watching the eps weekly as they drop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; on the other hand continues to be really effective/frustrating with their cliffhangers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/f9e8b66a362f9a61612057f4db10b9cf/&#34;&gt;This note&lt;/a&gt; summarizes how I feel about these three shows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/Kaldheim&#34;&gt;Kaldheim drafts are continuing&lt;/a&gt;, although I find I&amp;rsquo;m much worse at this than Zendikar Rising. Despite being so terrible, I am considering throwing gems away on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/announcing-february-2021-arena-open-2021-02-10&#34;&gt;Sealed Arena Open next weekend&lt;/a&gt;, seems like it could be fund (although there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance of instant regret!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s this small indie game I bought a while back called &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/922710/Knightin/&#34;&gt;Knightin&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, I tried it a bit, kinda neat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Been getting back into Fire Emblem Three Heroes, on my second run at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Couple of gaming things this week that I&amp;rsquo;m interested in:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Street Fighter V made their initial previews for the first drop in season 5. The season pass includes something that lets me random select on ranked! I&amp;rsquo;d love to that, and I&amp;rsquo;d love to play more SF5 despite being so trash at it, except the real problem is I find it so hard to find online matches (possibly because I&amp;rsquo;m so bronze tier). Still, tempted to get this pass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser&amp;rsquo;s Fury for Switch released this week. Was initially not interested since I already finished 3D World on WiiU, but I saw a preview that made Bowser&amp;rsquo;s Fury look like a significant addition, so now I am once again waffling about whether to throw money Nintendo&amp;rsquo;s way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Still reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Walkaway-Novel-Cory-Doctorow-ebook/dp/B01FQQ47OC/&#34;&gt;Cory Doctorow&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Walkaway&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt; We were terrible in this week&amp;rsquo;s About Quiz, mostly due to the abundance of PH-local questions which we always find difficult. We finished second last, but I think we still manage to retain first place in the league, by a razor-thin margin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started to use an electric massager and doing arm rotations and other weird exercises to help loosen up my left shoulder and maybe regain flexibility and alleviate muscle pains. Here&amp;rsquo;s to hoping it works!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My eyes are a bit tired. Quite possibly from playing too much Fire Emblem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward-to-this-coming-week&#34;&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yet another WandaVision ep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new One Piece later today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think we should also be getting details on the next Civ6 New Frontier Pass drop next week? It should just be a free update for this month though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oh Ash Wednesday is this week, I wonder if they&amp;rsquo;ll provide an alternative for people who still don&amp;rsquo;t want to go to the actual church&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s February! We are nearing the one year anniversary of being in the longest covid19 lockdown in the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Myanmar&amp;rsquo;s military staged a coup, and have apparently cut off the country from the internet, maybe? Last night during an international voice chat, the two of us who were in the Philippines were suddenly dropped/disconnected and one of my first thoughts were &amp;ldquo;Wait, is there a coup happening in our country RIGHT NOW?&amp;rdquo; Luckily no, it was just the typical bad internet we have here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In local news: &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1392144/fwd-media-orgs-groups-call-out-parlade-for-remarks-vs-inquirer-net-reporter-shows-perils-of-anti-terror-act&#34;&gt;Red-tagging&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1392466/manigas-kayong-lahat-roque-touts-duterte-for-infrastructure-success-beating-covid-19&#34;&gt;immature public officials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1392786/go-says-duterte-also-against-imposing-child-car-seat-law-at-the-moment&#34;&gt;people objecting to laws due to poorly-thought of implementation rules&lt;/a&gt;, etc. So, same-same. Oh, also the anti-terror law challenged in the Supreme Court, and Napoles finally convicted of the pork barrel scam after a five-year trial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like noting down these current events in the weeknotes because they help future me frame my personal happenings around what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the world, but in a way &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/1358305512517849089/&#34;&gt;it can get exhausting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing for today, I&amp;rsquo;ll post some stuff later this week, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have been busy for the past week, mostly learning a thing that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about right now. So I haven&amp;rsquo;t been wandering the internets that much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily sketches still ongoing in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gurren Lagann&lt;/strong&gt; was added to Netflix! I watched the first few episodes, the series is as insane as I remember. It has English dubs, so I can watch it in the background (since I&amp;rsquo;ve already seen it before), but I have a bunch of other stuff to watch, so we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; episode 5 was fantastic. It also may or may not be a BIG DEAL (tm). We&amp;rsquo;ll see. I was a bit annoyed that this was a weekly show, but the reality is that their cliffhangers wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been as effective (or generated as much discussion/hype) if all the episodes came in one drop, so I guess it&amp;rsquo;s okay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On a whim, I decided to watch the &lt;strong&gt;Royal Rumble&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s so weird since their events have virtual audiences (with the wall of faces). Also like 1/3 to 1/2 of the actual Rumble participants have been around since forever, and in fact the current winner Edge won the Rumble for the first time 11 years ago to the day (which, together with him starting at #1, was a pretty strong hint he&amp;rsquo;d be winning). Not sure if I&amp;rsquo;d watch Wrestlemania in two months, since I don&amp;rsquo;t really follow anymore and I&amp;rsquo;m not really invested in the storylines or anything, but they really do a pretty good job of recapping storylines, feuds, etc in the events themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Humble Choice is out and includes &lt;strong&gt;Valkyria Chronicles 4&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Endless Space 2&lt;/strong&gt;, which seem like good picks for me, so I&amp;rsquo;m probably getting it. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2009/01/valkyria-chronicles/&#34;&gt;played the first Valkyria Chronicles more than a decade ago&lt;/a&gt; and I was surprised to know there&amp;rsquo;d already been 3 sequels, so looking forward to this one. Endless Space looks like my kind of jam as well. What? Backlog? What&amp;rsquo;s that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have already drafted a bit of &lt;strong&gt;Kaldheim&lt;/strong&gt; on Magic Arena. It&amp;rsquo;s proving to be a rather fun format, and I did already get my first 7-x run on the third try. Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/Kaldheim&#34;&gt;Kaldheim tag&lt;/a&gt; for details/VODs/etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Finished Scott Berkun&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Year-Without-Pants-WordPress-com-Future/dp/1118660633&#34;&gt;The Year Without Pants&lt;/a&gt;, review sometime this week. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what to read next, so I just sat down and scrolled through the files in my Kindle til I decided on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Walkaway-Novel-Cory-Doctorow-ebook/dp/B01FQQ47OC/&#34;&gt;Cory Doctorow&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Walkaway&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt; Hey, we somehow managed to win this week&amp;rsquo;s AboutQuiz, so we are back on top of the league standings, I think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muscle pains in my left upper arm/shoulder seem to be more prevalent. Not more painful or anything, but like, easier to trigger at random angles so now I find myself wincing a lot. And the arm has a lot less flexibility when doing something like reaching behind me or such. At this point I should probably get a massage or something to try to fix it, but that would mean interacting with a stranger!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward-to-this-coming-week&#34;&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as always (at least until March), more WandaVision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new One Piece later today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s February tomorrow! Somehow, the world still turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somehow the most viral world news this week doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have been about any kind of politics, but rather about capitalism. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1354670019045584899/&#34;&gt;Gamestop/stock market brouhaha&lt;/a&gt; was a sage of retail investors on reddit going head-to-head with hedge funds over the stock price of a dying gaming company (among others) that dominated most of my feeds for the week. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a lot more compliced than that. If you want a more in-depth look, I recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine&#34;&gt;Matt Levine&amp;rsquo;s Money Stuff column over on Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, he covered the whole thing for most of the week. You can start &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-25/the-game-never-stops&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tony Hawk, age 52, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tonyhawk/status/1354305117982400514&#34;&gt;can still hit a 720&lt;/a&gt;, probably his last one ever. I think it&amp;rsquo;d kind of a bittersweet blessing to be doing something you love and knowing that it&amp;rsquo;s going to be the last time you get to do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/crossover-project/are-we-really-engineers/&#34;&gt;excellent series of posts by Hillel Wayne&lt;/a&gt; comparing software engineering to other engineering disciplines by interviewing people who have crossed over from other fields into ours. It addresses interesting questions like whether what we do can really be called &amp;ldquo;engineering&amp;rdquo; and what can software engineering and other engineering fields learn from each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kottke.org/21/01/usa-downgraded-from-democracy-to-anocracy-part-democracy-and-part-dictatorship&#34;&gt;USA has been downgraded from a democracy to an anocracy&lt;/a&gt;. This was the first time I heard of this term, anocracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.engadget.com/facebook-political-content-news-feed-mark-zuckerberg-232846266.html&#34;&gt;Facebook says they want to deprioritize political content&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ll see if that holds, given that generating political heat is good for their engagement metrics. But if such a thing were to happen (and applied to the PH), it would seriously reduce the reach of government propaganda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of Facebook, they appear to have recently &lt;a href=&#34;https://lincoln.metacannon.net/2021/01/facebook-disabled-my-account-after-i-criticized-them.html&#34;&gt;banned someone for criticizing them.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have yet to read through all of it, but there&amp;rsquo;s this metafilter thread full of all sorts of recommendations: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ask.metafilter.com/351766/What-do-you-always-recommend-to-people&#34;&gt;What do you always recommend to people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily sketches in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt;, somehow I still haven&amp;rsquo;t fallen behind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started watching the current NCIS season (TIL Fez from That 70s Show is a cast regular there now!) and also a bunch of Mike Birbiglia standup specials on Netflix. I do have other more interesting series on my backlog to watch, but somehow I found myself falling back to procedurals and standup comedy. The main reason is that these things don&amp;rsquo;t require a lot of attention, so I can leave them running in the background while I do other things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will admit I was a bit meh on &lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt; episodes 1-3 (and even for the rest of the MCU offerings this year), but episode 4 was just fantastic and has renewed my MCU hype. If they manage to hit this level of quality for their other series, we have a lot to look forward to. It makes me a bit sad that the Netflix series/Agents of SHIELD never received the kind of MCU integration these series are getting, but what can you do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of gaming for me this week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played three whole games of &lt;strong&gt;Civilization VI&lt;/strong&gt; over the past week, two of them before the latest New Frontier Pass drop even. I won one game with the new Civ Vietnam. (I &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFiA4HBCi8&#34;&gt;streamed a bit of this game&lt;/a&gt; if you want to watch me be dumb.) I&amp;rsquo;m glad I got one already, because I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;d play them again, as the terrain restrictions are very challenging. The Corporations mode is nice, but I feel like I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet maximized it too much. It does feel like I&amp;rsquo;ll be enabling this by default from now on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of reasons, I purchased a copy of &lt;strong&gt;Princess Maker 2 Refine&lt;/strong&gt; on Steam. I played a bunch of the original game back in the day, and it was weird reading through the old guides on GameFAQs and some of them would have advice on configuring old-timey things like &lt;code&gt;config.sys&lt;/code&gt; and such. Anyway, I played almost 5 hours of this in one session, which was really bad for my eyestrain. This was one of the first calendar-based life sims I played, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the reason I really enjoyed the Persona series? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why I found this game in particular so engaging, as it&amp;rsquo;s kind of like watching spreadsheet numbers go up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kaldheim&lt;/strong&gt; is out on Magic Arena! I only had time to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1355164547842248704/&#34;&gt;do a Sealed&lt;/a&gt; so far, but I expect to be drafting (and streaming on Twitch) a few times a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; Still reading Scott Berkun&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Year-Without-Pants-WordPress-com-Future/dp/1118660633&#34;&gt;The Year Without Pants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finances:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t talk about my finances a lot in this space, but I will note that a couple of weeks ago I started investing in the US markets via an app called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.etoro.com/&#34;&gt;eToro&lt;/a&gt;. I got lucky with an initial trade that had a bit too much leverage for my taste, because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t reading too carefully. Luckily the NASDAQ spiked that day so I made it out with a bit of profit. I used a bit of that profit to buy-in a minimal amount of Gamestop, trying to cash in on the trend, unfortunately I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get in on a low price. Well, I can afford to risk (and lose) this profit, so that&amp;rsquo;s fine. I just hope the Gamestop thing doesn&amp;rsquo;t crash the markets entirely, that would be just my luck for such a thing to happen just when I started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt; We were still ahead in the AboutQuiz league going into this week&amp;rsquo;s Price is Right-themed game, but we only finished 5th this time, so IDK if that will still hold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a lot of family errands during the week as well, mostly financial stuff and helping my folks with medical appointments and such. I think this was the week where I had the most trips out of the house since the pandemic lockdowns began.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;site-updates&#34;&gt;Site updates:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you follow this site via an RSS/feed reader (both of you), you may want to know that I&amp;rsquo;ve added a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/daily/feed/&#34;&gt;daily feed&lt;/a&gt; to the site, it will cough up a single post per day with a summary of all the things I&amp;rsquo;ve posted for that day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward-to-this-coming-week&#34;&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new WandaVision episode!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a new thing I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to learn/get into, hoping to get started on it this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Wow, January is almost done. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biden inaugurated as US president, world celebrates US getting rid of Trump. Biden isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly unproblematic, but he is at least sane and boring. There will be time enough to criticize him later, for now let them be enjoy victory. My expectations of him are at least moderately higher than &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2017/01/822558467265335297/&#34;&gt;the ones I had for Trump&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the internet gets inundated with an inordinate amount of Bernie Sanders memes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;locally: the govt continues to bombard us with controversies, this time stirring up a red-tagging hornests nest by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/phkule/status/1351128229462028288&#34;&gt;abrogating the DND-UP accord&lt;/a&gt;, paving the way for militarization of campuses and stifling of free expression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone made &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJH_RbnrGUs&#34;&gt;a Mandalorian trailer in the style of old-school spaghetti westerns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like this &lt;a href=&#34;https://myk.ninja/loremen&#34;&gt;random lore generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote a bunch of words about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/tech-censorship/&#34;&gt;my thoughts on tech censorship and social media&lt;/a&gt;; there are some relevant links in there, if that kind of thing interests you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.idrlabs.com/difficult-person/test.php&#34;&gt;difficult person test&lt;/a&gt; did the rounds in some of my online groups this week (and sparked some silly discussions about gaming self-assessments)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wow, did I not internet that much or was the internet just boring this week? Boring can be good though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily sketches in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt;, ongoing, streak yet unbroken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1352137686614564867/&#34;&gt;World War Z&lt;/a&gt;, though I kinda wish I had seen it back at the start of the pandemic, seemed like it would have been appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WandaVision ep 3: So weird! I don&amp;rsquo;t mind the sitcom stuff, though I&amp;rsquo;m mostly here for the Marvel plots. The pacing is fine, with just enough easter eggs and plot teasing to not be annoying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kicked off a second run of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1349796416042856448/&#34;&gt;Fire Emblem Three Houses&lt;/a&gt;! Now in hard/classic, and going down the red/Black Eagle path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG: &lt;strong&gt;Kaldheim&lt;/strong&gt; previews are done, and set is out on Arena next week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular Saturday gaming group tried to do some Jackbox games via Discord, but we ran into audio issues, so we ended up just playing Sentinels and Root again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books: I finished reading Katie Mack&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;End of Everything&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;, here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/end-of-everything/&#34;&gt;a short review&lt;/a&gt;. For the next book, I started on Scott Berkun&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Year-Without-Pants-WordPress-com-Future/dp/1118660633&#34;&gt;The Year Without Pants&lt;/a&gt; of which I&amp;rsquo;ve had a copy forever. It&amp;rsquo;s about remote work back in the early 2010s, which is a fun contrast to our current remote work-heavy world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz: We actually won the online Wheel of Fortune-themed AboutQuiz the week before this (forgot to mention in last week&amp;rsquo;s notes), so we were defending champs in this week&amp;rsquo;s Weakest Link-themed quiz, but we were too conservative with our banks and only finished 3rd place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health: Still have muscle pains in my left upper bicep and shoulder, though they seem to be in different places compared to before? Am using this hand massager to massage the area occassionally while I&amp;rsquo;m at the computer, and still continuing the warm compress. Hoping this fixes it up soon, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to ask a stranger to come in and massage me or whatever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the first time since March, I put on pants! I had only been going out in shorts when going to the grocery or the nearby pharmacy, but this week I had to do an errand at a hospital a bit farther away, so I figured it would be a good time to figure out where my pants were. Hospital protocols were strict, as expected. We had to wait in like 3 different waiting areas before we could get to our appointment. This hospital was one of the hotspots back in the early days of the pandemic, so their vigilance is reassuring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PC died unexpectedly today. As in, lost power while I was using it and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t turn back on, power light just blinking. This has happened once before, towards the end of 2020. Back then I had tried unplugging the power supply and opening it up, then reconnecting to see what happened, and it just miraculously fixed itself. This time, I just unplugged the PS, then left it alone for a while. When I came back later and reconnected everything and booted up, it was fine. So I guess there&amp;rsquo;s some issue with the power supply? I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to upgrade just yet, although this rig is already more than 5 years old, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping I can get a couple more years out of it at least. (That and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to go to a shop to have one assembled during the pandemic, and I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna do the assembly myself.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I filled up an online application form for Quezon City&amp;rsquo;s new QC id, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how this goes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward-to-this-coming-week&#34;&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new WandaVision episode!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaldheim releases on Magic Arena!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new drop in Civ6&amp;rsquo;s New Frontier pack!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This is 2021 week 3. Or week 2. Two and a half? How do calendars work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;relatively calm compared to the chaos of the previous week. However in the US, a storm may be brewing over Biden&amp;rsquo;s inauguration next week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;locally: still a lot of confusion/inconsistencies around the vaccination plan. Or at least &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/01/17/2071005/senate-seeks-further-hearings-vaccines&#34;&gt;some senators think so&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, we are close to breaching 500k cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot about personal note taking recently, in a bid to find ways to improve my own systems. I skimmed this book from like 2004ish: &lt;a href=&#34;https://users.speakeasy.net/~lion/nb/html/&#34;&gt;How to Make a Complete Map of Every Thought You Think&lt;/a&gt;, which is like a super paper-heavy system. Probably totally impractical (for me at least), but some ideas there worth considering. The modern day equivalent would be something like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/&#34;&gt;Zettelkasten method&lt;/a&gt;, something I&amp;rsquo;ve also been considering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I read this Substack &lt;a href=&#34;https://paulskallas.substack.com/p/is-culture-stuck&#34;&gt;post about culture being stuck in the mid-2000s&lt;/a&gt;, presumably because the Internet became mainstream and people started forming a hivemind around what was popular, and creators responded accordingly by creating more of the same stuff. I think there&amp;rsquo;s still some space for fringe tastes out there, but it is true that pop culture has seemed monolothic recently. What hits me most from the article is the phasing out of rock n roll in favor of hip hop, because a more diverse crowd favors it. I&amp;rsquo;m not really a hip hop person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cory Doctorow &lt;a href=&#34;https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/&#34;&gt;blogs about his daily linkblogging process&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate 20 years of blogging. This reminded me that during my recent blog-hopping I also ran across &lt;a href=&#34;https://althouse.blogspot.com/2021/01/another-bloggiversary-this-blog-is-17.html&#34;&gt;Ann Althouse&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt;, which has been posting daily for 17 years without breaking the streak! I kind of wish I could be that prolific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald%27s_Restaurants&#34;&gt;McDonald&amp;rsquo;s coffee lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, often held up as an example of frivolous ambulance-chasing lawsuits, was much more complicated than that. The woman was hospitalized for more than a week and had to have skin grafts, and McDonald&amp;rsquo;s refused to settle for more than $800, which wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have even covered medical expenses, leading to the huge jury award.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tom Critchlow asks &lt;a href=&#34;https://tomcritchlow.com/2021/01/14/new-browsers/&#34;&gt;why we can&amp;rsquo;t write code in our browsers&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel B. Markham argues that &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielbmarkham.com/the-platform-is-the-enemy/&#34;&gt;platforms might be turning us into idiots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this (kinda old) story about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.damninteresting.com/who-wants-to-be-a-thousandaire&#34;&gt;a guy who hacked a TV game show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not a big fan of Tiktok, but I admit I have been enjoying some of the sea shanty performances coming out of it. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/etelsverdlov/status/1348654717036093440&#34;&gt;Example one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/EKingstonBooks/status/1349906687537373189&#34;&gt;example two&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PH stuff: A trailer came out for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ4ChZPlikM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&#34;&gt;Voltes V Legacy&lt;/a&gt;, which will be airing on GMA. I don&amp;rsquo;t have high expectations, but the animation seemed decent enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily sketches in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt;. I used to crosspost them all to &lt;a href=&#34;https://instagram.com/roytang0400&#34;&gt;instagram&lt;/a&gt; pretty consistently, but now I only do it when I feel like it. Been thinking of getting off instagram anyway, but that&amp;rsquo;s something for another time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finished &lt;strong&gt;Spectacular Spider-Man&lt;/strong&gt; on Netflix. I liked it, even if it was a kids&amp;rsquo; show. Too bad it was cut off abruptly due to licensing issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also started (re-?) watching Attack on Titan, from season 1, as the final season has been getting some hype. Anime is hard to background-watch though (due to subs), so this might take a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched my first two movies of the year: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1350042544567029763/&#34;&gt;The Godfather&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1350361902149324800/&#34;&gt;The Godfather Part II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First two eps of WandaVision are in! It&amp;rsquo;s so weird. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing how things unfold. Series runs until March, I feel like I should do one of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/spoiler-free-review/&#34;&gt;spoiler-free reviews&lt;/a&gt; when it&amp;rsquo;s done (haven&amp;rsquo;t done any of those in a while) but it feels weird to do it for a show that drops weekly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1349796416042856448/&#34;&gt;Fire Emblem Three Houses&lt;/a&gt;! Will probably kick off the 2nd run sometime this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG: &lt;strong&gt;Kaldheim&lt;/strong&gt; preview season in progress. I am fairly excited for the new set to come in, because I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to draft, the limited environment looks exciting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I feel like I should be starting one of the many Steam RPGs on my backlog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books: Been reading Katie Mack&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;End of Everything&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;m around 2/3rds in, so hopefully I can finish it and at least get 1 book in this month lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health: My muscle pains in the left upper arm are still there, although they&amp;rsquo;ve tapered off a bit, I think because I&amp;rsquo;ve been applying warm compresses twice a day for most of the week. Hopefully it will be gone by next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward-to-this-coming-week&#34;&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biden inauguration (chaos?!?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometime this week, I will probably put on pants for the first time since March.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;We are barely more than a week into 2021 and it has already been quite a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-world&#34;&gt;The world:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the week started off with something as innocuous as a guy going viral for making his daughter work six hours to figure out how to use a can opener and open a can of beans. I can&amp;rsquo;t explain &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9506541/bean-dad-explainer-reactions/&#34;&gt;Bean Dad&lt;/a&gt;, but it was so weird and surreal the way it took over the internet for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;impossible to discuss the last week without mentioning the violent attack by Trump supporters on the US capitol upon incitement by the president himself
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching the events unfolding on the news &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1347017186317983745/&#34;&gt;gave me the same feeling as watching the 9/11 twin towers assault almost two decades ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the subsequent condemnation and consequences not just from US politicians but worldwide, including Trump himself subsequently getting booted off/banned from almost every social media service (of course sparking many opinions about the first amendment and the disproportionate control by tech giants over the public sphere).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s talk of second impeachment and 25th amendment calls (I know about the 25th amendment mostly due to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1347018337990021122/&#34;&gt;Air Force One&lt;/a&gt;), although Pence has thumbed that down. If Trump faces no consequences for this one, they might be looking at something much worse down the line, possibly as soon as the Biden inauguration on the 20th.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s consequences for the actual rioters though: many are being identified on social media and some have already been fired from their jobs. Nascent social media app Parler, used to coordinate the attacks, has been booted off Apple and Google mobile stores AND off their Amazon webhosting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, gootecks showed himself to be once again a MAGA idiot supporting the violence, so his emote got banned from Twitch, which was a weird piece of news.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yesterday (Saturday) was the feast of the Black Nazarene, a big deal in Manila. It was reported that &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1381685/doh-to-quiapo-crowd-watch-for-symptoms&#34;&gt;up to 400,000 devotees&lt;/a&gt; crowded the streets of Manila in what is probably a COVID19 super-spreader event. I mean sure, we held back and stayed at home for Holy Week/Easter/Christmas but somehow we can&amp;rsquo;t avoid celebrating the Black Nazarene. This when our local case counts have been rising since the holidays. Sigh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;links-of-interest&#34;&gt;Links of interest:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started these weeknotes, I sometimes put in a section with recent links I&amp;rsquo;ve found interesting during the week. It kind of died off, mostly because I haven&amp;rsquo;t been good about going through my backlog of feeds and sources to get much content for the section. I&amp;rsquo;m bringing it back here as a regular section (for now), so that (a) I force myself to go through all that stuff at least once a week; and (b) people who aren&amp;rsquo;t super interested in what&amp;rsquo;s going on with me have more stuff to read in these weeknotes. I also considered just having a separate weekly &amp;ldquo;linkblog&amp;rdquo; post with the links of interest section, but figured maybe I&amp;rsquo;d check first if I can keep up with the volume needed for that sort of thing? Also, a lot of these are available on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/links/&#34;&gt;links&lt;/a&gt; list, which I also share to Twitter/Masto as they come, so if you follow me there, you might have seen me tweet some of these, and this is just sort of a weekly recap. Anyway, for this week, here we go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for gamers, the wonderful &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.engadget.com/spotify-persona-5-4-3-fes-2-pq-dancing-arena-soundtracks-104349652.html&#34;&gt;Persona 4 and 5 soundtracks are now officially available on Spotify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for people who like old-school blogs and personal websites: Robin Rendle writes &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.robinrendle.com/essays/newsletters&#34;&gt;a nicely-formatted post about newsletters and writing on the web&lt;/a&gt;, Desmond Rivet wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://desmondrivet.com/2020/04/28/writing-reasons&#34;&gt;about using his blog to manage his thinking&lt;/a&gt; back in Apr 2020, and I realized I never shared this &lt;a href=&#34;https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse&#34;&gt;2019 post from Matthias Ott about personal websites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For self-improvement, ideopunk &lt;a href=&#34;https://ideopunk.com/2020/12/22/100-tips-for-a-better-life/&#34;&gt;talks about 100 tips for a better life&lt;/a&gt;. Probably not all of these are for you, but maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll get some stuff of interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For optimists, it can be nice to know there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://reasonstobecheerful.world/the-year-in-cheer/&#34;&gt;quite a few bits of good news in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, in spite of everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snAhsXyO3Ck&#34;&gt;video about lockdown productivity&lt;/a&gt; came out early on in the pandemic, but a lot of the advice still seems sound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.damninteresting.com/who-wants-to-be-a-thousandaire/&#34;&gt;old story about a guy who gamed one of the earliest game shows&lt;/a&gt; by studying the RNG patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some recent Twitter threads of interest:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently, it&amp;rsquo;s a thing for teens &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/unikunka/status/1346602536904523777&#34;&gt;to disbelieve in Hellen Keller&lt;/a&gt;, wth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are told that abusers and white supremacists &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lilithsaintcrow/status/1347293759155838976&#34;&gt;absolutely do not believe their own bullshit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to determine if &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/NomeDaBarbarian/status/1338876619205746688&#34;&gt;something is a sandwich&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone compiled some ridiculous &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/paulisci/status/1340764722811957248&#34;&gt;2020 headlines of the year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hey, the new daily habits I kicked off starting the New Year are holding strong so far. Well, except for daily blog posting, I missed yesterday. But I never claimed that as a resolution, so maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t count that.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily sketches in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook/&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;rsquo;re not super good, but maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll like that kind of thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I binged season 3 of &lt;strong&gt;Cobra Kai&lt;/strong&gt; in under 24 hours. Still greatly enjoying it, despite the high school drama. I really like the evolving dynamic between Johnny and Daniel, and the callbacks to all 3 Karate Kid movies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For my background watching I started &lt;strong&gt;Spectacular Spider-Man&lt;/strong&gt; on Netflix. Not bad for a kids&amp;rsquo; show, covers most of the mythos fairly well, though I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed at how Peter treats Gwen like a sidekick given in the comics she&amp;rsquo;s the love of his life. I&amp;rsquo;m only halfway through, maybe that changes later? I always felt Spider-man was better as a serialized TV series than the constant movie reboots. He has a lot of nice street-level villains and supporting cast that can only feature in a longer storyline than blockbuster movies can afford. Oh well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Star Trek Discovery&lt;/strong&gt; Season 3 finale was this week. Nothing too exceptional, I mean, we knew they were going to pull out a win somehow, there were very few surprises. Star Wars wins 2020 I guess lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Emblem Three Houses&lt;/strong&gt; still ongoing. I actually took a few days break this week because I felt like I was playing it a bit too much lol. I think I&amp;rsquo;m fairly close to the end though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG: &lt;strong&gt;Kaldheim&lt;/strong&gt; preview season kicked off this week, but nothing too exciting for me so far, though there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of interesting cards of course. Lore-wise, I do like how they translated a lot of the Norse myth stuff into card form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books: Been reading Katie Mack&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;End of Everything&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty interesting so far, but I&amp;rsquo;m less than halfway in, not a good rate. To help reinforce my book reading, I&amp;rsquo;ve switched up my evening meals reading from the day&amp;rsquo;s news to whatever book I have on tap at the moment. It works I guess, but I eat quickly, so I don&amp;rsquo;t get to read much per session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the past week or so I&amp;rsquo;ve had some kind of strange muscle (?) pain in my upper left bicep, but only when I hold up the arm or stretch it at certain angles. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of annoying, like I slept on it wrong. I thought it would just go away on its own, but now I&amp;rsquo;m thinking maybe it&amp;rsquo;s one of those old age things where things just hurt randomly and you have to live with it?!? Friends recommended trying a warm compress and/or self-massage on the arm, gonna try those out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward-to-this-coming-week&#34;&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WandaVision kicks off on Disney+! I think we&amp;rsquo;re getting two episodes this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more Kaldheim previews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a brand new year, a brand new week, a brand new day. There&amp;rsquo;s no real reason to believe 2021 will be a better year, but we can choose to try to be better, and maybe that in itself is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week&amp;rsquo;s New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve transition played out pretty much as expected. We just stayed at home, actually had an early media noche dinner (around 9ish) and observed the fireworks for a little bit. Yes, there were still fireworks, despite the supposed ban at the LGU level. I would estimate a drop in fireworks volume of maybe 20% at best. Ma says maybe most of those are &amp;ldquo;sanctioned&amp;rdquo; fireworks in common areas, but I remain unconvinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/2020-year-in-review/&#34;&gt;year in review blog post&lt;/a&gt; covered most of the stats for the past year. I enjoyed putting this together, I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker both for reflecting over the past and for gathering stats, so it&amp;rsquo;s a pleasant combination for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really believe in New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions anymore, but I did decide to try to restart a few daily habits and see which ones stick. Don&amp;rsquo;t feel like talking about them all here, but a couple are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the daily walking, but this time I only do a small loop right in front of the house and still inside our subdivision. It&amp;rsquo;s super boring, so I can&amp;rsquo;t tolerate doing it for too long, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get used to it. I&amp;rsquo;ve started listening to a trivia podcast while walking, maybe that will help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/03/sketching-daily/&#34;&gt;sketchdaily&lt;/a&gt;! This might be the most ambitious one. You can check all my sketches via &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook&#34;&gt;the sketchbook album&lt;/a&gt; on this site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;: Fire Emblem run ongoing! And the usual Eternal, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/1344593852154347520/&#34;&gt;Magic Arena&lt;/a&gt;, regular Saturday gaming, etc. I paused on the new Humble Monthly, seems meh. There&amp;rsquo;s still time to get stuff from the Steam sale, but there&amp;rsquo;s nothing particularly interesting. FOR NOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching&lt;/strong&gt;: I finally watched Wonder Woman 1984. Kind of meh. First one was definitely better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: I purchased Katie Mack&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;ldquo;The End of Everything&amp;rdquo; on Kindle because it was on sale, hopefully to restart the book reading habit for the New Year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to this coming week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star Trek Discovery season finale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG Kaldheim preview season kicking off!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shenanigans in the US congress/senate when they try to certify the EC results. Also Georgia elections determine whether Biden will have Senate support!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Weeknotes 2020-12-27 Season Finale
</title>

            <pubDate>Sun, 27 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;I started doing these weeknotes at &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/01/weeknotes-01-12/&#34;&gt;the top of 2020&lt;/a&gt;, so this one signals one complete year of doing my weekly reviews/notes in public. I thought it appropriate for a review!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did it turn out to be a good practice? I think for me yes! Not necessarily for anyone following the blog (all 3 of you), since a lot of the weeknotes stuff might seem boring or irrelevant to you. But for me, forcing me to publicly write some thoughts about the past week has been good for my own self-awareness and keeping me writing regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned this in the first weeknotes linked above, but I used to do private weekly reviews before this. I haven&amp;rsquo;t found much need to supplement the public weeknotes with private ones over the year, but that&amp;rsquo;s basically because (a) my other tracking systems have evolved this year to better capture more data, so less review was actually needed; and (b) this silly pandemic keeping me at home most of the year means there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much to report most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I&amp;rsquo;ll be carrying the weeknotes practice into 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the past week, it was of course Christmas week, which went about as expected. Noche buena night was just me and the folks at home, although the brothers and their families did pass by for a short while on the morning of that day for some gift exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world was relatively quiet. Well, there&amp;rsquo;s finally a post-Brexit trade deal, and Trump seems to be screwing over everybody as expected, and there&amp;rsquo;s a new Covid19 variant, and our government is still being dumb. So, same old same old?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good chunk of my week went towards playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/1340074409961222146/&#34;&gt;Fire Emblem Three Houses&lt;/a&gt;. As is typical of JRPGs, the startup is a bit slow, but once you get into the whole Persona-like loop of tasks and battles, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty addictive. Pretty sure this will take a while to finish though!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steam Christmas Sale is still ongoing. Thinking of actually getting Hades, because of all the GOTY accolades it&amp;rsquo;s getting. On the other hand, Fire Emblem&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular weekly gaming with friends: Root, Sentinels of the Multiverse. I also played a couple more Civ6 games for achievement hunting purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new Jeopardy eps on Netflix ran out quickly. Haven&amp;rsquo;t really started on anything seriously yet, though I did watch first episodes of The Expanse S5 and Kimetsu no Yaiba, but I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling like binging either series yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of cramming a few more movies into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/page/lists/2020/movies/&#34;&gt;2020 movies list&lt;/a&gt; this week, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if I get around to it or just play more Fire Emblem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To whoever is reading this: despite everything about this year, I hope you somehow managed to have a good holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This coming week: end of year stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the penultimate week of the year, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;m not the only who&amp;rsquo;s had enough of this accursed year and looking forward to moving on to the next one. I know that&amp;rsquo;s silly since the world won&amp;rsquo;t magically become better when the calendar flips over to January the first, but I think it helps our mental health to have this sort of &amp;ldquo;fresh start&amp;rdquo; mentality, even if it&amp;rsquo;s on an arbitrarily chosen date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holiday season continues to be weird, thanks to the pandemic. My brothers and I have been trying to hash out how to have the usual holiday gift exchange among the four households. In theory nobody will be coming inside the house, just parking outside and dropping off and picking up gifts, but they need to coordinate since they also need to exchange gifts with each other. They&amp;rsquo;re trying to see if they can synchronize their visits so that the exchanges can happen, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if that works out. Meanwhile, the usual family and extended family reunions will probably happen on Zoom, like many of my friends&amp;rsquo; recent company Christmas parties. Hopefully they go smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the pandemic and the holiday, cases continue to rise locally. This trend will probably carry on into January as a result of holiday gatherings. In pandemic related government screwups recently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;requiring face shields everywhere in public, even for joggers or bikers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a pilot for face to face classes in January because the education secretary says they are more likely to get infected at home anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apparently we could have had vaccines as early as the first quarter of 2021, but the health secretary dropped the ball during negotiations with pfizer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I guess they were working with some sort of backlog due to the holiday sales, but my local gaming store took an entire week to ship me my copy of Fire Emblem Fates. It finally arrived last Friday so yay! I haven&amp;rsquo;t started playing yet, beyond opening the package and checking that the cartridge works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead this week, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a bit of achievement hunting in Civilization VI, since a new patch with balance updates dropped last week. I also tried resuming my Wasteland 2 game. It took me a while to get my bearings, but the game just seems so fiddly, I have a hard time getting into it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG: Kaldheim previews started this week! We don&amp;rsquo;t get any more until January though. The metal-themed previews reminded me of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/1339627168947601408/&#34;&gt;something from 10 years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finished The Big Bang Theory rewatch, I totally did not almost tear up at Sheldon&amp;rsquo;s speech in the finale. TBBT gets a lot of flak for being terrible, but I think it holds up reasonably well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;caught up with Mandalorian and Discovery. Discovery was so-so, but wow, the Mandalorian. What a fantastic season finale. I watched it around half a day after the episode dropped and I was very happy I wasn&amp;rsquo;t spoiled by the internet. The team behind the show are doing a great job with the Star Wars franchise. After the problematic sequel trilogy (which I still enjoyed), maybe the real future of the franchise is on episodic TV. Looking forward to all the new Star Wars content next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New background binge watching: There&amp;rsquo;s new episodes of Jeopardy on Netflix! Not a lot, but more trivia is always fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, most of my time was again spent on digging through and sorting old files. Additionally, one of my old external hard drives had also started getting errors, so I ordered and got a new 1tb one, and spent some time trying to move old backup files across from the old drive to the new one. It was annoying because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t play any games that use a controller while this was happening, for fear of disturbing the long file transfers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m kind of looking forward to doing my year in review blog post for this strange and accursed year.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Time passes yet again. I think I have to get used to not having much personal stuff to report in the weeknotes on certain weeks (aside from the watching/gaming parts), especially given the pandemic where I&amp;rsquo;m at home 90% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the pandemic, the UK started vaccinations last week, and the US FDA approved the Pfizer vaccine as well, so hopefully this is where things start to turn around. Sadly, it may be a while before vaccinations get widespread, especially here in the Philippines. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping things clear up by mid next year for us here, but I&amp;rsquo;m not optimistic about it. It would be really sad if the pandemic restrictions reach next year&amp;rsquo;s holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that people here seem to realize there&amp;rsquo;s still a pandemic going on, if pictures coming out of Divisoria are any indication. I get that not everyone has access to online shopping, but are there no other options for holiday gift shopping than walking through such dense crowds? This may be one instance where our generous gift-giving culture is bad for us, since people are still out trying to buy gifts when the pandemic is a perfectly good excuse for scaling back on the shopping. Capitalism ho!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The saddest part of this pandemic for me has that my brothers and their families can&amp;rsquo;t come over to visit, which means my parents don&amp;rsquo;t get to see their grandkids (and I don&amp;rsquo;t get to see the pamangkins). Sometimes we push back a bit on that envelope, but it&amp;rsquo;ll be a while before we all really get to see each other and enjoy company in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I managed to finish Batman Arkham Knight! The main story at least. Achievement completion seems unlikely, given the multiplayer achievements, and even some of the single-player ones seem a bit too challenging. I was able to enjoy the game despite the graphical issues I encountered early on. Lowering the settings helped a lot I think, though things still weren&amp;rsquo;t 100% good. I really take to these style of games where there&amp;rsquo;s an open world and you have a lot of things to collect and such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ordered Fire Emblem Fates for the Switch yesterday! I was also considering Paper Mario Origami King, but that had some mixed reviews, so holding off for now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently doing a binge re-watch of The Big Bang Theory as my background watching, I&amp;rsquo;m up to season 7 at the moment. I think the show holds up better than some of its contemporaries such as How I Met Your Mother. I know the geek portrayals can be a bit exaggerated or patronizing, so a lot of geeks don&amp;rsquo;t like it, but for me it&amp;rsquo;s fine. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of doing a bad comic book movie marathon sometime this month, covering the ones I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother watching, stuff like Ben Affleck Daredevil, Michael B Jordan Fantastic Four, and the recently released New Mutants. We&amp;rsquo;ll see if I get around to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just under two weeks until Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This week felt like another set of those moments-in-between, where not much seemed to happen, but it somehow still went by quickly anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the household and the family has slowly gotten used to the idea that any big Christmas celebration isn&amp;rsquo;t happening. My niece&amp;rsquo;s birthday was last weekend, so we sent her gifts via Grab delivery instead of being able to get together. Most likely something similar&amp;rsquo;s going to happen for gift exchanges on Christmas. We&amp;rsquo;re still trying to figure out what we can do in the meantime. The extended family has proposed a zoom call on the day of, instead of our traditional annual get-together, I&amp;rsquo;ll let them manage the logistics of that, they have a lot of digital natives to figure it out I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past couple of weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve made improvements to one of my side projects which is an app I use for personal data tracking. Improvements to that app&amp;rsquo;s feature set meant I could also take the time to do some digital housekeeping. That mostly means digging into a whole bunch old files to process their contents and possibly extract them the tracking app. Also regular maintenance things like backing up what needs backing up, deleting what can be deleted. It feels appropriate as a near-year-end activity to be going through junk from the past. (Although I should get started on going through actual physical junk as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;: In the never-ending quest to defeat the  gaming backlog, I started working on Arkham Origins. I believe I&amp;rsquo;ve had  my Steam copy for years now, well before I finished Arkham Knight, and  never got around to it. It&amp;rsquo;s not a particularly new game, so I figured  my five-year old PC could handle it fine. However I&amp;rsquo;m experiencing graphical  slowdowns, especially when dealing with bug groups of enemies. I&amp;rsquo;ve  already tried turning the graphics down to minimum settings, but still  experiencing some issues. My suspicion is that it may have something to  do with me currently using an AMD graphics card (the game does say it&amp;rsquo;s  optimized for NVidia when starting up). So maybe I should have gotten  around to it before my old GeForce card started having trouble. It&amp;rsquo;s  still mostly tolerable, and I did manage to get through some of the  quick-time event sections despite framerate drops. I&amp;rsquo;ll stick with it a  bit to see if I can crawl my way to the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt; Finished the binge watch of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/perfect-strangers/&#34;&gt;Perfect Strangers&lt;/a&gt;, and have caught up with Mandalorian and Discovery. I also blazed through S4 of My Hero Academia. I&amp;rsquo;d read the manga already, so just skipped ahead through the boring parts. I kind of want them to catch up with the current manga arc, as I want to see some of the more recent fights animated, but I guess that&amp;rsquo;s going to take a while. I also started rewatching The Big Bang Theory as my background show of choice, it&amp;rsquo;s aged reasonably well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned recently that I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write more, and I did manage to churn out one blog post per day last week! Maybe I went overboard? And that says nothing about their quality of course. Still, writing more + going through the past should help me focus my thoughts to help me figure out what I want for the upcoming year (aside from the to-be-expected wish for the end of the pandemic of course.) I&amp;rsquo;m not committed to daily posting, but let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can keep up the writing pace.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;December is almost upon us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an opportunity last week to take on some additional work, but on further reflection, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d pass on it. I am in general, averse to working during the Christmas season (that is to say, more so than during the entire year in general). Even back when I was working full-time, I&amp;rsquo;d prefer taking most of my leaves during December. It&amp;rsquo;s really a result of the terrible traffic in Metro Manila, which gets significantly worse during Christmas season, a trauma that lingers even when I&amp;rsquo;m home all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past week went by quickly. Not so much because of anything stressful or such, but more like there were a bunch of errands to be done. I also did a bunch of maintenance work for some of my smaller side projects (adding questions to the trivia bot, fixing some bugs in this site&amp;rsquo;s code, adding some minor features to some of my tracking stuff, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t been writing much lately, other than these weeknotes. Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve also found my thoughts wandering a lot and been having difficulty focusing on anything productive. I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel these things are related, and that I should be writing more to help me focus and get back into the habit of thinking better. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can get a few more blog posts out in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing much new. A new drop in the Civ6 New Frontier pass was released a couple of weeks ago, so I played a few Civ6 games this week to try things out. The new leader/civ (Hammurabi of Babylon) was pretty fun, kind of a unique experience, and I like the Heroes and Legends mode. I actually want to try the other new game modes added by the NFP recently, it&amp;rsquo;s just that Civ games always take so long, so it&amp;rsquo;s hard to fit them in when I have other single-player games I want to play. Steam Autumn sale is currently ongoing, but so far I have taken no damage (though I did let myself get billed for November&amp;rsquo;s humble choice). I kind of wanted to buy a couple of additional Switch games, but I might just start something on my very extensive Steam backlog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; I finished &lt;em&gt;Rhythm of War&lt;/em&gt;! Fun book, I may write a longer review, as I kind of regret not having a review for the previous book Oathbringer, as I had nothing to go back to as a bit of review before starting on Rhythm of War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt; I think I&amp;rsquo;ve only been watching more Perfect Strangers this week. Two more seasons to go! This also means I&amp;rsquo;m behind on the Mandalorian and Discovery, which means I risk spoilers lol. Should try to catch up this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward to:&lt;/strong&gt; December? Christmas? Not really, not so much, though it can&amp;rsquo;t hurt, but I&amp;rsquo;m counting the days until we are rid of this accursed plague year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;This week felt weird. It kind of went by quickly for me, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like anything important really happened. Its kind of like those moments in-between other events, where you&amp;rsquo;re just coasting along and waiting for the more significant things to happen. My country is still recovering from the storms of the past few weeks, Trump is still flailing around trying to overturn democracy, and our own president is still insecure when someone gets more attention than him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These moments feel fleeting, but they&amp;rsquo;re a pretty good time for some self-reflection. I probably need a bit more of that, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found my mind has been wandering through parallel universes lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; I pushed the post-game completion on Super Mario Odyssey, but I might just be at my limit. I have 7 moons remaining, and 5 of those are for minigames, and the last 2 are for the super frustrating Breakdown Road stage. All of these probably require a great deal more patience than I have available, so that might be it for me. Still, it was a great ride, and I&amp;rsquo;m proud I can even get this far given I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself great at platformers nowadays. Still looking around for a new single-player game to dig into, not sure if I want to do another platformer or look for an RPG or such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magic:&lt;/strong&gt; Still been drafting a bit of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgkld/&#34;&gt;Kaladesh Remastered&lt;/a&gt;, although it seems the draft format doesn&amp;rsquo;t like me very much. I&amp;rsquo;ve gone a single 5-3 and three 0-3s, so it&amp;rsquo;s pretty bad! Still, I can keep doing at least one draft a week until Kaldheim comes out next year I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Rhythm of War&lt;/em&gt;, fourth book in Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s Stormlight Archive came out this past week! I got a Kindle copy off Amazon and have been reading a few chapters every night. I&amp;rsquo;m about a third of the way through I think. The problem with this book is I didn&amp;rsquo;t do a re-read of the previous books (they&amp;rsquo;re pretty long!) so every few chapters I&amp;rsquo;m like &amp;ldquo;Who is this person again and why is she here?&amp;rdquo;. This is a typical problem for epic fantasy series like this, so I&amp;rsquo;ll probably have this same problem if/when GRRM manages to get &lt;em&gt;Winds of Winter&lt;/em&gt; out. (I think these two are the only unfinished fantasy series I&amp;rsquo;m still following.) I will say that Sanderson still writes quite well, and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this gets me back into the habit of reading regularly again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I caught up with the Mandalorian, pleasant surprise to see Katie Sackhoff around, apparently playing a character she voiced in Clone Wars (which I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen). Since I caught up with both Mandalorian and Discovery mid-season, now I have to wait every week for new episodes, like some kind of peasant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For my background binge watching, I found some old copies I had of Perfect Strangers, so I&amp;rsquo;ve burned through a few seasons of that already. I loved this series when it was on TV back when I was young. It&amp;rsquo;s not particularly deep; most episodes have the same plot of &amp;ldquo;Balki does/says something naive and/or Larry overreacts and gets them into trouble and hilarity ensures&amp;rdquo;, but it&amp;rsquo;s still fun, and has probably one of the best ever TV show opening themes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward to:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t know? US thanksgiving is next week, which is mainly relevant for me because there&amp;rsquo;s usually a bunch of gaming sales at the time, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything I&amp;rsquo;m particularly interested in yet. There&amp;rsquo;s also some family events coming up (my eldest niece&amp;rsquo;s birthday), but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to get excited about those since we can&amp;rsquo;t actually get together.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Weather this past week was very bad for those of us in Metro Manila (and many other places in Luzon). Howling winds and strong rains dominated for 2-3 days of the week due to typhoon Ulysses. This typhoon wasn&amp;rsquo;t as strong as Rolly a couple of weeks ago, but it seems that it brought a lot more rains, causing flooding and loss of power in a whole lot of places. Metro Manila was hit quite badly, even drawing comparisons to Ondoy back in 2009. Even up to today I&amp;rsquo;m still reading about a ton of people who need assistance, relief or rescue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fortunately got off relatively unscathed. The howling winds and pouring rain meant it was heard to sleep at some point, but we experienced no other bad effects and in fact were a bit more comfortable due to lower temps. Oh, and we still don&amp;rsquo;t have cable service until today, a minor inconvenience. A lot of my friends lost power and some in the more Northern provinces were subject to severe flooding as well. It also took us a couple of days to get in touch with some relatives on the southern side of Luzon, but it seems they are fine, power issues notwithstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; Still playing Super Mario Odyssey, hopefully to completion. Although given how difficult some of these minigames are for me, I&amp;rsquo;m not optimistic. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how close I can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magic:&lt;/strong&gt; Kaladesh Remastered is out on Arena! I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten started on a sealed and a draft, you can follow along via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgkld/&#34;&gt;MTGKLD tag&lt;/a&gt;, if you&amp;rsquo;d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Boys S2: Surprisingly the Boys kind of got a &amp;ldquo;good ending&amp;rdquo; this time, although there are still threats lurking around. I went back and reread the first Omnibus of the comic book after finishing the season, and the differences are really stark, as in the comics Butcher is really portrayed as a bastard, maybe even as much as Homelander, while in the series they&amp;rsquo;re pretty tame by comparison. Somehow a lot of the issues raised in this season feel topical too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star Trek Discovery S3: Season isn&amp;rsquo;t done yet, but I went ahead and got this started. It&amp;rsquo;s quite a trip. Discovery is charting an unknown future now in the Star Trek timeline, and there are a lot of fun moments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Queen&amp;rsquo;s Gambit: This Netflix limited series has been getting a lot of buzz so I decided to give it a go. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly good, in a sports anime kind of way.  It&amp;rsquo;s a testament to how good and realistic the portrayal of the 1960s chess scene is that for a while I thought it was based on a real-life chess prodigy. Apparently, the show is based on a novel instead, a well-researched one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misc:&lt;/strong&gt; In the starting-yet-another-side-project department, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with this library called the Dragonruby Game Toolkit, which I got from the itch.io Racial Justice bundle a while back. I tried building a simple platformer using a Kenney asset pack that I also got from the bundle. Here&amp;rsquo;s the WIP: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDRShB4psyU&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDRShB4psyU&lt;/a&gt;. I like that I can work with the framework using only my text editor (as compared to some big bulky IDE like Unity), and it&amp;rsquo;s fairly quick to start up, as it makes a lot of assumptions for you so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about things like screen resolution, screen coords, fps, etc. I don&amp;rsquo;t doubt that using Unity might have made the platforming physics a bit easier, but I did enjoy figuring things out on my own. Not sure if this is going anywhere, I&amp;rsquo;m mostly just dabbling with it at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trivia:&lt;/strong&gt; we actually won an online quiz this past week! Amazing. We had so much fun, we even went ahead and had our own internal 2-hour trivia quiz right after: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no0sYBcU5LA&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no0sYBcU5LA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward to:&lt;/strong&gt; I just found out that the next book in Sanderson&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Stormlight Archive&lt;/em&gt; is coming out next week! That&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a huge book, hopefully I can manage to finish it before year-end (so that I can at least get my books read stat for the year up a tiny bit)&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The World&lt;/strong&gt;: Somehow the week seemed to go by both quickly and agonizingly slowly, mostly because of the US presidential elections held this week. Slowly because after the initial burst of results on Tuesday night (US time), the remaining states&amp;rsquo; results trickled in very slowly. Quickly because much time was spent doomscrolling and refreshing election-related updates. I think the world collectively breathed a sigh of relief this weekend as the US networks finally called the race for former VP and now president-elect Joe Biden. Celebrations on the streets in many cities in the US, notably New York and Philadelphia. Trump still won&amp;rsquo;t concede and vows legal action, but that seems unlikely to go anywhere except make him look immature and pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biden isn&amp;rsquo;t even the best or most exciting candidate, and it&amp;rsquo;s still to be seen how he handles crises like the BLM and police brutality stuff and even healthcare, but at the very least the US will now have a coherent leader and hopefully will be able to address the pandemic better. I would guess that Harris as VP will ultimately end up the more historic win. But I imagine the celebrations are less about Biden winning and more about Trump losing. It must be weird to be a fanatic Trump supporter seeing all these people celebrating his loss. He still got a lot of votes - America remains a deeply divided nation, but at least under Biden there&amp;rsquo;s a chance of that being rectified at least a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have written a lot of words on this topic, considering I&amp;rsquo;m not an American. My stakes in this are a bit lower, but I still found myself glued to the ever-changing blue and red numbers. The US leadership affects the rest of the world of course, especially in terms of climate change and multilateralism moving forward, so it&amp;rsquo;s serious business. But I admit, I also enjoyed the drama and the memes. I had more than one chat groups where some of the members were living in the US, and let me tell you, they were super active during this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of all this drama has to be the whole &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-four-seasons-total-landscaping_n_5fa6e08bc5b6f21920dc14f7&#34;&gt;Four Seasons Total Landscaping&lt;/a&gt; brouhaha. Basically, Trump announced his lawyers would have a press conferencce at Four Seasons in Philadelphia, then later corrected himself saying it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the Four Seasons Hotel, but rather Four Seasons Total Landscaping. Basically a parking lot in an industrial area, next to a dildo shop. It smacks of incompetence and miscoordination of the highest order. It&amp;rsquo;s the kind of comedy that TV shows just can&amp;rsquo;t make up, proving indeed that reality can be stranger (and funnier) than fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump&amp;rsquo;s loss is a repudiation of his style of populist, lying leadership. I wish I could say I was as hopeful for similar positive change in my own country in two years, but that remains to be seen&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, back to my stuff lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Server migration update:&lt;/strong&gt; Today, I&amp;rsquo;ve closed my account at the old hosting provider, so there is no more turning back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; I started and finished Super Mario Odyssey! Just about a week, but that was main game only, finished with a bit over 400 moons. (I believe I can get up to 999 in the game?). Immediately proceeding into the post-game, since I only borrowed this game, so I want to get as close to completion as I can before I have to give it back. That being said, there are some moons gated behind annoying minigames like jump rope, RC racing, etc, which I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;d have the patience to grind through, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see. After Odyssey, I&amp;rsquo;ll take it easy on the Switch games for a little bit, though I am already considering getting either Fire Emblem or the new Paper Mario. Would be good to get back to an RPG after all these platformers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching Lately:&lt;/strong&gt; About halfway through The Boys season 2 now. More thoughts when I finish I guess? I thought about watching a Sean Connery James Bond flick when he died this week, but neither Netflix nor Prime had any, sadface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got a new pair of glasses last Wednesday, but up to today my eyes still feel like they are adjusting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not start Nanowrimo. I started trying something else instead, not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s gonna go anywhere though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing I was anxious about last week never pushed through. I should care less about things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward to:&lt;/strong&gt; Kaladesh Remastered comes out next week on Arena, so there&amp;rsquo;s that!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now:&lt;/strong&gt; Stormy weekend here in Manila. Supposedly the &amp;ldquo;strongest storm of 2020&amp;rdquo; so far, typhoon Rolly made landfall earlier today and is currently battering many of the provinces south of Metro Manila. Storm signals are as high as number 5. As of this writing, weather is currently cold and nippy but not particularly rainy where I am. We expect stronger winds and rain to hit us as evening approaches as well. On top of everything, a second typhoon has entered the PH area of responsibility and is expected to affect us over the next couple of days as well. If those two typhoons get together, it may be very bad. Hoping for the best. (I thought about doing these weeknotes end of day&amp;hellip; but we might lose power, so here we go.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Server migration update:&lt;/strong&gt; Migrating the final domain now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; I finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1322214646221205504/&#34;&gt;Link&amp;rsquo;s Awakening!&lt;/a&gt; Full heart and seashell completion even! It was fun and a great throwback to classic games like Link to the Past. I never played the original on Gameboy, though maybe that&amp;rsquo;s for the best, as I liked how this one looked and my memory is not tainted by nostalgia over GB graphics. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a particularly long game, especially compared to other Zeldas, but there is a custom dungeon feature (new to this remake) which probably adds some replay value, though I don&amp;rsquo;t have much interest in it at the moment. On to Super Mario Odyssey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; I did terribly at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/11/review-eternal/&#34;&gt;Eternal Card Game&lt;/a&gt; worlds LCQ, but I must admit their current celebration promo was super effective in getting me back into the game, as I&amp;rsquo;m now doing daily grinds in both Eternal and Magic Arena again. I managed to hit Mythic in Magic Arena before month end, but didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough time for Eternal, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can keep it up next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying games of &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/965580/Root/&#34;&gt;Root&lt;/a&gt; with the Saturday gaming group. It&amp;rsquo;s a multifaction boardgame where each faction plays differently and has different ways of scoring victory points, and the factions will naturally clash with each other. The main challenge is finding a fine balance between advancing your agenda and interfering with the others. Disrupting the other factions might lose you some momentum compared to the others, but if no one keeps the others in check, someone might run away with victory! Pretty fun. And given that the game supports asynchronous games (up to 3 days per turn), the term &amp;ldquo;Saturday gaming group&amp;rdquo; is a bit obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Done:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober2020&#34;&gt;the Inktober thing&lt;/a&gt;! I managed to get through the whole thing without missing a day! Doing daily drawings with a pen are hard for me, given my poor manual dexterity at this age (and it was never that good in the first place). My hands got tired so easily, and a lot of my lines were shaky. Still, I enjoyed doing a lot of the sketches, and while I don&amp;rsquo;t want to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2016/03/sketching-daily/&#34;&gt;commit to daily drawings&lt;/a&gt; again (at least for now), maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll warm up the old Apple Pencil every so often and do some digital stuff? Maybe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt; I finished Season 4 of The Expanse. I didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy it as much as the first 3 seasons, though the second half was better than the first. Things were ramping up too slowly, and a lot of things didn&amp;rsquo;t seem relevant to the what was going on with the Roci crew (and turned out to be mostly geared towards next season&amp;rsquo;s big crisis apparently?). As I said to a friend, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m here for the scifi protomolecule stuff not OPA terrorist or earth politics BS.&amp;rdquo; Still, looking forward to the next season. Also: Finished five seasons of NCIS (that&amp;rsquo;s all they had on Prime Video). In the queue: The Boys S2, Star Trek Discovery S3, Mandalorian S2. Where&amp;rsquo;s my Orville?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skipped:&lt;/strong&gt; Hacktoberfest. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considering:&lt;/strong&gt; Nanowrimo. Haven&amp;rsquo;t done any prep, so if ever it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a late start. I do have some ideas rolling around in my head, but I also have some other stuff to do, so for now let&amp;rsquo;s say this is &amp;ldquo;low probability&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxiety:&lt;/strong&gt; Low, most of it due to awaiting a call back about something that hasn&amp;rsquo;t pushed through yet, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really need? Why am I anxious about it then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Random:&lt;/strong&gt; This storm reminded me of my worst typhoon experience in Metro Manila, Ondoy back in 2009, so I wrote a short &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2009/09/ondoy/&#34;&gt;back-dated retrospective on it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad luck:&lt;/strong&gt; The hinge on one side of my glasses&amp;rsquo; frame broke while I was at the cashier at the grocery yesterday! D: I have a slightly older pair I can use in the meantime, but it&amp;rsquo;ll probably be a few days before I can even go to get a real replacement, given the storm and the long weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward to:&lt;/strong&gt; the US presidential elections, with a mix of morbid dread and anticipation, like an onlooker at a car crash.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Server migration update: I had encountered some trouble with the Travis-CI -based Hugo build generating this here website last week. Luckily, most of the migration work to the new backend was already done, so I went ahead and switched over the servers. So this site is no longer plain-old deployed HTML, but rather powered by a Django backend. The site should be mostly the same, though I did take the opportunity to move some stuff around. There&amp;rsquo;s probably some bugs floating around, and maybe some secrets even. Probably need a longer blog post writing about the migration itself, though it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too complicated. I also have a bunch of notes about the server setup that I&amp;rsquo;ll also carve into a blog post when I have time. Things should be mostly done for this site, but I have one other domain I have to migrate, and I have scheduled that for the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that hopefully all my apps/domains will be on the new server after the first week of November. My account at the old webhost is paid until Nov 15th, and I&amp;rsquo;ve already indicated I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to migrate to whatever new system they have, so it&amp;rsquo;s just in time I think. Hoping things go smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming: I did &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1318238520251621377/&#34;&gt;the 120 stars &amp;ldquo;completion&amp;rdquo; for Super Mario Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;, although that&amp;rsquo;s really more like half of actual completion. I put down the Switch for a few days after that to cool down on it for a bit, as I have been playing it a lot since I got it. Still deciding whether to play Odyssey next or try Link&amp;rsquo;s Awakening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming: I haven&amp;rsquo;t played &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/11/review-eternal/&#34;&gt;Eternal Card Game&lt;/a&gt; in months, which meant falling behind on the collection as new sets came out and such. But they&amp;rsquo;re running an event right now where all accounts have access to all cards, and there are qualifiers for their worlds event. I figured why not and gave it a shot, running a deck I got from their recent tournaments, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1319794495395745793/&#34;&gt;managed to qualify for the LCQ on my first try&lt;/a&gt;. Eternal has always been a fun game, but the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve preferred playing on MTG Arena. The timing of this Eternal event was pretty nice, as it came up just after Arena got a patch that severely downgraded the UX, with bugs being reported everywhere and general laggy performance. The Eternal client was, as always, snappy and had no issues. Arena dev team needs to get their act together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still ongoing: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober2020&#34;&gt;the Inktober thing&lt;/a&gt;. Still haven&amp;rsquo;t missed a day! This week is the final stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not ongoing: Hacktoberfest. I mentioned before that I was planning to do it, but&amp;hellip; I haven&amp;rsquo;t. Less than a week to go, so doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem likely I can get into it, especially since other things have come up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my current webhost finally decided to give me a deadline, the long and short of it is that my new server needs to be ready by December the 9th, giving me a bit under a month to get things in order. I&amp;rsquo;m already in the middle of setting up the new server, so I think I&amp;rsquo;ll be ready by early November anyway. Most of the code to run the new blog is also mostly ready (who knows how many bugs there are though!) I am (re-)learning a lot about server setups though, so hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll have quite a few blog posts to write the migration is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching lately: Mostly old NCIS seasons still, and I&amp;rsquo;m just past the halfway point on The Expanse season 4. Slow going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to November, and am awaiting the outcome of the US presidential elections with morbid interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaming: Hey, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1317023064555548672/&#34;&gt;finished Super Mario Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;! There&amp;rsquo;s 15 post-game stars only available after beating the game, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to work through them before moving on to Odyssey, alhough some of them are quite stressful. (Apparently there&amp;rsquo;s an entire 120 stars again afterwards in some kind of second quest, but I figure I can come back to that some other time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still ongoing: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober2020&#34;&gt;the Inktober thing&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s surprising that I haven&amp;rsquo;t missed a day yet. (Hopefully I haven&amp;rsquo;t jinxed it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching lately: I&amp;rsquo;ve taken to having old seasons of NCIS running in the background (via Prime Video) recently, they&amp;rsquo;re the sort of show you can just leave running while you&amp;rsquo;re doing other things, and if you miss something it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. I also started on Expanse season 4, but that requires more focused watching so the going is slow. I have some backlog to work through, since The Boys season 2 and Star Trek Discovery season 3 are both out now.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The world continues to be terrible. The PH government wants people to get back to work and everything to spur the economy (with health precautions and everything). A lot of people have no choice, but I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate enough to not have to go out there yet, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure people like me will still hold back. This all would have been a lot easier if the government had gotten control of this pandemic early on but it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still not writing blog posts apparently. I have a lot of thoughts swirling in my head, I&amp;rsquo;m sure they&amp;rsquo;ll pop out sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming: Hey, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1314224120490389504/&#34;&gt;finished Super Mario Sunshine&lt;/a&gt;! I started Super Mario Galaxy right afterwards. It&amp;rsquo;s actually interesting playing through these 3d Mario games for the first time, since I can see how things evolve. Will hopefully have some good thoughts for the eventual review, probably after I also play Odyssey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still ongoing: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober2020&#34;&gt;the Inktober thing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still ongoing: The site rewrite project. It&amp;rsquo;s going reasonably well, and might be ready soonish (famous last words), so I started looking into the new server as well. I&amp;rsquo;ve also mentioned before that I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/03/rip-webfaction/&#34;&gt;migrate to a new webhost because GoDaddy etc.&lt;/a&gt;, and I had been leaning towards getting a VPS on Linode so I tried to do that this week, but for some reason they kept rejecting my application, so I just went with DigitalOcean instead. They give free two months $100 credit, so I&amp;rsquo;m not paying for anything until December or such, so that&amp;rsquo;s nice. I spent a couple of hours wrangling with Nginx + uWSGI + my app on Ubuntu, with permission problems and everything. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll figure it out eventually!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some recent fun things on the internet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Toadsanime/status/1312880060899233797&#34;&gt;Twitter thread about free indie games&lt;/a&gt;. Not like I have time to play all of these, but I find it fun to browse these lists and fantasize about my lifelong dream of being an indie game developer that I still hope to eventually get back to someday (why not today)? Anyway, check them out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vulture.com/article/most-influential-best-scenes-animation-history.html&#34;&gt;100 Sequences that shaped animations&lt;/a&gt;. Some fun history of animation stuff to go through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBpxhfBlVLU&#34;&gt;Why do mirrors flip horizontally but not vertically?&lt;/a&gt;(Youtube video). I always have trouble explaining this, so this one was nice to watch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.playstation.com/2020/10/07/ps5-teardown-an-inside-look-at-our-most-transformative-console-yet/&#34;&gt;Sony released a PS5 teardown video&lt;/a&gt;. My biggest takeaway from this is that this console is HUGE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the news this week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donald Trump, who for some reason is still the US president, has tested positive for Covid19, adding even more chaos and uncertainty to the US election season. The rest of the world has no choice but to pay attention, given how much US politics affects the rest of us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Philippines is now #20 worldwide in total Covid cases, yay! Yay?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some drama about the PH congress leadership? IDK, whatever man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annoyingly, I&amp;rsquo;ve not been doing any blog posts other than these weeknotes during the past few weeks. It is what it is though. I guess I haven&amp;rsquo;t really had time for longer writing things lately?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; busy, but the I have felt busy during the past week. Part of it is probably becaause I&amp;rsquo;ve started &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober2020&#34;&gt;doing the Inktober thing&lt;/a&gt;, so that&amp;rsquo;s an additional daily task. Another part of it is probably the fact that I purchased a Nintendo Switch last week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, gaming then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the aforementioned Nintendo Switch. I got Super Mario 3D All Stars and Link&amp;rsquo;s Awakening together with the purchase. I originally wanted to get Mario Odyssey, Fire Emblem and Paper Mario as well, but I figured two games (really four) was plenty for a first set, and my brother was going to lend me Odyssey anyway. I started playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/09/1310497720117784577/&#34;&gt;Mario 64&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not too far in, but I found the camera really problematic, and I can&amp;rsquo;t play it for too long without getting dizzy. I also started playing Super Mario Sunshine, which was a noticeable improvement camera-wise, and I can play it for extended periods without dizziness problems, so I&amp;rsquo;m quite a bit farther along there. I hope to get back to Mario 64 eventually, but it&amp;rsquo;s no big loss if I don&amp;rsquo;t. I understand it&amp;rsquo;s a classic game a lot of people look back fondly on, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s aged well, and not just because of camera problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also tried the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1311655542008377346/&#34;&gt;free Super Mario 35 battle royale game&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s reasonably fun, although when you&amp;rsquo;re at the last 2-3 players, it takes a while to get to a winner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally managed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1311602939891535872/&#34;&gt;hit the 7 wins in Zendikar Rising draft&lt;/a&gt;! Standard is still terrible though. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll just play 1 draft a week and that&amp;rsquo;s it? The MTG community was also in an uproar the past few weeks, both due to the poor state of standard and due to some controversy over an upcoming Secret Lair crossover with The Walking Dead. WOTC has implied they are looking at expanding Magic mechanics to other IPs, so the TWD thing is mostly a trial balloon, I think. Many people are upset and are predicting the death of Magic, but the game has been pronounced dead before. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens. I&amp;rsquo;m not personally affected (since I don&amp;rsquo;t Commander), my primary concern is the health of Standard formats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday gaming group picked up a new multiplayer game, it&amp;rsquo;s Root, from Leder Games (and published for digital by Dire Wolf, creators of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/&#34;&gt;Eternal&lt;/a&gt;). It&amp;rsquo;s reasonably complicated, and thematically and mechanically quite different from the last digital boardgame we were doing (Blood Rage).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned last week that I was planning to participate in &lt;a href=&#34;https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/&#34;&gt;Hacktoberfest&lt;/a&gt;. I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet, and there was some controversy over the past few weeks, with OSS maintainers complaining about spam PRs due to the event. Apparently, it was the fault of a Youtube who had a few hundred thousand followers. He had made a video showing how easy it was to make PRs and win the event swag, and a lot of people were following his low effort examples. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;ll still participate, though I have been looking around a few repos here and there, we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, I haven&amp;rsquo;t watched anything of note the past week. A couple of standup specials on Netflix, that&amp;rsquo;s it. I guess the Switch took most of my entertainment time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IFTTT, a service I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/01/ifttt/&#34;&gt;been using for a while now&lt;/a&gt;, has &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/10/1312652625511280640/&#34;&gt;obnoxiously been insisting I upgrade to their Pro tier&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;rsquo;re going to start severely restricting free accounts, so I&amp;rsquo;m looking to minimize my usage of the service moving forward. All of the social media syndication stuff can be handled by the new blog backend I&amp;rsquo;m writing, so that&amp;rsquo;s fine. The only things that should remain are stuff I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked into automating myself yet, mainly backing up of SMS, so I&amp;rsquo;ll probably look into that soonish. I&amp;rsquo;m not against paying for services, but in this case it&amp;rsquo;s simply not worth it for me, since I can trivially write my own replacement software for most of my usage of the service. So long IFTTT, it&amp;rsquo;s been swell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no closing words of wisdom today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;October is imminent! There are two distractions I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to in the coming month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober/&#34;&gt;Inktober&lt;/a&gt;, which I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing since 2016. Basically it&amp;rsquo;s just to do 30 ink drawings in October, one per day. There are some &lt;a href=&#34;https://inktober.com/rules&#34;&gt;official prompts&lt;/a&gt;, which I&amp;rsquo;ll probably follow. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really done any serious &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/albums/sketchbook&#34;&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt; in a while, maybe this will help me get back into the groove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second one is &lt;a href=&#34;https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/&#34;&gt;Hacktoberfest&lt;/a&gt;! Basically it&amp;rsquo;s an event where you have to submitted some number of GitHub PRs in October, and there&amp;rsquo;s some swag for people who finished. I last &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/02/hacktoberfest/&#34;&gt;participated in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, skipped last year because I was a bit busy. I have a bit more free time this year, so hopefully I can get into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these are welcome distractions, as the world continues to suck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past week, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the Django-based rewrite for my personal site (this one!). It&amp;rsquo;s one of those projects where I find myself being productive not because of deadlines or anything like that, but because I genuinely enjoy working on it. When I find myself thinking of of new things that need to be done, or a new feature, or a way to solve an interesting problem, I am cursed (blessed?) with restlessness until I get it done. There are a number of challenges with the way I chose to approach this problem, most probably the subject of a future blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned this before, but I went ahead and paid for a year of the Micro plan on Migadu.com. The email in/out limits aren&amp;rsquo;t that high, but the price is decent, and I don&amp;rsquo;t really use my personal email that much anyway (I&amp;rsquo;m no spammer!). I&amp;rsquo;ll re-evaluate next year whether I want to migrate. (Sets a calendar event.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve watched this past week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went ahead and watched the second season of Umbrella Academy. It&amp;rsquo;s more or less structured like the first season: each member has their own problems; five discovers an upcoming apocalypse, so he tries to bring everyone together; also, there&amp;rsquo;s people who want to kill them. The ending of this is more satisfying than S1 though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enola Holmes on Netflix. It was ok, but it&amp;rsquo;s more of a young adult story, maybe a bit above the Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming this past week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;managed to get in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgznr/&#34;&gt;couple more Zendikar Rising drafts&lt;/a&gt;. Fun format, but I continue to have a terrible record, with only one draft actually going well. I did get a refund for that last one, so let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can&amp;rsquo;t do better this coming week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;additional drop on the Civ6 New Frontier pass came out, giving us Gaul and Byzantium. A friend and I tried it in a multiplayer game. I played Byz and he went with Gaul; we only played for a couple of hours, but both new civs seem quite powerful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my SC2 group managed to finish the Wings of Liberty coop campaign! Pretty fun, and it was fun to relive the story too, as I had already forgotten a lot of it. We started the Heart of the Swarm version the next day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday gaming group have been playing Blood Rage over the past few months, and it even came out with a new DLC/expansion a couple of weeks ago. The game client is a bit buggy, but we tolerate it because it&amp;rsquo;s a fun/deep game anyway. We&amp;rsquo;re looking at maybe trying out a different game next week though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trivia was meh this week, the topics weren&amp;rsquo;t really to our liking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I purchased last month&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription&#34;&gt;Humble Choice&lt;/a&gt; (or rather, let it lapse into purchase). It&amp;rsquo;s not unreasonable, there&amp;rsquo;s some games there I can try like Forager and Evoland, and given my recent streak of Mario playing, I was wanting a platformer for the PC, so Yooka Layle isn&amp;rsquo;t a bad idea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Late-breaking Sunday news: I have kind of impulse bought a Nintendo Switch. Well, I was agonizing over it for a while, but stores were selling it just a bit overpriced. Today I found that there was a slight price drop (around $40 worth) of the Labo bundle at one of my local stores, so I impulsively went ahead and ordered it. Maybe should have waited a day or so? regardless, it&amp;rsquo;s on the way, along with Zelda: Link&amp;rsquo;s Awakening and Super Mario 3D All Stars. No interest in the Labo personally, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll try to sell it off?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried using Messenger Rooms for a family conf call today, in lieu of Zoom which limits us to 40-minute calls. Might have been bad luck or poor internet, but the experience was substantially worse. Disconnections, lag, poor video quality, etc. We&amp;rsquo;ll see if they want to switch back to Zoom next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems weird that we are so close to the end of 2020 now. Still no idea what Christmas is going to look like. I&amp;rsquo;m sure many other people are also looking forward to closing out 2020 and going to 2021, even though that holds no logical promise of things being better than they are now. But we can always dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine this is already the 3rd week of September, it feels like the month is passing by quickly, although I haven&amp;rsquo;t been particularly busy recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did do some paid work this past week; not a lot, just filling in to provide some emergency support/consultation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the reason it feels like the week passed by quickly is that I started a new side project (like many programmers, I am afflicted by the curse of wanting to start too many side projects). This one will probably get finished: I&amp;rsquo;m writing a Django based server for this website. I am generally happy with the current Hugo workflow I use for publishing things here, but the build times have struggled with the sheer number of posts I have. This started back when I decided to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/10/archive-of-my-own/&#34;&gt;start importing my social media activity to this site&lt;/a&gt;, which increased the post count from a couple of thousand to more than twenty thousand now. Even the automated builds take forever, and I can&amp;rsquo;t even run the local Hugo build on my laptop due to too many open files error on Mac. And Hugo is already one of the faster static site generators, so I have doubt that other SSGs would be able to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I briefly considered moving back to Wordpress, but that seems like a step back. I also briefly considered writing a new backend using a new programming language like Rust, giving me an opportunity to learn something new as well. But I kind of needed to get this done quickly, given that I have a pending server migration within the next couple of months; it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary, but it would be nice to have the new system up in place by the time I do that, so that all the migration happens in one go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still generally happy with the workflow of writing using my local editor and pushing markdown files to git, so I plan to retain that. The Django webapp will have a database, but that will be a secondary data structure used mainly for indexing and searches. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be some kind of weird file system/database storage, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how that goes. Anyway, probably more details on all that when I am ready to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching this past week: I finished both seasons of Cobra Kai. The series is decent. I&amp;rsquo;m here mostly for the Karate Kid nostalgia and the Lawrence/LaRusso rivalry. Season two had a lot of high school drama, which I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too interested in, so I liked the first season a lot more. Will still probably watch S3 when it comes out on Netflix. Now to figure out what to watch next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming this past week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zendikar Rising is out on Magic Arena! I&amp;rsquo;ve already played a couple of drafts, but things didn&amp;rsquo;t go as well as I hoped, so now I am poor, will probably be able to draft again in a couple of days. Hopefully I get better at this format, as I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to draft this set a lot; posts on these should be under &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgznr/&#34;&gt;the mtgznr tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t play much else this week other than the regular multiplayer games with the gaming groups SC2, Blood Rage, etc. I have yet to find a new game to knock off the backlog. I have also been considering trying out some of the smaller indie games in my collection, and maybe streaming some let&amp;rsquo;s play/reviews for them, as a bit of support for indie game devs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this week was the much awaited PS5 announcement, with pricing and release dates and everything! The $499 price tag is reasonable, but I probably won&amp;rsquo;t be getting one on launch, since there&amp;rsquo;s not a lot of games I want immediately. I will admit to getting a bit excited at the FF16 reveal, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably a ways off. I&amp;rsquo;m probably more likely to get a Switch first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trivia team put up a new chaotic video of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U52L9c2kB8M&#34;&gt;us playing some trivia&lt;/a&gt;. Check it out, like, subscribe, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big news from the other side of the pacific is that US SC Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has died. &amp;ldquo;No no no&amp;rdquo; was trending on Twitter for a little bit, and a lot of people on my timeline were swearing. I had a short discussion with some friends living on the west coast about it. Many of my US friends also have some level of anxiety/worry about what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen during/after their elections. It&amp;rsquo;s actually annoying how informed I am about US politics, although it doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect me directly. Like it or not though, the US further sliding into single-party autocracy will likely be bad for the rest of the world, so let&amp;rsquo;s all hope they get their shit together.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It has certainly been a week, yes it has. The world continues to turn (and burn even).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy. Not so much with work, though there was a bit of that due to a required emergency software change (aren&amp;rsquo;t they always emergencies?). I wasn&amp;rsquo;t doing the emergency work myself, more like consulting and advising how to approach it, so not much to tell there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did quite a bit of work on my personal data processes/backups/workflows. It involved streamlining my backups, dedepulication, going through old records and cleaning them up, and so on. Some combination of Python scripts and manual work was required. One specific thing I did was to get a whole bunch of my old photos out of Google Photos and onto disk backups, and also had to do some deduplication there. I was able to remove around 1300 duplicates from over 12000 photos, so around 10% ish duplication rate, not too bad. My original intent was to remove them from Google Photos, dedupe, then add them back, but now I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure I need to add them back. The main advantage of Google Photos has been that they make the photos more searchable, but I don&amp;rsquo;t seem to have an urgent need for that anyway, and probably there are other ways to do that? I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll look into it when the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also been browsing some old (physical) albums stored around the house. There&amp;rsquo;s another few thousand photos there, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of eventually digitizing them, as a means of backup, but that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work, so maybe in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming was good again this week. I finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/09/uncharted4/&#34;&gt;Uncharted 4&lt;/a&gt;! I guess any week where I manage to tick something off the backlog is a good week. Last weekend I mentioned I was near the end, that was so untrue lol. Turned out more than half the game was still to come. My SC2 buddies and I started to play this 3-player coop version of the Wings of Liberty campaign (avaiable as custom arcade things), that&amp;rsquo;s been fun. Then the usual stuff: Blood Rage with the Saturday group. Quiz nights/codenames with the trivia team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kind of want to get into SFV again, presumably there&amp;rsquo;s a flood of new players coming in recently since it was free on PS+ this past month, so hopefully it won&amp;rsquo;t be so hard to find matches this time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My desire for a Nintendo Switch is being tempered by two things at the moment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rumors of a new, upgraded Switch coming out next year. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the first time that I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased a console just before it&amp;rsquo;s successor came out though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;frustration at the difficulty of the special stages in Super Mario 3D Land lol. It&amp;rsquo;s a stark reminder that I&amp;rsquo;m getting old and I&amp;rsquo;m not as good at these games as I used to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this week, I binged four seasons of Superstore. It&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable enough ensemble comedy, though it&amp;rsquo;s no Brooklyn Nine Nine. A lot of the characters&amp;rsquo; problems are of their own making due to selfishness, that&amp;rsquo;s always annoying. But it&amp;rsquo;s good enough for side-watching while I&amp;rsquo;m doing other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also started watching Cobra Kai, not even halfway through the first season yet. It&amp;rsquo;s slightly painful, since it casts Johnny Lawrence as the POV character/protagonist, and he&amp;rsquo;s kind of a loser asshole, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My desktop PC seems to be showing it&amp;rsquo;s age. It&amp;rsquo;s like recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been hitting 100% CPU and/or RAM much more often. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried uninstalling some unneeded software, hopefully that helps. I got this PC back in 2015, so it&amp;rsquo;s not unreasonable that I might need an upgrade soon, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I want to spend that money yet. I&amp;rsquo;m kind of hoping it can still hold on for a few years still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same thoughts for the rest of the world, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s September! The last six months were a blur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s considered &amp;ldquo;Christmas season&amp;rdquo; over here already I guess. The local memes are that once the clock hits midnight between Aug 31 and Sep 1, your neighbor&amp;rsquo;s Christmas lights are magically up. Also of course the famous Jose Mari Chan gets famous starting September, since malls and stores love to play his Christmas songs during this time. IDK what to expect for Christmas season this year though, since we are still in a pandemic. I keep telling my mom not to get her hopes up that we (i.e. my brothers and their families) will all be able to get together as tradition dictates. It&amp;rsquo;s possible, but I&amp;rsquo;m not optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My week was kinda busy. Not really in terms of work, but in terms of&amp;hellip; high school stuff, I guess? My high school batch hosted our 25th year alumni homecoming this past weekend. Since we were unlucky enough to have it in the middle of the pandemic, it was an online-only affair, with presentations and raffles and whatnot. And a quiz night! A lot of my batchmates did a lot more work, my participation was mostly limited to some tech stuff, since I had access to the database of registrants for the raffle, and also representing the batch at the Pisay Quiz Night held online. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only PQN team member, I was just the one assigned to join the zoom and show the whiteboard; I was drafted against my will due to my past quiz night experience. My other batchmates were supporting me from a Discord, I basically streamed the Zoom call to them via Discord (which is really troublesome, always has tech issues) and they fed me possible answers etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting my PQN participation to take too much time, but there was like a tech rehearsal and a dry run before the event proper, to make sure everything worked well and that all the team got it, plus my team also got together a couple of times for &amp;ldquo;practice.&amp;rdquo; I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to take it seriously, as with all online quiz nights I&amp;rsquo;m mostly there for the fun since it&amp;rsquo;s super likely for at least some people on some teams to be googling their answers lol. The PQN is super competitive though, I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s to be expected given the nature of Pisay. We didn&amp;rsquo;t win, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the final scores yet, but I guess that we finished around middle of the pack among the 22 teams, but we had a good time (more or less!) and it was fun hanging out with the batchmates virtually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming this week was pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/09/1301222471568297984/&#34;&gt;and finished Disco Elysium&lt;/a&gt; during the first half of the week. Fantastic game, and I was probably unhealthily engrossed in it for like 2-3 days. I was so into the whole mystery thing, when the game warned me that I was at a critical point and that proceeding further would end other sidequests, I just created a save and pushed to the finish anyway. I went back later to load and finish the other side stuff. It&amp;rsquo;s the kind of game you&amp;rsquo;d enjoy if you like getting your Speech skill to 100 in Fallout. It&amp;rsquo;s very well-written and had some really great/shocking moments. Since it has very little actual &amp;ldquo;action&amp;rdquo; aside from delving inside the MC&amp;rsquo;s thoughts, I understand that it&amp;rsquo;s not for everybody, but it&amp;rsquo;s certainly a worthwhile experience. I thought about writing a full review post, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll save that for when/if I manage full achievement completion (looks tough!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after getting distracted by Disco Elysium, I went ahead and resumed my Uncharted 4 game. I think I&amp;rsquo;m close to the end on this one, should finish it this coming week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;already half way through the Super Mario 3D Land special worlds. Speaking of Mario, Nintendo announced a bunch of new Mario releases for the Switch this past week, which significantly increases my want for a Switch. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how long I can hold off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;still playing my regular games with the playgroups: Starcraft 2 Coop, Blood Rage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it&amp;rsquo;s September, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing my regularly quarterly data backups/exports. One of them is Google Takeout. The last one was back in April, and that last export was 27 chunks (they split it into 2GB or less chunks). The new one is 44 chunks! I suspect the huge increase is because I&amp;rsquo;ve been streaming on Twitch and exporting them to Youtube, so they&amp;rsquo;re probably part of this current export. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even export everything this time, since I don&amp;rsquo;t need to re-export data from those services I&amp;rsquo;m no longer using. One of my ongoing projects is reducing my Google footprint, so I need to figure out how to get the size of this export down.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This last week was weird. I feel like I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get much done in terms of productivity, yet I don&amp;rsquo;t feel I was unproductive. A very relaxed and chill week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again a tiny bit of work done this past week, some fixes, including to side projects. I also spent some time preparing for some events next weekend. Although I wasn&amp;rsquo;t productive this week, I did outline a bit of a roadmap of new features for one of my side projects, hopefully I can get into that in the coming weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still in a pandemic! But I did have my first dine-in meal at a restaurant last Monday. It was because I went to get blood drawn for routine medical reasons, and I had needed to skip breakfast for the test (spoiler: my blood sugar levels were very, very normal). So after getting the blood drawn I was super hungry and decided to have breakfast at the nearby Pancake House. I was the only customer since it was super early (and you know, pandemic), although a second guy came in after I had given my order. I almost subconsciously picked up the glass of water to sip from it as soon as it was served, luckily I remembered I was wearing a face mask and a face shield. I decided to hold off on removing the gear until the actual pancakes were served, to minimize the exposure time. The next day I also decided to have a snack at a Starbucks after running some errands, mainly because I had a free coffee from Globe Rewards. It was afternoon so there were a few other customers there. The cashier said it was ok to dine in, but for a maximum of one hour only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a longish post I was writing, but it felt too raw to publish and might break it up into smaller posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We actually managed to win an online quiz night this week! It&amp;rsquo;s been a while, good job trivia team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels great to no longer be following the covid19 stats regularly, even though they are still fairly terrible. UP experts are projecting that we get the reproduction rate to below 1 in like a month though, so that&amp;rsquo;s some good news, though we may still be a ways away from getting this under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching and playing the past week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still playing a lot of SC2 Coop, trying to unlock the new prestiges. Levelling the commanders again can be a pain, but at least they managed to provide new goals/objectives for the players, breathing back a bunch of life into this game mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still drafting Amonkhet Remastered, although the last few drafts haven&amp;rsquo;t gone well. Need to save up gems, so I&amp;rsquo;ll do one last one draft once I get enough gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Huh, I guess I kind of paused Uncharted 4 for most of the week, not sure why. I should get back to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started re-playing Super Mario 3D Land (on the 3DS) lately, mostly to stave off my desire to get a Nintendo Switch (prices are still inflated here due to supply issues!). I had forgotten a lot about this game, so even when I finished the first 8 worlds and rescued Princess Peach, I was pleasantly surprised to find there were another 8 &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; worlds to play!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watched the video game history documentary &lt;strong&gt;High Score&lt;/strong&gt; on Netflix. Pretty good, although there&amp;rsquo;s some Dragon Quest erasure going on in the RPG episode!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watched &lt;strong&gt;Bill and Ted Face the Music&lt;/strong&gt;, this was a most excellent sequel. I found the start a bit clunky (I always find it awkward watching characters be awkward), but the rest of it was a fun and sweet adventure that echoed elements of both of the first two movies. A lot of the time travel stuff didn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense if you sat down and thought about it, but I was smiling through a lot of it. Little Billie and Theda are great!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also watched &lt;strong&gt;Superman: Man of Tomorrow&lt;/strong&gt;, the first entry in the new DC animated universe (following the reboot at the end of Justice League Dark: Apokolips). Yet another Superman origin story here. Not too happy with this one. Not fond of the animated style, and the writing and plot seemed weird at many points. I felt like there could have been a better way to resolve the whole situation with the big bad that felt more &amp;ldquo;Superman&amp;rdquo;-like, and the movie doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to earn the monicker &amp;ldquo;Man of Tomorrow&amp;rdquo; for the hero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for one reason or another, I also ended up watching a few standup specials on Amazon Prime. A couple from Craig Ferguson, and one from Jimmy Yang.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cobra Kai is now on Netflix! Yet another thing to add to the ever-increasing backlog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some tech stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have about three months left on my Webfaction hosting, which I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/03/rip-webfaction/&#34;&gt;been planning to migrate away from&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m currently leaning towards getting a cheap $5/mo VPS from Linode, although I&amp;rsquo;m still willing to accept any recommendations. Switching to a VPS means more effort (since it won&amp;rsquo;t be a managed service anymore), but that should provide some learning opportunities. It&amp;rsquo;s just as well anyway, my apps have been pushing the memory limits on the current hosting, and even the cheapest Linode VPS provides more RAM.  I&amp;rsquo;ll probably start looking into the migration in September.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote before about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/gmail-migration/&#34;&gt;migrating away from GMail&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Migadu.com&amp;rsquo;s free tier for about half a year now. This past week, they wrote that they are sunsetting the free tier. Totally understandable, given the economy. They are also introducing a new Micro tier at $20 a year, with slightly better limits than the old free tier, so I may migrate to that near the end of September (when the free tier runs out). In theory, I could just try to run a mail server on whatever VPS I set up (see above bullet), but that&amp;rsquo;s a big hassle. This cost + the $5/mo for the VPS is still less than what I was paying for at Webfaction, so I don&amp;rsquo;t mind paying for this for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was notified by a local bank that their old web platform is being sunsetted and I needed to migrate to the new system, so I did that. But whenever I tried the migration steps, the process never completed, it just kept telling me it was processing. I finally had to message someone I knew on the dev team lol. Hopefully it can getr resolved next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The week after I posted about phoning in the weeknotes, here I am with one where there&amp;rsquo;s nothing much to report. Not that surprising, given how busy I was over the previous few weeks, I took the opportunity to take a more relaxing week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a bit of work to be done, but very miniscule by comparison. Minor fixes here and there, including to some side projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did get to write on the blog more, as expected. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope I can keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These week&amp;rsquo;s quiz nights were terrible for our team, but on the bright side, I got to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/08/quiz-night-sketches/&#34;&gt;do a couple of sketches&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching and playing the past week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continued drafting Amonkhet Remastered, although the last few drafts went a bit poorly. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/mtgakr/&#34;&gt;mtgakr tag&lt;/a&gt; on this site has all the records.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After finishing D:OS2 and FF7R, I looked around for a new game to start and decided on Uncharted 4, which I guess I got free from Plus or something. I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten very far yet, but unsurprisingly Nathan Drake&amp;rsquo;s antics still really challenge one&amp;rsquo;s suspension of disbelief. He has to be one of the most peak-performance athletes in the world to consistently pull of the jumping and wall climbing stunts he regularly does. Not to mention being able to win over basically hordes of heavily-armed mercenaries in gunfights. Not that it&amp;rsquo;s not fun and engaging as a game, it just feels so ridiculous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dcfandome.com&#34;&gt;DC Fandome&lt;/a&gt; was today, I watched some panels and new trailers and such. I enjoyed the Suicide Squad reveals and the Wonder Woman 1984, Shazam 2 and Justice League Snyder cut trailers, plus previews for the new Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad games, looking forward to those. (I should probably get around to Arkham Origins first.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing to play SC2 coop and Blood Rage with the regular groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that there&amp;rsquo;s anything wrong with a bit of relaxing downtime, but I am hoping to eventually ramp up to being more productive in the coming weeks, especially with the side projects.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;These weeknotes are coming in late in the day because of reasons. (The reasons being laziness and procrastination.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been kind of phoning in the weeknotes over the past few weeks, they&amp;rsquo;ve mostly been &amp;ldquo;hey, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy, so nothing of significance happened, but here are some things I watched/played.&amp;rdquo; Supposedly one of the side effects of writing regular updates is that you tend to look out for more interesting things to do so you have something to write about, even on an unconscious level. In the past few weeks, that has been problematic because (a) as mentioned, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with some things, so my excess time is devoted to less mentally taxing things like just watching movies/shows or destress with games; and (b) we are still in the middle of a pandemic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the pandemic, I read this piece recently on the Financial Times: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ft.com/content/32d79c87-1ade-4b63-8d14-7af1a553d963&#34;&gt;We won’t remember much of what we did in the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, about how the sameyness of our days in quarantine means our brains compress that data since so little of it is meaningful, affecting our perception of time. When 99% of your activities take place in the same environment, in your room during a zoom call, everything just tends to blur together. And I guess that reflected in the weeknotes too! (For that reason, I&amp;rsquo;m switching up the weeknotes format today to be more freeform prose, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if it sticks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the pandemic part 2, one thing I have been doing since the pandemic started is writing a regular series of notes, first as &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/03/covid19/&#34;&gt;one long post that I kept updating every couple of days or so&lt;/a&gt; then later I transitioned to regular weekly update notes, on the same day as these weeknotes. The idea was that in the future I could just browse the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/covid19/&#34;&gt;covid19 tag&lt;/a&gt; on the site and I could recall what things were like during the days of quarantine and the quality of the government response. And this was fine during the start, since things happened and unfolded quickly. But these past few months, the updates have fallen in the quagmire of sameyness as well: I only went out once every 1 or 2 weeks, everything was always getting worse, cases were always going up, government response was always terrible, and so on. One thing the last few months has made clear for me is that the government has no clear plan on controlling this thing and so I am highly pessimistic that things will change anytime soon. For that reason, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to pause on doing the covid19 update notes for now, unless some drastic change happens.(I have no expectation of Russia&amp;rsquo;s vaccine having any effect on our status quo anytime soon!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so how was my week? I wrapped up the things causing my busy-ness towards the middle of the week, so I expect to be less busy/stressed during the coming weeks. At the very least, I should be able to write on the blog more, and maybe do some work on some of my other side projects. I actually thought about writing some posts already last week but I was like you know what, I&amp;rsquo;ll just relax and watch things and play things and leave the writing to next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching and playing the past week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marvel&amp;rsquo;s Agents of SHIELD had their series finale last Thursday. I enjoyed the first half of this season, but the second half and the finale were just ok, maybe slightly meh. Still, the series finale was pretty good, wrapping things up nicely with a big bow. This series had a lot of haters, I think mostly because of mismatched expectations, because people wanted it to be more directly tied-in to the MCU movies, but that was never going to happen (maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll get that more with the coming Disney+ series). But I like it, it had a lot of fans, and it had a pretty good run. And it had Ghost Rider!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One things I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a bunch is Amonkhet Remastered, which came out on Magic Arena last Thursday. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing drafts over on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy&#34;&gt;the twitch channel&lt;/a&gt;, and archiving them to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsD8jNRlYkw&amp;amp;list=PLmU0vkKslGXg6Pdu3_kaKx5oumTwftUUe&#34;&gt;this playlist on the Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly fun, though I need to play better. Watch me on Twitch/Youtube, or like and subscribe, all that jazz, if you like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oh, I also finally finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/08/1293051269129486337/&#34;&gt;Divinity Original Sin 2&lt;/a&gt;! I really dragged out that last act for a few months, but I finally got there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/08/1294146833359364097/&#34;&gt;tried out Fall Guys on PS4&lt;/a&gt; (free on PS+!). It&amp;rsquo;s fun but kind of frustrating, I guess this is why I don&amp;rsquo;t really play these battle royale kind of things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a little bit Street Fighter x Tekken because of a reddit thread and am once again disappointed that (a) it was such a missed opportunity; and (b) up to now it&amp;rsquo;s still not available on Steam in SEA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so one of the reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing these &amp;ldquo;watching/playing lately&amp;rdquo; posts and segments is because I want to track what I have been watching/playing at any particular point in the past. And maybe I can have like a widget on the site with things like &amp;ldquo;Recently played&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Last movie watched&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;d also want to be able to search/query for things like &amp;ldquo;what year did I watch so-and-so movie?&amp;rdquo; (Helps with trivia quizzes!) I feel like I need to be recording these detail in more of a machine-readable format or a database in order to do those kinds of things. Maybe some kind of Goodreads-like system? It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;d need to figure out how to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, this is already longer than I thought it would be. More things will be posted to the blog (hopefully!) later this week!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Still kind of busy, although there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of things I hope I can finally wrap up this week, so I can move on to the long list of other things I want to be doing. The world continues to be bleak, so I&amp;rsquo;m still hiding from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/08/forty-two/&#34;&gt;Forty-two.&lt;/a&gt; I thought about just merging these into a single post for the day, but nah, this seems better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reworking the old charity side project still ongoing. I was hoping to finish all the changes last week and next week would be testing and deployment, but stuff got in the way (and estimates may have been a bit off), but the spillover is small and we should still be fine for finishing everything next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots more SC2 coop this week, mostly in the wee hours to destress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost impulse-bought a Switch yesterday; a friend&amp;rsquo;s logic and my inexorably large gaming backlog held me back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG Arena: Nothing of significance, but Amonkhet remastered comes out this week so looking forward to that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually did a bit better in 1 of the two quizzes we played this week, but I think we had way more fun playing Codenames online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background watching: Jeopardy on Netflix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binged the new Transformers Netflix series, since it was fairly short (six episodes). A very bleak take on the Autobots&amp;rsquo; struggle against the Decepticons on Cybertron, and also a very obvious tie-in to the current War for Cybertron toy line since most of the main characters have toys in that line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also watched Craig Ferguson&amp;rsquo;s Netflix special Tickle Fight, mainly because I happened to have watch a few of his late night segments on YT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also started watching the last season of Agents of SHIELD, since I&amp;rsquo;m told the season finale is coming up next week. First three episodes seem pretty good for network TV, hopefully I have time for the rest of the (short) season in the next couple of weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links: Nothing of note this week. Even though I have read some interesting stuff, I think my link-capturing workflow really needs improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still in a pandemic!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Pandemic thoughts and updates, Aug 9 edition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So, NCR got sent back into MECQ, a stronger quarantine lockdown. I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually felt the difference, since I&amp;rsquo;m at home most of the time. We went out yesterday for a grocery run, and not much seemed different out there either, still a lot of cars and people out of doors. I don&amp;rsquo;t actually remember what the last MECQ was like, but I kind of assumed things would be closer to how they were at the onset of the lockdowns in March, but this feels still mostly like the GCQ of past weeks. IDK if this 2-week MECQ stretch really serves any purpose except to show the government is trying something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching mass via Facebook again today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 126,885 cases (+4226 from the day before, +28653 from last week, huge jump week-on-week), 2,209 deaths (+41 from the day before, +170 from last week, thankfully not as big a jump as from last week), 67,117 recoveries (+287 from the day before, +1852 from last week, a predictably much smaller jump after last week&amp;rsquo;s miraculous &amp;ldquo;mass recoveries&amp;rdquo;). We hit record high daily deaths again over the first few days of the MECQ. We seem to have settled at a much higher average daily rate since then. Luckily, the death rate hasn&amp;rsquo;t gone up that much. We are now #1 in confirmed cases in SEA, overtaking Indonesia. The govt claims nothing to worry about, it&amp;rsquo;s only because we are testing more, but our relatively large positivity rate (around 8.6% as of this writing) implies transmission is outpacing testing? &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at around 19.8 cases (+1.8M from last week, slope holding steady for maybe 3 weeks now?) and almost 730k deaths. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        






    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Kind of a busy week for me again, so the week kind of passed me by quickly. It&amp;rsquo;s August! In one month it will be (PH) Christmas season! It feels like July went by more quickly than other quarantine months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bit of consulting work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reworking the old charity side project still ongoing. I was hoping to finish all the changes last week and next week would be testing and deployment, but stuff got in the way (and estimates may have been a bit off), but the spillover is small and we should still be fine for finishing everything next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starcraft 2 came out with a 10th anniversary patch that had some sweet new features and changes for coop. They added unlockable prestige talents for each of the 18 commanders, each talent alters their gameplay so they play out a bit differently. We had actually been getting a bit bored with SC2 coop and had been playing it less, this patch did a lot to invigorate our enthusiasm for it. We&amp;rsquo;ve been playing it quite a bit to unlock the prestige talents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG Arena: Didn&amp;rsquo;t hit mythic last month, but that&amp;rsquo;s fine. I switched my historic deck to Monored for faster games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only played 1 quiz last week for reasons. Instead, trivia group played some online Codenames (via &lt;a href=&#34;https://codenames.game/&#34;&gt;https://codenames.game/&lt;/a&gt;) on Saturday night, with voice chat over discord. It was a bunch of fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s new episodes of Jeopardy on Netflix, so that quickly replaced Family Guy as my background watching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s actually a bunch of new stuff to watch too: Umbrella Academy S2 is out, there&amp;rsquo;s a new Transformers series on Netflix etc. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get around to all of these things someday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some fixes to the trivia app backend, but I can&amp;rsquo;t really get too much into the (other) side projects until I get past my current busyness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internet seems to be having some DNS issues this past week. Occasionally can&amp;rsquo;t access various URLs, but is fine on refresh. Problem survived multiple router reboots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The right-click button on this gaming mouse I got last year is starting to get less responsive. I only got for $13 in Walmart, but even then it&amp;rsquo;s one of the more expensive mice I&amp;rsquo;ve bought, so I hope it doesn&amp;rsquo;t die too quickly. Maybe I should clean it out?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Couple of somewhat related blog posts resonated with me: &lt;a href=&#34;https://rubenerd.com/why-arent-you-more-serious/&#34;&gt;Why aren’t you more serious?&lt;/a&gt;, asserting the personal blog&amp;rsquo;s right to write about whatever the blogger wants, and not just to focus on specific serious or technical topics; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://om.co/2020/07/30/write-like-a-human/&#34;&gt;Write like a human&lt;/a&gt; is kind of self-explanatory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great follow-up to a previous survey on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pudding.cool/2020/07/song-decay/&#34;&gt;Defining the 90s Music Canon&lt;/a&gt;. Also had an &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/roytang/status/1288899712112717824&#34;&gt;interesting exchange about this with a friend over on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; re:how this might reflect locally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDK, maybe I&amp;rsquo;m getting used to the pandemic. Is this what they mean by &amp;ldquo;new normal&amp;rdquo;? I&amp;rsquo;ll move the pandemic notes to the end of these weekly updates.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Pandemic thoughts and updates, Aug 2 edition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We ended July with around 90k active cases. Despite the threat of sending Metro Manila back to ECQ if we breached the 85k mark, the govt did not push through. Over the weekend, this led to a clamor from doctors and other frontliners to have a &amp;ldquo;time out&amp;rdquo; of 2 weeks for the NCR, a temporary quarantine, to give the healthcare system some breathing room. The knee-jerk response from the palace was to say it wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessary, but they quickly flipped their flops and said the IATF would discuss it. Enraging people and doctors, a certain outspoken-on-social-media doctor tried to shame doctors for not being heroic enough, and a certain senator implied that we can&amp;rsquo;t afford it so frontliners just need to work harder and be more passionate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching mass via Facebook again today. Churches have actually been holding limited physical services, but in solidarity with the call for ECQ, they said they will temporarily suspend such services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went to get some Jollibee takeout last Thursday; apparently they are already allowing limited dine-in customers, that seems unwise, eh. Was anxious the entire time I was waiting for my takeout order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 98232 cases (+4963 from the day before, +19820 from last week, huge jump week-on-week), 2039 deaths (+17 from the day before, +142 from last week, moderate jump), 65265 recoveries (+93 from the day before, +39513 (!) from last week, a miraculous jump). We hit record high daily deaths over the past few days, and the huge spike in recoveries is because the DOH decided to do a &amp;ldquo;mass recovery&amp;rdquo; of mild/asymptomatic cases that are already 14 days or older, supposedly in line with WHO guidelines. I can kind of see some logic behind this, but the communication was not handled very well. &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at around 18M cases (+1.8M from last week) and almost 690k deaths. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hm. I was a bit busy this week, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t paying too much attention, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have too much to rail against today. Well of course, things are still ongoing. There&amp;rsquo;s still the pandemic, fascist police state philosophy continues to rear it&amp;rsquo;s ugly head in the US, PH gov&amp;rsquo;t continues to be dumb, etc., but this week seemed a bit tame comparably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching mass via Facebook again today. The nearby Church actually holds services, but last I heard it was only 10 people per mass, and need to call ahead of time. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem likely we&amp;rsquo;ll be going anytime soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grocery run yesterday, without incident&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;last Thursday I finally &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/1286105826743091201/&#34;&gt;got a haircut&lt;/a&gt; my last one was around New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day, so this was around six and a half months of hair cut off. I didn&amp;rsquo;t go to a barbershop, this was a home service haircut, care of a lady who works at a neighboring salon, who actually came over to do some home care service for my mom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of last night, we are at 78412 cases (+2019 from the day before, +13108 from last week, slight acceleration week-on-week), 1897 deaths (+20 from the day before, +224 from last week, lower jump than last week), 25752 recoveries (+1278 from the day before, +3685 from last week, much less than last week&amp;rsquo;s jump). The admin claims that if we breach 85k cases by end-July, Metro Manila may go back to NCQ. First, that seems likely to happen so we&amp;rsquo;ll see. Second, it seems a bit unfair and illogical to make Metro Manila&amp;rsquo;s quarantine status dependent on national case numbers, but whatever. &lt;a href=&#34;https://covid19ph.com/&#34;&gt;Reference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, we are at 16.2M cases (+1.8M from last week, slight acceleration) and almost 650k deaths. The US retains a comfortable lead over second placer Brazil. Caveat: these numbers are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;Worldometer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        






    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Busy with rebuilding the UI for the old project. I&amp;rsquo;m having fun with it, so that&amp;rsquo;s something. I think this week went by more quickly for me because of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake completed! Review &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/ff7r-review/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I played through a couple of Civ6 games, trying out the new civs and game modes from the New Frontier pass. Fun and challenging. Apocalypse mode: it&amp;rsquo;s an insane feeling the first time you see a comet strike take out a city. I was actually streaming the gameplay to a friend on Discord when this happened and we both went &amp;ldquo;Woah!&amp;rdquo; and he said that pushed him to get the DLC as well. Secret societies: Only tried Voidsingers so far; their cultists are great for culture victory since they&amp;rsquo;re a constant source of relics for tourism, and the Old God Monument gives you GW slots for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG: Still playing a bunch of JumpStart, but also put together Bant Ramp for Historic. Currently at Diamond 4, I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can grind Mythic for constructed before end of month. Related: I watched Maro&amp;rsquo;s Comic-con stream for Zendikar Rising last night, but left kinda underwhelmed. Set boosters are neat, but I kind of wanted more info/spoilers about the set itself. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to be excited about the set boosters when my MTG involvement is primarily through Arena these days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only played 2 online quizzes this week (the third one didn&amp;rsquo;t fire due to not enough participants). There was a fun Scientists/Inventors round which I could have perfected if I had gone with my gut answer (Rutherford) and not listened to my teammates lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a new season of Family Guy on Netflix, so I&amp;rsquo;ve started to watch that in the background while I&amp;rsquo;m working on other things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I watched a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ew.com/events/comic-con/scott-pilgrim-cast-reunion-table-read/&#34;&gt;for-charity cast-reunion live-table-read for Scott Pilgrim vs the World&lt;/a&gt; last week. I enjoyed it so much, I went and rewatched the movie on Netflix as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technically, this old project I&amp;rsquo;m revamping used to be a &amp;ldquo;side project&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing of note.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;My country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are days when I have to consciously temper my rage at the shenanigans of this government. I can&amp;rsquo;t write about them today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/covid19-07-19/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s pandemic notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a busy work week again; at the same time I also picked up an older charity project where the client asked for UI updates. Had issues with running the old code, and it was small enough, so I decided to rewrite it in a new tech stack. Might write about it at some point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am like 98% through the FF7R hard mode run. I&amp;rsquo;m totally making these percentages up, but I do have only one trophy left, and it&amp;rsquo;s this annoying minigame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started trying out some of the new leaders/civs in the Civ6 New Frontier pack. Another drop should be coming this week, so looking forward to that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG JumpStart is out this week! I tried it a couple of times on Arena. Some combinations are much better than others; the sad things is if you picked a miserable pair you have to stick with it longer before you can get your requisite two wins. Here&amp;rsquo;s an (ongoing) &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/1283901490206109698/&#34;&gt;thread of my JumpStart results&lt;/a&gt; will probably update it through the month it&amp;rsquo;s available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t win any online quiz this week, boo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After watching Atomic Blonde last week, I watched the Old Guard for back-to-back Charlize Theron action flicks. Pretty fun, although some plot points might make you go what?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of stuff coming out in July that I might watch: new season of Umbrella Academy, and there&amp;rsquo;s a Transformers anime coming out on NF, and well, there&amp;rsquo;s also a long backlog of things to watch&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing to note, too busy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;My country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday afternoon the House of Representatives voted to deny the franchise application of the nation&amp;rsquo;s biggest broadcaster ABS-CBN. This despite all agencies of the executive testifying that the company had no violations. Justifications cited were mostly personal reasons. The Palace claims they remained neutral on this issue, but no one really believes that. Probably not even then. What now, Philippines?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/covid19-07-12/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s pandemic notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a busy week work-wise. Learning a lot about Vue and Laravel though, so that&amp;rsquo;s fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am like 95% through the FF7R hard mode run. Only a 5% difference from last week, progress is slow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I bought a few games off the Steam Sale: Civ 6&amp;rsquo;s New Frontiers Pass (not actually on sale), Disco Elysium, and Garou Mark of the Wolves. You can watch me struggling in Garou &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yQ6B9IlwHU&amp;amp;t=70s&#34;&gt;on Youtube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We only played one online quiz this week, didn&amp;rsquo;t do too well D:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I watched Atomic Blonde yesterday. I thought it was like a John Wick style action flick. That&amp;rsquo;s true, but it&amp;rsquo;s also a Cold-War era spy thriller with lots of double-crosses and whatnot. Fairly engaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing to note.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.dev/one-line-layouts/&#34;&gt;Ten modern layouts in one line of CSS&lt;/a&gt;. I could have used this two weeks ago!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.swiss-miss.com/2020/07/alike-an-animated-short-film.html&#34;&gt;Alike, an Animated Short Film&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of an allegory for modern life.&lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;My country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday afternoon the president sighed the controversial &amp;ldquo;Anti-terror law&amp;rdquo; that vastly expands police powers, allows people to be arrested without warrants on mere suspicion of terrorism etc. Interesting timing, right after China applies a new anti-terror low to Hong Kong (and rightly gets castigated for it by countries all over the world) and also right after the PNP (who &lt;em&gt;promise&lt;/em&gt; not to abuse their newfound powers) are under criticism for killing some soldiers in a &lt;em&gt;misencounter&lt;/em&gt; and tampering with the crime scene to cover it up. Many are afraid of the chilling impact on freedom of speech, but I like to think that I will be as complain-y as I used to be. I am privileged to be able to do that, so might as well keep going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Congressmen &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/abscbn-bias-press-freedom/&#34;&gt;tightening the screws on ABS-CBN&lt;/a&gt; during the franchise hearings reminds me that: given how complicated the various laws and statutes are, anyone with an agenda who wants to harass you can always find some obscure laws or regulations that you allegedly violated. That is not to say we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t follow such regulations, but given when one randomly keeps digging up new issues, it becomes obvious that there is a vendetta at work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I often ruminate about what I can do to help the state of my country today. Or maybe even the state of the world? I used to think being a good citizen and making good voting choices was enough, but it&amp;rsquo;s not. The systems are rigged to perpetuate inequality, exploitation, and bad people in power. I read somewhere recently that one should imagine the path towards the future he wishes to claim and take the steps to make it happen, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think my imagination is up to the task at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/07/covid19-07-05/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s pandemic notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fair bit of consulting work for this coming week, might be busy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have already &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/quitting-facebook/&#34;&gt;deactivated Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. If I would be honest, I still find myself sometimes instinctively thinking about checking the Facebook feed. Hopefully, it&amp;rsquo;s an instinct that gets weaned away with time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaming:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am like 90% through the FF7R hard mode run, but I&amp;rsquo;m currently stuck at a certain point trying to beat the so-called &amp;ldquo;hardest fight in the game&amp;rdquo;. Hopefully I can finish it this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinity OS2 inched along slightly as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday gaming group picked up a new board game on Steam, it&amp;rsquo;s Blood Rage, about vikings trying to earn glory for Ragnarok. A bit more violent than Scythe, lots more fighting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTG: I did six twitch streams/yt episodes of M21 drafting, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXZO7Ukg5Xk&amp;amp;list=PLmU0vkKslGXiz0shcCJgV1YTP5emzWgr4&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s a playlist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quiz:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Able to play a couple more online quiz nights this week, but still didn&amp;rsquo;t do well lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching lately:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some new movies on Netflix lately. Decided to watch Mission Impossible Fallout. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I ever watched Rogue Nation though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to plan out the next set of updates for the trivia thing, but I might be too busy in the coming weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I changed the fonts on this blog. Again. Someday I&amp;rsquo;ll probably try Comic Sans just for the heck of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again: I should probably write more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This list of &lt;a href=&#34;https://whimsical.club/&#34;&gt;websites that spark joy&lt;/a&gt; is great, have some new sites to browse!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A walk back through the history of web trends and standards: &lt;a href=&#34;https://pavellaptev.github.io/web-dark-ages/&#34;&gt;dark ages of the web&lt;/a&gt;. As someone &lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.technology/@schwartz/104450459330476402&#34;&gt;commented on Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; though: &amp;ldquo;dark ages for development, golden age for content.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/covid19-06-28/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s pandemic notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easily the most annoying thing this week: our broadband modem conked out Wednesday night. Customer support isn&amp;rsquo;t super responsive for local telcos: I called their support line the next day (support line is not even available 24/7!), got put on hold for 45 minutes TWICE before they agreed to send a repair crew over the next day (Friday). Friday morning I got a text that the technician visit was actually scheduled for SATURDAY morning. They arrive Saturday AFTERNOON, due to traffic apparently. And unluckily, they are out of spare modems for the replacement. They promise to come back first thing in the morning SUNDAY. They come back Sunday LUNCHTIME. And I finally have internet back. An annoying experience, and I&amp;rsquo;m also worried that my mobile plan might be charged for the two one-hour calls I had to do to their support line (hopefully I can clear that up), and I&amp;rsquo;m told I can also call them up to ask for a rebate for their days we had no service, but eh, I&amp;rsquo;d have to sit through another long on-hold period!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One would think that being offline for half a week would lead to some kind of gigantic productivity boost, but no such luck. I still had my mobile internet for my doomscrolling after all. I did manage to read/write/watch a few more things than usual I guess?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finished Final Fantasy VII Remake (before the internet outage)! So I spent a lot of the outage (including my time on hold with tech support) playing through hard mode, already about half-way through. Still not sure I&amp;rsquo;m going to do achievement completion, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see. Hard mode is actually an enjoyable challenge, nothing too insane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinity OS2 inched along slightly as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;won my &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/1274581114628108289/&#34;&gt;first Trivia Royale&lt;/a&gt;, I can quit now lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the internet outage coincided with the start of this week&amp;rsquo;s Steam Summer Sale. There&amp;rsquo;s some games/DLC I&amp;rsquo;m considering buying, but realistically in terms of backlog I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t lol. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if willpower holds out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the new MTG core set also came out on Magic Arena during the outage. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get back into regular streaming for M21 limited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still tried to join the Zoom and voice chats for the online quizzes with only my tethered mobile internet, but that was kind of a miserable experience. Still, I was able to contribute a bit, though we didn&amp;rsquo;t actually do too well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finished watching season 2 of Harley Quinn. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve written about the show before. The whole Harley/Poison Ivy dynamic isn&amp;rsquo;t really for me, but I like the show&amp;rsquo;s take on Gotham and the wider DC universe and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of fun characters like King Shark and Clayface. Also, Riddler was recognizably voiced by Dean Pelton from Community, and that was fun lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also did a rewatch of Spider-Man Far From Home on Netflix, before the internet problems and all. Still a pretty good movie, and watching it made me eager to get back to the MCU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also watched the Sonic the Hedgehog movie while things were offline. The best thing about this is Sonic being recognizably voiced by Ben Schwartz, who apparently &lt;a href=&#34;https://thesuperheroesnetwork.tumblr.com/post/622121477003739136/supernova-swirls-gothammite-he-really&#34;&gt;voices everyone blue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As soon as my internet came back, I started watching Ghost Fighter/Yu Yu Hakusho, which came out on Netflix (as you guessed it, during the outage)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also tried reading a book. It was a Discworld book. &amp;ldquo;Tried&amp;rdquo; being the operative word. I&amp;rsquo;ll write about it if I manage to get to the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uh, proceeding apace I guess?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again: I should probably write more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I don&amp;rsquo;t really follow SSC too strictly, but that seemed like a bad thing. I also read up some more on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Scott_Alexander&#34;&gt;Scott Alexander / SSC&lt;/a&gt; because of this, and it looks like he had a lot of problematic views, so I don&amp;rsquo;t really think I want to support him lol.&lt;/li&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/covid19-06-21/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s pandemic notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some days still hot, but weather beginning to turn for the better. Sleep kind of better and a bit more regular too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did my quarterly medical checkup this past week (slightly delayed). No issues, but I need to do an FBS test for next time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep schedule kind of settling back into my usual biphasic sleep. Although the second phase seems to move around a lot&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not much work-wise the past week, and a bit more family-related expenses. Medical and government stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;still playing a lot of Final Fantasy VII Remake. I think I&amp;rsquo;m already in the final chapter. I am quite happy with the adaptiation, bit I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;m going to bother with achievement completion for this one; it requires hard mode completion, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the issue. The problem is the abundance of these dexterity-based minigames! I thought everything was fine when I did the squats thing, but then later there&amp;rsquo;s a harder pull-ups thing! And I haven&amp;rsquo;t even cracked the bottom of that darts leaderboard&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinity OS2 inching along slightly. But probably will be finished after FF7R at this rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s a new trivia app by the makers of the QuizUp, which we used to play a lot back in the day. The name is Trivia Royale, it&amp;rsquo;s currently iOS only and it&amp;rsquo;s basically battle royale quizup: you join a game with 1000 players, and you play 10 head-to-head matches until you get a winner. Took me most of the wook to actually win my first one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;did poorly in the AboutQuiz and PopQuiz games this week. Actually, we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing poorly for a while now lol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing to log. Maybe a good thing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://triviastorm.net/&#34;&gt;triviastorm&lt;/a&gt; stuff this week. Most of it are some backend fixes to make later planned new features easier to build. Planning to clear/reset leaderboards at the end of the month. Some roadmap things:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allowing users to submit their own questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make the discord bot usable for public usage, i.e. let other people add it to their discord&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I should probably write more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot of posts off &lt;a href=&#34;https://lobste.rs&#34;&gt;lobste.rs&lt;/a&gt; lately, so I finally pulled the trigger and asked around for an invite to the site. A &lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@ignaloidas&#34;&gt;helpful person&lt;/a&gt; provided me one via Mastodon. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting site, basically an invite-only reddit-like site, mostly focused on tech stuff, so in theory the discussion quality should be fairly high. The chain of invites is public too, each user&amp;rsquo;s profile shows you who invited him, so in that way it&amp;rsquo;s kind of similar to a certificate chain of trust? We&amp;rsquo;ll see if this scales up well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed this &lt;a href=&#34;https://mxb.dev/blog/the-return-of-the-90s-web/&#34;&gt;recent article about the 90s web&lt;/a&gt;. I will easily admit that I am an easy sucker for any post that appeals to my nostalgia for how the web was better &amp;ldquo;back in the doy&amp;rdquo;, rose-tinted glasses or no.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed the song Fast Car, so it was interesting to read about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/tracy-chapman-fast-car-revival-luke-combs-khalid-1014843/&#34;&gt;its origins and its surprising popularity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The founders of BaseCamp recently released &lt;a href=&#34;https://hey.com&#34;&gt;Hey&lt;/a&gt;, a new email service that has &lt;a href=&#34;https://hey.com/features/&#34;&gt;some interesting ideas about new features&lt;/a&gt; to support the typical email workflow. I don&amp;rsquo;t nearly use email enough on a personal basis to pay for it (though I do have an invite!), but I&amp;rsquo;m glad someone is innovating in this space, although they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be using open standards. They promptly &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation&#34;&gt;got into a fight with Apple over App Store policies&lt;/a&gt; which has sparked some debate in the tech community on the value of curated app stores. So maybe they&amp;rsquo;re actually going to push for innovation in two different areas?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, no new crises have emerged during the past week. I think. More of the same crises, carrying on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Friday was the PH independence day holiday. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like celebrating. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like we are free. In any case, a protest rally against the yet-to-be-signed terror bill took place at the university that morning, inspite of threats from the authorities that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t allowed. The protestors spaced themselves out and everything. Some friends reported trouble getting into the university though. Apparently a heavy police/military presence was manning many of the entrances for some reason. &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/DailyGuardianPH/posts/3416858255000782&#34;&gt;Basta&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/move-ph/263710-police-blocks-entry-protesters-rally-independence-day-2020&#34;&gt;News report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/covid19-06-14/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s quarantine notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much better weather this week, some nights were comfortably rainy and chilly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep schedule kind of settling back into my usual biphasic sleep. Although the second phase seems to move around a lot&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disappointed in the PS5 reveal. None of the shown games are must buys from me, and I was hoping for a price and release date. Highly unlikely I&amp;rsquo;d get a PS5 on launch though. Historically I&amp;rsquo;ve waited at least a year to get consoles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divinity OS2 run stalled this week because&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip; most of my gaming this week spent on Final Fantasy VII Remake. I&amp;rsquo;m only around 12ish hours in. Game is pretty great, and not just for the nostalgia bit. There is a large amount of added content, and some plot details play out differently. Looking forward to how this all ends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also purchased the &lt;a href=&#34;https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality&#34;&gt;itch.io BLM bundle&lt;/a&gt; this week. Wow that&amp;rsquo;s a ton of value. Over 1600+ games, assets, etc for minimum $5? I was originally hesitant since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have an itch.io account and really I don&amp;rsquo;t need more backlog, but it&amp;rsquo;s for a good cause, and did I mention also a ton of value? Better than Humble Bundles ever were.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somehow managed to win Geekfight this week, and it&amp;rsquo;s the last one until July. We got third place in PopQuiz and as usual did poorly in AboutQuiz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team Camote Pop Culture Trivia Challenge S01E01 is out: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQytLl61PCQ&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQytLl61PCQ&lt;/a&gt;. We had a lot of fun, and we recorded this around a month ago I think, editing took a while. We have a few more episodes in the queue, feel free to like and subscribe!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My dad has been watching a lot of Two and A Half Men, which means a lot of incidental watching from me whenever I&amp;rsquo;m in that same room. The Charlie Sheen firing came really abruptly since he was binging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Huh, I guess not much TV/movies for me last week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worked a bit more on &lt;a href=&#34;https://triviastorm.net/&#34;&gt;triviastorm&lt;/a&gt; stuff this week. Cleaning up the old questions, prepping new question sets, etc. Will probably load new question sets and reset both the twitter bot and discord leaderboards around the end of the month, and hopefully can expand upon the app after that, and prepare it for more general use and other cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My urge to completely revamp the site has passed&amp;hellip; for now. Other plans proceed apace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/&#34;&gt;Sort By Controversial&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s two years old, but it&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic read, a fictional (or maybe not so fictional?) take on how society can easily be cleaved apart by the right discussions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;The world isn&amp;rsquo;t letting up. The virus is still around, but both the US and my own country have gotten distracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US is in its second week of police brutality/black lives matters protests. Meanwhile, our government took on a sidequest of trying to enact a wide-ranging and easily abusable anti-terror bill, triggering some smaller (by comparison to the US).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t written about the terror bill, mainly because I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the opportunity to dig into it too deeply. But my general impression leaves me two points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the justification for asking for increased police/anti-terrorism powers? We don&amp;rsquo;t actually get that many terror attacks pulled off, the last big one was Marawi (which I heard some Congressmen citing, tbf), which was back in 2017. And that was mostly a problem with Islamic militants. I don&amp;rsquo;t hear any of the bill proponents talking about how specifically the limits on govt powers holds them back. How would these added powers prevent another Marawi? Did they actually have intel leading up to the Marawi siege that they couldn&amp;rsquo;t act on due to limited powers? I find this difficult to believe because&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what about the authorities&amp;rsquo; history of impunity? It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that they are being restricted by the law in anti-terror activities when they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to let the law get in the way for much lesser things. I guess this is the crux of the issue for most people, one of trust. Even if you say there are safeguards in the law, they are still easily abusable. The bill extends the detention period for terror suspects to I think is it 30 days, extendable? But given the speed (or lack thereof) of local courts, even if you challenge any violation of the safeguards, the challenge may take longer to resolve than the detention period. Maybe we should consider cleaning up our justice system first? People wouldn&amp;rsquo;t object if our systems were trustworthy&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, also China banned mocking their national anthem in HK, or something to that effect. China being China. Better not to lose track of what is probably the greatest threat to democracy in the coming century&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/06/covid19-06-07/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s quarantine notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was hoping the weather would get much cooler than this. Where&amp;rsquo;s our &lt;em&gt;hanging amihan&lt;/em&gt;?!?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tiny bit of consulting work again this week, mostly integration work. And it&amp;rsquo;s in PHP, which means I&amp;rsquo;m once again tempted to write a &amp;ldquo;bad things about PHP&amp;rdquo; post lol. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll collect a few more gripes before I do that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep schedule slightly better and more regular, but my eyes seem to be heavy a lot more often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;m like in the final act for Divinity OS2. Need to finish it soonish because&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip; my PS4 is back! My brother finally passed by the house to pick up some stuff and returned my console. I already hooked it up and did the installation things for FF7R. Will probably start it this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new Humble choice is up, but it&amp;rsquo;s meh again. Will probably pass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was looking forward to the PS5 reveal this week, but it got rescheduled due to everything happening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least previews for the next Magic set have already started. Some cool stuff. Instant planeswalker abilities! Phasing! Prowess! &lt;a href=&#34;http://mythicspoiler.com/m21/cards/peerintotheabyss.html&#34;&gt;Really creepy art&lt;/a&gt;! We also got some bans and an actual rule change to address companions, both of which are sure to shake up the formats. I finally caved and paid gems for the Ikoria mythic pass on Arena (I&amp;rsquo;ve saved up a bunch anyway. Still totally F2P!). Hopefully I can max out the levels/rewards before the mastery rotation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt; Geekfight was fun this week (theme was Marvel comics, right up my alley), although I didn&amp;rsquo;t win. We did poorly in the other two online quizzes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legends of Tomorrow season finale was weak and didn&amp;rsquo;t really make sense, but still somehow the best of the Arrowverse finales this season. Oh well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By contrast, I really liked the Rick and Morty season finale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also started watching Space Force; only 3 episodes in, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit meh. Not super funny or anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Side projects:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worked a bit on &lt;a href=&#34;https://triviastorm.net/&#34;&gt;triviastorm&lt;/a&gt; stuff this week. I&amp;rsquo;m preparing new questions and cleaning up the old ones, and also some work on a tighter checking algorithm. There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of features I want to add to this side project, let&amp;rsquo;s see if I manage to get around to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also spent a couple of hours fantasizing about rewriting the site again, maybe back to a dynamic backend, or some kind of hybrid, mostly to address the issues scaling with so many posts. Lol, will probably not do this yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s in the back of my mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No recent links for now. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll be more diligent about this next week.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>
            
            &lt;p&gt;It seems difficult to write about stuff today, when the world seems like it is on fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For historical context, for the past few days the USA, presumably a first-world nation, has been in the grip of massive protests and riots and police brutality following the murder of a black man by four police officers was captured on video and went viral. Basically, many states are responding to protests against police brutality with&amp;hellip; police brutality. Bold move Cotton. I&amp;rsquo;m not an American, but this resonates with me a lot because to see this kind of thing happening in a country that purports to champion human rights, how much worse can it be in a country like ours or a dictatorship like China where they don&amp;rsquo;t even give lip service to the concept? (Spoiler: we already know police brutality and EJKs are a thing in my country.) I give my support to those protesting, and hope they achieve the reforms their country needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would question why I (and maybe the world) focuses so much on what happens in the USA, given that violence and brutality happen in a lot of other countries too. The main difference is that the USA is presumably a superpower and provide some semblance of leadership to democratic countries. The USA needs to shape up, they&amp;rsquo;re making democracy look bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s weird watching a hegemony fall apart in real time to weight of its own excesses. It&amp;rsquo;s like they&amp;rsquo;re trying to hard to make &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_Tense_(Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine)&#34;&gt;Deep Space Nine&amp;rsquo;s 2020s prediction&lt;/a&gt; come true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: I should also highlight in this space that this past week China rammed its National Security Law through Hong Kong, bypassing the HK legislature and essentially ending HK&amp;rsquo;s autonomy through one country, two systems. I&amp;rsquo;ve been to Hong Kong multiples times and know and have worked with people there, so this one hits a lot closer to home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/covid19-05-31/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s quarantine notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weather slightly cooling off, with more thunderstorms happening in the afternoons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep schedule completely out of whack again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming:&lt;/strong&gt; Moved along my Divity OS2 game. A friend got me some Steam keys for the older Jackbox Party Packs, so I have more access to games to play. I tried streaming via Twitch, but seems difficult due to streaming delay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt; We didn&amp;rsquo;t really do too well in the quiz nights this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have uploaded some gaming videos to our trivia team&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCptXvNbp4ETVttb_k-1oOww&#34;&gt;Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;, check it out!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watched Zombieland: Double Tap. My friends and I really enjoyed the first movie when it came out ten years ago. This one was fun, but pretty much more of the same&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;caught up with Legends of Tomorrow in anticipation of their season finale this coming week. I have to say I had low expectations but once again Legends may be the best of the Arrowverse shows this season. I really enjoyed the penultimate episode where they had parodies of other shows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Site updates: Nothing to announce!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do have some social media related thing to announce, maybe tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent Links of Interest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/&#34;&gt;Rediscovering the small web.&lt;/a&gt; Great post here, and I like the term &amp;ldquo;small web&amp;rdquo; to describe what I&amp;rsquo;ve been missing on the internet lately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slim pickings this week apparently. Been distracted by other things.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;My stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/covid19-05-24/&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s quarantine notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the weather has been so hot lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken to shifting my sleep schedule to afternoons so that I can maximize the use of the air-conditioning to when it&amp;rsquo;s most needed. It also helps me be more productive, since I can get more things done if I&amp;rsquo;m awake during the cooler hours of the day. I think I&amp;rsquo;m more looking forward to the end of summer than the end of quarantine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a bit of consulting work this week, actually had to code some stuff. Mostly integration work, API calls, that sort of thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/hyperx-cloud2/&#34;&gt;fancy new headset&lt;/a&gt; I ordered off Lazada came in last Saturday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Gaming: **Not much gaming this week surprisingly. The Saturday playgroup started playing Scythe, a Steam version of an actual boardgame. Games take a long time, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty terrible at it because it seems to need a lot of advance planning. We&amp;rsquo;re also planning to play some Jackbox games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiz:&lt;/strong&gt; So we&amp;rsquo;re up to 3 regular online quiz nights now. Sadly, we didn&amp;rsquo;t too well in this week&amp;rsquo;s quizzes. I did win the Geekfight one last Wednesday, but the other two were a wash. As if that weren&amp;rsquo;t enough, we also decided to do internal trivia team quizzes, with the intent of putting them up on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCptXvNbp4ETVttb_k-1oOww&#34;&gt;relatively-new Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt; (Subscribe, etc). I hosted the first one last Wednesday, and the video will be up on YT as soon as our editor gets done with it. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably upload the slides once it&amp;rsquo;s up as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching lately:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caught up with the &amp;ldquo;season finales&amp;rdquo; for Supergirl and Flash. In quotes because they literally just cut their seasons short and left a lot of cliffhangers to be resolved next season. Understandable, but so weird.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;various streaming shows have started up again their seasons that I&amp;rsquo;ve started watching: Rick and Morty, Patriot Act with Hasan Minaj&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Site updates: Nothing to announce! Been busy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent Links of Interest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;great &lt;a href=&#34;https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/&#34;&gt;post on software bloat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not big on sudoku, but I enjoyed watching &lt;a href=&#34;https://kottke.org/20/05/solving-the-the-miracle-sudoku&#34;&gt;this &amp;ldquo;miracle sudoku&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; that made the rounds last week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@steve.yegge/saying-goodbye-to-the-best-gig-i-ever-had-a33736833c1e?source=rss-c1ec701babb7------2&#34;&gt;Steve Yegge has left Grab&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with him, he used to work at Google and wrote a bunch of &lt;a href=&#34;https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;longish but really good software development related articles&lt;/a&gt; back in the day. I like this recent post because he highlights some of the differences he noticed while working with people from this side of the world. It was actually a year ago that he last &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/05/1131993395738468352/&#34;&gt;wrote about being at Grab&lt;/a&gt;. Although ick, Medium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the Worldometer site to track worldwide Covid19 stats, but it turns out it &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html&#34;&gt;might not be super accurate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capcom has re-released &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.capcom-unity.com/2020/05/21/street-fighter-april-fools-mini-games-have-returned/&#34;&gt;some old April Fools joke Street Fighter themed minigames&lt;/a&gt;! I liked the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/1263976021444816896/&#34;&gt;Street Fighter Academy one&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s a trivia game!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theringer.com/2020/5/20/21264342/online-trivia-learned-league&#34;&gt;Great writeup of LearnedLeague&lt;/a&gt;, a long-running trivia league that&amp;rsquo;s invite-only. I kind of want to try to find a way to join, but it seems really tough! &lt;a href=&#34;https://learnedleague.com/&#34;&gt;Their website&lt;/a&gt; has an archive of all the past sets and their questions. I browsed through a month&amp;rsquo;s worth of questions and they&amp;rsquo;re really hard, I could answer maybe 1-2 in 10 questions on average.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
