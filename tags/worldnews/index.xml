            Reply to &amp;#39;Justin Trudeau to Facebook: Fix your fake news problem — or else&amp;#39; on /r/worldnews at https://reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7w9869/justin_trudeau_to_facebook_fix_your_fake_news/:

            &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the problem is humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realistically, what can facebook (or any other internet/social media/news platform) do? The most they can do is promote &amp;ldquo;reliable&amp;rdquo; content and deprioritize &amp;ldquo;unreliable&amp;rdquo; content, but then they run into issues of how to rate the reliability of sources/content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even assuming they solve that (maybe by asking govt+independent orgs to certify reliability?), what are they supposed to do if people keep sharing unreliable content regardless?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total worldwide online connectivity unfortunately means the internet brings together even believers of supposedly fringe ideas - flat earthers, anti-vaxxers, conspiracy theorists, white supremacists, fanatics, etc and if you censor their content they will complain about freedom of speech and that starts us down a slippery slope&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long term solution would be to educate people, but that relies on more people being willing to be good actors on social networks and speak up against fake news and other unreliable stuff. It isn&amp;rsquo;t in the hands of the tech companies&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Where are they undergoing rehab? There&amp;rsquo;s only 52 rehab centers in the entire country&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;As a Filipino living in the Philippines, I can tell you he&amp;rsquo;s not exactly the most consistent person spewing out reliable statements. Even during the campaign period he had a tendency to flip-flop especially when people call him out, and even his own spokespeople often give different &amp;ldquo;interpretations&amp;rdquo; of his nonsenical ramblings. If you believe he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to stay in power, you should also believe his threat to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to declare martial law if she doesn&amp;rsquo;t toe the line, or his threat to leave the UN if they aren&amp;rsquo;t more polite or something&lt;/p&gt;
