            &lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Google officially announced their much-rumored streaming game platform, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/21/google-announces-its-video-game-platform-stadia&#34;&gt;Google Stadia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If this works out, it will greatly lower the barrier for access to AAA games, since people won&amp;rsquo;t have to buy desktops or consoles anymore, and you would be able to game on laptops without worrying about overheating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sadly like many online services, it will probably be a while before it even becomes available over here in the PH (I believe even Sony&amp;rsquo;s Playstation Now is not yet accessible here)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One would presumably worry about how well it would work with the limited bandwidth available to third-world countries like ours, but I had this worry too when Netflix first became available here, and that worked out fine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of Netflix, if Stadia manages to have a Netflix-like unlimited access service, that can only mean my gaming backlog is going to get a lot worse!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
