            &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;  Hold the power button for 10 seconds and plug in the mag safe connector  while you keep holding down the power button for another 10 seconds at  least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was I supposed to do this while the laptop was off? because of course it started turning on in the middle of the first 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tried it while the laptop was on, in which case it shutdown during the first 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, it does not seem to have changed anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;  Have you thought about switching out the battery?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you mentioned, macbook airs dont have removable batteries. Also, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t the fact that I am sometimes able to charge it, depending on how I place the magsafe connector, imply the problem is with the connector or port and not the battery itself?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;ve tried this before; unsure as I&amp;rsquo;ve had this problem for a while and have been looking around for solutions for a while. Regardless, I tried it again today a couple of times, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed anything.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h4 id=&#34;posted-on-rapplehelp-2017-macbook-air-has-trouble-charginghttpsredditcomrapplehelpcommentsn33ad92017_macbook_air_has_trouble_charging&#34;&gt;Posted on r/applehelp: &lt;a href=&#34;https://reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/n33ad9/2017_macbook_air_has_trouble_charging/&#34;&gt;2017 Macbook Air has trouble charging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a 2017 Macbook Air. This one still has the Magsafe charger. My problem with it is that connecting the charger to the device via the Magsafe port is super finicky, most of the time if I just plug it in straight, the device won&amp;rsquo;t charge (the battery status indicator will have the lightning bolt symbol, but if you click on it, the dropdown will say &amp;ldquo;not charging&amp;rdquo;) and the magsafe connector won&amp;rsquo;t light up (if it&amp;rsquo;s charging it will light up either red or green).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I&amp;rsquo;m usually able to get it to charge. But it takes me some number of tries disconnecting and reconnecting the charger, turning the wire or the connector every which way trying to find the proper angle where it will charge. Sometimes it takes me hours or even days to be able to get it to charge again. Obviously not very practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s a problem with the charger itself; I&amp;rsquo;ve tried borrowing another working magsafe charger from someone else and the same problems arise. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried blowing into the connector ports or using toothpicks to clean out any dust, and still the situation persists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone else encountered this kind of issue? Any advice?&lt;/p&gt;
