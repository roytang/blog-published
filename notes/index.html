<div class="content e-content">

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/zaaaldehyde/">@zaaaldehyde</a> I&rsquo;ve walked most of the northbound side of EDSA from around Trinoma QAve and Araneta to Ortigas/Pioneer I don&rsquo;t recall having any trouble, but it&rsquo;s been a while. Have the sidewalks been repurposed in the last 2-3 years?</p>

<p>This mindset reflects someone who doesn&rsquo;t respect institutions or the  law or civilized agreements, and basically respects only one thing:  power. That&rsquo;s why he thinks people who oppose China want war and why he  doesn&rsquo;t want to offend China, power is all he sees and values, like the thug that he is.  For this kind of person, you can&rsquo;t be right because of the law or  because of principle, or because of justice, you can only be right if you had the ability to  enforce that right. Basically the type of leader who would just  collaborate with any invaders who managed to overpower us and would say wag na lang tayo gumawa ng gulo, andyan na e.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>&gt;  Hold the power button for 10 seconds and plug in the mag safe connector  while you keep holding down the power button for another 10 seconds at  least.</p>
<p>Was I supposed to do this while the laptop was off? because of course it started turning on in the middle of the first 10 seconds.</p>
<p>I also tried it while the laptop was on, in which case it shutdown during the first 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Either way, it does not seem to have changed anything.</p>
<p>&gt;  Have you thought about switching out the battery?</p>
<p>As you mentioned, macbook airs dont have removable batteries. Also, wouldn&rsquo;t the fact that I am sometimes able to charge it, depending on how I place the magsafe connector, imply the problem is with the connector or port and not the battery itself?</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ve tried this before; unsure as I&rsquo;ve had this problem for a while and have been looking around for solutions for a while. Regardless, I tried it again today a couple of times, it hasn&rsquo;t changed anything.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a 2017 Macbook Air. This one still has the Magsafe charger. My problem with it is that connecting the charger to the device via the Magsafe port is super finicky, most of the time if I just plug it in straight, the device won&rsquo;t charge (the battery status indicator will have the lightning bolt symbol, but if you click on it, the dropdown will say &ldquo;not charging&rdquo;) and the magsafe connector won&rsquo;t light up (if it&rsquo;s charging it will light up either red or green).</p>
<p>Eventually I&rsquo;m usually able to get it to charge. But it takes me some number of tries disconnecting and reconnecting the charger, turning the wire or the connector every which way trying to find the proper angle where it will charge. Sometimes it takes me hours or even days to be able to get it to charge again. Obviously not very practical.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a problem with the charger itself; I&rsquo;ve tried borrowing another working magsafe charger from someone else and the same problems arise. I&rsquo;ve tried blowing into the connector ports or using toothpicks to clean out any dust, and still the situation persists.</p>
<p>Anyone else encountered this kind of issue? Any advice?</p>

<p>I binged season 2 of Tom Clancy&rsquo;s Jack Ryan this week (after watching season 1 back in 2018!). This season felt tighter than the first in terms of pacing and such.<!--sep-->But I&rsquo;m not happy with the way it promotes American interventionism and their easy willingness to interfere in the affairs of a sovereign nation (however justified it may be)</p>

<p>Invincible season 1 finale was pretty great, the fight was intense and afterwards I couldn&rsquo;t believe there was still half an episode to go. It&rsquo;s been a while since I read the books so I&rsquo;m not sure, but I think they diverged a bit from the source material, but it&rsquo;s fine.<!--sep-->The series was developed well enough, decent pacing and enough to portray the major characters well. Looking forward to season 2!</p>

<p>Phrases like &ldquo;insufficient evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;no proof&rdquo; does nothing to dissuade people whose arguments are along the lines of &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t hurt to try&rdquo; or &ldquo;maybe it will help&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The drug actively harming people would be more effective but the disadvantage of relying on science is that we can&rsquo;t just make claims like that without evidence.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/joshagarrado/">@joshagarrado</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/talk2GLOBE/">@talk2GLOBE</a> Hi Josh! It&rsquo;s you! Lol sorry, for some reason Twitter never gave me a notif for this.</p>
<p>Apparently the bundle is part of the normal package I got when I signed up for my plan, except the first 24mo were free. So when the 24mo were up, they automatically charge me for it.</p>

<h4 id="posted-on-rglobaltalk-question-what-are-the-police-like-in-your-countryhttpsredditcomrglobaltalkcommentsmvsss1question_what_are_the_police_like_in_your_country">Posted on r/GlobalTalk: <a href="https://reddit.com/r/GlobalTalk/comments/mvsss1/question_what_are_the_police_like_in_your_country/">[Question] What are the police like in your country?</a></h4>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been following recent events in the US (disclaimer: I&rsquo;m not an American), police brutality is a big, controversial topic over there, leading to protests and calls to defund the police and such, popularizing the phrase ACAB (meaning &ldquo;all cops are bastards&rdquo;)</p>
<p>In my own country (the Philippines), cops don&rsquo;t have a very good reputation either; they are often seen as corrupt extortionists and some may be complicit in extrajudicial killings in Duterte&rsquo;s drug war; recently they have done some bad moves such as attempting to interfere with community pantries that popped up to help the poor during the pandemic.</p>
<p>So that left me wondering what police are like in other countries. Are there countries where the police have a generally good reputation (maybe my country or the US can learn something from those places)? Or are they generally just tools for enforcing the (often unequal) status quo?</p>

<p>Wednesday afternoon Strixhaven draft(s?)! <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy">https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy</a> #mtg #magicarena #twitch #strixhaven</p>
<p>Had a great draft! I went Quandrix+Prismari and managed to go 7-2. Very explosive. One of those losses was actually due to the server giving me a defeat without even going to a match, so I might even get reimbursement!</p>

<p>Today I decided to watch Rocky (1976) for some reason. The quintessential sports film, but I&rsquo;ve never seen it before. Stallone looks only a bit younger than I remember him from the 90s. Apollo Creed is that dude from the Mandalorian! Surprised at the ending.</p>

<p>Saturday afternoon Strixhaven draft(s?)! <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy">https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy</a> #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgstrixhaven</p>
<p>Managed to do 2 drafts today. First one with Witherbloom only went 3 wins, but I managed 4 wins with the second one using Quandrix before a matchmaking bug ended my draft prematurely (hopefully we get reimbursed!)</p>

<p>Friday afternoon Strixhaven sealed! <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy">https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy</a> #mtg #magicarena #MTGStrixhaven #twitch</p>
<p>Ended up with a 3 hour stream doing 1 sealed and 1 draft. Didn&rsquo;t finish too well, only went 4-3 in sealed with silverquill and 3-1 in draft with lorehold, but it&rsquo;s a decent enough start. I like the set so far and looking forward to trying out the other houses!</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/momblogger/">@momblogger</a> Even if we criticize the choice of sinovac as less efficient, its still our duty to get vaccinated to improve public health. The Duterte govt gave us no choice. Those who still get vaccinated with sinovac should even be commended for setting aside their misgivings</p>

<p>Bond film no. 8: Live and Let Die (1973).</p>
<p>Moore feels a lot more &ldquo;generic white guy&rdquo; than Connery was. Maybe I just need to get used to him. Young Jane Seymour is here! There&rsquo;s a bayou chase scene here that goes on just a bit too long and had superfluous cop characters. <!--sep-->All the voodoo stuff felt weirdly out of place. There&rsquo;s a character named Tee Hee! Most ridiculous villain death so far.</p>
