<h4 id="posted-on-rglobaltalk-question-what-are-the-police-like-in-your-countryhttpsredditcomrglobaltalkcommentsmvsss1question_what_are_the_police_like_in_your_country">Posted on r/GlobalTalk: <a href="https://reddit.com/r/GlobalTalk/comments/mvsss1/question_what_are_the_police_like_in_your_country/">[Question] What are the police like in your country?</a></h4>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been following recent events in the US (disclaimer: I&rsquo;m not an American), police brutality is a big, controversial topic over there, leading to protests and calls to defund the police and such, popularizing the phrase ACAB (meaning &ldquo;all cops are bastards&rdquo;)</p>
<p>In my own country (the Philippines), cops don&rsquo;t have a very good reputation either; they are often seen as corrupt extortionists and some may be complicit in extrajudicial killings in Duterte&rsquo;s drug war; recently they have done some bad moves such as attempting to interfere with community pantries that popped up to help the poor during the pandemic.</p>
<p>So that left me wondering what police are like in other countries. Are there countries where the police have a generally good reputation (maybe my country or the US can learn something from those places)? Or are they generally just tools for enforcing the (often unequal) status quo?</p>

<p>Wednesday afternoon Strixhaven draft(s?)! <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy">https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy</a> #mtg #magicarena #twitch #strixhaven</p>
<p>Had a great draft! I went Quandrix+Prismari and managed to go 7-2. Very explosive. One of those losses was actually due to the server giving me a defeat without even going to a match, so I might even get reimbursement!</p>

<p>Today I decided to watch Rocky (1976) for some reason. The quintessential sports film, but I&rsquo;ve never seen it before. Stallone looks only a bit younger than I remember him from the 90s. Apollo Creed is that dude from the Mandalorian! Surprised at the ending.</p>

<p>Saturday afternoon Strixhaven draft(s?)! <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy">https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy</a> #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgstrixhaven</p>
<p>Managed to do 2 drafts today. First one with Witherbloom only went 3 wins, but I managed 4 wins with the second one using Quandrix before a matchmaking bug ended my draft prematurely (hopefully we get reimbursed!)</p>

<p>Friday afternoon Strixhaven sealed! <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy">https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy</a> #mtg #magicarena #MTGStrixhaven #twitch</p>
<p>Ended up with a 3 hour stream doing 1 sealed and 1 draft. Didn&rsquo;t finish too well, only went 4-3 in sealed with silverquill and 3-1 in draft with lorehold, but it&rsquo;s a decent enough start. I like the set so far and looking forward to trying out the other houses!</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/momblogger/">@momblogger</a> Even if we criticize the choice of sinovac as less efficient, its still our duty to get vaccinated to improve public health. The Duterte govt gave us no choice. Those who still get vaccinated with sinovac should even be commended for setting aside their misgivings</p>

<p>Bond film no. 8: Live and Let Die (1973).</p>
<p>Moore feels a lot more &ldquo;generic white guy&rdquo; than Connery was. Maybe I just need to get used to him. Young Jane Seymour is here! There&rsquo;s a bayou chase scene here that goes on just a bit too long and had superfluous cop characters. <!--sep-->All the voodoo stuff felt weirdly out of place. There&rsquo;s a character named Tee Hee! Most ridiculous villain death so far.</p>

<p>Bond movie no. 7: Diamonds are Forever (1971). Connery&rsquo;s hair starting to go a bit gray in his last appearance. More Blofeld than I&rsquo;d expected (harhar). Space laser! Plenty O&rsquo;Toole seemed pointless, there just to die. A lot of cheesy lines from the assassin henchment.</p>
<!--sep-->
<p>These movies would be a lot shorter if they just shot Bond whenever they caught him. The action scenes in all these old Bond films always feel so jarring compared to modern ones. Limited by the technology of their time I guess.</p>

<p>Bond movie no. 6: On Her Majesty&rsquo;s Secret Service (1969). Only Lazenby appearance. He was fine, I suppose. Tracy probably best Bond girl so far. I liked the ski scenes more than Thunderball&rsquo;s underwater scenes.</p>
<!--sep-->
<p>Loose continuity. Was confused by Blofeld not recognizing Bond after they already met in the previous movie. Apparently, the novel order was reversed. Also, did Bond just leave him stuck in a tree assuming he was dead after hunting him relentlessly?</p>

    <p>It always feels weird for me when the PH president exercises a line item veto, since presumably Congress has balanced the bill as a whole. This is an unusual power, Wikipedia only lists 3-4 countries that allow line item vetoes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-item_veto
Quoted manilabulletin&#39;s tweet:   READ: President Duterte vetoed nine items in CREATE law, including hike in VAT threshold on real property sale, redundant incentives for domestic enterprises; automatic approval of incentive application (📷: Roque) | @GenKabiling  Note that the PH isn&rsquo;t one of those listed in the Wikipedia article!</p>

<p>So what does that mean? Are we never getting iOS/Android versions in SEA? Will they (Tencent) release it later? Or there&rsquo;s no word at all?</p>

<p>Has anyone in SEA been able to get the mobile versions? I&rsquo;m from the Philippines, me and my friend in Singapore both can&rsquo;t find the app on the stores. Even when using a direct link, the stores will just say Arena isn&rsquo;t available in the country/region. Any others from SEA countries have any luck?</p>
<p>Have they released any official word on this? Or is there any WOTC staff here who can shed some light on why it&rsquo;s not available in SEA?</p>
<p>So annoyed that the MTG twitter accounts have the audacity to claim Arena is now available &ldquo;everywhere&rdquo; on mobile when it&rsquo;s definitely not.</p>
