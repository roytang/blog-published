<p>So, Manila Water (miss ko na mag bidet and shower). Catching up with all the &ldquo;explanations&rdquo; given out so far, the thing that makes the least sense for me is this: Supposedly MW is allocated 1600mld from Angat Dam, which is insufficient because the demand is at 1750mld. That&rsquo;s around a 9.375% deficit. Given that, why would it be necessary for a large number of areas (I&rsquo;m not sure if there are even unaffected MW service areas) to have service interruptions for majority of the hours of the day? (Over here, I think we get like very weak water pressure a couple of hours a day and that&rsquo;s it). Obviously they can&rsquo;t just cut 9.375% of the hours, they need to add some buffer, that&rsquo;s fine. And households would of course compensate for reduced hours by consuming more during the time they do have water. But why so extreme, so immediately? At worst I would have expected that they cut service hours by at most 50% (so households have water during half the day), then if that&rsquo;s not enough come out with an advisory saying &ldquo;okay, we&rsquo;re still consuming too much water, we need to cut more hours&rdquo;. As it is, their announced service interruption hours are highly inaccurate, so it seems they can&rsquo;t even predict what&rsquo;s going to happen with their service. Conspiracy theories aside, I prefer to attribute all of the issues to sheer incompetence first, but is there something I&rsquo;m missing here, some kind of engineering reason or what, for the service interruptions to be so widespread and unpredictable?</p>
