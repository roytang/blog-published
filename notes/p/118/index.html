<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">On the one hand, it&rsquo;s not really your responsibility. Unless it affects you somehow (i.e. their work in that field is affecting yours)</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">On the other hand, if that person is not aware that he doesn&rsquo;t have talent then it might be better to let him know so that he can decide whether he wants to go on or not. If he is already aware of this, and decides to go on anyway, I don&rsquo;t think you can do anything more.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If you do decide to discuss this with him, try to soften it a little. I would wrap it in concern: &ldquo;Hey, are you doing okay? You always seem like you&rsquo;re having trouble with [field]?&rdquo; Get them to consider other alternatives: &ldquo;If things are so hard, have you ever thought of pursuing some other field like [alternative]?&ldquo;</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If the person is doing well, you want to reward him/her with either a raise or a promotion or both. But to justify a raise/promotion, there is also a perception that you will need to take on additional responsibilities as well. And for many companies, they will reach a point where they are unable to assign further technical responsibilities to a senior developer. At this point, they may consider moving the developer into management. This usually means taking on project management tasks - monitoring the work of other people, managing schedules, trying to help the team meet the schedules/deadlines, resolving conflicts within the team, coordinating and assigning work, etc. Many developers won&rsquo;t have the skills for these tasks and thus many will also be unhappy doing this kind of work. Many will still prefer to keep one foot in the technical side - this means still doing some of the dev work while also taking on management tasks. Some developers who value status or adjustment may prefer moving on to management.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It is always difficult to let go of someone especially if that person was significant in your life. It will come mostly with time, slowly and it&rsquo;s something you can&rsquo;t really hurry. Try to train yourself to redirect your thoughts to something else whenever you think about this person, and keep yourself occupied to avoid stray thoughts. You may never ever forget that person completely (I sometimes find my thoughts wandering back to someone I knew 20 years ago!), but eventually you&rsquo;ll get to the point that you can move on.</p></span></p>

Your brain needs to function on a wide variety of inputs, so try to participate in other activities too. Keeping a healthy balance will give you a wider perspective and will help you attack problems from different angles.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If you are finding it difficult to deal with the interruptions, I suggest taking it up with your manager. Perhaps you can ask that requests for updates should be scheduled at a regular time (so you can prepare), or done via a channel that doesn&rsquo;t interrupt you directly (like email)</p></span></p>

<p>I basically never want to use the feature. How to? There&rsquo;s another question here that answers how to disable it in Linux via a command-line option in .bashrc, but I don&rsquo;t think that can be done in Windows?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>I am on Windows 10</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No Recovery.xcu anywhere on my C drive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>even if I discard recovery data, then the next time I open the same file there is no recovery prompt. But when I shutdown Windows without shutting down LibreOffice first, then I get the prompt the next time I open the file.</p>

Colonel Sanders was almost bankrupt at 65 when he founded KFC and turned his life around. Einstein did poorly in some early school subjects but his name is now synonymous with brilliance.

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">There should be companies willing to hire you fresh out of school, but they will often test you on your knowledge. Ask around about the companies you&rsquo;re planning to apply for and what sort of qualification test they run and prepare accordingly. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Some will test you on specific programming languages and their minutiae. This is kind of a bad idea, as it tests only for rote memorization, a skill increasingly less valuable in the age of search engines. If applying for a company like this, you might want to ask previous applicants about the scope of the questions and study accordingly.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Better companies will test you by asking you to write software to some exercise problem(s). It can be during the interview itself. Some will ask you to do it on paper or on a whiteboard. Even better companies will provide a computer for you to use your programming language of choice and with internet access available as reference. The best interviewers will walk through the exercise with you, sort of a pair-programming exercise, so they can better gauge your abilities. If applying for a company like this, review your algorithms and their usage and try a few practice problems so you can more easily recognize which approaches are applicable to each problem</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">For some people it&rsquo;s easier to live life without making too many difficult decisions. It may just be your perception though. There are many people who are deeper than they appear. Maybe they just have interests that aren&rsquo;t aligned with yours and thus look boring from your POV. That doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t live a fulfilling life. Don&rsquo;t worry too much about them and just make sure your own life is fulfilling :D</p></span></p>

In that case, just look for some smaller steps that maybe might kind of take you in the general direction you want to go and try it out for a while, and after some time sit down again and evaluate whether you want to keep going in that direction or try something else.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Regarding your interest in Japan, here are some suggestions (you&rsquo;ll need to figure out which will work best for you)</p><ol><li>Have you studied the language? Studying the language could lead you to jobs such as translation work. You might want to search for freelance translation work online</li><li>Have you looked into how much it would actually cost to take a trip to Japan? If you have the costs in mind then you can take some other unrelated job first and work towards saving money so you can travel there</li><li>You need to be open to taking on some work/jobs that may not be directly related to your goal, if only to start saving up money that you will need.</li></ol><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It is important too that even though you have a goal or area of interest, you also spend some time to try new things and widen your horizons, as this may unlock other areas of interest that may turn out to be better for you.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Good luck!</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext">The answer is always practice.</p>
<p>Seek out opportunities to speak to people. You can start with smaller groups first to gain confidence. Participate in discussions with your friends. If your friends don&rsquo;t like to have serious discussions, maybe try finding some new ones who do :p</span></p>

Live as if you&rsquo;ll die today&rdquo; - James Dean</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Living each day like it&rsquo;s your last doesn&rsquo;t mean giving up all your earthly possessions or not paying your bills or burning bridges etc. It means making the most of each day and the opportunities it provides. It means not putting off for tomorrow things that you could do today. It means cherishing the people important to you. It means letting go of things that do you no good or otherwise waste your time. </p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">They are still in use. Not all companies follow the latest trends and use the latest technologies. If by relevant you mean you can still find work using those technologies, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll have to worry about it for a while, since there are many active systems using JSP/Servlets for sure. After all, even COBOL specialists can still find work these days :)</p></span></p>
