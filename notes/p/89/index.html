<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Would-you-let-a-junior-developer-be-the-only-developer-on-a-project/answer/Roy-Tang">Would you let a junior developer be the only developer on a project?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are projects where it would be acceptable. Generally small, low-risk projects where there is a sufficient library of similar enough projects for the junior developer to reference how to do the more difficult common stuff (security, auth, audit trails, etc)</p>

<p>Most common is burnout due to inordinate amounts of stress. It’s usually the schedule pressure + some form of bad management.</p>
<p>Some things that can stress software developers out:</p><ul><li>poor team dynamics</li><li>having to work too many hours</li><li>crisis-driven development</li><li>having to do substandard/low-quality work</li><li>incompetent managers not listening to developers or not respecting estimates</li><li>having to deal with constantly changing client requirements</li></ul><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">All of the above are part and parcel of “enterprisey” software development though, but combined with intensive schedule pressure it can make developers question the industry altogether</p>

<p>You have to feel you deserve it. If you don’t, then fake it until you do. Convince yourself, day after day</p>
<p>If you are feeling sad or depressed for an extended period, please consider talking to a professional</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” Liz said, scratching her head.</p>
<p>“What’s not to understand?” The old man looked at her with a look that was somewhere between condescension and amusement. “There’s simply nothing there.”</p>
<p>“You mean like, no one lives there right? Behind your house? Or is it just a steep cliff that I’d fall off if I tried to walk into whatever that mist is?”</p>
<p>The old man shook his head, “No, no. No cliff. A cliff is something after all. There’s nothing there.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand,” Liz repeated, looking even more confused.</p>
<p>“Tell you what, why don’t you go out back, pick up a stick, and poke it through the “mist”, see what happens,” the old man turned his back to her and started fussing around with the oven again, “After all, this pie will be a few more minutes.”</p>
<p>Liz didn’t really have anything to do but wait, so she decided to satisfy her curiosity. She still wasn’t sure if she could fully trust the old man (although he didn’t look he was in any condition to assault anyone), so she picked up her backpack before heading out the door at the back of the kitchen.</p>
<p>She stepped out into a small, grassy back yard (not very well-maintained) surrounded by a number of trees of varying age. Beyond the yard and beyond the trees, a swirling black and grey and white shrouded her view, and she could not see anything more than a few dozen meters from the house. The black and grey and white extended in both directions, as far as her eyes could see, interspersing with the trees that dotted the landscape.</p>
<p>Slowly, Liz walked towards the mysterious black and grey and white. She glanced back at the house as she did so, the aging red-bricked walls no different from the facade she had sighted from the distance. The house looked a lot smaller up close, even though it was two stories. It must have been some trick of perspective that made it look like a mansion when she first spotted it not thirty minutes ago. Or perhaps a trick of her mind, deliriously happy to see smoke coming from t</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Learning to code is not strictly necessary. It would be sufficient to simply have an understanding of how programs execute step-by-step instructions and algorithms. If you’re interviewing programmers, you can simply give them a moderately complex problem and ask them to verbally walk through / explain to you how they would approach the problem (you yourself would need to understand how the problem is typically solved). Sorting algorithms for example, can easily be explained with a few whiteboard diagrams instead of writing code</p>
<p>The larger problem is that it is never easy to identify a good programmer. Even for people who do know how to code! The best way to identify a good programmer is actually to work with them on a project, but of course that option is unlikely during an interview. In general look for high-level skills: ability to step through the solution to a problem (and explain it well), ability to spot possible problems in a given solution (you might try describing a problem you encountered in a previous project and ask how he would address it), ability to work well with others, etc</p>

<p>Practice doing without thinking. Be spontaneous</p>
<p>It can be small, low-risk things. Say hi to strangers. Impulse buy a chocolate bar. Take a different route to work. Eat at unfamiliar restaurants. Buy a book in a genre you don’t usually like. Skip work one afternoon to see a movie. Etc</p>

<p>Philippines.</p>
<p>In the city areas, I think belief in ghosts and the like is comparable to Western countries. It may be more pronounced in the countryside. A lot of people reference local myths of course, but it&rsquo;s not like adults really believe them or anything. There&rsquo;s a lot of old wives tales too but nobody really takes them seriously afaik</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of chinese families here who practice feng shui and the like too</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It depends on what the purpose of the documentation for the non-technical people is</p>
<p>If you’re trying to convince them to try/buy your software, that’s marketing and copywriting, and you have to focus on feature sets and how it will be used by the end user</p>
<p>If it’s for users, to give instructions on how to use the software, typically developers will include some sort of user manual detailing the way to execute various tasks within the application</p>
<p>Regardless of the purpose, documentation written for nontechnical people will tend to focus on use cases and how the software satisfies requirements</p>

<p>Show an interest in what they’re into. Say you’re not too familiar and ask for details. People who like things like it when other people ask about those things.</p>
<p>Please note though that it’s perfectly fine to have different interests from other people. People don’t have to like the same things. It doesn’t mean you can’t hang out with them or anything unless you really want to</p>

<p>For native mobile applications, there is little choice.</p>
<p>Applications running on iOS must be written in either Objective-C or Swift.</p>
<p>Applications running on Android must be written in Java.</p>
<p>That being said, there are frameworks that allow you to write an application in a common language and export the output to be compatible for either Android or iOS. Unity is an example of such a framework, although it’s focused on games</p>

<p>Someone on <a href="https://quora.com">quora</a> asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-life-boring-for-highly-efficient-people/answer/Roy-Tang">Is life boring for highly efficient people?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably not more than inefficient people.</p>
<p>The whole point of being efficient is to be spending less time doing things you don’t like so that you have more time to spend on things you don’t like (which presumably you don’t find boring). So it’s more likely that efficient people are less bored than inefficient ones</p>
<p>Additionally, efficient people will usually find the act of optimizing to become more efficient in and of itself to be an endeavor worth their time, so that part is not boring either</p>

<p>Someone on <a href="https://quora.com">quora</a> asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/If-we-were-to-come-in-contact-with-intelligent-life-and-were-able-to-exchange-messages-how-would-we-understand-each-other/answer/Roy-Tang">If we were to come in contact with intelligent life, and were able to exchange messages, how would we understand each other?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is something that often comes up in science fiction.</p>
<p>Think about the scenario where you are stranded in a foreign country where nobody speaks your language. How would you communicate with the locals? You would look for common signals or signs that they would interpret the same way. For example, if you were thirsty, you would mime drinking from a glass and hope that they get the message. If they don’t understand you would need to try different signs or words and hope that they recognize one of them</p>
<p>Any contact with extraterrestrial intelligence would likely proceed the same way. We have no guarantee of what medium of communication they would use (it is possible they do not use visuals or sounds, but instead through some sort of E-M radiation), so we would have to try all sorts of things to see what they would recognize. Obviously we can’t send out signals in English or such as this would be meaningless to them. One possibility is to use a universally recognizable language - mathematics. We can transmit recognizable mathematical patterns or sequences to establish that we are an intelligent species capable of communication. If we are lucky enough that the alien species can understand visual signals we can show them images to try to explain what we mean, then use a secondary medium such as sound to try to establish our language.</p>
<p>In effect we would have to spend effort to learn how to communicate with each other, largely through trial and error until a reasonable approach can be found. It’s not too different from the usual scientific method approach</p>

<h4 id="posted-on-rwritingprompts-pi-two-monsters--flashback---1885httpsredditcomrwritingpromptscomments4ohvmupi_two_monsters_flashback_1885">Posted on r/WritingPrompts: <a href="https://reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4ohvmu/pi_two_monsters_flashback_1885/">[PI] Two Monsters – Flashback - 1,885</a></h4>
<p>“If you’re going to kill me, then kill me,” the old man said to her without a hint of fear or desperation. “If not, then stand aside.”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding?!?” The young woman in front of him was tall and stocky, her outstretched arm holding the outgun steady not five feet in front of the old man. At this range, she would not miss. “You don’t know how long I’ve been searching for you Scorpion! You don’t deserve a quick death!”</p>
<p>She heard the crowd milling around them start to whisper and murmur. A young man stepped forward, arms raised. “Miss, please. There must be some sort of mistake. This kindly old man is our town doctor.”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “There is no mistake. For years, your little village has hidden a monster!” She addressed the old man again. “Tell them Scorpion!”</p>
<p>All eyes went to the old man and he shut his eyes for a moment. It’s been years now, and that name still haunted him. The memories came back to him easily. The smell of the blood and violence and the poetry in motion. And of course the pride. Always the pride. The Scorpion was the best, which was why he was the most well-known.</p>
<p>Finally, the old man spoke. “I haven’t heard that name in many years… May I ask who sent you?”</p>
<p>“Who sent me?” The young lady sneered. “No one sent me, old man. You probably don’t recognize me. After all, it has been more than twenty years since that night in Albany.”</p>
<p>“Albany… that house on the cliff, wasn’t it?” The old man wasn’t surprised that he could still remember it. The memories don’t really go away. He had scouted the perimeter three times before making his entrance. A sniper bullet took out the man on the balcony, then a quick climb over the fence. Two guards near the back door fell in quick succession seconds after he had drawn his knives. A maidservant was unlucky enough to be in the kitchen. She was a noncombatant, so he made sure she did not suffer. Three more guards in the upper hallway. He had loved it back then, wading into melee with multiple opponents. It was like a dance. A bloody dance as crimson spilled from their necks.</p>
<p>And finally, the bedroom. He had begged for mercy. They’re always so smug while their security was around, but they always beg for mercy in the end. He had pinned the man to the wall and carved his symbol on the man’s chest in blood. The man screamed for all of two minutes before he finally cut his throat. And then a slight noise, a movement nearby, behind him. He spun towards the armoire. He stepped forward and opened the doors wide.</p>
<p>The old man came back to the present. “I see. You were the little girl then.”</p>
<p>“Now you remember!” the woman’s calm exterior started to crumble, the rage building in her voice. “I had to listen to his screams! He was begging for mercy and you made him suffer!” This was it, this was what she had waited for all these years.</p>
<p>Her mind went back as well. All the suffering she had endured. The training she had to go through. The Scorpion was the best, they had told her. Every time she tracked down one of his contacts, it was the same warning. You’ll never get him. She had killed those contacts, but her rage never quelled. Her thirst for vengeance kept her moving forward. If the Scorpion was the best, I would have to be better. She had told herself that time and time again. She had immersed herself in his world. He had vanished off the face of the earth, she was told. But she would find him, and she would make him pay. Following the trail of contacts and clients and assassinations. She took her own contracts, built her own reputation. To earn their respect. The men who knew how to find the Scorpion.</p>
<p>She came back to the present. “They didn’t give you up easily you know. Your old clients. Your contacts. That’s why they all died, slowly. I had to piece together your movements slowly. And finally, where do I find you? Some small backwater village, playing doctor?!?” She sneered again. “I was looking for The Scorpion, the best assassin there ever was! I was ready to show you how I had surpassed you, to make you pay for your sins! And I find you here, this decrepit old man?” She shook her head. “Don’t worry, I’ll make sure you suffer!”</p>
<p>The young man from the crowd turned to the old man. “Doc… is it true, what she’s saying? Are you this… Scorpion?”</p>
<p>“It was a long time ago. I was a different person then…” the old man said.</p>
<p>The woman moved quickly, stepping forward and whipping the old man across the face with the pistol before anyone could react. “A different person? Don’t make me laugh!” she said as the old man staggered back and leaned against the wall. She addressed the crowd. “Murderers don’t change people! He’s a wolf, and he’s been hiding among you sheep for so long, waiting for another chance to bare his fangs!”</p>
<p>The old man spat out some blood and stood up straight again. “You’re a different person too you know,” he said, looking her in the eye. “There was fear in your eyes back then to be sure. But innocence too. And I took it away. I apologize. I may have spared you, but I also condemned you to this life. Your father was not the only life I took in that bedroom that night.”</p>
<p>“Enough!” The woman cocked her gun and aimed it at the old man’s leg. “I don’t need to be told what I’ve lost old man! I’ll blow off your legs, then your arms, then let you bleed out for hours, how does that sound?”</p>
<p>“Please, wait,” the young man said. “He may have been the monster you say, but as our doctor, he’s helped us greatly. He’s a different person now, he’s kind and gentle and&ndash;”
“&ndash;he doesn’t even ask for ourmoney,” one of the old women in the crowd spoke up. “We just pay him in vegetables or invite him over for dinner…”</p>
<p>“&hellip;an’ he took care o’ my ma when she couldn’t work,” a little boy, perhaps no more than twelve was speaking up, “he helped us bring her goods to the merchants, so we could eat…”</p>
<p>Another spoke up, speaking of the old man’s kindness. Then two more, then another. Finally, the woman raised her gun in the air and fired a shot. The bang silenced the crowd and many of them stepped back.</p>
<p>“Shut up, all of you!” the woman said with a quivering voice, “You don’t know this man! He’s killed dozens, maybe hundreds over the years! A few acts of kindness won’t excuse that!”</p>
<p>“B-but,” the young man spoke again, “if he has killed so many people, why did he spare you?”</p>
<p>The woman was silent for a moment. Then she pointed the gun at the old man’s head again. “I don’t know old man, why <em>did</em> you spare me? You’re the Scorpion, you were a merciless killer. Why the moment of weakness?”</p>
<p>“Weakness was it?” The old man spoke again, calmly and softly. “It’s true, I had taken many lives before that night. But I had never killed a child.” He looked her in the eye again. “I told you, I saw the innocence in your eyes. It changed me. And I fled. If you spoke to my clients, you know I never took the payment for that night. And I have never killed again.”</p>
<p>“Never killed again?!? What bullshit is this old man? You expect me to believe that?” She was practically shouting at his face. “Everyone I spoke to, they told me about The Scorpion’s bloodlust, his need to kill. And you expect me to believe you just walked away from that?!?”</p>
<p>He looked at her, this time with pity. “You can’t imagine it, can you? Because you have it now. That bloodlust, that rage. You can’t imagine your heart changing so much that it takes it all away. You’ve lived with this rage for so long, you can’t imagine life without it. I am truly sorry.”</p>
<p>She spun her arm around to pistol-whip him again, but this time the old man caught her arm in mid-air. Her rage momentarily gave way to surprise, then almost immediately to alertness. She quickly wrested her arm and stepped back. “I knew it. Your old instincts, all still there eh?”</p>
<p>He did not answer her but instead pointed towards the far end of the town plaza. “Those two men you shot. They are still alive. Let me tend to their wounds, stabilize them. Afterwards, you can do with me as you wish.”</p>
<p>Her eyebrow went up. “Hah! You’re just going to let me kill you?”</p>
<p>“You said I deserved it, didn’t you? I won’t disagree.” He picked up the small bag he had dropped earlier. “My medical instruments, don’t worry.” He started walking slowly towards the injured men. “As you can see, I could not run from you even if I wanted.”</p>
<p>She looked skeptical, but she let him pass and followed just behind him. The small crowd followed them. The old man knelt beside one of the victims, who had been shot in the shoulder. He began tending the wounds. She watched him silently.</p>
<p>“Perhaps it is fitting that you should be the one to kill me,” the old man spoke finally as he moved on to the second victim. “After all, you were the one who changed me.” She didn’t respond so he kept going. “I tried to kill myself you know. I could never do it. The famous killer, afraid to take his own life. Finally I decided, I could not take back the sins of my past, but perhaps I can balance the scales, even a little bit. I’ve been a doctor here for almost eight years now, but I fear I’m no longer as strong as I used to be. I would not have been of use to them much longer. And so I can at least give you your vengeance. One final act of atonement.” He finished dressing the wound.</p>
<p>He stood up and looked at her. “I can only hope that you too find someone to change you, once you have taken your vengeance. Perhaps you can move on, and this cycle of death can end.”</p>
<p>“Move on?” She finally spoke again, slowly and in a lower voice this time, all trace of rage gone, only bitterness remained. “To what? I don’t have anything, old man.” She raised her gun again. “All I have is vengeance. All I have is the monster I’ve been hunting down all my life. And now I find the monster is gone!”</p>
<p>He stepped towards her slowly. She did not waver, her arm outstretched. “Then there is but one more monster to slay,” the old man said. This time he reached his own hand out and tapped her chest lightly. “The monster you have become.”</p>
<p>She wept, and fell to her knees.</p>
