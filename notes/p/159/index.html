<div class="content e-content">

<p>The DC universe rebooted back in September 2011, which may be causing some of your confusion. Martian Manhunter used to be a big part of one of the Jusice League incarnations before this reboot. In the current universe, he has some sort of history with the Justice League but was never a full member I think.</p>
<p>In the current universe (the new 52):</p>
<p>Justice League - team of heroes formed during the Darkseid invasion five years ago, basically kicked off an age of superheroes</p>
<p>Justice League of America - the US government (ARGUS)&rsquo;s attempt to form a counterbalance to the Justice League. Basically they want to have their own Justice League that they can control.</p>
<p>Justice League Dark - a team of magic-related heroes hanging out together for one reason or another. Unaffiliated with either the JL or the JLA</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Time and effort and cost (assets, etc.) and the story all factor in. Some stories are stronger when told in a straight/linear fashion.</p>
<p>The term laziness here upsets me for some reason (nothing personal). Might be because I&rsquo;m a programmer and I understand what it means to need to cut content or features or avoid feature-creep in order to meet budgets and schedules. It&rsquo;s not like &ldquo;branching paths&rdquo; are on a standard RPG checklist and developers are just &ldquo;naw, fuck that&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That being said, there are still a lot of very nonlinear RPGs around. The Fallout series and the Elder Scrolls games come to mind, and I think the Witcher series offers a lot of choice too.</p>

<p>Well, that might take a while longer then. &ldquo;The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time.

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/1gu122/digital_download_vs_physical_copy/">&#39;Digital download vs physical copy&#39; on /r/3DS</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>I always get physical for 3ds. I buy digital on Steam and PSN and the AppStore, but not on the eShop because Nintendo won&rsquo;t implement the primary advantage digital downloads for me: tying the purchase to an account so that even if something bad happens to my device I can still access the game on a future device. It&rsquo;s doubly important for handhelds!</p>
