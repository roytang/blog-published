<p>Practice solving puzzles to get better at math. Not necessarily math puzzles (those are fine), but also logic puzzles will help. Try the book Satan, Cantor and Infinity</p>
<p>For remembering things, try to exercise your memory in everyday locations. For example whenever you go to the grocery store, choose a thing that you like to buy, say potato chips. Look at the row of potato chips on sale and try to memorize the order of the brands as arranged on the shelf. Then the next time you go to the store, see how well you remembered it.</p>
<p>You can also look into/research the memory technique called the memory palace. There&rsquo;s a TED talk about it somewhere.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It can be something as simple as a checklist that you verify at the end of the period to make sure you&rsquo;ve done all the necessary things. Add a reminder/notification to your phone to remind you to do the thing you have to do for your goal. Tell your friends about your goal to keep you honest.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Practice, practice, practice.</p>
<p>Try tracing out pictures for a while. Get a sheet of paper that you can partly see through and overlay it on an existing image of a face and a body. Depending on the paper you might not be able to see much detail, but you can trace the outline and general location of the facial details and also the general body proportions.</p>
<p>Most artists will use outline figures, like ovals and circles and lines, to outline the general placement of body parts and proportions. There&rsquo;s an example of this at <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Draw-People">How to Draw People</a></p>
<p>Once you have the rough outline, either from a sketch or what, you can fill out the details however you like</p>
<p>Try to draw first from reference images that you can see, not just ones you have in your head, it will be easier. After a lot of practice, you will be more easily able to translate the images in your head to drawings by hand.</p>
<p>If you use reddit, there&rsquo;s a subreddit I&rsquo;ve found helpful, it&rsquo;s <a href="http://reddit.com/r/sketchdaily,">http://reddit.com/r/sketchdaily,</a> you might want to check it out.</p>

<p>Typically, a database administrator will have the following tasks:</p><ol><li>Database installation and configuration</li><li>Maintenance - version upgrades and applying patches</li><li>Migration - transferring data from one database to another, or an older database version to another</li><li>Setting up regular backups and planning for recovery procedures</li><li>Configure security models</li><li>Storage and capacity planning - this means monitoring the disk storage used by the database</li><li>Performance monitoring and tuning - users will complain if the database slows to a crawl! Tuning here can mean modifying SQL statements or stored procedures to improve performance</li><li>General database troubleshooting</li><li>Maintaining data integrity - this means making sure the data in the tables and the relationships between them are &ldquo;correct&rdquo;. Typically a database will have internal mechanisms to ensure this, such as foreign keys (which may be configured by the database administrator also), and applications using the database will have their own set of rules that they impose upon the data. However, the applications aren&rsquo;t always correct, so that may from time to time require running SQL scripts to correct any data errors that arise from misconfiguration or application errors</li></ol><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Hope that helps!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried your level, it&rsquo;s fun and seems to be just the right amount of difficulty, although I had a bit more retries at the last room than I was happy with haha. Cleared and starred!</p>

<p>Leave at 5:30am, look for a nice place to have breakfast in Makati. Get some work done remotely at a Starbucks or chill somewhere and read a book without having to sit 3 hours in traffic.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Having a mix of skills will be incredibly valuable for you since it makes you &ldquo;rarer&rdquo;. Look for the place where your skills/interests intersect - that is a good niche for you to pursue since there will be fewer people to compete with. i.e. look for programming work where an economics domain would be an advantage, or work for an economics graduate (I have no idea what that entails LOL) where you can leverage your programming knowledge (maybe via program-assisted data crunching or analysis). It&rsquo;s better than competing against everyone who is a programmer.</p>

<p>Try turning your suggestions into questions, which suggests inviting input from others. Instead of &ldquo;In my opinion, telling this to the client will not be received well.&rdquo;, try &ldquo;Do you think the client will receive this well?&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a difficult fear, and it may take a lot of practice to get over. Not all fears have reasonable causes, but that&rsquo;s okay. To overcome fear you do not need to rationalize it, you only need to confront it.</p>
<p>Basically you need to start confronting this fear in small doses. It&rsquo;s best if you have friends you can count on and that are aware of your fear and willing to help.</p>
<p>Practice being comfortable around small groups of people first. Try taking the bus to/from school or work, if possible. Better if you can ride the bus with a friend.</p>
<p>Do your shopping errands at different grocery stores, find one where you feel slightly uncomfortable with the amount of people there and do your grocery shopping there for a while. When you get used to it, look for another grocery store that might be more difficult for you.</p>
<p>Bring a friend when you need to navigate through a large crowd (say, at the shopping mall or such). Having a friend along will make you a bit more comfortable.</p>
<p>Practice small talk. Say hi to the cashier at the grocery store, or the bus driver on your way to work. You don&rsquo;t need to think of anything else to say beyond &ldquo;Hi, how are you doing?&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t worry if you have trouble responding, just smile and try again next time.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>Edit: You don&rsquo;t always need to be outgoing and confident! It&rsquo;s perfectly acceptable to sometimes want to curl up in bed all day and stay away from people :)</p>

<p>If you are depressed, it is best to talk to a professional. This is the very first thing you should do.</p>
<p>Also see if you can share your fears and anxieties with friends and family and ask for their support. Maybe you also fear telling them about it, but that&rsquo;s fine. You&rsquo;ve already taken the first step of asking people on the internet for help anyway. If you have trouble telling them your problems, you can send them the link to this question :) Try to ask friends or family members who you think will likely be supportive.</p>
<p>For your everyday fears, try facing them one at a time. Try the easiest ones first. Try a break in your routine. Go to a different coffee shop. Say hi to the barista (any small talk after that is optional!) When you go get a haircut ask the barber to suggest a different look. Or ask him how his family is doing. Little things, one at a time. It&rsquo;s ok to fail too. Every attempt is already a victory.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s up to you to decide whether another person is worth risking heartbreak for. And you can avoid ever getting attached to anyone if you really want to avoid heartbreak. But if you do that, are you even really living?</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t let negative people get you down. Most often the people trying to drag you down are insecure about their own position and in seeing you working hard they feel some insecurity because they are stuck in their own mediocrity. As long as you are doing what you believe is right and you are not hurting other people, you shouldn&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>If those people are affecting you negatively, you might want to consider avoiding them or cutting them out of your life entirely</p>

<p>Just a fun thing: the stage the screenshots are on is the one where there used to be an Alex-looking character in the background and he&rsquo;s no longer there</p>

<p>Someone on <a href="https://quora.com">quora</a> asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Be-Positive-How-do-I-tell-someone-theyre-not-talented-in-a-field-they-really-want-to-pursue/answer/Roy-Tang">Be Positive: How do I tell someone they&rsquo;re not talented in a field they really want to pursue?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the one hand, it&rsquo;s not really your responsibility. Unless it affects you somehow (i.e. their work in that field is affecting yours)</p>
<p>On the other hand, if that person is not aware that he doesn&rsquo;t have talent then it might be better to let him know so that he can decide whether he wants to go on or not. If he is already aware of this, and decides to go on anyway, I don&rsquo;t think you can do anything more.</p>
<p>If you do decide to discuss this with him, try to soften it a little. I would wrap it in concern: &ldquo;Hey, are you doing okay? You always seem like you&rsquo;re having trouble with [field]?&rdquo; Get them to consider other alternatives: &ldquo;If things are so hard, have you ever thought of pursuing some other field like [alternative]?&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If the person is doing well, you want to reward him/her with either a raise or a promotion or both. But to justify a raise/promotion, there is also a perception that you will need to take on additional responsibilities as well. And for many companies, they will reach a point where they are unable to assign further technical responsibilities to a senior developer. At this point, they may consider moving the developer into management. This usually means taking on project management tasks - monitoring the work of other people, managing schedules, trying to help the team meet the schedules/deadlines, resolving conflicts within the team, coordinating and assigning work, etc. Many developers won&rsquo;t have the skills for these tasks and thus many will also be unhappy doing this kind of work. Many will still prefer to keep one foot in the technical side - this means still doing some of the dev work while also taking on management tasks. Some developers who value status or adjustment may prefer moving on to management.</p>

<p>For specific technical skills (programming languages, frameworks, platforms and such), it&rsquo;s literally impossible to say. Technology advances quickly and at a pace difficult to predict. We probably can&rsquo;t even predict what will be in use 5 years down the line, let alone 15 years.</p>
<p>Focus on soft skills and technical principles that will be the same no matter the technology being used:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Learn to communicate well. That means listening and reading and writing and speaking and good grammar and conveying your ideas clearly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding of design patterns in software. Such design patterns are prevalent regardless of the technology in use (although they may look slightly different on each platform)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User interface design - that includes presentation, ease of use, etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business/requirements analysis - fleshing out requirements from clients, etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working well with other people. That means managing conflict, knowing how to help people who are doing poorly, and learning from people who are doing well, and being able to work well with teams and schedules</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bias towards learning and self-improvement - should be self-explanatory. Always seek to further and improve yourself</p>
</li>
</ol>

</blockquote>
<p>Hahaha no.</p>
<p>Assessing programming skill is highly difficult and subjective. There&rsquo;s not even an objective metric that would take <em>a year</em> to measure. Sure, in a year&rsquo;s time you could figure out whether a programmer is &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; (already subjective), but even then comparing against other programmers (&ldquo;better&rdquo; or &ldquo;worse&rdquo;) will still be highly subjective. There&rsquo;s nothing like say &ldquo;programmer A is 89%, while programmer B is 72%, so we&rsquo;ll pick programmer A&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Think about WHY you need to convince them you&rsquo;re not crazy?</p>
<p>I understand the need to have your family understand what you&rsquo;re doing, even if you&rsquo;re not dependent on them for financial reasons. If you really need to explain it to them, try to communicate that:</p><ol><li>This is something you&rsquo;ve always wanted to do</li><li>You&rsquo;ve thought about the risks and consequences thoroughly</li><li>You&rsquo;ve prepared some measures in case it doesn&rsquo;t work out - you have a buffer of savings, etc (if you haven&rsquo;t done this, you should consider doing it first!)</li><li>Set a time limit (I&rsquo;m going to take 1 year off to try to pursue this dream, if it doesn&rsquo;t work out, I can go back to my other field)</li></ol><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Good luck!</p>

<p>It is always difficult to let go of someone especially if that person was significant in your life. It will come mostly with time, slowly and it&rsquo;s something you can&rsquo;t really hurry. Try to train yourself to redirect your thoughts to something else whenever you think about this person, and keep yourself occupied to avoid stray thoughts. You may never ever forget that person completely (I sometimes find my thoughts wandering back to someone I knew 20 years ago!), but eventually you&rsquo;ll get to the point that you can move on.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/When-you-pour-your-heart-into-something-and-it-fails-what-does-that-mean-show/answer/Roy-Tang">When you pour your heart into something and it fails what does that mean/show?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can put 100% of your effort into something and do everything right and make no mistakes and have the right circumstances and in the end still fail. That is not your failing, that is life. That&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>Life isn&rsquo;t deterministic. We can&rsquo;t predict outcomes perfectly, nor should we try to. We don&rsquo;t do things because we will surely succeed. We do things because we are willing to risk failure for the chance to succeed.</p>
<p>There will be a tendency to be disheartened, when you put your all into something and it falls apart. This is only natural. But you have to learn to accept failure, learn from the mistakes, learn how to manage the risks, and move on.</p>
<p>Life goes on.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve had corrupt presidents before. We&rsquo;ll probably survive. We are surprisingly resilient that way. Obviously things could be better, but if it comes to pass we would just have to be more vigilant against abuses.</p>

<p>If you are already using up 8-10 hours a day just for math, you may be overdoing it already. Your brain needs to function on a wide variety of inputs, so try to participate in other activities too. Keeping a healthy balance will give you a wider perspective and will help you attack problems from different angles.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If you are finding it difficult to deal with the interruptions, I suggest taking it up with your manager. Perhaps you can ask that requests for updates should be scheduled at a regular time (so you can prepare), or done via a channel that doesn&rsquo;t interrupt you directly (like email)</p>
