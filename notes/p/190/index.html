<p>Thor: GOT is very good.</p>
<p>Cable and X-force is a bit meh. Uncanny X-Force is better IMHO</p>
<p>Look into X-Men #1 coming out this week.</p>
<p>Consider: Daredevil, Captain Marvel, Young Avengers</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>The characters are all owned by Marvel. Marvel is owned by Disney.</p>
<p>Sony doesnt &ldquo;own&rdquo; the Spider-man franchise. Sony has an exclusive license from Marvel to use Spider-man in movies; that means only they can produce Spider-man movies. The license is from before Marvel had their own movie studio.</p>
<p>Fox also has a similar license for the X-Men/Fantastic Four.</p>
<p>For any characters where Marvel hasn&rsquo;t given anyone else an exclusive movie license, they can use those characters in their own movies.</p>

<p>You can get what is currently free. As long as you have &ldquo;purchased&rdquo; a free game, it stays in your download list and you can redownload it any time as long as your subscription is active, even after it rotates from the IGC.</p>
<p>This should be in the sidebar, it gets asked all the time.</p>
