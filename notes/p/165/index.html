<div class="content e-content">

<p>He became Apocalypse and Wolverine&rsquo;s Uncanny X-Force were forced to kill him. In his place, the Life Seed grew something new, resembling Warren, but it&rsquo;s apparently not him at all.</p>

<p>Because you&rsquo;re making it sound like the current through any particular wire is constant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Forgive me if I gave that impression, but it&rsquo;s not (as my last post mentioned &ldquo;if you measured the current in the wire <em>at that time</em>). The current passing through a wire or being drawn by a device can change, the same way voltages can change or through switching.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>When I say &ldquo;this wire has 2 amperes&rdquo;, I just mean that if you measured the current in the wire at that time, it would be 2 amperes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if wires are rated that way. (They probably are for safety purposes)</p>

<p>Does the story mode cover the entire One Piece manga run? Or just select parts? Or it&rsquo;s an original story?</p>
<p>Also, do you think it would it be better to buy OP:PW (I can probably find a used one somewhere for cheap), or wait for OP:PW2 (being released later this year)?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>If the Xbox One (a) lets me play all my PS3 discs and PSN downloads AND (b) had an online service that gave out lots of value in free games, that&rsquo;d turn me for sure. I&rsquo;m not terrible interested in Xbox franchises like Halo or Gears of War. (I originally typed GoW, but realized that means God of War)</p>
<p>PS4 has (b) but not (a), but I&rsquo;m not rushing out to get that on release date either, and I figure given enough time and Gaikai, Sony would be able to figure something out for (a)</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>It would have to be enough life to stave off death from aggro attacks for 2-3 turns because (a) you wasted a turn casting it and (b) you still need to naturally draw into whatever answer you&rsquo;re looking for within the window the life gain gives you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say 12 might be borderline playable, depending on the environment. 15 is already reasonable and will probably see sideboard play. 20 seems a bit overboard, but it could be balanced if aggro becomes really strong/fast</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>July and August might get fairly rainy.</p>
<p>Weekend trips: the popular ones are the beaches (Boracay, etc), there are cheap local flights if you buy ahead of time. You can also head up north to Baguio, it&rsquo;s a nice place, though people usually travel there during summer (April-May)</p>
<p>Safety is a concern, yes, but don&rsquo;t let that stop you. Just be more wary especially if you&rsquo;re in a seedy-looking area. I think the Makati central business district is pretty safe most of the time.</p>
<p>Most people will have some level of English understanding, though some might respond to you in broken English. A few key phrases might help, but are unnecessary.</p>
<p>The basketball thing, hard to say, you have to know people who participate in leagues (the local term is &ldquo;liga&rdquo;). If you&rsquo;re working for a big company, the employees there will be able to help you, most guys are basketball fans.</p>
<p>Have fun and enjoy your stay!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see it as a problem. We don&rsquo;t know how large the print run is going to be (people are just speculating about it), and no matter how limited it was, it&rsquo;s still adding some N number of modern legal cards into the wild, which is better than adding 0.</p>

<p>&ldquo;unmanipulated open market&rdquo; is exactly why MM is expensive - demand is high and buyers are willing to pay at a high price and sellers are free to sell at the price (because the market is &ldquo;unmanipulated&rdquo; and &ldquo;open&rdquo;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would you feel if you ripped a Voice of Resurgence from a booster pack and Wizards told you that you could only sell it for $5 or trade for another card with the same rarity 1:1?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if there was some magical way to force retailers to sell product at MSRP, buyers will just turn around and sell them at expensive prices because that&rsquo;s what the market is willing to pay. Again, supply and demand.</p>

<p>Back when I was a chubby, weird, nerdy kid who was very worried that I’d always and forever be that gigantic, that awkward, and that trapped in my own weirdness, I used to think “Well, Peter Parker used to be this nerd who everyone picked on and no one understood, then he became this cool hero with a fun job who married this beautiful model who loved him.” And then I’d think, “It won’t be this bad forever.”</p>
<p>This picture reminded me of that. Haven’t thought about that kid in a long time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If “The Amazing Spider-Man 2” was actually just a slideshow of Andrew Garfield in his Spider-Man costume talking to and playing basketball with kids, I’d be fine with that.</p>
<p>And in so many ways it would actually speak much more to what Spider-Man really is than anything they could ever capture in a script.</p>

<p>Misleading title, and linking directly to his twitter profile means anyone who clicks the link after 24 hours will have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about. (It&rsquo;s only been 4 hours and I had to read the comments to figure out what you&rsquo;re talking about)</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t really enjoy ToA (haven&rsquo;t finished yet, but I&rsquo;m about 80% through the game). Too much unnecessary walking around for me.</p>
<p>Dunno about EO4, but I enjoyed the demo.</p>
