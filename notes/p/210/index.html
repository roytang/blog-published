<p>Is this really how people pronounce it? Spelling out the &ldquo;N&rdquo;, &ldquo;E&rdquo; and &ldquo;S&rdquo;? I&rsquo;ve always pronounced it as &ldquo;Esness&rdquo; (and logically, &ldquo;Esness Nine Ex&rdquo;)</p>

<p>I already have Mount and Blade, but it&rsquo;s still a couple of games from the top of my to-play list (still haven&rsquo;t finished going through everything I bought at the last Steam sale :p) What about Fire and Sword? Should I get it? There&rsquo;s a 10% off preorders at the moment.</p>

<p>Maybe she prepares everything ahead of time and just has shell scripts to run. That way she impresses all the noobs who have no idea how she does all this so fast. Do I get a no-prize?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s about as bad as Garcia from Criminal Minds, who can basically search for any information in no time flat unless the plot gods say it&rsquo;s too difficult.</p>
<p>Most of the time it doesn&rsquo;t bother me though. It&rsquo;s just TV.</p>

<p>I have 3 King&rsquo;s Bounty games that I apparently got back during the Steam holiday sales. Legend, Crossroads and Armored Princess. Just starting to play them now, surprisingly fun. What order should I play them in?</p>
