<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can convince old people of anything, they tend to be set in their ways. But it&rsquo;s worth a try: Grandma, don&rsquo;t eat 5-year old food!</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Don&rsquo;t feign confidence, <strong>be</strong> confident.</p>
<p>Take as many opportunities as you can to try to strike up conversations - don&rsquo;t restrict yourself to parties, and don&rsquo;t restrict yourself just to girls you want to hit on</p>
<p>Just keep trying, be yourself, you&rsquo;ll get used to it eventually.</p>

<p>Given a JSF/EJB stack, how do I filter the contents of a dataTable listing automatically using the values of a field in a pojo/entity bean?</p>
<p>i.e. I have an entity bean Employee with name field having a value of &ldquo;John&rdquo; I would like to use this bean to filter the data table to show only records with name John, and not having to construct the where clause manually?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get a sense of what are the most commonly-used Java web frameworks, with a focus on large, enterprisey projects. I&rsquo;m interested in which one is most favored by companies/enterprises (which may not be the same as the one most favored by developers or the open source community I guess). I&rsquo;d also like to be able to cite specific projects used by each framework, preferably big-ticket or well-known ones.</p>
<p>Anyone have any idea about this stuff or can point me in the right direction?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I just crafted four times and got four X% off Valve coupons. I love it. Anyone want to trade for some other coupons?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s been a good sale and christmas hunt. I did get one game from the gift pile (SpaceChem), and bought quite a few cheap ones.</p>
<p>I hope you guys had a good holiday sale :D</p>

<p>DX:HR or the Witcher 2 would be great if possible. Some other hopefuls:  Magicka (with all DLC preferably?), Audiosurf, Shogun 2, Might and Magic Clash of Heroes, SPAZ. Please don&rsquo;t ask me how many coals I want for a game, just make an offer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also consider other games, just make an offer here.</p>
<p>Thanks :D</p>
<p>Edit: I only get to check Reddit every few hours or so, so I may not reply immediately. Cheers.</p>

<p>nope, real life is harsher. sorry dude.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not trying to discourage you, but the &ldquo;standard meta decks&rdquo; are tuned by hundreds of players regularly, that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re standard. it&rsquo;s difficult for a lone player with a rogue deck to match the level of tuning these decks have.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying you can&rsquo;t do it, there&rsquo;s a chance you&rsquo;ve hit on some interesting concept that may crush a lot of other decks out there. or maybe you&rsquo;re a deckbuilding genius savant, i dunno.</p>

<p>If those are the DLC you&rsquo;re buying, then yeah, you would have a problem. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I managed to get 2 pretty good Fallout:New Vegas DLCs for the price of those &ldquo;few guns&rdquo;</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>I like the Civ DLC. I don&rsquo;t enjoy map packs, but then again I don&rsquo;t have to buy them. But I like the additional civs being added every now and then. Keeps the game fresh. In fact, I&rsquo;d like to have as many civs as possible, but I don&rsquo;t want to have to wait forever for that game. And with Steam, I never have to buy them full price, I just wait for the next big sale.</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t mind not having religion or corporations, I already have Civ4 for that. :D</p>

<p>Does anyone know if there is a java API provided for OpenText eDocs (formerly Hummingbird DM)?</p>
<p>Our experience in using it in our webapp is limited to client-side access using ActiveX, we&rsquo;d like to know if there&rsquo;s a way to access the API on the server side using Java</p>
