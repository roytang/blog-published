    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ufzj5/question_about_the_true_chronology_of_orson_scott/">&#39;Question about the &#39;true&#39; chronology of Orson Scott Card&#39;s &#39;Ender&#39;s Game&#39; series.&#39; on /r/books</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>The biggest jump is between Ender&rsquo;s Game and Speaker of the Dead, not only in terms of time (since Speaker takes place way in the future where only Ender and Val are carried over from Ender&rsquo;s Game&rsquo;s cast), but also in terms of story style.</p>
<p>I would recommend reading first Ender&rsquo;s Game, then Ender&rsquo;s Shadow. After that, decide whether you want to follow Ender branch (this is far future space exploration, dealing with aliens stuff) or Bean branch (this is more of post-Ender&rsquo;s Game earth politics/warfare)&hellip; I would guess that if you liked the battle school aspect of Ender&rsquo;s Game with the kids being all smart and tactical, you would prefer Bean branch first. if you prefer the sci-fi aspect of it all, then you would probably prefer the Ender branch.</p>
<p>Ender branch is (in order of the story timeline): Ender&rsquo;s Game -&gt; Ender in Exile -&gt; Speaker for the Dead -&gt; Xenocide -&gt; Children of the Mind</p>
<p>Bean branch is Ender&rsquo;s Shadow -&gt; Shadow of the Hegemon -&gt; Shadow Puppets -&gt; Shadow of the Giant -&gt; Shadows in Flight</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Wild Ricochet is a legal target while it is resolving. The last step of spell resolution is:</p>
<p>608.2k As the final part of an instant or sorcery spell&rsquo;s resolution, the spell is put into its owner&rsquo;s graveyard. As the final part of an ability&rsquo;s resolution, the ability is removed from the stack and ceases to exist.</p>

<p>James Clavell&rsquo;s Shogun was the first full-length novel I ever read (unless you count Hardy Boys books or something), I&rsquo;ve probably gone through the whole book around 8-10 times now, that&rsquo;s not counting times I went back and just re-read some chapters I liked</p>
