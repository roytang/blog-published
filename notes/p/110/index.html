<p>Someone on <a href="https://quora.com">quora</a> asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-people-make-amends/answer/Roy-Tang">Why can&rsquo;t people make amends?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">There are many reasons, but the most common is probably pride. They don&rsquo;t want to admit that maybe they were wrong or at least partially responsible for any rift. This pride may manifest in making up reasons not to make amends (&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need him, etc&rdquo;)</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">That being said, there are valid reasons for letting go of a friendship and not bothering to make amends. One is if a friendship is not good/healthy for you, for example if the friend is a bad influence, or he is always hurting you and taking advantage of you. In such cases, not making amends and just letting go of the friendship is understandable</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The answer to that depends entirely on you - do you think the point of life is just to eat, go to bars and have fun? Do you think there&rsquo;s more to life than that?</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Do what you want and enjoy life, but maybe try not to burn up or use up all your resources, money, etc. People can change and mellow with age, and maybe at a later date your priorities will change and you will wish you had saved just a bit more money.</p></span></p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>This was for the Dacer-Corbito double murder case. He was cleared of it by the SC in 2011 so he was able to return home.</p>
<p>However, I think it speaks a bit ill of him that he chose to evade the law until he was cleared. (I guess some would say it&rsquo;s justifiable given our justice system, but as a lawmaker and police officer maybe he should be one of the first to abide by the rules)</p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">When there is no index in use, you are essentially performing a sequential search (iterating through each row and testing it to see if it matches your criteria), which means the search performs at O(n). If you limit your results to the first hit (using TOP 1 as pointed out by Scott Berry), the average number of checks is n/2 where n is the total size of the sample set. If there is no limit, the average number of checks is n (since you check all rows)</p></span></p>

<p>In my opinion his stint as MMDA chair wasn&rsquo;t too good, particularly on traffic management (although that was a really tough job anyway)</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also responsible for the lewd dancing girls incident at an LP sortie (he owned up to it and withdrew from the LP Senate slate)</p>
