<p>Someone on <a href="https://quora.com">quora</a> asked:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-so-much-support-for-Rodrigo-Duterte-in-the-Philippines/answer/Roy-Tang">Why is there so much support for Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He appeals to a set of primal instincts - he does things people wish they could do but they can&rsquo;t because of social norms and whatnot. He feeds on people&rsquo;s fear, anger and discontent. They cheer him on because he does what they cannot - and it lets the supporters feel the euphoria of lashing out at a system that they feel has failed them, without actually doing it themselves.</p>
<p>Jessica Zafra has a great article on this: <a href="http://interaksyon.com/article/126627/jessica-zafra--of-course-you-love-duterte--he-is-your-id">http://interaksyon.com/article/126627/jessica-zafra--of-course-you-love-duterte--he-is-your-id</a></p>

<p>Read to him often and encourage him to read by buying him books appropriate to his age. Instill a love of reading into him.</p>
<p>Teach him to be kind, and to share, and to help people.</p>
<p>Give him some small, minor chores like picking up his own clothes. Teach him to be responsible for his own messes by asking him to help clean up.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s never too late to be who you were meant to be.</p>
<p>That being said, it will be a bit more difficult to get into the industry the traditional way (companies are not likely to hire you). You will more likely be able to find work on a freelance basis.</p>

<p>BTW, if you know anyone at the COMELEC, I know of a senior software engineer with a lot of experience in website security who currently has a lot of free time and is willing to help avoid further incidents (for a reasonable consultancy fee of course).

<p>Someone on <a href="https://quora.com">quora</a> asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-people-make-amends/answer/Roy-Tang">Why can&rsquo;t people make amends?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many reasons, but the most common is probably pride. They don&rsquo;t want to admit that maybe they were wrong or at least partially responsible for any rift. This pride may manifest in making up reasons not to make amends (&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need him, etc&rdquo;)</p>
<p>That being said, there are valid reasons for letting go of a friendship and not bothering to make amends. One is if a friendship is not good/healthy for you, for example if the friend is a bad influence, or he is always hurting you and taking advantage of you. In such cases, not making amends and just letting go of the friendship is understandable</p>

<p>Confidence. Communication. Presentation. Connections.</p>
<p>As an engineer I tend to value function over form, but though I hate to admit it, we live in a society where many times form matters, which means putting your best foot forward and maybe trying to appear more presentable and confident than you usually are.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Ive-spent-every-penny-that-I-have-made-on-food-bars-and-just-having-fun-Have-I-missed-the-point-of-life/answer/Roy-Tang">I&rsquo;ve spent every penny that I have made on food, bars and just having fun. Have I missed the point of life?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer to that depends entirely on you - do you think the point of life is just to eat, go to bars and have fun? Do you think there&rsquo;s more to life than that?</p>
<p>Do what you want and enjoy life, but maybe try not to burn up or use up all your resources, money, etc. People can change and mellow with age, and maybe at a later date your priorities will change and you will wish you had saved just a bit more money.</p>

<p>This was for the Dacer-Corbito double murder case. He was cleared of it by the SC in 2011 so he was able to return home.</p>
<p>However, I think it speaks a bit ill of him that he chose to evade the law until he was cleared. (I guess some would say it&rsquo;s justifiable given our justice system, but as a lawmaker and police officer maybe he should be one of the first to abide by the rules)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-searches-does-it-take-on-average-to-find-a-row-when-not-indexed-in-MySQL-database/answer/Roy-Tang">How many searches does it take on average to find a row when not indexed in MySQL database?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When there is no index in use, you are essentially performing a sequential search (iterating through each row and testing it to see if it matches your criteria), which means the search performs at O(n). If you limit your results to the first hit (using TOP 1 as pointed out by Scott Berry), the average number of checks is n/2 where n is the total size of the sample set. If there is no limit, the average number of checks is n (since you check all rows)</p>

<p>The first post remains neutral. The additional info I put in a separate post. I only put cons here because that&rsquo;s the info I have. The whole point of the exercise is for people to provide any info they have also, so if you have additional info (whether pro or con), you can comment them also.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s already an abundance of information on the presidential candidates. People just need to decide which flaws they are willing to overlook. That being said, I do have a spreadsheet I&rsquo;ve been using to help decide, but it is quite specific to my own stand on the issues. If you are still undecided you may find it useful: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MTPMAhGCiG_7jWC0vLNnJNQLPXGbBBLlfHri8-RqgaI/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MTPMAhGCiG_7jWC0vLNnJNQLPXGbBBLlfHri8-RqgaI/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>For VP, I have no inputs as I have already made my choice.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think coding skill is strictly necessary. However, it would be a good idea to have a decent understanding of how the software development process works.</p>

<p>You can take certification courses online. I know from first-hand experience that Java certification exams are taken online. Many employers look favorably upon applicants that have certifications. However, they are usually expensive to take.</p>

<p>Well, you probably know the famous quote:</p><blockquote><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Some people, when confronted with a problem, think &ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;ll use regular expressions.&rdquo; Now they have two problems. - Jamie Zawisnki</p></blockquote><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">That being said, regular expressions can be a good approach for particular problems. Sifting through JSON however, does not sound like one of them. Why not? JSON is already a structured format that has elements you can easily iterate through using normal programming constructs. I&rsquo;m assuming you mean using regular expressions to search through JSON data by treating the entire JSON object as a string. If instead you&rsquo;re using regex matching on individual JSON elements, that&rsquo;s probably fine.</p>

<p>If you love it that&rsquo;s great. It&rsquo;s a rare gift to be able to love something that also happens to be a skill that can net you a high-paying job/career. The thing about software development is that there is actually a wide scope within the field that makes your concerns moot.</p>
<p>Do you want more free time? There are jobs that offer flexible hours, working from home, etc, or you could just go freelance and control your own hours.</p>
<p>Want to avoid working for a company that feels like a prison? While there are companies that can be like that, there are also many companies that are better. And good programmers are always in high demand, so as long as you have sufficient competence and skill, you should be able to find better working conditions.</p>

<p>Yes, I watched the whole video. I know that he&rsquo;s a brave son of a bitch willing to let himself take the place of hostages and that he killed all the rapists. Hooray for him.</p>
<p>No, I still don&rsquo;t want him to be president. I wouldn&rsquo;t want Rambo to be president either. But that&rsquo;s me. If you&rsquo;re voting for him, that&rsquo;s fine, ikaw bahala. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean tatanggapin mo na lang na hindi nya kailangan mag-apologize. Hint: Pwede mag-acknowledge ng flaws and still vote for him..</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t excuse the rape joke. It doesn&rsquo;t excuse trivializing rape. Saying na ganun talaga magsalita ang mga lalaki trivializes rape (I hope I don&rsquo;t have to say this, but hindi ako ganun magsalita). It trivializes rape. Saying that your rival candidate is not rapeable trivializes rape. Saying that heroic deeds excuse rape jokes trivializes rape. Claiming that he said it in anger doesn&rsquo;t excuse it (it makes it worse). Repeating the joke for cheap laughs during political gatherings? Trivializes rape.</p>
<p>Saying the other canddiates have also said terrible if not worse things does not excuse it.</p>
<p>What would have been a better response? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for my poor choice of words. I&rsquo;m sorry for repeating those words during political rallies. Rape is never a laughing matter, no matter what the context. Real men should never look at any woman with thoughts of rape. I ask all my supporters not to speak this way about women. I will try not to speak this way again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not going to get that response. That&rsquo;s the kind of person he is.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I understand the theory behind it, and will try these things to practice my own meaty setups, but one of my concerns right now when playing ranked (I&rsquo;m only in Super Bronze so I&rsquo;m not particularly good) is that against higher-ranked players, I often find myself helpless on waking up because of meaty attacks in particular. So I&rsquo;m a bit more interested in what one can do when the opponent knows these setups inside and out. Do I just try to predict whether he is going for the meaty and block then punish?</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>If it&rsquo;s a meaty attack, does that mean any wakeup by the opponent will get snuffed? The opponent must block to avoid getting hit (leaving himself open to a throw)?</p>
<p>Also, some of these setups are different depending on whether the opponent quick rises or not. Will I be able to tell ahead of time if he is quick rising, or I need to decide which setup to use on reaction (i.e. if I see him rising quickly, I switch to the quick rise setup)?</p>
<p>Sorry if noob questions!</p>
