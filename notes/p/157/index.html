<p>Yeap. Well, you could always just try making a fan project and hope and pray that they don&rsquo;t shut it down.</p>
<p>For contacting someone at EA, going through the regular channels like customer support or marketing/sales isn&rsquo;t going to cut it; that&rsquo;s not how deals are made, with their staff entertaining random proposals from people on the internet. The only way to get traction is to find someone on the inside who will listen to you - probably through game dev industry contacts or such. If you already have the capacity, I would suggest just making your own game first (maybe &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; by lands of lore, but not ripping it off directly) and hope that leads into a future path that might eventually get you where you want.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>Datablitz doesn&rsquo;t have used games but that doesn&rsquo;t mean the market doesn&rsquo;t exist. There are shops in greenhills that will buy and sell used games. iTech also sells some used PS3 games, not sure if they will buy them off you as well.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve often read that our country has the second-highest cost of electricity in Asia (or are we the highest already?) Has there been any study or analysis conducted and published that provides a breakdown of why we have such high costs?  Is it solely due to Ramos-era expensive IPP contracts? If so, how long until we can get out of these contracts? Can we renegotiate them somehow, or at least the provisions that are disadvantageous to the government/public?  Or are we overpaying for some other components such as labor, fuel, components, maintenance, distribution, etc costs? Are our power plants more expensive? Can we compare cost breakdowns with our neighbors to find out?  I would think that if you were a newly-elected President appointing a secretary to the Department of Energy the first two things you would ask for would be (a) an analysis like the questions above need; and (b) a list of proposals to drive down energy costs. But I don&rsquo;t recall Erap, Gloria or PNoy coming out with any such analysis or plans. (Aside from the WESM which doesn&rsquo;t appear to have been successful in driving down prices)  Anyone on my feed have more knowledge on this topic, anyone involved in the national power generation and distribution systems (wala ba mga EE diyan lol)?</p>

<p>I was around 10 when I played and finished the first Legend of Zelda; probably 15 or 16 when I beat A Link To The Past. ALBW is easier than both of those, I think. You might just not be giving younger you enough credit, kids are surprisingly good at games.</p>

<p>Nope. Timestamp order only matters for effects in the same layer (i.e. if you resolve &ldquo;set creature&rsquo;s P/T to 0/1&rdquo; then afterwards resolve &ldquo;set creature&rsquo;s P/T to 3/3&rdquo;, it becomes a 3/3), but for effects in different layers, they are applied simultaneously regardless of timestamp order.</p>
