<div class="content e-content">

<p>No offense, but you were probably applying for the wrong companies (obvious if you consider they have some sort of padrino system), either that or you were aiming for jobs you werent qualified for. Not only have i found my current job without any sort of connections, i do not personally know anyone who needed connections to land their job. I&rsquo;ve also interviewed dozens of applicants for entry level positions, everytime i had to fail an applicant it was because he didnt have the talent we needed, connections never came into play.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I&rsquo;m really bad at explaining things to kids! Especially since this involves probability.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s late in the game and you already have 8 swamps in play. You don&rsquo;t want to draw any more lands, you just want creature to attack with or spells to kill stuff with. If you had 24 swamps in your deck, there&rsquo;d be 16 more lands you can draw after playing 8 swamps! If you had only 32 cards left in your deck, half of those would be lands!</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say instead of 24 swamps, you had 4 marsh flats and 20 swamps instead. And instead of having 8 swamps in play, you have 6 swamps and 2 marsh flats. Everything else is the same (32 cards left in the deck) If you use the two marsh flats to remove 2 swamps from your deck and put them into play, you now have only 30 cards left in your deck. More importantly, now only 14 of them are lands! (12 swamps and 2 marsh flats). So now your odds of drawing odds are slightly less than 50% - 14/30!</p>
<p>It all boils down to improving probabilities and thinning your deck, making it a bit easier to draw useful cards later on.</p>

<p>How high does he think online piracy should rank in terms of America (and the world&rsquo;s) priorities? Aren&rsquo;t there a multitude of more pressing problems regarding poverty, education, unemployment, healthcare that the governments should focus on?</p>
<p>How does he compare the &ldquo;no due process&rdquo; provisions of SOPA (allowing websites to be shut down without need for evidence or hearing) to the constitutional guarantee of &ldquo;innocent until proven guilty&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Is the MPAA even considering developing alternative business models that work with the internet instead of trying to destroy it?</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/Games/comments/oggsn/origin_is_required_for_all_pc_editions_of_mass/c3h4jzs/">a comment by niton on &#39;Origin is required for all PC editions of Mass Effect 3&#39; on /r/Games</a>:

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I dislike the whole thing not because of the DRM (I don&rsquo;t even see Steam as DRM), I dislike it because the Origin service at the moment is crappy. They don&rsquo;t have the same amount of sales Steam does, and their customer service is horrid (there are horror stories about Steam customer service)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for having a competing service to Steam, but hopefully that competing service is a good one that forces Steam to innovate and improve to keep up (not that they&rsquo;re doing a bad job at the moment). Origin is nowhere near that yet.</p>
<p>Mass Effect 3 being exclusive to Origin isn&rsquo;t a bad thing per se, but it&rsquo;s a bit like a much anticipated game being exclusive to a console that only 5% of the market uses - the other 95% are sad, but we just move on because our platform of choice already has a vastly superior library anyway.</p>

<p>I wish they would do one of their big yearly crossovers (on the scale of secret invasion, fear itself, etc) where they spend a lot of time trying to identify the big bad and it turns out that it was dr doom all along. Then of course they defeat him, but it&rsquo;s just a doom bot</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I&rsquo;m fine with requiring a button to run. Not only is that how Mario works, but I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going to be randomly walking at the wrong time if it depends on the tilt on the analog stick.</p>
