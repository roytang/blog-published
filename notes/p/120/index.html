    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/4b3f6u/finding_diehard_supporters_of_politicians_cringey/">&#39;Finding die-hard supporters of politicians cringey&#39; on /r/Philippines</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>I have a number of otherwise intelligent friends who often post things in favor of certain candidates that are obviously biased. And if you call them out on their bias they will just be all defensive and ask if you have a better idea, etc.</p>
<p>Like literally, one of my friends posted something along the lines of:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Candidate A - lists negative points; Candidate B - lists negative points; Candidate C - lists positive points. Easy decision right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not even pretending to be fair or anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s normal to be turned off by such things, especially for people who are truly undecided and trying to weigh pros and cons of the candidates. I try to stay informed and read everything even the biased ones post, but I tend to give more weight to those who I know to be undecided and are trying to be objective.</p>
<p>I have to agree that none of the presidential candidates look good enough (at the moment, at least), and I wouldn&rsquo;t object to abstaining the presidential slot. Abstaining is a vote too, in and of itself.</p>
<p>Edit: If you also find that none of the candidates meet your standards and are considering abstaining, you might want to read this: <a href="http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/abstain4president2016/">http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/abstain4president2016/</a></p>
<p>But at the very least consider voting for the other positions. There is (in my opinion) at least one worthy candidate in the VP slot, and your vote could help some of the more worthy senators get past the cringe-worthy ones in the bottom half (sadly, I think we&rsquo;re going to have to live with another term of Senator Sotto)</p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It sounds like you should just ignore this person. When he sends you such advice, just respond with &ldquo;eh, I don&rsquo;t really care&rdquo;, and walk away</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Moving on doesn&rsquo;t mean forgetting her. Don&rsquo;t dwell too much on her death; whenever you find yourself thinking about that topic, try to refocus your thoughts to her life and to your good memories together with her. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It might be difficult to let go, but it will come eventually with time. In the meantime, try to find new ways to occupy your mind and keep you distracted. A new hobby or something else to direct your attention to. Ask your friends to help you with this as well.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It&rsquo;s an understandable bias, always needing perfect information before moving forward and taking action. But it can be paralyzing, and there are situations where you will need to act quickly and with minimal information. As in many things in life, it&rsquo;s important to strike a balance and know when to wait for more data or when to move forward with what you have.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If you are having difficulty with this, you might need to practice being more spontaneous. Ask your friends to help you with this: ask them to drag you along on sudden road trips without telling you where you&rsquo;re going, or to surprise you with random situations where you have to react quickly</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Good luck!</p></span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-teachers-make-kids-write-a-2000-word-essay-when-a-500-word-essay-would-be-clearer-and-more-concise/answer/Roy-Tang">Why do teachers make kids write a 2000 word essay when a 500 word essay would be clearer and more concise?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Minimum length requirements are inflated to take into account the BS that students write. If students write 500 words of meaningful response + 1500 words of BS for a 2,000 word essay, then for a 500 word essay, you&rsquo;re likely to get only 125 words of meaningful response.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">And even the mere act of thinking up 1,500 additional words of BS is something, at least you&rsquo;re trying to think about things tangentially related to the topic at hand. </p></span></p>

<p>Some of those early vine jumps were way too tight, making the first part way harder than the rest of it lol. Boss fight was nice.</p>
<p>How do you make that large fireball with wings that&rsquo;s followed by some smaller fireballs with wings?</p>

<p>There are two branching paths. Also, there&rsquo;s mushrooms hidden in invisible blocks in a few places to help you along the way</p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Practice solving puzzles to get better at math. Not necessarily math puzzles (those are fine), but also logic puzzles will help. Try the book Satan, Cantor and Infinity</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">For remembering things, try to exercise your memory in everyday locations. For example whenever you go to the grocery store, choose a thing that you like to buy, say potato chips. Look at the row of potato chips on sale and try to memorize the order of the brands as arranged on the shelf. Then the next time you go to the store, see how well you remembered it.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">You can also look into/research the memory technique called the memory palace. There&rsquo;s a TED talk about it somewhere. </p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Typically, a database administrator will have the following tasks:</p><ol><li>Database installation and configuration</li><li>Maintenance - version upgrades and applying patches</li><li>Migration - transferring data from one database to another, or an older database version to another</li><li>Setting up regular backups and planning for recovery procedures</li><li>Configure security models</li><li>Storage and capacity planning - this means monitoring the disk storage used by the database</li><li>Performance monitoring and tuning - users will complain if the database slows to a crawl!

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Are-programming-skills-valuable-for-an-economics-graduate/answer/Roy-Tang">Are programming skills valuable for an economics graduate?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Having a mix of skills will be incredibly valuable for you since it makes you &ldquo;rarer&rdquo;. Look for the place where your skills/interests intersect - that is a good niche for you to pursue since there will be fewer people to compete with. i.e. look for programming work where an economics domain would be an advantage, or work for an economics graduate (I have no idea what that entails LOL) where you can leverage your programming knowledge (maybe via program-assisted data crunching or analysis). It&rsquo;s better than competing against everyone who is a programmer.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If you are depressed, it is best to talk to a professional. This is the very first thing you should do.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Also see if you can share your fears and anxieties with friends and family and ask for their support. Maybe you also fear telling them about it, but that&rsquo;s fine. You&rsquo;ve already taken the first step of asking people on the internet for help anyway. If you have trouble telling them your problems, you can send them the link to this question :) Try to ask friends or family members who you think will likely be supportive.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">For your everyday fears, try facing them one at a time. Try the easiest ones first. Try a break in your routine. Go to a different coffee shop. Say hi to the barista (any small talk after that is optional!) When you go get a haircut ask the barber to suggest a different look. Or ask him how his family is doing. Little things, one at a time. It&rsquo;s ok to fail too. Every attempt is already a victory.</p></span></p>
