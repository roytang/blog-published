<p>Do Miles, Ganke, Miles&rsquo; family etc remember the Ultimate universe? Or Ultimate Peter Parker dying? Or were their histories &ldquo;re-written&rdquo; and merged into the main universe?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not up-to-date with the Miles comics, but I don&rsquo;t remember this being explained after Secret Wars</p>

<p>Covid19 thoughts and updates, June 14 edition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aside from doing another grocery run this weekend, I also accompanied my mom to the hospital last Saturday. Nothing major, just a consult that had been put off due to all of this. Before letting us into the hospital, there were the usual temperature checks, but they also had us fill up a form with name, address and contact details, I assume for contact tracing purposes. We waited for a couple of hours in the doctor&rsquo;s queue (my mom was only there to get a referral, which in itself only took like 5 minutes). The hospital was mostly empty, we didn&rsquo;t see any actual sick patients in most of the waiting areas I think. Seating was limited - they had blocked off the seat rows such that only 2 out of every 4 seats was usable. I was super anxious about touching anything, and probably used hand sanitizer at least 5 times during the visit. Their canteen was open, I only went in to get some water while waiting.</li>
<li>Watched mass via Facebook again today.</li>
<li>GCQ in Metro Manila was supposedly only up to the 15th. It&rsquo;s the 14th, and we still don&rsquo;t know what happens after that. In fact, I&rsquo;m not even sure the IATF has already announced their recommendations. There are rumors going around that we may get sent back to ECQ. Some authorities are saying limited restaurant dine-in will be available this week. In spite of this, my mom already scheduled some tests at the hospital, a result of the referral consult I mentioned earlier.</li>
<li>As of last night, we are at 25293 cases (+607 from the day before, +4052 from last week), 1074 deaths (+22 from the day before, +80 from last week), 5706 recoveries (+252 from the day before, +1265 last week). Jumps slightly lower than last week, except for recoveries which are about the same, so that&rsquo;s good news. Let&rsquo;s see what happens next week. <a href="https://covid19ph.com/">Reference.</a></li>
<li>Worldwide, we are at 7.8+ million cases and 432,000 deaths. Caveat: these numbers are from <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html">Worldometer</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Covid19 thoughts and updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>one week into ECQ. I went out for a walk outside the subdivision last Thursday, just to see what it was like. First time walking outside since I did a meds run for the folks in April. What I saw: lots of people and cars already in the streets, just like it was pre-virus. Of course this time, around 95% of people are masked. (Maybe 1 in 10 weren&rsquo;t wearing their masks correctly though.). I went into the nearby Jollibee to see what it was like. Not as many people inside, and the guard took my temp told me to stand aside before later motioning me to get into a particular queue. The queues are spaced (should have taken pictures), and there&rsquo;s tables in front of the cashiers to keep you from getting too close. Anyway, I think I&rsquo;ll still keep my walks limited to my subdivision; much too many people outside for my comfort.</li>
<li>Watched mass via Facebook again today.</li>
<li>As of last night, we are at 21340 cases (+714 from the day before, +7563 (!!!) from last week), 994 deaths (+7 from the day before, +131 (!!) from last week), 4441 recoveries (+111 from the day before, +1264 last week). &ldquo;Last week&rdquo; numbers slightly lower because it&rsquo;s only been 6 days since the last report. Basically an explosion in confirmed cases; over 50% jump from last week. Large jumps in deaths and recoveries too, thought not as alarmingly large as the cases. Regardless of the DoH&rsquo;s &ldquo;tardy&rdquo; / &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; massaging of the data, it looks bad, and the explosion in cases kind of aligns with the last days of the ECQ. I expect another spike in another two weeks. <a href="https://covid19ph.com/">Reference.</a></li>
<li>Worldwide, we are almost at 7 million cases and 400,000 deaths. Caveat: these numbers are from <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html">Worldometer</a>. The protests in the US and worldwide might speed up these numbers in a week or so, though hopefully the virus doesn&rsquo;t spread as easily in open air. (And at least many of the protesters this time are masked, as compared to the the ones protesting before about not being able to get haircuts).</li>
</ul>

<p>Hey, in case you still need this: I was able to resolve the issue by going to <a href="https://store.playstation.com">store.playstation.com</a> on my web browser, trying to log in, then telling it to resend the verification code. The new verification email had a link that goes to a <a href="https://sony.com">sony.com</a> subdomain instead of a <a href="https://playstation.com">playstation.com</a> subdomain, and that one didn&rsquo;t have the SSL certificate problem.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AskPlayStation/">@AskPlayStation</a> there&rsquo;s some problem with the email verification links you&rsquo;re sending out, there&rsquo;s an error with the ssl certificate on the site it links to. Some details here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/gx4pjp/anyone_else_not_able_to_verify_email/">https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/gx4pjp/anyone_else_not_able_to_verify_email/</a> (this isnt me, but it&rsquo;s the same issue)</p>
<p>is this a known issue? How to resolve?</p>
<p>in case someone needs a solution for this, I added a comment to the reddit thread: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/gx4pjp/anyone_else_not_able_to_verify_email/ft30jyz/">https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/gx4pjp/anyone_else_not_able_to_verify_email/ft30jyz/</a></p>

<p>Covid19 thoughts and updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metro Manila is lower restrictions again and going into ECQ tomorrow, June the 1st. Only a two week MECQ transition period, and not really any time to evaluate what the effect that has had on the case numbers. This is reopening for the sake of the economy, without regard for the medical data. I&rsquo;m still not going out. Public transportation will still be limited, so I kind of expect chaos Monday morning.</li>
<li>Speaking of medical data, the DOH has changed the way they report new cases, now dividing them into &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; and &ldquo;tardy&rdquo; cases. The tardy ones are the ones that were delayed by 4 or more days due to validation or some other reason. This seems like propaganda to make things seem not so bad, especially since there have been an explosion of cases in the past few days, probably as a result of lowering restrictions.</li>
<li>Watched mass via Facebook again today.</li>
<li>Went out for groceries this past Saturday. Had to do it on a weekend, since my dad drives the car to work on weekdays now and we need that for groceries. Surprisingly, a bunch of things that were always out of stock the past couple of months were available this time around.</li>
<li>Lazada is back to shipping non-essentials again, and I&rsquo;ve already <a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/hyperx-cloud2/">ordered a thing</a>.</li>
<li>As of last night, we are at 13777 cases (+180 from the day before, +1264 from last week), 863 deaths (+6 from the day before, +39 from last week), 3177 recoveries (+85 from the day before, +542 last week). &ldquo;Last week&rdquo; numbers slightly lower because it&rsquo;s only been 6 days since the last report. Maybe I should be monitoring the active cases too? Apparently our active case count has never dropped, and the DOH backlog in confirming cases is only getting larger. <a href="https://covid19ph.com/">Reference.</a></li>
<li>As of last night, we are at 18086 cases (+862 from the day before, +4309 from last week), 957 deaths (+7 from the day before, +94 from last week), 3909 recoveries (+101 from the day before, +732 last week). The case numbers are exploding in growth, presumably because the DOH is catching up to the backlog, but that&rsquo;s still super unsettling. <a href="https://covid19ph.com/">Reference.</a></li>
<li>Worldwide, we are at 6.2 million cases and 372,000 deaths. Caveat: these numbers are from <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html">Worldometer</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not an American, but I considered writing out some of my thoughts on the current events there in a show of solidarity, but very hard to fit into a tweet. Probably need a blog post at some point.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I would just word it with a keyword, the same way other games like Hearthstone or Eternal do. Something like &ldquo;Arrives - Draw a card&rdquo;. Same thing for death triggers. &ldquo;Dies - Deal 2 damage to any target&rdquo;. &ldquo;Arrives&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t too great, but in my head it evokes the &ldquo;oh, it happens when he&rsquo;s already here&rdquo; feeling.</p>
<p>That Saga wording is actually reminder text, the actual Saga rules text should be the same as normal ETB triggers and draw step triggers.</p>

<p>Covid19 thoughts and updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are officially one week deep into Modified ECQ. It should be a couple of weeks before the cases start picking up again, but we are already seeing a lot of traffic and crowds and such.</li>
<li>Lazada is back to shipping non-essentials again, and I&rsquo;ve already <a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/05/hyperx-cloud2/">ordered a thing</a>.</li>
<li>I feel compelled to share <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10158571281328991&amp;id=827533990">this post</a> by a friend of mine dubbing a certain local &ldquo;expert&rdquo; as &ldquo;Science Mocha&rdquo;.</li>
<li>My dad started going back to work last Wednesday. He says they have strict screenings and rules so that&rsquo;s good. They don&rsquo;t let anyone go out unless they&rsquo;re already going home for the day, so he has to bring <em>baon</em>.</li>
<li>We did a grocery run the day before he went back to work. Not sure if it was because we went earlier, but it felt like there were slightly fewer shoppers that time.</li>
<li>As of last night, we are at 13777 cases (+180 from the day before, +1264 from last week), 863 deaths (+6 from the day before, +39 from last week), 3177 recoveries (+85 from the day before, +542 last week). &ldquo;Last week&rdquo; numbers slightly lower because it&rsquo;s only been 6 days since the last report. Maybe I should be monitoring the active cases too? Apparently our active case count has never dropped, and the DOH backlog in confirming cases is only getting larger. <a href="https://covid19ph.com/">Reference.</a></li>
<li>Worldwide, we are at 5.3 million cases and 340,000 deaths. Caveat: these numbers are from <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html">Worldometer</a>.</li>
