    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15yq5f/philippines_authorities_propose_scrapping_hunt/">&#39;Philippines authorities propose scrapping hunt for billions looted by Marcos - latimes.com&#39; on /r/Philippines</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>The headline is ridiculous, since scrapping the PCGG is not the same as giving up on the Marcos loot, it just means that we won&rsquo;t have a dedicated agency for that one task, and their tasks will devolve to the DoJ.</p>

<p>I just want an app that gives me trivia questions that I can toss out to people. Nothing that requires an internet connection and preferably no time limits. A wide variety of trivia questions and topics would be great.</p>

<p>How is this done in the new itunes? In the old one I just drag epubs to the iPad on the left side panel. In the new itunes I tried going to the Books tab of the iPad but it seems I can&rsquo;t drag anything into there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna do syncing or anything, I want to be able to copy/remove books individually as needed.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really only looking forward to this so that the series can finally end. I&rsquo;ve been reading this series for almost two decades, stuck through it when it was draggy just for the heck of it. I can barely remember any of the things that happened in the middle books. If I had time I&rsquo;d reread them all again before the last book comes out but meh, what can you do. There better be a damn good ending!</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/15rvcf/where_do_people_stand_on_respeccing_in_rpgsarpgs/c7poxhz/">a comment by grumbel on &#39;Where do people stand on respeccing in RPGs/aRPGs?&#39; on /r/truegaming</a>:
</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>Sid Meier once said that a game is a &ldquo;series of interesting decisions&rdquo;. When your decisions have no consequence, the decisions become less interesting and meaningful. If your decisions don&rsquo;t have consequences, why bother having the decisions at all? Why not just give the player everything all at once, since that&rsquo;s what it essentially comes down to when you can respec at will?</p>
<p>I remember when I was playing Kingdom of Amalur, you could respec at any time for a small gold cost. The gold cost increases gradually every time, but it never becomes a very high value such that respeccing was practically free. That means there was no point investing in the Crafting skills since at any point you could decide &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do all my crafting now&rdquo;, respec to the best crafting build, craft your stuff, then respec back to what you normally have.</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>It&rsquo;s a problem of balance. If the RPG isn&rsquo;t well-balanced, it may punish the player for decisions made early on (i.e. he chose an ability that didn&rsquo;t turn out to be as useful as he expected), and having no respec option at all locks him into that choice. I agree that there needs to be some level of consequence to your choices and we can&rsquo;t expect the game to be balanced 100% with regards to character choices, but the problem is that for a new player playing a new game, he will almost invariably be unable to judge correctly whether certain choices are good or bad.</p>
<p>So my answer is: I&rsquo;d prefer not having respec options, but I understand the need for them. Maybe not have respeccing be so easy or something would be a good idea (i.e. need to complete some quest that gets harder every time you want to respec)</p>

<p>Okay, I dreamt I was in a client meeting for a software project, except that the client was an alien who looked a bit like Jabba the Hutt and kept insulting us for being earthlings. He was asking us why we were using Java when it had restrictions for export outside the US. As the lead technical guy I had to explain that the restrictions only applied to certain countries and to certain parts of Java and that we wouldn&rsquo;t be using those parts, etc.   Also, my sleep cycle is completely out of whack</p>

<p>Seriously, there&rsquo;s always people around who blame their losses on the shuffler or to mana screw. It&rsquo;s like deck building and mulliganing decisions aren&rsquo;t relevant. A lot of people don&rsquo;t understand randomness either - people complain about not having mana screw runs in real life compared to mtgo are often unaware of their own negative bias and most probably are not sufficiently randomizing their decks in real life.</p>
<p>Earlier, there was this guy complaining to me about mana screw and I was like &ldquo;dude I have 3 lands to your 6&rdquo;. And he replied that at least I was casting my spells. Well maybe I had a smaller curve and only two colors (he had 4 colors of land out by the time the game ended) and I kept my hand even with 2 lands because it already had 3 two-drops. When your opening hand is 2 forests, a green card and 3 white cards and you think to yourself &ldquo;Surely I&rsquo;ll draw a plains!&rdquo; then you don&rsquo;t draw one for seven turns, that&rsquo;s not really mana screw, that was a bad keep.</p>
<p>Sigh, sorry about the rant. I just hate it when people complain so much about the same things. (Yet they still keep coming back to play magic)</p>
