<p>Sorry, I don&rsquo;t know what to tell you but that&rsquo;s how this game is played on the competitive level. When the world/internet has already built the top tier of decks, the option exists to simply tweak one of those decks for your meta and rely on your play skill to see you through. You can go against the tide and build your own deck, but you better be damn well prepared for the top tier decks regardless. Budget isn&rsquo;t really an excuse.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always casual play with friends where you can agree not to play netdecks.</p>

<h4 id="posted-on-rgaming-kingdoms-of-amalur-reckoning-ps3-or-pchttpsredditcomrgamingcommentspkg9fkingdoms_of_amalur_reckoning_ps3_or_pc">Posted on r/gaming: <a href="https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/pkg9f/kingdoms_of_amalur_reckoning_ps3_or_pc/">Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, PS3 or PC?</a></h4>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve tried both the PS3 and the PC demos. The PC version looks better, but the control scheme seems clunky for the keyboard/mouse (the loot dialog doesn&rsquo;t even seem to have any keyboard shortcuts) and better for the controller. I&rsquo;m also not too thrilled that the PC version required me to login to my EA account. Any feedback on the full version, is it ok, better than the demo?</p>
<p>Anything else I need to consider in weighing PC vs PS3? Do we expect mod support? Also, if I buy the retail version (off the shelf copies are a lot cheaper than digital downloads where I am), will it be for Steam or Origin or Neither?</p>

<p>I hope this isn&rsquo;t true, that would be terrible. I love that there&rsquo;s a different Spider-Man in the Ultimate Universe, with his own set of problems and issues. I&rsquo;d understand them wanting to bring Peter back someday, but Miles needs more time in the sun!</p>

<p>Are you suggesting that r/gaming should be filled with posts begging for stuff? You&rsquo;re not the only poor gamer you know.</p>
<p>r/gaming is not averse to giveaways, but the supply of people who can giveaway stuff is a lot less than the people who want stuff, so it&rsquo;s more acceptable to post a thread giving away stuff than begging for stuff</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I think the year in parenthesis is the year the series started. It makes sense for most of them, but not for Amazing Spider-Man. Pretty sure it didn&rsquo;t start in 1999. Shrug.</p>
<p>For series to jump into, do you want to follow an ongoing series? If yes, the recent ones that I like: Daredevil (&lt; 10 issues), Uncanny X-Men (they rebooted last year, only 5 issues so far), Uncanny X-Force (this is around 20 issues in), Wolverine and the X-Men (5 issues), Defenders (only 2 issues in! I like the art). The X-books might be a bit harder to pick up if you&rsquo;re not familiar with the characters as they reference a lot of previous storylines.</p>
<p>You might be interested in the Ultimate line, it&rsquo;s basically a separate universe they started around 10 years ago that has less back story for a new reader to follow. They have some ongoing series currently, namely Ultimate Comics Spider-Man (6 issues in, this Spider-Man is not Peter Parker), Ultimate Comics X-Men (6 issues) and Ultimate Comics The Ultimates (6 issues). If you want to go back farther, I suggest picking up trades of Ultimate Spider-Man (this was the first Ultimate book, and it ended last year) and Ultimate X-Men.</p>
<p>If you want some Avengers, they have several series ongoing. Avengers, New Avengers and Secret Avengers are all okay, and they&rsquo;re all in the 20+ issue range. I like New Avengers best among the three, I need to catch up on Secret Avengers</p>
