<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It is a form of self-awareness, which can come only with contemplating yourself and your actions. Look at how you live your life. Which things do you prioritize, which principles do you adhere to? What actions do you respond to well? What actions do you respond to poorly? e.g. If you respond poorly to people lying, maybe you strongly value honesty and integrity. If you respond well to people who make intelligent discussion points maybe you value cerebral thinking</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It&rsquo;s difficult. Generally whatever you do will always be colored to some extent by your personal biases. The key is to be aware of your personal views and biases and compensate against them in order to be more balanced. Do more research on views opposing your own to counteract your own biases</p></span></p>

<p>Ernie: &ldquo;We should vote for candidate A, his platform promises X, Y and Z!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Have you listened to the speech by candidate B?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just empty promises!&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;Candidate A said [something stupid]&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Ungas talaga yang si candidate A, ang kapal ng mukha! Bakit ba may boboto jan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;Candidate B said [some other stupid thing]&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Wala namang perpektong kandidato&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;People say candidate A is involved in [something illegal]&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Grabe talaga si candidate A! Dapat ikulong na yan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;People also say candidate B is involved in [something else also illegal]&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Wala naman silang ebidensya, bakit nde sya kasuhan sa korte!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ernie: &ldquo;May nagkakalat na maling kwento tungkol kay candidate B mula sa supporter ni candidate A!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Kagagawan yan malamang ni candidate A!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;May nagkakalat na maling kwento tungkol kay candidate A mula sa supporter ni candidate B!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Aba, hindi siguro tunay na candidate B supporter yan, malamang binayaran lang ni candidate A para magmukha kaming masama!&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;Inendorse daw ni Celebrity X si candidate B!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Idol ko talaga yang si Celebrity X! May integridad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ernie: &ldquo;Inendorse daw ni Celebrity Y si candidate A!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert: &ldquo;Grabe, idol ko pa naman yang si celebrity Y, mukhang nabayaran!&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Comment if you have your own examples :p</p>
<p>Edit: Most of these are from FB btw. I&rsquo;ve found that this sub is slightly more rational compared to FB threads when it comes to politics discussion (although meron pa din trolls)</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">People don&rsquo;t always react well to people they perceive as different from them. It is born of a primal fear of things that are unknown, i.e. in the olden caveman days you had to be wary of every unknown thing since it might be a dangerous predator. This fear can be hard to overcome unless the person willingly recognizes it and acts to change it. Your acquaintance may not realize it, but he is probably scared that you will do something unusual or awkward and he won&rsquo;t know what to do or how to respond. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I would suggest just telling him that you&rsquo;re just like every other person: you have some unusual quirks that takes some getting used to. Everyone is like that! But if he doesn&rsquo;t want to hang out with you, you have to respect that and just look for better friends who can be more understanding.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Fear is often overcome by facing the fear repeatedly until you are so used to what you are afraid of that the fear goes away. Fear is a primal instinct meant to keep us alive, but many times that instinct is not justified. You need to learn to understand when fear is keeping you safe and when fear is holding you back.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">For your specific fear, I&rsquo;m not clear exactly what you mean by unsafe. If your fear is keeping you from entering unsafe conditions, i.e. maybe your fear is stopping you from moving in to a bad neighborhood known for a high crime rate, that fear might be justified and it&rsquo;s ok. But if your fear is unjustified, it can be unhealthy. i.e. if you fear flying because you think it&rsquo;s unsafe (despite the fact that thousands of planes take off and land each day without incident), that&rsquo;s irrational</p></span></p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Remember: You are not your code. You are not the hundred or so lines of C or Java or Javascript or whatever that you wrote today.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">This problem arises because you are too attached to your code. Your ego is associated with the code you write and you feel that any comments or defects found reflect upon   you as a person. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">You are not perfect. You will not write perfect software, and that&rsquo;s fine. It&rsquo;s not a flaw, it&rsquo;s just the way software is. It isn&rsquo;t written all in one go, magically perfect and elegant and satisfying all the requirements. Good software goes through multiple iterations and many eyes looking at it. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It is also important to treat it as a learning experience - learn what you can from each code review comment and try to apply what you learn to future code you write. This also helps you minimize review comments in the future. Instead of treating the large number of comments as a shortcoming on your part, treat it as a metric you can improve upon.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Fear is an instinct, to keep one away from danger. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Sometimes the fear is valid. Such fear can keep you alive, especially in crisis situations. Examples are fear of falling or fear of injury.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Many other times, fear is simply a vestige of our prehistoric brains not yet adapted to modern times. An example is fear of humiliation, maybe manifesting as a fear of public speaking. Our prehistoric lizard brains are afraid that we might say something stupid and be humiliated and lose standing among the tribe, leading to us being ostracized. In prehistoric times, being ostracized can mean death, since humans had to band together to survive. But in modern times, such fear is unnecessary and unhealthy since people are more free to disagree with one another.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The key is to recognize fear for what it is and to understand whether the fear you are feeling is justified and needs to be acted upon, or simply part of a prehistoric instinct that is meaningless in the modern life.</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Everyone, no matter how talented, will question themselves at some point.

If yes, then ignore the instinct to question yourself and just write. Write, write, write. Write until it becomes second nature, like breathing. Write until these thoughts fade to the wayside. Write until you can&rsquo;t write anymore, then write some more.</p></span></p>

Personally, I&rsquo;d recommend Python, but it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what programming language you choose, your initial learning stage should only be to get you familiar with programming concepts and constructs.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">When looking for a job, look for the ones geared towards fresh graduates that may be offering training for new hires. This puts you on a more even field with people who have been programming for longer.</p></span></p>

In this category you can put people growing up in poor neighborhoods where there will often be peer pressure to be one of the gang and trying to better yourself is frowned upon. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Sadly, parents can pass on this attitude to this children</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">There are many people using PLDT that are able to play online using the PS4. There is probably some sort of configuration or routing issue in your area which is causing the problem. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Also, try a hard reset on your router every so often. I had this issue with my Bayantel router that my PS4 suddenly can&rsquo;t connect to PSN for a few days. After some time and a few router restarts, it got better.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I suggest calling Sony support. Tell them about the error and ask them for technical details of the possible cause, and if there are any diagnostics you can do. Ask them what you need to tell your ISP to check</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">People die at seemingly random times all the time.

There&rsquo;s no point worrying about it, if you die you die. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Stay healthy, take care of yourself and be careful not to walk down dangerous areas at night. Now, even though you do all these precautions, there&rsquo;s no guarantee you won&rsquo;t suddenly die due to some random accident. Just do what you can and live your life to the fullest. Live each moment as if it might be your last, appreciate the things you have and the people you love and know that they might all vanish in a heartbeat</p></span></p>

<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It&rsquo;s really up to you to decide if where you are is something you&rsquo;re satisfied with. In life, you often come to a crossroads where you have to decide whether you are willing to settle with what you have and are comfortable with, or to go out to seek something better. The choice is not always clear-cut, and the right answer always depends on the person and what he wants out of life</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It is a tenuous balance between ambition and happiness. If you are too ambitious and always keep moving on looking for the next best thing, you run the risk of never being happy. If you find yourself happy where you are, you run the risk of settling for something less than what you could have had. You have to look inside yourself and figure out where that balance lies.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Think about what happens if you stay: what&rsquo;s the best-case scenario? Will the job eventually become more challenging? More engaging? What&rsquo;s the worst-case scenario? Will it become even more boring later on?</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Think about what happens if you leave: are you likely to be able to find new work? (Actually there&rsquo;s minimal risk since you don&rsquo;t have to resign before looking for new work). Will you likely do well at any other job? Will you find happiness elsewhere?</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">For my case, I worked in a software job for more than a decade. It paid really well and I was well-respected by my peers and it was quite cushy for me. But eventually I decided to leave and take a break from working for a while to figure out where to go next. I had enough savings to live comfortably for a new months. Absolutely no regrets, enjoying all the free time I have now :)</p></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-fear-is-a-good-quality/answer/Roy-Tang">Do you think fear is a good quality?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Fear can keep you alive, that in itself makes it a good quality. But you have to be able not to let fear control you, to recognize when the fear you&rsquo;re having is irrational.</p></span></p>
