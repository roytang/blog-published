<div class="content e-content">

<p>Seriously though, how is this a question? What&rsquo;s the ratio of human population vs bear population anyway? I think it&rsquo;d have to be less than a hundred humans per bear to even be remotely close, because for sure a hundred humans could take a single bear.</p>

<p>As much as I support this post, I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s not really going to do much to change the minds of those who feel really entitled to it. They are too blinded by nerdrage to understand what this chart means, I say just let them rant it all out and ignore the multiple threads about it, until ME3&rsquo;s release date when the rage subsides as they enjoy the game.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>They need to deliver the game to the console guys (Microsoft/Sony) for certification months before the release date (I believe for ME3 it was submitted for certification in January). So your suggestion is that even if they have a chance to work on additional content earlier, they should NOT do that at all? Like, just have those guys work on the old republic or something?</p>

<p>Strictly out of curiosity, for what value of N would &ldquo;DLC released N days after the launch day&rdquo; be okay for you, but &ldquo;DLC release N-1 days after launch day&rdquo; not be okay?</p>

<p>I like how your criteria for &ldquo;Good DLC&rdquo; doesnt include whether it was a day one release or not. And if you&rsquo;re saying &ldquo;day one&rdquo; means it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;new&rdquo;, would day two be better?</p>

<p>I like how the statue is part of the game&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that time I bought FF7 and later there were action figures of cloud and sephiroth being sold in the store, but they should give those to me for free because they&rsquo;re part of the game content! Oh, and I should also get a copy of Advent Children for free!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s expensive to implement a payment system processing credit card payments. There&rsquo;s security certifications you need to go through before the CC companies will agree to process payments coming from your website, the cost is in the tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
