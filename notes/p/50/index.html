<p>There are actually people who question why state-sponsored students are protesting against the government. As a taxpayer and as someone whose education had been state-sponsored from high school, I would expect that educational subsidies produce well-informed good citizens.</p>
<p>And being a good citizen means being willing to stand up and  question the actions of those in power when the need arises.</p>
<p>Even if as  some say &ldquo;rally lang ng rally&rdquo;, it is better for the country  that they  err on the side of activism than the other way around, as a  deterrent to  the power of the state. Student activism isn&rsquo;t a bug, it&rsquo;s a feature.</p>

<p>You know, when I said I wanted the real world to be more like Harry Potter I just meant the teleportation and the magic stuff, not the entire plot of  book 5 where the government refuses to do anything about a deadly  threat so the teenagers have to rise up and fight back.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to read about the details of Mueller&rsquo;s Russian indictments. It gives a pretty good picture of how Russia was able to weaponize the internet and social media by preying on things like human ignorance and filter bubbles to effectively divide a nation.</p>
<p>This is the modern face of information warfare, and Russia is  leading the way. I&rsquo;m curious as to if and how society will adjust and push back against these trends</p>
<p>(It&rsquo;s actually surprising that in the latest <a href="https://twitter.com/CivGame/">@CivGame</a> expansion they don&rsquo;t have a Spy mission to reduce loyalty in an enemy  city).</p>

<p>Whenever there&rsquo;s a mass shooting in the US, there&rsquo;s a call for more gun control, and then gun fanatics buy up high-powered arms in anticipation of more controls, which increases the likelihood of more mass shootings. It&rsquo;s a positive feedback loop!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious as to whether the actual statistics bear this theory  out. I&rsquo;m also curious as to where the US&rsquo; breaking point will be before  they decide they&rsquo;ve had enough of this loop.</p>

<p>BLACK PANTHER spoiler-free review!</p>
<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s a fun, action-filled romp and Wakanda is amazing</li>
<li>tchalla was ok, killmonger and nakia were great, shuri was badass</li>
<li>some of the actions scenes didnt seem too well-shot/edited, making them hard to follow</li>
<li>I realize I&rsquo;m saying this about a universe where there are talking raccoons and magic hammers, but some of the Wakandan tech push the boundaries of my suspension of disbelief</li>
<li>my expectations were probably set a bit too high what with some people saying it&rsquo;s the best MCU movie since Iron Man or calling it revolutionary or eye-opening</li>
<li>off the top of my head I&rsquo;d say I consider Civil War, Spider-Man Homecoming and Thor Ragnarok better than this one</li>
<li>I understand that it&rsquo;s revolutionary in the sense that it&rsquo;s a major hollowood motion picture filled with a cast of mostly african descent and that some of the characters are motivated by real world racial issues. But the plot itself was typical for an MCU first movie (maybe I&rsquo;ve seen too many MCU movies? lol). I dont think it presents the issues it covers under any new or revolutionary context. I guess I kind of went in hoping to be impressed on the level of The Dark Knight or such, but I was disappointed in that regard. It&rsquo;s a very straightforward movie</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t watch in Imax, which I kind of regret, as I can imagine some of the scenes being pretty good</li>
<li>Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Possibly, pero baka mahirapan sya intindihin accent ni Chadwick Boseman</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a mid-credits scene and a post-credits scene</li>
</ul>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We need to add a live support chat to a platform we&rsquo;re developing. It seems there&rsquo;s a lot of options out there and it&rsquo;s difficult to sift through them, so I thought I could ask reddit for help/recommendations.</p>
<p>Basically it&rsquo;s for users of our web application to talk to live support. Ideally something not too complicated to setup and support. We are a software dev team ourselves, but our client kind of added this request at the last minute so to save on costs we are looking for a prebuilt solution.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t need too many frills/features on the customer/UI side, but some nice to haves:</p>
<ul>
<li>control over the backend database</li>
<li>user account integration (i.e. the operator knows which of our system users he is chatting with)</li>
</ul>
<p>Any advice or recommendations would be appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Not because we know robots. Because we know who will train them.</p>
