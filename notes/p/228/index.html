<p>I&rsquo;m not one to troll :)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that much of an FPS player so I never really got into the Half-Life series.</p>
<p>Their naming convention is weird with HL2E1 and HL2E2, I initially thought they were like parts of HL2 or something.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the definition of &ldquo;expert&rdquo; in the post that&rsquo;s throwing me off. By that definition, the only people who can be considered experts have to be playing FPS, RPGs, Platformers, and every other genre that has one of the &ldquo;must play&rdquo; video games.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>A newlywed couple moves into their new house. One day the husband comes home from work and his wife says, &ldquo;Honey, you know, in the upstairs bathroom one of the pipes is leaking, could you fix it?&rdquo; The husband says, &ldquo;What do I look like, Mr. Plumber?&rdquo; A few days go by, and he comes home from work and his wife says, &ldquo;Honey, the car won&rsquo;t start. I think it needs a new battery. Could you change it for me?&rdquo; He says: &ldquo;What do I look like, Mr. Goodwrench?&rdquo; Another few days go by, and it&rsquo;s raining pretty hard. The wife finds a leak in the roof. She says, &ldquo;Honey, there&rsquo;s a leak on the roof! Can you please fix it?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;What do I look like, Bob Vila?&rdquo; The next day the husband comes home, and the roof is fixed. So is the plumbing. So is the car. He asks his wife what happened. &ldquo;Oh, I had a handyman come in and fix them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Great! How much is that going to cost me?&rdquo; he snarls. Wife says: &ldquo;Nothing. He said he&rsquo;d do it for free if I either baked him a cake or slept with him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Uh, well, what kind of cake did you make?&rdquo; asks the husband. &ldquo;What do I look like,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;Betty Crocker?&rdquo;</p>

</div>


    
<div class="content e-content">

<p>You&rsquo;re going to need a whole lot more details before anyone can give you a reasonable estimate, especially from a programmer who&rsquo;s not familiar with how fantasy leagues work. Where is the data going to come from? How many players will participate? What kind of actions can they do? Will size will you need to be able to scale to? etc</p>

<p>Currently my savings are mostly in fixed-interest time deposits (low interest rates around here though) and in personal loans to well-trusted people who repay me on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I would like to branch out my investments to stuff like mutual funds or whatever, but I am a bit ignorant on these matters. I&rsquo;m just looking for more growth opportunities since some people have told me that I should be growing my money more. Because I&rsquo;m ignorant, I&rsquo;m a bit risk-averse, especially with stuff like the stock markets that seem so swingy to me. Any advice on where to start or what stuff I should read first?</p>
<p>Note: I am not an American!</p>
