<p>I think the face looks fine. For the hands, I would guess that it starts with not getting the wrist part right (where the hand joins the arms). I try to place the back of the hand first before adding the fingers, so that I know the fingers will end up in sensible positions. Take a picture of what your own hand would look like in the given pose then use it as reference.</p>
<p>For proportions, I think the sketch looks mostly ok, although the legs might be a bit too short. You can try using one of those figure drawing outline thingies (I forgot the term, there was a sketchdaily for them a while back), just google &ldquo;figure drawing outline&rdquo;, it acts like a guide to tell you what typical body proportions should be</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no expert or anything, but I hope I was helpful!</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t tell who it was sorry :( I always find portraits of real-life people difficult to get accurately (maybe I&rsquo;ll attempt Nathan Fillion one of these days too)</p>
<p>Aside from the eyes, I find that the shape of the lower half of the face particularly on the left side of the image feels quite different from the original. The smile is a bit wider on the original too.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>I feel like if I was younger and more trusting of state authority, there would have been a better chance of me being in favor of the death penalty. But I&rsquo;m old and wise enough to know that humans are fallible creatures, and somehow placing them in power makes them even more so, and thus we should avoid giving the state too much authority over human life.  Side note: I clicked through the link and read through the comments section a bit. Big mistake, sumakit lang ulo ko sa terrible comments</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You probably mean learning programming enough to work (unless you are really a fan of the theoretical applications of computer science). There are many ways to learn programming online (regardless of whether Filipino or not). A CS degree is hardly necessary. All you need is a decent computer and internet. Lots of short courses, books, tutorials available online. You just need to choose what you want to learn</p>

<p>Anything can become boring if you do it for too long and you let it. Whether you find something boring or not depends more on you as a person that the activity that you’re doing. Stamp collecting seems like the most boring hobby in the world, but there are people who have been doing it for ages.</p>
<p>Any kind of programming is in a class unto itself though, because technology advances so rapidly. There are always a lot of new things to learn!</p>

<p>Corruption is actually on the downtrend (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphjennings/2015/03/02/why-graft-is-declining-in-the-notoriously-corrupt-philippines/#1f6b83465aab">Why Graft Is Declining In The Notoriously Corrupt Philippines</a>)</p>
<p>Traffic and internet are bad, but I don’t see how you could possibly compare that to 1789 Paris, unless may alternate timelines involved.</p>
<p>Dissent is at a healthy level and people are perfectly free to criticize the government and oppose their actions. There is no rampant violence on the streets on a daily basis.</p>
<p>We aren’t perfect, and there is a long way to go, but we are in almost no way a dystopia.</p>

    Reply to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4kvhsq/serious_which_is_best_business_or_job/">&#39;[Serious] which is best Business Or job ?&#39; on /r/AskReddit</a>:

<div class="content e-content">

<p>The answer will be different for each person. Starting a business is more stressful and has a lot of risks but is potentially more rewarding. Taking a regular job is &ldquo;safer&rdquo; in the traditional sense, the risk here is mostly of possible future regret - in the future you may wish you had tried out riskier things when you were young.</p>
<p>There are people who will argue that having a job is still a risk since you are dependent on the competence and good will of other people to earn a living, that your safe job may not actually be as safe as you imagine since you could get fired or the company could go under at any time. But truthfully, you run the same risks when running a business, except that you do more of the work yourself, so whether you are able to overcome those risks or not is more dependent on your own effort.</p>

<div class="content e-content">

<p>It means what the reminder text says. You can choose to cast Murderous Cut for a reduced cost (as little as one black mana!) by exiling cards from your graveyard. Each card you exile reduces the cost by (1)</p>
<p>Some decks will use the graveyard as a resource, so they will have cards that allow you to move cards directly from your own library to graveyard (often called &ldquo;milling&rdquo;). The idea is to win before running out of cards in the library, taking advantages of the additional bonuses provided by having more cards in the graveyard (for Murderous Cut, the bonus is having the choice to play it at a lower cost)</p>

<p>In the long run, these will tend to be the same. If people perceive you as confident, it tends to create a positive feedback loop that soon enough you <em>will</em> be confident</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Write. Keep a journal or write a blog. As long as you write regularly.</p>
<p>Writing lets your sort out your thoughts and clarify them and lets you learn how they should be organized.</p>
<p>Don’t worry that other people might not like what you write, you can write for yourself (at least at first). Writing for yourself is a lot like meditation, except that the physical act of typing out or manually writing out your thoughts can make it more satisfying and give a better sense of permanence.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Adverbs don’t work the same way in Tagalog as they do in English. Most adverbs will be a phrase combining an adjective with something else, with the exact form depending on context, usually “nang”.</p>
<p>For example, “deeply”’s root adjective is “deep”, which is “malalim” in Tagalog.</p>
<p>“He was stabbed deeply by a knife”  -&gt; “Sinaksak sya <b>nang malalim</b> gamit ang kutsilyo”</p>
<p>“I loved her deeply” -&gt; Minahal ko sya <b>nang malalim.</b></p>

<p>Don’t worry too much about what people think about you. Other people generally think about us a lot less often than we imagine.</p>
<p>Be a true person. That means being open and honest and unpretentious. It also means being comfortable with yourself, flaws and all.</p>
<p>Be interested in other people. Genuinely interested. When you meet someone new, try to find something you find interesting about them and ask them more about it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Don’t feel bad for being a quiet person. Quiet people are cool.</p>
<p>Don’t compare yourself to other people. Not everyone has to be the life of the party.</p>
<p>Instead of worrying about being a quiet person or whether other people see you as boring, ask yourself this: are you a true person?</p>
<p>Being a true person means that you are honest and open. It means that you are comfortable enough with yourself that you don’t mind talking about your own interests and passions when other people are interested and keeping quiet when they are not. It means not being pretentious and not changing yourself simply to become more popular or liked.</p>
<p>When you are a true person, you don’t have to worry about whether you are boring or interesting. Here is a truth: every person can be boring or interesting to other people, it all depends on whether those other people share the same passions or culture with you. I work in software development, so when I encounter another software developer in the wild, we can easily have good conversations even if we are strangers. Being a true person facilitates this: when people see that you are honest and open and unpretentious, those who share your interests and passions will be more likely to gravitate to you.</p>
<p>Aside from that, one other tip I can give you is: be interested in other people. What you think of other people matters more to them, so if you show interest in them, they are more likely to show an interest in you. This means being willing to listen to them and their stories to figure out where their interest lies, and asking them questions to make them elaborate on those interests.</p>
<p>Being a true person helps here too, because people can easily spot fake interest. Be genuinely interested in other people. Even if you dislike another person, try to find something about him that you find interesting and try to make him talk more about it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The fact that you recognize this as a fault is already a very good first step.</p>
<p>Being kinder, selfless, generous, thoughtful…these are all basically traits of empathy, which means being more attuned to the needs and feelings of other people instead of simply being absorbed in your own.</p>
<p>I imagine you could try one or more of the following:</p><ul><li>when in a conversation with someone, try to listen more to what the other person is saying instead of waiting for your turn to speak. Once the other person is done speaking, try to echo back what she is saying like “So if I understand this correctly, what you’re saying is …?” If after clarification it turns out that person has a problem, ask her what you can do to help</li><li>after a nontrivial encounter with another person, try to take stock and ask yourself some questions: did the other person have a problem? Did I notice and acknowledge it and maybe offer some help? What seemed to be his/her state of mind?</li><li>Try to study the body language of people you know.

<p>I&rsquo;ve found when drawing female faces, the less lines I use they generally turn out better. I try to use just enough lines to show the facial/bone structure</p>
<p>Your sketch is pretty great though!</p>
