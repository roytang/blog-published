<p>This is already on the second visit to Lignatore. I had already defeated the boss and there was the cutscene and everything, then I realized I didn&rsquo;t get this box and I probably won&rsquo;t be able to get it. I still have this save game that&rsquo;s right before the boss before I go to Mysticete, wondering if whatever is in there is worth re-loading to try to get it :p</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Seriously? Determination of guilt or innocence isn’t a purely computational matter. There are no algorithms that can compute guilt. Adding to the complication are varying intricacies of law in different jurisdictions. If humans don’t know how to get it right, then we can’t program computers to do so either.</p>
<p>Arguably, we could build programs that learn to make such judgments, but in order for such programs to work we would need more data to train them. A lot of data, given the impossibly large number of possible ways that a crime can be committed. Way, way more data than we have criminal cases worldwide. We are probably two or three generations away from such a thing being even conceivably possible.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Despite what many might say, people can change. That is, people’s interests and passions can change. It’s not right or wrong, it’s just being human. The key is to keep living your life proactively. If you feel like the passion in your work is waning, think of what used to excite you about it and see if you can recapture that excitement. Or try to identify whether the problem is with the work you’re doing or the company you’re working for. Perhaps working for a different company or in a different environment might reingite the spark. Explore your options.</p>
<p>At the same time, explore your options in other areas as well. It’s good that you tried taking courses about something, but if you find it doesn’t hold your interest very well, don’t be afraid to try other things. Be open to new opportunities or new areas to expand your character or your interests.</p>
<p>Living life is pretty much a game of exploration. You try things out and see if they make you happy, then you keep doing those that make you happy until they don’t. Then either you try to make it better or you search for other things to make you happy.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Someone on <a href="https://quora.com">quora</a> asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Have-you-ever-made-something-that-you-ultimately-regret-making-Why/answer/Roy-Tang">Have you ever made something that you ultimately regret making? Why?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought about answering this with some of the products I helped develop in the past, but as I was writing it I realized that “regret” was the wrong word to choose. There were a lot of mistakes made during design and implementation that ultimately led to the failure of those products, and I suppose the company might regret spending time and effort and money on those products, but for me personally I learned a lot from them, especially on what kind of mistakes to avoid in the future</p>
<p>I think the only way I could say I regret making a product would be if it were something that ultimately turned out to be harmful to other people, i.e. something that might have caused injury or harm</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Where?&rdquo; Steve muttered over the cackle of his walkie-talkie. He dropped his fork on the plateful of bacon and started packing up. &ldquo;I’m nearest, I’ll be there ASAP. Have Glen and Lynn follow me as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His companion was looking at him quizzically from across the table. &ldquo;Relax, John. You didn’t screw up this time. In fact, I guess it’s time for your trial by fire.&rdquo; He got up and tossed him the keys. &ldquo;Come on, you’re driving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John just nodded and followed as Steve got up and stepped out of the supply depot. John had been on this internship for three days now and he still had that feeling of awe and majesty whenever he gazed upon the vast expanse. The green grassy fields were bounded to the north by a heavily wooded area and to the southwest by a small mountain range. The sun was on the way down by the mountains; it would be dark soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where we going?&rdquo; John asked as he stepped into the driver’s seat of the open-air off-road jeep they had been using for patrols.</p>
<p>Steve jumped into the passenger seat and gestured. &ldquo;North by northeast. Floor it, we need to be there fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John nodded and soon they were speeding down the grassy plains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we headed into the forest?&rdquo; John asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; Steve was rummaging around in the supplies in the back of the jeep. To John’s surprise, Steve pulled out a scoped hunting rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What’s going on? There’s going to be trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; Steve said, loading and readying the rifle. &ldquo;But best be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before John could ask any more questions, they both heard a loud thunderous roar ring through the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; Steve nodded. &ldquo;It’s Amethyst.&rdquo; Steve pointed to the edge of the forest. &ldquo;There! Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were still some distance away, but the dragon was large enough for John to see. Amethyst was on the ground, her amber-yellow scales glistening in the receding sunlight. Her large wings were pinned to the ground somehow and she seemed to be struggling with some sort of ropes. It was starting to get dark, but John could still see a number of small figures milling around the dragon. &ldquo;What are they doing&ndash;?&rdquo; John wondered aloud as they got closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poachers.&rdquo; A grim look took over Steve’s face as he aimed the rifle and took a shot. It was a warning shot, there was no way he would hit anything at this distance. &ldquo;Hang on Amy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poachers turned at the sound of the warning shot. John saw that there were six of them in all, and they had a large truck nearby, barely large enough to carry a small dragon. Two had trapped Amy in a net of ropes weighted down by what looked like metal drums. One of them, a stocky man with a dark tan and wearing army fatigues was shouting instructions to the others. Three were holding rifles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit, &quot; John said, recognizing the threat. He quickly braked and turned, sending the jeep into a spinning drift. &ldquo;Get down Steve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two of them ducked as shots rang overhead. The jeep skidded to a stop and John and Steve quickly spilled out the passenger side and crouched down, using the vehicle as a cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great instincts kid! Here!&rdquo; Steve tossed the rifle to John as he pulled out the walkie-talkie from his belt. &ldquo;Keep ‘em busy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nodding, John picked up the rifle. Now he understood why weapons training had been a requirement for this internship. He took a peek over the jeep’s side. The poachers were still firing, but keeping their distance. Amethyst struggled uselessly against the weighted ropes and her roars kept echoing. John fired a shot, then sat back to reload. &ldquo;I think the dragon’s wounded Steve! Her left wing looked like it was bleeding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve nodded. &ldquo;Bastards! They probably clipped her wings to force her to land.&rdquo; He spoke into the walkie-talkie again. &ldquo;Glen, Lynn, where are you? These guys are heavily-armed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten minutes out!&rdquo; a voice cackled back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not nearly quick enough,&rdquo; Steve grunted as more shots rang overhead and John managed to fire back a few times. &ldquo;You got any of them yet kid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They’re too far, I can’t get a good shot,&rdquo; John shook his head, &ldquo;I don’t understand, why doesn’t the dragon breathe on them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amy’s too young kid, just like you,&rdquo; Steve replied, &ldquo;You saw her snort out a couple of small fireballs outta her nostrils the other day right? That’s all she can do without getting exhausted.&rdquo; A few more shots rang over their heads. &ldquo;Well, we only got one shot now. Cover me.&rdquo; He reached over back into the jeep again, being careful not to expose his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don’t suppose you have a rocket launcher in there,&rdquo; John said as he fired off a couple more shots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better,&rdquo; Steve said, finally pulling out a weapon only slightly larger than a pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A flare gun? How is that going to help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn’t fire flares kid,&rdquo; Steve aimed the gun upwards. &ldquo;Watch and learn.&rdquo; He pulled the trigger. What shot out certainly looked like a flare to John, as it slowly arced upwards into the sky. At the peak of the shot, where a flare would have exploded into bright light, instead a loud roar pierced the heavens. &ldquo;Gotta hope she’s nearby…&rdquo;</p>
<p>John saw the poachers look up at the sound in alarm. &ldquo;What the heck was that?&rdquo; John asked, &ldquo;Who is nearby…?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was cut off by another roar, seemingly a short distance away, from beyond the woods. He looked to the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There we go,&rdquo; Steve grinned. &ldquo;You’re in for a treat kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A large winged figure was descending towards them quickly. &ldquo;Another dragon!&rdquo; John exclaimed, &ldquo;And she’s a lot bigger too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just any dragon, kid,&rdquo; Steve said, &ldquo;That’s Amy’s mom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her shadow was almost fifty-feet long as she flew over the two of them and circled back towards the poachers. She flew so close to the ground that her scales glistened with the reflections of the fading sunlight, and every flap of her enormous wings sent a strong gust towards John and Steve. John was pretty sure his mouth was agape.</p>
<p>The larger dragon roared again in fury. John looked behind the jeep just in time to see the poachers in a panic, dropping their ropes and guns and making a mad dash for their truck. He looked up and saw the larger dragon take a deep breath and then what seemed like pure hot boiling rage burst forward from her open jaws. The grass seemingly parted way to burnt leaves as the fiery breath scorched the ground, heading straight for the poachers.</p>
<p>The leader of the poachers was already in the truck’s driver seat, willing the engine to start. The others were scrambling into the back of the truck. But it was too late for them. The dragon caught up with them and in a matter of seconds the truck was completely wrapped in flames. With another roar, she swooped back upwards and around for another go, but it wasn’t necessary. As she turned away from the truck, it exploded into a violent ball of fire.</p>
<p>Amy cried out to the skies as her mother circled around and finally landed next to her. The mother’s majestic wings spread out as she landed and she let out another roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on kid,&rdquo; Steve said, finally getting up, &ldquo;Just stick close to me, they know who I am.&rdquo; He started jogging towards the dragons. John shook himself out of his stupor and followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We’re gonna need the water choppers over here,&rdquo; Steve was talking into the walkie-talkie again as they jogged past the burnt grass.</p>
<p>Amy and her mother let out quiet wails as they approached. Not quite roars, but more like cries of… recognition? That’s what it seemed like to John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy there, girls,&rdquo; Steve said in a soothing voice as he slowed down and walked towards the ropes holding Amy to the ground. He kicked one of the barrels the ropes was tied. &ldquo;Must be fifty pounds of rocks in there,&rdquo; he muttered as he pulled out a knife and started cutting off the ropes as the two dragons quietly looked on.</p>
<p>Finally, Amy had been cut loose. She loosed another cry again, perhaps in gratitude. &ldquo;She looks tiny in the shadow of her mother,&rdquo; was all John could say as Amy tried flapping her wings. The left wing was useless, she wouldn’t be able to fly.</p>
<p>The mother let out a subtle roar, and started flapping her wings. Steve held on to his hat as the gusts blew over them. She hovered over the two of them and Amy for a bit, before she finally grabbed the smaller dragon with her hind claws and lifted her up. The two of them took altitude and flew off towards the mountains, into the sunset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow.&rdquo; John said. Then after a while he said it again. &ldquo;Wow. That was… intense. What happens now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve nodded towards the mountains. &ldquo;She has a nest there somewhere. She’ll nurse Amy for a few weeks until the wing heals. Dragons have naturally good healing, so she’ll probably make a full recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John looked back at the charred remains of the poachers’ truck. &ldquo;Does this happen a lot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; Steve shook his head. &ldquo;They don’t often go for the dragons themselves. Couple of times a year, they’ll try raiding the nests for eggs or scales or leavings, that kind of thing. You’ll be surprised what they can get on the black market.&rdquo; He mused. &ldquo;The last time they got a live one must’ve been something like seven or eight years ago. It’s why we only have eight dragons here in the preserve. Used to be nine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No new ones have been born since then?&rdquo; John said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope. Dragon births have been getting rarer and rarer. Not enough males. We haven’t seen our male in a few months,&rdquo; Steve nodded towards the mountains again. &ldquo;Amy’s the most recent birth we know of. No one knows if there’re any in the wild. The older ones are starting to die off too, so there’s a good chance the eight we got might be the last ones ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John shook his head. &ldquo;It’s sad isn’t it, in a few generations, kids might think they’re fairy tales.&rdquo; Steve had no response, so they stood there in silence staring at the charred grass until the sounds of a helicopter started coming in from the east.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, took ‘em long enough,&rdquo; Steve muttered before gesturing John back to the jeep. &ldquo;Cheer up kid, you did good today. Who knows, maybe we make a difference. Maybe soon, dragons will be all over the world again.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There are projects where it would be acceptable. Generally small, low-risk projects where there is a sufficient library of similar enough projects for the junior developer to reference how to do the more difficult common stuff (security, auth, audit trails, etc)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Most common is burnout due to inordinate amounts of stress. It’s usually the schedule pressure + some form of bad management.</p>
<p>Some things that can stress software developers out:</p><ul><li>poor team dynamics</li><li>having to work too many hours</li><li>crisis-driven development</li><li>having to do substandard/low-quality work</li><li>incompetent managers not listening to developers or not respecting estimates</li><li>having to deal with constantly changing client requirements</li></ul><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">All of the above are part and parcel of “enterprisey” software development though, but combined with intensive schedule pressure it can make developers question the industry altogether</p>

<p>You have to feel you deserve it. If you don’t, then fake it until you do. Convince yourself, day after day</p>
<p>If you are feeling sad or depressed for an extended period, please consider talking to a professional</p>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/How-does-a-single-game-programmer-get-art-for-his-game/answer/Roy-Tang">How does a single game programmer get art for his game?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The options should be fairly obvious:</p><ol><li>You raise money; or</li><li>You con one of your friends or some stranger to do the art for you either for free or in exchange for some part of future profits (which are unlikely to happen); or</li><li>You do the art yourself</li></ol></span></p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” Liz said, scratching her head.</p>
<p>“What’s not to understand?” The old man looked at her with a look that was somewhere between condescension and amusement. “There’s simply nothing there.”</p>
<p>“You mean like, no one lives there right? Behind your house? Or is it just a steep cliff that I’d fall off if I tried to walk into whatever that mist is?”</p>
<p>The old man shook his head, “No, no. No cliff. A cliff is something after all. There’s nothing there.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand,” Liz repeated, looking even more confused.</p>
<p>“Tell you what, why don’t you go out back, pick up a stick, and poke it through the “mist”, see what happens,” the old man turned his back to her and started fussing around with the oven again, “After all, this pie will be a few more minutes.”</p>
<p>Liz didn’t really have anything to do but wait, so she decided to satisfy her curiosity. She still wasn’t sure if she could fully trust the old man (although he didn’t look he was in any condition to assault anyone), so she picked up her backpack before heading out the door at the back of the kitchen.</p>
<p>She stepped out into a small, grassy back yard (not very well-maintained) surrounded by a number of trees of varying age. Beyond the yard and beyond the trees, a swirling black and grey and white shrouded her view, and she could not see anything more than a few dozen meters from the house. The black and grey and white extended in both directions, as far as her eyes could see, interspersing with the trees that dotted the landscape.</p>
<p>Slowly, Liz walked towards the mysterious black and grey and white. She glanced back at the house as she did so, the aging red-bricked walls no different from the facade she had sighted from the distance. The house looked a lot smaller up close, even though it was two stories. It must have been some trick of perspective that made it look like a mansion when she first spotted it not thirty minutes ago. Or perhaps a trick of her mind, deliriously happy to see smoke coming from t</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Learning to code is not strictly necessary. It would be sufficient to simply have an understanding of how programs execute step-by-step instructions and algorithms. If you’re interviewing programmers, you can simply give them a moderately complex problem and ask them to verbally walk through / explain to you how they would approach the problem (you yourself would need to understand how the problem is typically solved). Sorting algorithms for example, can easily be explained with a few whiteboard diagrams instead of writing code</p>
<p>The larger problem is that it is never easy to identify a good programmer. Even for people who do know how to code! The best way to identify a good programmer is actually to work with them on a project, but of course that option is unlikely during an interview. In general look for high-level skills: ability to step through the solution to a problem (and explain it well), ability to spot possible problems in a given solution (you might try describing a problem you encountered in a previous project and ask how he would address it), ability to work well with others, etc</p>

<p>Practice doing without thinking. Be spontaneous</p>
<p>It can be small, low-risk things. Say hi to strangers. Impulse buy a chocolate bar. Take a different route to work. Eat at unfamiliar restaurants. Buy a book in a genre you don’t usually like. Skip work one afternoon to see a movie. Etc</p>

<p>Philippines.</p>
<p>In the city areas, I think belief in ghosts and the like is comparable to Western countries. It may be more pronounced in the countryside. A lot of people reference local myths of course, but it&rsquo;s not like adults really believe them or anything. There&rsquo;s a lot of old wives tales too but nobody really takes them seriously afaik</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of chinese families here who practice feng shui and the like too</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It depends on what the purpose of the documentation for the non-technical people is</p>
<p>If you’re trying to convince them to try/buy your software, that’s marketing and copywriting, and you have to focus on feature sets and how it will be used by the end user</p>
<p>If it’s for users, to give instructions on how to use the software, typically developers will include some sort of user manual detailing the way to execute various tasks within the application</p>
<p>Regardless of the purpose, documentation written for nontechnical people will tend to focus on use cases and how the software satisfies requirements</p>

<p>Show an interest in what they’re into. Say you’re not too familiar and ask for details. People who like things like it when other people ask about those things.</p>
<p>Please note though that it’s perfectly fine to have different interests from other people. People don’t have to like the same things. It doesn’t mean you can’t hang out with them or anything unless you really want to</p>
