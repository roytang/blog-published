He was crazy but not too\ncrazy. He was mean when it came to exams. But that was ok. He still rocked!\n \n \nI haven&#39;t done anything earth-shaking yet. Well, there was Digital Pinay - I\nwas one of the bloggers who had so much to say about it but that was about it.\n*laughs* Feeling ko tuloy wala akong nagawa!",
