  "text": "I think you should cut white. You already have a lot of removal so you don&#39;t\nreally need to play Oblivion Ring since it just makes you have to play a\nfourth basic land type. Plus you left out some really good on-color stuff for\nthose white removal spells, like Topan Ascetic, and less so but still solid\n2nd Carrion Thrash and Resounding Roar. You could cut one or two of the gold\n2-drops since it seems like (haven&#39;t layed out the deck myself) you&#39;re pretty\nspread among BRG, and you have a decent amount of removal to deal with a rush.\n \n \nYou can always board it in if you think you&#39;re playing a deck you absolutely\ncan&#39;t beat without it.\n \n \nAnd Manaplasm is really freaking good, he starts every time you are in Green.",
