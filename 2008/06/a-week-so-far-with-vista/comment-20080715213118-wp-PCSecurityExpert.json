  "text": "I think OEM vendors have some kind of agreement with McAfee and Norton which\nforces them to install these antiviruses - no matter how bad performing they\nare. If I&#39;m more or less tolerant with McAfee, then Norton is a system killer.\nI&#39;ve just come across a report where it&#39;s said that Norton slows start-up by\n50%. Awful! Avast antivirus is much less resource-hungry.",
