I actually read your blog also, sana nga dumami tayo hehe.\n \n \nAbout the decklists and cardnames, I do programming so I wrote a plugin for\nWordpress that automatically formats the decklists for me. Unfortunately since\nyou&#39;re using Blogger, it&#39;s more difficult since Blogger doesn&#39;t support\nplugins. It might be possible using JavaScript...I&#39;ll think about it hehe",
