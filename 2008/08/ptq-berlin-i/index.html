<p>The tournament was last Saturday, Aug 16 at Robinson&rsquo;s Galleria. I played the same deck as <a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/2008/08/2008-philippine-open-block-top-16/">last week</a>, except I had the following sideboard:</p>

<p>The extra removal was geared towards the kithkin matchup, which was unknown to me at the time. As is usual for me, I lacked playtesting; with the justification that these PTQS <em>were</em> my playtesting for the GP.</p>
<p>Tournament report follows! My memory is a bit sparse, so I&rsquo;ll gloss over some of the details.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1</strong>: PWC Special vs GRBW Persist</p>
<p>I won this in three games. The opponent&rsquo;s deck was very rogue&hellip; tons of persist creatures: Murderous Redcap, Kitchen Finks, Twilight Shepherd&hellip; and <a href="http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Rendclaw%20Troll">Rendclaw Troll</a>. Yeah, look it up.</p>
<p>Games: 2-1, Matches: 1-1</p>
<p><strong>Round 2:</strong> PWC Special vs Kithkin/Mirror Master</p>
<p>Ooh, my first Kithkin matchup with this deck! Let&rsquo;s see how I do. The following picture from my life total notes should explain it clearly:</p>

<p>Long version: I lost the first game quite badly.</p>
<p>In the second game, I managed to stabilize and race. My army had been tapped low by Pollen Lullaby and the guys weren&rsquo;t going to untap. All I had was a Mirror Entity. He was on six and I was at nine (see the life totals in the image!) He had six spirit tokens and a random kithkin (I think it was a Meadowgrain).</p>
<p>So he plays Ajani, pumps &lsquo;em all and swings for the kill. I show my own Pollen Lullaby and we clash: He shows a land, I show&hellip; Cryptic Command! I&rsquo;ve practically won; despite Ajani&rsquo;s vigilance, I could tap down his army with the Command (and bounce Ajani), and the effect from Pollen Lullaby still applies so they won&rsquo;t untap before my army gets another swing.</p>
<p>So he says done, I don&rsquo;t untap and draw my Cryptic Command. At this point, I have seven lands in play and an active Mirror Entity. I look at the life totals and see he&rsquo;s at six. Somehow, what goes through my head is that the Entity could kill him in one swing. So I did! And I immediately pumped for seven!</p>
<p>The spirit tokens were all of course, still quite untapped as I had not yet played the Cryptic Command. T_T</p>
<p>Wow, what a lapse. I had to write &ldquo;MISPLAY&rdquo; in all caps so that I never forget.</p>
<p>Games: 2-3, Matches: 1-1</p>
<p><strong>Round 3:</strong> PWC Special vs Demigod Red</p>
<p>I got lucky in both games 2 and 3 as he drew far too many land and couldn&rsquo;t finish me off.</p>
<p>Games: 5-5, Matches: 2-1</p>
<p>While waiting for the next round, I did a few playtest games with Joel &ldquo;gjarkeld&rdquo; Bantilles playing Kithkin, so I could get a better feel for the matchup. I don&rsquo;t usually name drop here, pero gusto raw ni Joel mabanggit sa blog ko e!</p>
<p><strong>Round 4:</strong> PWC Special vs Kithkin/Mirrormaster</p>
<p>Second time around, I have a better idea how to fight the matchup. The main defensive key in game one is the Banneret into Sower opening. Even if they kill the Sower, it&rsquo;s like you time walked them since they didn&rsquo;t do anything for a turn. If you do get to untap with the Sower, you&rsquo;re iin good shape. I won game one this way.</p>
<p>For game two, I sided into board control:</p>
<p>-4 Merfolk Reejerey, -2 Peppersmoke, -1 Mirror Entity, -1 Bitterblossom, +2 Hallowed Burial, +2 Shriekmaw, +2 Eyeblight&rsquo;s Ending, +2 Pollen Lullaby</p>
<p>I pulled out the Reejereys because I didn&rsquo;t want him to be a Mirrorweave target. (More on this in round seven!)</p>
<p>I won game two in three quick swings according to my notes.</p>
<p>Games: 7-5, Matches: 3-1</p>
<p><strong>Round 5:</strong> PWC Special vs Justice Toast</p>
<p>I remember reading somewhere that Justice Toast was an underdog to Merfolk, so I wasn&rsquo;t too worried. I figured as long as I could stick a Bitterblossom or hit the Merfolk aggro engine, I should be fine. None of those things happened in two games!</p>
<p>Games: 7-7, Matches: 3-2</p>
<p>Hay&hellip; I was thinking of dropping at this point, but I figured I needed more play experience for the GP (I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be able to play in the last 2 Sunday GPTs)</p>
<p><strong>Round 6:</strong></p>
<p>PWC Special vs Kithkin (again)</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether he was in fact playing Mirror Master since in game one he showed me only the Goldmeadow tapper and Rise of the Hobgoblins and a million plains. I boarded -2 Peppersmoke, +2 Hallowed Burial since I wasn&rsquo;t sure.</p>
<p>I won both games off the Banneret into Sower plan, since he didn&rsquo;t draw any Unmakes.</p>
<p>Games: 9-7, Matches: 4-2</p>
<p><strong>Round 7:</strong> PWC Special vs Kithkin yet again</p>
<p>I was expecting I would win round 5 since my tendency seems to be to gravitate towards a 5-2 record. Unluckily I was paired againt Joel (whom I mentioned above; dapat daw sabihin ko &ldquo;Hayup yung si Joel!&quot;)</p>
<p>In game one he dropped me to below 10 quickly, but I stabilized a bit with a Bitterblossom. He was still at 20 and I had an entity, so I figured I needed to get a creature advantage and then entity him to death. I thought about it for a bit, then played a second Bitterblossom. I was hoping that either I would draw a Cryptic Command or he would have 1-2 turns without drawing creatures, in which case the Bitterblossom advantage would be enough. Unfortunately I went to as low as 2 and we still had equal counts and the next draw was a land, so I scooped for game two.</p>
<p>I went with the same board plan as round 4 here, bringing out the Reejereys.</p>
<p>In game two I hit every Kithkin with removal as soon as it game down, then went into Bitterblossom mode, and we were racing again. I eventually won due to winning a Pollen Lullaby clash.</p>
<p>In game three, he had a quick start and all I had were Bitterblossoms and Sage&rsquo;s Dousings. Even if had drawn a Sower to stop the tide, he had Moonglove Extract and Unmake in hand.</p>
<p>Joel commented that I should have boarded out the Dousings, and instead kept in the Reejereys (more creatures). In retrospect he was probably right, especially since I was on the draw.</p>
<p>I shook my fist at him and swore vendetta (not really), and then signed the match slip for my disappointing finish.</p>
<p><strong>Final Record:</strong> Games: 10-9, Matches: 4-3</p>
<p><strong>About the deck:</strong></p>
<p>Right now, I&rsquo;d say there&rsquo;s about a 60-70% chance I&rsquo;ll be playing this deck at the Grand Prix (even though I&rsquo;ve been known to make deck switches at the last minute)! I went 2-2 against Kithkin today, and 2-1 against other decks. One of the Kithkin losses was arguably due to sheer stupidity/lack of focus, so there&rsquo;s definitely room for improvement there that should come with practice.</p>
<p>Now to figure out the QnT matchup&hellip;</p>
