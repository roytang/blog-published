<p>Of course I went in again with no playtesting. Enjoyment. Tournament report follows.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1: UB Faeries</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically impossible to join a standard tournament without seeing UB Faeries. This matchup is a race, since usually there&rsquo;s no blocking involved. But I felt confident since they have Bitterblossom and I have Psionic Blast, so I had a lower damage target. However, the main enemy in this matchup is Cryptic Command, since it stalls one round of damage which is huge in such a close race. I won game one easily since I got a nuts draw and my opponent seemed not used to playing against the fish.</p>
<p>I ‘m not sure exactly how I sideboarded here but it was almost certainly wrong, as I remember changing my board decisions 2 or 3 times. I proceeded to lose games two and three, although game three was very close. My opponent had boarded in more removal (4 Shriekmaws) which meant I almost never had a lord on the board &ndash; good choice.</p>
<p>Games 1-2 Matches 0-1</p>
<p><strong>Round 2: UBw Control (with Reveillark)</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how the opponent could possibly win here; the matchup is very similar to Faeries, except that my guys are unblockable. The normal plan is to have 3-6 guys in play by turn 3, then just use permission to stop Wraths/Damnations/whatever. Delay is excellent in this matchup since you send the Damnation back three turns where he&rsquo;s hopefully dead. I think I boarded in +2 Sower -2 random dorks, and won in three games.</p>
<p>Games 3-3 Matches 1-1</p>
<p><strong>Round 3: UB Faeries</strong></p>
<p>Yes, once again Faeries! Game one I had my opponent at one life and she had Bitterblossom out so I thought I would win, but end of turn Scion + Spellstutter + me forgetting to count the Faerie Conclave meant she was able to take me from 17 to 0 in one turn&hellip;</p>
<p>However, I managed to pull ahead and comfortably win games two and three.</p>
<p>Games 5-4 Matches 2-1</p>
<p><strong>Round 4: UB Faeries</strong></p>
<p>3 out of 4 opponents now brought this deck. Game one here was very close, as he killed me the turn before Bitterblossom would have killed him. A Cryptic Command decided that race, and he knew enough to play it inside the attack step so that I had no window to play a Merfolk spell to untap a creature.</p>
<p>Game two I mulligan to five, get stuck on one land and promptly lose. My opponent was apologetic about the mana screw, but hey that&rsquo;s the way the game works.</p>
<p>Games 5-6 Matches 2-2</p>
<p><strong>Round 5: UB Faeries</strong></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even bother writing the matchup in the notes anymore, I would surely remember that 4 out of the first five rounds I faced Faeries.</p>
<p>Game one my opponent tried to stay alive by using a Sower on my Lord of Atlantis &ndash; but that doesn&rsquo;t actually do anything since my guys get the bonus no matter where the Lord is. I lose game two to fast beats, then in game three I get the nuts draw: Turn 1 &ndash; Suspend Visions, Turn 2 &ndash; Banneret, Turn 3 &ndash; Reejerey, Adept (revealing Adept), untap island, one more Adept (revealing 3rd Adept). I actually had the 4th Adept as well, but I didn&rsquo;t want to overcommit to the board. No hope for the opponent&rsquo;s survival here&hellip;</p>
<p>Games 7-7 Matches 3-2</p>
<p><strong>Round 6: BRwu Control</strong></p>
<p>A strange controllish deck, I got hit by Avalanche Riders, Reveillarks and Hellkites, etc. I was close to sealing off game one with him at 5 and me holding the PsiBlast, but he manages to get a Tendrils off and I lost after that.</p>
<p>I board in +2 Sower -2 Sage&rsquo;s Dousing. I win the next two games easily without drawing the Sowers though&hellip; I just make it a point to be more careful about Tendrils.</p>
<p>Games 9-8 Matches 4-2</p>
<p><strong>Round 7: Monored Burn</strong></p>
<p>Finally, an opponent without islands! It&rsquo;s immediately obvious what he&rsquo;s playing when his turn 1 is mountain, suspend rift bolt. I take some hits, and he chooses to point his burn at me instead of my critters, which I think is a mistake. Against a straight control deck that&rsquo;s fine, but this one is an aggro-control swarm; I only need to make sure his burn doesn&rsquo;t deal the twentieth point of damage and surely my creatures can finish the job. At least, that was the plan, until he played Crusher and suspended Big Gargs. I kept chumping the Crusher while waiting for my answer &ndash; Sower. When I finally drew it, it forced him to sac the Crusher and he was already in topdeck mode so I just went in, dealing 4-5 points of damage at a time to win the game at one life. The Sage&rsquo;s Dousing and Silvergill Adepts were awesome in this matchup, ensuring that he loses steam before me.</p>
<p>I board in Flash Freeze for Delays. Second game is much like the first, except he draws no creatures except for a lone Mogg Fanatic which he sacs to off a Banneret, and he&rsquo;s also mana flooded. He&rsquo;s learned from the first game and keeps killing the lords, but eventually even the 1/1s manage to kill him. I ended the game at a comfortable 4 life, holding 2 flash freeze and a sage&rsquo;s dousing.</p>
<p><strong>Final record:</strong></p>
<p>Games 11-8, Matches 5-2, #15</p>
<p>I win a Morningtide Booster, and the rare is</p>
<p><strong>Idyllic Tutor!</strong></p>
<p>To be honest, I&rsquo;m glad to win anything at all, as I haven&rsquo;t won anything since the Morningtide Release event.</p>
<p>Well, that wasn&rsquo;t bad for a deck put together quicky with no playtesting at all. I wasn&rsquo;t able to use the Surgespanners, which I had hoped to use against ‘Lark but after getting a feel of the deck the Surgespanners seem a bit too slow. Still, the deck is a pretty good choice for the meta. It has about an even chance with Faeries, I think it has a positive matchup against slow control decks and with a little luck can even survive against monored burn, even without Dragon Claws or Bottle Gnomes. I&rsquo;ve always preferred turning men sideways in order to win, so I find this deck appeals to me more than ‘Lark.</p>
<p>What will I play next week? Stay tuned!</p>
