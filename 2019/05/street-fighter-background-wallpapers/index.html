<p>I often prefer having a randomly changing background wallpaper, even back in the day when Windows didn&rsquo;t support it natively and I had to install various plugins to support it. I like the variance! The one I&rsquo;ve been using recently was this set of wallpapers based on Street Fighter stage backgrounds, which I got from a reddit thread that I unfortunately can&rsquo;t find anymore (I&rsquo;ll update this post if I find it later).</p>
<p>In the meantime, I thought I&rsquo;d share:</p>
<p>(I also took this opportunity to install a Hugo gallery plugin for this sort of thing. Credits to <a href="https://github.com/liwenyip/hugo-easy-gallery/">Hugo Easy Gallery</a>!)</p>
<p>Edit: Found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/9i5y65/street_fighter_3_enhanced_stage_wallpapers/">the link to the reddit thread</a>!</p>
<p>Edit 2020-09-23: To reduce the number of shortcodes used on the site, I decided to just include the wallpapers as inline image resources.</p>
