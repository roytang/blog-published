<p>I bought the Outer Worlds <a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/2019/11/b4op_a_h17a/">earlier this month</a>, mainly because I had been without both my graphics card and my PS4 for a bit and I kind of wanted to play a relatively new game. I got the PS4 version because I hadn&rsquo;t yet replaced my video card at the time and besides, the game was not available on Steam. I guess minor spoilers follow.</p>
<p>Summary: A reasonable Fallout-esque RPG from the makers of Fallout: New Vegas. It&rsquo;s not as expansive or quite as nonlinear as their previous games, but it&rsquo;s pretty serviceable and there&rsquo;s a reasonable amount of stuff to do. A decent purchase, though I chafe at buying games at full $60 price these days lol.</p>
<p>My notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>setting is a far future corporate dystopia in a remote human colony. Or at least, a caricature of a corporate dystopia. Your main enemies are evil corporations, which appeals to my recent disdain for capitalism. There are no intelligent alien races to interact with, but plently of wild animals</li>
<li>the space map shows something like 6-7 inhabited planets in the cluster, but you really only interact with 3-4 of them so that&rsquo;s disappointing</li>
<li>there are some gorgeous environments on those planets though</li>
<li>feels a bit like Fallout, with the general aesthetic hewing closely to Fallout&rsquo;s 40s/50s vibe. Even the loading screens and movie advertisements are throwbacks to monster flicks from that era.</li>
<li>also feels a bit like Mass Effect, mainly with you getting a ship and the shuffling between worlds and the companion system</li>
<li>I would say the companions are not as fleshed out as the Mass Effect ones though. Some of them are a lot less fleshed out than others. One of them is basically just a cleaning robot that you stuck a gun to, and he has no further storyline. Also, tbere is no companion romance option, but completing companion questlines unlocks an extra perk for them (though this isn&rsquo;t clearly indicated when it happens, you have to check their status screen)</li>
<li>Phineas Welles gives a strong Rick Sanchez vibe</li>
<li>It isn&rsquo;t a true open world, more like a forest of smaller open world areas</li>
<li>There are a lot of quests to do, at least at the start, and they do a good job of putting the other quests in your path so that you naturally feel like you&rsquo;re running into them. Towards the last third of the game, new quests seem to taper off though</li>
<li>Actually, by the last third of the game, everything felt a bit same-y. I was definitely less enthused to play towards the end.</li>
<li>Combat especially doesn&rsquo;t have much variation. Either enemies run at you with melee weapons or shoot at you from afar etc. I wish I used a more sniper-rifle style with scoped hunting rifles, but I didn&rsquo;t. There is a version of VATS (which only you can use so somehow its a superpower), but it&rsquo;s more like a bullet time effect to help you aim</li>
<li>I like the voice acting, it&rsquo;s pretty decent, although as always it&rsquo;s noticeable when multiple NPCs have the same VA</li>
<li>Load time between areas can be a bit horrendous, sometimes as long as 1-2 minutes, or does it only feel that way?</li>
<li>It feels like you earn a lot of money, but there isn&rsquo;t really anything to spend it on. There&rsquo;s no reason to buy anything from shops, you&rsquo;ll get more than you ever need just from looting and picking up stuff.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a respec machine on your ship, which is cool, since it means you can commit skill points without too much fear of screwing up. However, I never really felt the need to respec during my run. I did respec after finishing the game to do some achievements though.</li>
<li>Level cap is 30. I did all the quests I could and I got to the cap before the point of no return, so that was annoying. I even went with nonviolent solutions a lot of the time, so if you were one of those guys who like to kill all the enemies instead, you&rsquo;ll hit the level cap even earlier. You won&rsquo;t be able to max a lot of skills. I like to be a &ldquo;jack of all trades&rdquo; kind of guy, so my skill distribution was fairly spread out and I was only able to max one skill.</li>
<li>For some reason, the game has a plethora of consumable items. I suspect these are mainly to support the hardest difficulty (supernova), as on normal difficulty there was never any reason to use a consumable other than the standard &ldquo;Heal X HP&rdquo; item.</li>
</ul>
<p>I finished the game yesteday, on normal difficulty. I actually started out on hard, but then, surprise, I had a hard time at the start. I didn&rsquo;t want to be too stressed so I downgraded to medium for the rest of the run. I got the &ldquo;good ending&rdquo;, that is to say, the one where you &ldquo;defeat&rdquo; the corporate master class, such as they are. Normal difficulty is relatively stress-free.</p>
<p>I usually want to go for 100% achievement completion, but this game had one that requires finishing on the highest difficulty, so that&rsquo;s another run altogether. Presumably the second run would be much faster since I don&rsquo;t have to do everything any more. I might get around to it someday.</p>
<p>Screenshots follow!</p>
