<p>For the uninitiated, <a href="https://inktober.com/rules">Inktober</a> is a drawing challenge where you have to make one drawing in ink (no digital! but you do you I guess) for each day in October, with each drawing based on a certain prompt. This year&rsquo;s prompts list is:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5af1bd791aef1d143f85e67e/1567315494055-9EETHXUUET9XHFJHGRNQ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kNiEM88mrzHRsd1mQ3bxVct7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0topjEaZcWjtmMYdCWL4dkGbxs35J-ZjFa9s1e3LsxrX8g4qcOj2k2AL08mW_Htcgg/2019promptlist.png?format=500w" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried participating in this a few times since 2016, I think I only completed the full 31 days once before this year though. You can view my current and future entries through the <a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober">inktober tag</a>.</p>
<p>For this year, I decided to up the challenge a bit more by doing a sequential series of drawings, something akin to a comic strip I guess? It&rsquo;s not a super good story or super original, but I did enjoy the challenge. Basically, I started out with a small group of adventurers (initially 2, but later 3 characters) in a dungeon for some reason, and followed them as they tried to get out of various dangerous situations. I also consider my handwriting quite atrocious, so I tried to avoid having to write too much text. (There was one drawing where I tried putting drawings in speech bubbles instead to get around this.) The sketchpad I was using was fairly small, and my manual dexterity is not so good these days, so a lot of my lines are shaky, since I don&rsquo;t have the advantage of digital sharpening etc.</p>
<p>The challenge usually came when I had to find a way to link the prompt to the current situation they were in, and to &ldquo;advance the story&rdquo; a bit every time, shall we say. I ended up having some days not have a single drawing, but rather a more comic-book style sequence of smaller panels. I think on average my ink drawings weren&rsquo;t as detailed as they were in previous years, but I did enjoy the challenge of having to string them together to form some semblance of a plot and also doing the panel layouts. The challenge was pretty fun, although stressful at times. I would only look ahead on the prompt list a few days of a time, so I didn&rsquo;t have a beginning-to-end plan or anything like that, but I did have some anxious days where it took me forever to figure out a way to somehow meet the prompt.</p>
<p>I made these drawings on a 152mm x 229mm sketchpad, using a Uni pin fine line pen I got a few years back. Many of them had pencil sketches first (especially those that were more complicated or challenging, and I didn&rsquo;t really erase the pencils thoroughly so you can still spot them on most of the drawings. There was also one day where I tried using some colored markers I found around the house to add some color, but the lines ended up way too thick so I was unhappy with it and didn&rsquo;t use them again. I had uploaded this series to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/roytang0400/">Instagram</a> as square images (since that&rsquo;s what Instagram accepts), but the original scans were mostly of full rectangular sketchpad page, so I present them here for your viewing pleasure. (Note: I&rsquo;m not claiming these are super good works or anything!) You can also view the original individual posts with captions via the <a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/tags/inktober2019">inktober2019</a> tag on this site.</p>
<p>Since I enjoyed the challenge so much, I&rsquo;m hoping this can set me back on my daily sketching routine. Though I&rsquo;ve already missed the first two days of November due to being out of town, but that&rsquo;s not something unrecoverable, hopefully!</p>
