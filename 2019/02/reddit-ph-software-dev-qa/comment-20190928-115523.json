I'm considering the chance that I'll pass the hiring process at a big international company as a software developer, but at the same time I'm considering that work just MIGHT be better in the USA. I'm looking forward to going through a bright career working in the IT industry but I fear that I won't be able to be satisfied working in the PH. Although after reading your post, I felt relieved that yes! I can possibly have a fruitful career here as long as I keep up my passion and work hard enough. Thank you so much for sharing what you know", "date": "2019-09-28 11:55:23"}
