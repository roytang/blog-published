This week felt like another set of those moments-in-between, where not much seemed to happen, but it somehow still went by quickly anyway.
I think the household and the family has slowly gotten used to the idea that any big Christmas celebration isn&rsquo;t happening. My niece&rsquo;s birthday was last weekend, so we sent her gifts via Grab delivery instead of being able to get together. Most likely something similar&rsquo;s going to happen for gift exchanges on Christmas.

<div class="content p-summary">
While digging through some old stuff recently I found a copy of the late 80s/early 90s US sitcom Perfect Strangers and decided to binge through all 8 seasons of it (really more like 6 and a half, since seasons 1 and 8 were an abridged 6 episodes each).
I grew up watching this series, on live tv even, before we had cable or Netflix or anything like that. During the binge-watch I remember a good number of the episodes from the first season all the way up to the end of season 7, which implies almost all of it was broadcast on local TV, kind of a rarity I think?

A while back someone I know went from working as a developer to working at a senior/management type position at a bank, and that new job came with the corresponding dress code, which meant he was now going to work in long sleeves or barongs. That kind of thing is not for me - back when I still considered a regular office job, one of the fastest ways to get me to run away from an &ldquo;opportunity&rdquo; would be an overly stringent and/or formal dress code.

Last week, Twitter added Fleets, their own version of stories (short-lived posts). As could be expected, it&rsquo;s not something I can relate to. I did post one (saying &ldquo;This is dumb.&quot;) just to see what the interface was like, but that&rsquo;s it.
I thought about writing a blog post about how I dislike this sort of ephemeral social media, but it turns out that something I&rsquo;d already written about before. Things don&rsquo;t change I guess, and they just come around.

After playing through Super Mario 3D All Stars in October, I borrowed a copy of Super Mario Odyssey for the Nintendo Switch from my brother and played through it for most of November. Odyssey was the main reason I actually got a Switch; I played through a few worlds at a friends house during a single session and loved it, so I had been meaning to get the console just for Odyssey alone.

<div class="content p-summary">
Rhythm of War is book four in Sanderson&rsquo;s epic fantasy Stormlight Archive series. Goodreads tells me I read the prior book Oathbringer back in Nov 2017, but didn&rsquo;t bother writing a review, so I had to make sure I&rsquo;d write one now.
The book&rsquo;s launch day kind of caught me a bit unexpectedly so I didn&rsquo;t bother doing a re-read of the previous three books. Which given an epic fantasy series of this scope might have been a mistake, but watch me do it again for book five.

It&rsquo;s National Heroes Day over here, so I&rsquo;ve been thinking about heroics.
In software development, Heroic Programming can have a negative connotation:
 HeroicProgramming is often the only course of action left when poor planning, insufficient funds, and impractical schedules leave a project stranded and unlikely to complete successfully.
 I guess it&rsquo;s not just in software development either. Many times heroics are an indicator of failed systems.
Bonifacio and other Philippine heroes were needed because Spanish colonialism had failed the Filipino people, necessitating a revolution.

December is almost upon us!
I had an opportunity last week to take on some additional work, but on further reflection, I thought I&rsquo;d pass on it. I am in general, averse to working during the Christmas season (that is to say, more so than during the entire year in general). Even back when I was working full-time, I&rsquo;d prefer taking most of my leaves during December. It&rsquo;s really a result of the terrible traffic in Metro Manila, which gets significantly worse during Christmas season, a trauma that lingers even when I&rsquo;m home all the time.

This week felt weird. It kind of went by quickly for me, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel like anything important really happened. Its kind of like those moments in-between other events, where you&rsquo;re just coasting along and waiting for the more significant things to happen. My country is still recovering from the storms of the past few weeks, Trump is still flailing around trying to overturn democracy, and our own president is still insecure when someone gets more attention than him.

    <p>Streaming some more Kaladesh Remastered draft (ep 2) https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgkld
Unfortunately, internet was too poor again tonight for streaming :(
Ok, I went ahead and did two drafts which was a terrible idea because I did very poorly both times. (Didn&rsquo;t bother getting a screenshot of the second result, they were the same!) Sigh, this format is tough. Hopefully I figure it out by next time.</p>

Weather this past week was very bad for those of us in Metro Manila (and many other places in Luzon). Howling winds and strong rains dominated for 2-3 days of the week due to typhoon Ulysses. This typhoon wasn&rsquo;t as strong as Rolly a couple of weeks ago, but it seems that it brought a lot more rains, causing flooding and loss of power in a whole lot of places. Metro Manila was hit quite badly, even drawing comparisons to Ondoy back in 2009.

<p>Kaladesh Remastered draft ep 1 <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy">https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy</a> #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgkld</p>
<p>Sadly, internet wasn&rsquo;t too good so I just cut the stream short. Too bad, so sad</p>
<p>Draft didn&rsquo;t feel super good, but I managed to break even in the games. No video because no stream. (In hindsight I could have just recorded locally!) Maybe I&rsquo;ll try streaming a draft again early next week.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/amirrajan/">@amirrajan</a> i dont have much other gamedev experience other than playing with unity a bit, but: I like that I can do most of the work in my text editor, and I like that it simplifies a lot of the work by making assumptions (like the 1280x720 resolution etc) so I can just focus on what I want</p>

I recently did a server migration since I moved to new hosting, The move was from managed/shared hosting to a VPS, these are some notes I took during the process, which I figure might be helpful if I ever tried to do this again. (And maybe someone else finds it helpful too). Links and references to helpeful resources are included.
Setting up a webserver and WSGI container I already knew I wanted to use Nginx (managed hosting on the old server always used Apache), that meant needing to choose a WSGI container for the Django apps.
