<p>Invincible season 1 finale was pretty great, the fight was intense and afterwards I couldn&rsquo;t believe there was still half an episode to go. It&rsquo;s been a while since I read the books so I&rsquo;m not sure, but I think they diverged a bit from the source material, but it&rsquo;s fine.<!--sep-->The series was developed well enough, decent pacing and enough to portray the major characters well. Looking forward to season 2!</p>

<p>Phrases like &ldquo;insufficient evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;no proof&rdquo; does nothing to dissuade people whose arguments are along the lines of &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t hurt to try&rdquo; or &ldquo;maybe it will help&rdquo;.</p>

    <p>The DOH and FDA reminded the public that they do not recommend the use of Ivermectin to treat #COVID19 due to insufficient scientific evidence.</p>

<p>The drug actively harming people would be more effective but the disadvantage of relying on science is that we can&rsquo;t just make claims like that without evidence.</p>

The jam A thing I did last weekend was to participate in the 48th LUDUM DARE game jam. Doing gamedev has been a long-time elusive dream of mine, all the way back to my college years. I&rsquo;ve had a number of failed attempts to get into gamedev, both solo and with other people.I&rsquo;ve also played around with things like PyGame, Unity, DragonRuby, etc.
I read about the LD48 game jam this April and signed up to participate.

Love intentionally, extravagantly, unconditionally. The broken world waits in darkness for the light that is you.&ldquo;<!--sep-->&ndash; L. R. Knost</p>

<h4 id="posted-on-rglobaltalk-question-what-are-the-police-like-in-your-countryhttpsredditcomrglobaltalkcommentsmvsss1question_what_are_the_police_like_in_your_country">Posted on r/GlobalTalk: <a href="https://reddit.com/r/GlobalTalk/comments/mvsss1/question_what_are_the_police_like_in_your_country/">[Question] What are the police like in your country?</a></h4>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been following recent events in the US (disclaimer: I&rsquo;m not an American), police brutality is a big, controversial topic over there, leading to protests and calls to defund the police and such, popularizing the phrase ACAB (meaning &ldquo;all cops are bastards&rdquo;)</p>
<p>In my own country (the Philippines), cops don&rsquo;t have a very good reputation either; they are often seen as corrupt extortionists and some may be complicit in extrajudicial killings in Duterte&rsquo;s drug war; recently they have done some bad moves such as attempting to interfere with community pantries that popped up to help the poor during the pandemic.</p>
<p>So that left me wondering what police are like in other countries. Are there countries where the police have a generally good reputation (maybe my country or the US can learn something from those places)? Or are they generally just tools for enforcing the (often unequal) status quo?</p>
