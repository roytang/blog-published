<div class="e-content">

<p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned <a href="https://mirror.roytang.net/2004/04/roy-goes-to-hk/">before</a>, I was sent to HK a couple of weeks back, for the rollout of a project I&rsquo;ve been involved with for about a year and a half. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s right for me to be talking about the project here, so I won&rsquo;t delve into any specifics. I will however, bore you all with stories from my first trip anywhere remotely far from home.</p>
<p>First, the plane trip. Economy class (excuse me, fiesta class) on a PAL Airbus from NAIA2 to HK International on Thursday night. Food was okay, I&rsquo;ve had worse, not really enough to turn me off airline food. The PAL flight attendants, as I later discussed with a male coworker, were quite not-young and, well, not-hot. Heh, probably unfair but you get a certain expectation from media, you know? The flight was short (less than two hours) and uneventful, no dizziness or pukathons for me, thanks, unlike when I take the eight-hour bus ride to Bicol. This may seem boring to seasoned fliers, but I liked that little map that told me at what location we were currently flying over. Neat!</p>
<p>As an engineering type, I also took notice of the plane itself. Is it normal that airplanes routinely jiggle and vibrate as the plane taxis? I understand that it&rsquo;s unavoidable as things like cars and trains do the same; but shouldn&rsquo;t things be a bit tighter on a plane? Still, didn&rsquo;t really bother me.</p>
<p>Upon landing, I got a glimpse of HK International Airport. I had heard it was huge, but didn&rsquo;t get to look around much as I was greeted at the boarding gate by two of the HK staff. Nice people, one of them bought me dinner at McDonald&rsquo;s although I told them I had already had the airline food. Afterwards, they took mo to The Peak, apparently a famous spot for tourists in Hong Kong. It&rsquo;s a mall-type thing on top of a rather high mountain. From the observation deck, you could see most of Hong Kong. From there I could see that Hong Kong was a very urbanized area, a lot more than Metro Manila.</p>
<p>After spending some time there, they drive me to the Staff Quarters near the HK office, where one of our RP staff has been staying for a month. The RP guy greets me, shows me upstairs, shows me the ropes, and I get some sleep.</p>
<p>The office building is right next to the block where the staff quarters was, barely a five-minute walk. I spent most of my time in HK between the office and the staff quarters. Truth be told, the trip wasn&rsquo;t really very exciting, as there was a lot of work to be done and not much time to goof around. I&rsquo;ll just note some things particularly interesting about being in a foreign country:</p>
<p><em>People speaking in an unintelligible language all the time</em>. Probably the biggest hurdle to anything, it took surprisingly little getting used to the fact that I couldn&rsquo;t communicate perfectly with anyone, and with some people, not at all. On some occasions, I had to buy food or drinks through pointing and using hand signs to find out how much stuff was. When walking on the street, I&rsquo;d turn my head whenever I hear someone speaking English, because it was quite unusual. Also, when dining out with the HK staff, I&rsquo;d have to rely on them to order for me, since I can&rsquo;t read the menus. Which brings me to&hellip;</p>
<p><em>Foreign food</em>. Anyone who knows me knows I&rsquo;m quite a picky eater. I don&rsquo;t take to new foods very easily. But it&rsquo;s hard to refuse when you&rsquo;re a guest, so I got to taste more new stuff in my five and a half days in HK than I have for maybe the past three years. It&rsquo;s ok, I don&rsquo;t mind, even the veggies. The biggest problem was the fact that I have no idea how to use chopsticks, and almost every meal needs the use of chopsticks. At one point, I had to badger my co-RP staff to help me get food using the serving chopsticks. While I was there, I had some Taiwanese, Thai food, and of course, Chinese. Lots of Chinese. Oh, and an interesting side note: apparently foreign McDonald&rsquo;s have no McSpaghetti.</p>
<p><em>Religious issues.</em> I was unable to hear Mass on Sunday. We had to work most of the day, but I got off around 4PM. I asked one of the HK guys for directions to a Church (we were in Kowloon, I believe), but when I explained that I was Catholic, he didn&rsquo;t know what the term meant. (This is of course ridiculous to a Filipino; everbody knows what a <em>Katoliko</em> is!) After saying that my faith is similar to another RP staff who he had also met before, he gave me some instructions on where to find a Church. I walked around a bit, following his directions. Which eventually lead me to a Mosque. Ooookay. So I walked around some more (quite a bit actually, went up and down the same road couple of times), I found a place called &ldquo;St Andrews Church&rdquo;, I guessed this was the place he was talking about. I walked in and asked around, found out they had a Mass around 6PM. So I waited for a bit. Around 5:45 I picked up a flier and noticed that it was in fact an Anglican Church (Is it a Protestant thing? Or something else? I&rsquo;m not entirely sure), and I it&rsquo;s not the same so I went out looking again. I saw another Church, this time it was Lutheran. Around 6:30PM, I gave up, bought some dinner at McDonald&rsquo;s and took a taxi home. The next day one of the HK staff who said he was Christian told me there was a Catholic Church beside the Mosque&hellip; apparently it was a small one so I failed to notice it. From our discussion, I think there&rsquo;s quite a distinction here between &ldquo;Christians&rdquo; and &ldquo;Catholics&rdquo;; which is weird since I&rsquo;m fairly sure Catholics are Christian. Anyway, I was wondering why it was so hard to find a Church in a place where&hellip;</p>
<p><em>There are so many Filipinos.</em> You can see &lsquo;em everywhere, as you walk along the main streets. Mostly tourists and domestic helpers, I believe. I could hear Tagalog being spoken on the street more often than English. Of course, maybe I should&rsquo;ve asked one of them where I could go to Church&hellip;</p>
<p><em>Taxis are discplined.</em> This is of course, shocking to any Filipino! A sticker on the inside of every taxi tells you the rules: They can&rsquo;t turn down fares, they have to issue a receipt when asked, they must follow seatbelt laws, etc. Every taxi is equipped with a receipt machine, and every one of &lsquo;em is bright red so they&rsquo;re easy to spot. Overall, while I still experienced traffic jams over there, their traffic situation is still hella lot better than ours.</p>
<p>What else can I say? As I said, I didn&rsquo;t have much free time. They were kind enough to give me half the day off on Tuesday afternoon (my flight home was Tuesday evening), and they recommended some places I could go visit. So I went to Quarry Bay, about 2 MTR stations away from the office. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what I was looking for, though, so I ended up mostly wandering aimlessly, not buying anything ‘cept for some food and drinks. I actually managed to walk all the way back to the office, and just decided to buy some chocolates from a supermarket to bring home.</p>
<p>On the flight home, PAL switched me to a much smaller plane, which sucked. :( I got to see more of HK Airport, and let me say&hellip; it&rsquo;s frickin&rsquo; huge. I told the guys who brought me to the airport that NAIA2 is like a fourth of HK airport, but now I think it&rsquo;s more like a sixth. I&rsquo;m told they even have some sort of moving platform thing for people whose gates are so frickin&rsquo; far. It took 30 minutes for our plane to taxi, that should say something.</p>
<p>Anyway, got home around 11:30, bought some more goodies at the duty-free shop. Took a taxi home, arrived safe and sound. Told stories for an hour or so, then &hellip;  zzzzzz.</p>
