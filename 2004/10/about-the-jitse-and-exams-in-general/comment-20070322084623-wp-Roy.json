  "text": "Hi Ruby, I wish I could help you out but I no longer have any of the review\nmaterial I used. I would recommend that you check out some of the sample exams\nor past exams (there should be some that are downloadable from the jitse\nwebsite I think), as these should help you greatly. The scope of the exam is\nrather wide, I understand it covers a lot of Computer Science stuff (I&#39;m no\nComSci grad so I don&#39;t know how accurate that is), there were questions on\nterminology, algorithms, software engineering concepts, etc.",
