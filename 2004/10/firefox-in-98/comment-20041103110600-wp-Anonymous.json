And I delete most desktop icons anyway - I already\nclutter it up with downloads whenever the data drives are out of space\n(often).\n \n \nIf you&#39;re in the mood to bowl, just say. I&#39;ve been itching to find someone to\nregularly play tenpins with.\n \n \nAbout playing, though: spent all day yesterday raising my rating from 867 to\n979 in WordBiz playing only against lower-ranked people (12 games). Apparently\nno one with a higher rank will answer my seeks. But, c&#39;mon, a guy with a\nranking of 131 took me on when I had a ranking of 939! (He lost by time out:\nspent 26 minutes on 7 or 8 turns. I guess that&#39;s why his ranking&#39;s low.)\n \n \nAnyways, I&#39;ve also tried Yahoo! Bridge and Yahoo! Hearts lately. Too bad\ntoday&#39;s the first day of classes in Ateneo - and next week is the first week\nof UP. I&#39;m finally full-time employed! Woot!\n \n \nHah! Even though I have my own blog, I just hijacked yours!\n \n \nhttp://www.livejournal.com/users/zukeeper/\n \n \nPS Drat, now I can&#39;t remember the last name of the new dean. I think she was\nthe EEE dean.",
