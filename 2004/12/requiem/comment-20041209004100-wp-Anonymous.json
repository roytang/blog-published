  "text": "Hey, Peng, (or is it still Sushie?). It&#39;s me, &quot;Entertainment Capital&quot;. Since\nmy account&#39;s on LJ, Roy and I anonymously comment in each other&#39;s blogs.\n \n \nIn the year that Sir Alix was my boss, he was, as far as I could tell,\ncompletely sober all of the time I was around. He convinced me that Pisay\nshould destructure the calculus curriculum and to trickle it down the lower\nyears, as he was teaching it partly in third year, though not as extreme as my\nurging to find a way to lower the function analysis parts of it (pertinent for\nlab reports) somehow to second (or first!) year. (He fully supported my move\nto teach bridge in Math 7 for the second semester, by the by.)\n \n \nHis cirrhosis was probably due to earlier bouts of heavy drinking. From what I\nhear, his drinking buddies were the heavy drinkers in campus. The year after I\nleft, he started having fainting spells. Prior even to that, he has had bouts\nof high blood pressure, though that could be as likely caused by teaching\nstress as by liver problems, I have heard.",
