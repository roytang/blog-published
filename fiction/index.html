This was a submission I made to a short story contest sometime in 2017 (I&rsquo;ve already forgotten the URL for the contest). But basically, there were some parameters you hade to use in your story:
Dialogue: Enter, put the items in the field and get out in 30, got it Science (Optional): Technology allows people to hack their DNA sequence and recreate themselves to their liking
I didn&rsquo;t win the contest, but I thought I&rsquo;d put this up for posterity anyway.

Posted on r/WritingPrompts: [PI] Explorers - FirstChapter - 2105 Words “Hurry up Michael,” the woman urged as she led the way forward through the brush.
“Ease up Raine, you know I’m an academic right, not a field researcher?” Michael said between short breaths. It was true, he wasn’t used to this much climbing.
