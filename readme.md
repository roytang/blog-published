Not just on social media, FB, Twitter, whatever. Write on your own sites and blogs. On your tumblrs, wordpresses, whatever. Long-form, rambling, incessant. The world could use more sincere blogging.

Wasn&rsquo;t able to screencap the results, but this draft went quite well! Tergrid&rsquo;s Lantern is definitely a bomb, and even the squirrel overperformed I think.

Today&rsquo;s draft went slightly better than the last one, though I still lost to some mana issues because I went for the greedy 5-color snow build.
