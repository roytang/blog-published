- [30 Dec 2020 1:11pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/1344269903285473283/): I thought my PC had died earlier today, but I was somehow able to resurrect it. Here&rsquo;s hoping this machine outlasts the pandemic somehow
- [30 Dec 2020 1:10pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/1344269606374948865/): @joyarmadamba uh, might be through less than legal means. Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;justified&rdquo; wut.
&hellip; let&rsquo;s not have this convo everytime i watch sth not available to stream locally, medyo madami for 2021 lol
- [30 Dec 2020 7:58am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/1344191049963425795/): Finally watched #WonderWoman1984. Maybe don&rsquo;t think too much about what&rsquo;s going on in the movie. My headcanon is that the only reason it takes place in 1984 is because it&rsquo;s pre-crisis

 I want to do so many things - things cost time - I don&rsquo;t have enough time - I don&rsquo;t want to prioritize the things, I want to do them all - I end up just going to sleep  
- [26 Dec 2020 2:17pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/12/1342836877942931456/): @Westraid Merry Christmas!
