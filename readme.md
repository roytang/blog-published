- [21 Jan 2021 3:43pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1352280628490747906/): Platforms should not be responsible for a person making awful content. They are absolutely responsible when they put it in front of people who didnâ€™t even know it existed. They should know the difference between hosting awful content and choosing to broadcast it. We all should.

- [21 Jan 2021 6:15am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/01/1352137686614564867/): 2021 movie no. 3: World War Z (2013). Pretty typical action movie I think, entertaining enough. Should have watched at the start of the pandemic.
