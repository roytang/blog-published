Cringe at trying to pass Bond off as Japanese. Introduction of secret volcano lair trope. Ninjas with guns! First screen appearance of the head of SPECTRE, inspiration for Dr Evil.
 That endgame scene of ninjas invading the secret volcano lair reminded me of the Simpsons episode You Only Move Twice. Bond&rsquo;s &ldquo;wife&rdquo; never named despite being only Bond girl to survive the movie.
- [23 Mar 2021 3:41pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1374385938273476623/): Why it&rsquo;s hard to trust either the Chinese government or Sinovac, exhibit 22,316
Quoted rthk_enews&#39;s tweet:   The #HongKong government stops a doctor from giving out #COVID19 jabs after he allegedly told people that the BioNTech vaccine has a much better reputation than the one made by China&rsquo;s Sinovac. https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1582148-20210323.htm  
- [23 Mar 2021 7:50am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1374267414192353281/): Give people aid so they can stay at home, you cowards
Quoted PhilippineStar&#39;s tweet:   READ: Amid rising COVID-19 cases, NEDA acting secretary @_karlchua says the issue now is the total health of the people, including hunger and other sickness apart from COVID-19. Localized lockdowns and managing risks should be the focus. | @maureensimeon  
- [23 Mar 2021 7:39am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1374264516414894085/): Whenever I deliver any software to clients I should go “Please enjoy the gifts from me, please make a commitment that you will take care of this code, you will take car of this database, you will take care of these bugs..”
Quoted paulcatiang&#39;s tweet:   Managed to get the receipt for the crass display by @DOTrPH. Remember, the people&rsquo;s taxes paid for those and continue to put food on your tables, you ungrateful public servants.
