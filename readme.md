Excellent opening sequence. Austria; Cairo, Egypt; Sardinia, Italy. 007 and Triple-X have great chemistry. Jaws has to be the most unstoppable Bond villain / henchman. Stromberg&rsquo;s Atlantis reminds me of the Legion of Doom&rsquo;s base in the old Superfriends cartoon. Actually, I think his evil plan might be the best one so far as well.

- [16 May 2021 5:33pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/05/c72ceb2e3748ccd8611baab1cbfdfe74/): I finished reading What Matters Now by Seth Godin, a book that is basically a collection of short blog posts by &ldquo;big thinkers&rdquo;, released for free back in 2009. Interestingly, a lot of the ideas presented in the book still feel relevant today. I didn&rsquo;t think it needed a full review post.
The funniest part for me is that one of the entries is by Jason Fried about how to apologize, advice he certainly could have used during the recent Bandcamp brouhaha
