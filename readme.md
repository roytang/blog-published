- [15 Mar 2021 9:54am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/273eae12d668c24135d4db358511c9d4/): Bond movie no. 3: Goldfinger (1964). Lot of the classic Bond tropes introduced. Bad guy&rsquo;s plan was actually pretty good, even had the escape contingency. Disappointed he did not have an actual gold finger. Great fight between Bond and Oddjob.
- [11 Mar 2021 11:29am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/1369973843050164226/): A bit worse off, since we didn&rsquo;t have a pandemic in 1985 afaik.
Quoted LaTtEX&#39;s tweet:   Massacres openly conducted by the police and military. Opposition figures in jail. A dying but belligerent despot. Deputies jockeying for power. A crashed economy. Infrastructure projects burying us in decades of debt.
Aminin na natin Pilipinas, bumalik lang tayo sa 1985.

- [11 Mar 2021 9:14am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/03/096b7c67797c165b01283d0c7cd6c016/): James Bond movie no. 2: To Russia With Love (1963). This one actually had more bits that felt like actual espionage. And Bond didn&rsquo;t need to get captured this time!
