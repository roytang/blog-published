Quoted verge&#39;s tweet:   The next Spider-Man movie will be titled Spider-Man: No Way Home https://trib.al/EwukXbI

- [24 Feb 2021 10:28pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/gomwdig/): It wasn&rsquo;t a one-off night of no matches found that prompted me to post, this has been the general case for me for about the past two years/seasons, I think. I&rsquo;m occasionally able to fight a match, but most of the time it takes me a long time to look for one, then I just give up out of frustration.
I didn&rsquo;t have much time last night, but I did actually manage to fight *one* guy (well, best of 3).
- [24 Feb 2021 2:23pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/gol1pex/): I do!
- [24 Feb 2021 2:22pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/02/gol1nto/): Unfortunately, I lent out my PS4 copy a while back and can&rsquo;t get it back easily now due to some kind of pandemic lol. Also, most of my unlocked last DLC from the last 2 seasons is on Steam now.
Would streaming (Netflix, Youtube, etc) interfere with the matching? I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m the only one who&rsquo;d be doing large downloads in the household, so I can certainly avoid that, but other people are almost always streaming video when I&rsquo;d want to be playing.
