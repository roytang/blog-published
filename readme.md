The quintessential sports film, but I&rsquo;ve never seen it before. Stallone looks only a bit younger than I remember him from the 90s. Apollo Creed is that dude from the Mandalorian! Surprised at the ending.

Went Silverquill, only finished 4-3, mostly due to a really bad misplay on my part in the last game. Decent outcome, but could have been better. I did manage to rare-draft a lot though lol
