Quoted peard33&#39;s tweet:   Apple said a new &ldquo;private relay&rdquo; feature designed to obscure users&rsquo; web browsing behavior from internet service providers and advertisers will not be available in China for regulatory reasons. Same in Belarus, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the Philippines &amp; more. via @StephenNellis  
- [7 Jun 2021 4:50pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/2641c1868d6ccb70715302ea340cae74/): For Your Eyes Only (1981): Bond film no. 12. After the sci-fi fantasy of Moonraker, this one is more grounded and down-to-Earth, a callback to early Connery adventures. No megamalomaniacs to defeat, just foreign agents and mercs. The opening sequence pays homage to the earlier pre-Moore films, acknowledging the death of Tracy Bond and killing off a villain that looks suspiciously like arch-nemesis Blofeld. The opening song is pretty good. The rest of the film was ok, if a bit forgettable.

- [4 Jun 2021 2:04am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1400634591166156805/): Binged thru S5 of Kim&rsquo;s Convenience yesterday. Still so easy to background-watch. Too bad it&rsquo;s the final season, they still had a few open threads to resolve.
https://www.avclub.com/simu-liu-opens-up-about-his-anger-and-unhappiness-over-1847022561 Apparently there&rsquo;s a planned spinoff starring Shannon, who&rsquo;s the second-worst character on the show! WTH. (Worst character is Janet lol)
- [2 Jun 2021 5:11pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2021/06/1400137937212248065/): If you are old enough, remember when the internet was shiny and new and we all thought it would be the cure for stupidity because everyone would have access to the world’s information at the click of a mouse?
How wrong we were.
