- [23 Nov 2020 1:09pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/11/1330861073247813634/): @art_abon Ranma has a much bigger cast that can cause hijinx. Dito it&rsquo;s always either Larry or Balki (and Larry most of the time)
- [23 Nov 2020 1:08pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/11/1330860801477885960/): @joyarmadamba uh, i have a copy
- [21 Nov 2020 11:40am](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/11/1330113747550134277/): I&rsquo;ve been binging Perfect Strangers. Fun show (and maybe best theme song), but 80% of the eps are like &ldquo;Balki says/does something naive, Larry overreacts and gets them into trouble, but it all works out in the end&rdquo;
- [20 Nov 2020 7:27pm](https://mirror.roytang.net/2020/11/1329868993600004096/): Wasting time wandering through parallel universes
